I think that good description of story may be critical. There is ridiculous amount of fics and selection is absolutely necessary - I think that during my search 99% of stories are discarded based only on title and first sentence of description. Part of this is that I discard certain types of stories ("Fred kisses Hermione (...)" -skip-, "Draco and Hermione entered a relationship" -skip-, "Scorpius" -skip-) but starting from things "This is my first ever Fan fiction" or using "DracoxLuna. Enjoy! (All right's belong to JKR)" as entire summary is suicide.

Potential new readers are unlikely to be interested in origin of this story - it may be better to put it somewhere inside (NOT at start of first chapter) - in fact your AN would work way better as description

  The challenge was to take a prompt and create a vivid, well-characterized scene in 100 words or less. They were written pre-Deathly Hallows.

Others are OK, but nothing that makes me think "I must read this" (but this is probably rare and depends on person).

I think that titles may be bigger problem - as "A Very Impractical Man" and "Even Unto the Seventh Generation" are interesting and intriguing, "Snapshots: Vivid Portraits in 100 Words or Less" works as description but ones like "Unacceptable", "Star-Crossed", "Poetic Justice" are not really better than choosing "Rock" as title.

From my list of favorites - examples of titles that caused me to notice story: "Far Too Many Time Travelers" (I always wanted story like this), "The Perils of Innocence", "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality" and "Growing Up Kneazle".

Obviously title part is highly subjective, but I really doubt that "Unacceptable" is title that will help story to find readers - I would describe it as bland.
