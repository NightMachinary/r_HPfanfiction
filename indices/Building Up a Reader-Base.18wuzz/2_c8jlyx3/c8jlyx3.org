One suggestion I have is Harry Potter Fanfiction Challenges on the ff.net website? They're pretty well-populated and people are always posting challenges. If you do a challenge, its posted on the thread for everyone to read. I've written fics for challenges before and they always get more traffic. If people like it, they check out what else you've written.
