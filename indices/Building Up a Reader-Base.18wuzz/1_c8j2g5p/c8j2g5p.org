Not sure how everyone else finds stuff to read, but I just stick to search engines of ff.net and the other few sites I use and try out stuff based on description of the story.

So for readers like myself it would mostly be a matter of your story fitting their search criteria + having an interesting premise that is well described in the short blurb + not containing many spelling and grammar mistakes in first 2 chapters + not being poorly written.

Also "in the past" is much harder to repeat now because so many archived works are available - fics that tend to build that kind of following, are the long novel length type. Readers who prefer novel lengths fics now don't need to wait to get them chapter by chapter because there is plenty of completed, or at least far progressed works available. I am sure I am not the only who uses word length as one of the main criteria when looking for stuff to read. So for many, even a perfect fic won't hit their radar unless it gets long enough.

I wouldn't worry about it getting lost in shuffle even on huge sites like FF.net - everyone is looking for new works to captivate them, and once a fic meets a given searcher's criteria and gets into the result set, many will check out the newer ones.
