Depending on your genre you can probably find a forum your favorite authors frequent.

Try: [[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/caerazkaban/]] [[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/3_or_4_Part_Harmony/]] [[http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/seelvorfanfiction/]]

CaerAzkaban especially is VERY active, you can participate in all sorts of discussions, and if you have a story you can ask for feedback on it in the group before posting to a site. Once you build up a following in the group they are likely to recommend it to friends too, and many of these people frequent the other groups. Be careful not to tick off the group owners though, ask for permission to post your chapter/story idea.

To build up a following, you have to post consistently. You don't have to write it all before posting chapter 1, but be good at staying on a decent schedule.

And finally...Don't Suck

Honestly, get a beta to help you, and bounce your ideas off friends in the community (hpfanfic, not your neighbor unless he's into that). If your idea sucks it will get shot down quickly, if it has ANY promise at all you will get lots of help offers because we are STARVING for good stuff to read.
