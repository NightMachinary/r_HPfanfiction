Yeah... On the whale matter, if I were you, I'd have created a magical creature wholecloth, a sentient magical /equivalent/ of whales --- for bonus points, make it look like [[http://www.medievalists.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/whales.jpg][medieval artists' wonderfully bizarre idea of a whale]], thus chalking up that peculiar real-life discrepancy as a mistake in the implementation of the Statute of Secrecy where they forgot to edit some of the illustrations even as the meticulously replaced each mention of the magical creature in manuscripts with "whale" or with a neutral term like "sea monster".
