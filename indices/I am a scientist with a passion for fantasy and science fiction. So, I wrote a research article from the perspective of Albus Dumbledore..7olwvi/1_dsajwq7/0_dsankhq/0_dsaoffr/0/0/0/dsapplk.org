Honestly I'd thought of that, but I really enjoy the notion that whales and other sea mammals possess an innate magic of their own, and an intellect rivaling ours. And having seen whales in person, I gotta say, there's not much that feels more magical. But certainly I think there's room for a Newt Scamander paper on whale-like beasts!
