I expect a lot of it is odd. But for the sake of thoroughness, I figured how might a wizard travel by sea animal? Naturally, I thought of Jonah. And I just watched Finding Nemo, so...

As for the Ways, there's a fair bit of European folklore that talk about these (though naming them such is a contrivance for my purposes), mostly I believe in Celtic folklore. The lady Maeve I think was said to travel by a particular way from our world to the faerie realm, for instance. But really, my inspiration there was /The Dresden Files/ and Jim Butcher's description of travel through the Nevernever.

So I guess you can think of this as a confluence of multiple fantasy stories and different folklore, not all of which is mentioned in the Potterverse!
