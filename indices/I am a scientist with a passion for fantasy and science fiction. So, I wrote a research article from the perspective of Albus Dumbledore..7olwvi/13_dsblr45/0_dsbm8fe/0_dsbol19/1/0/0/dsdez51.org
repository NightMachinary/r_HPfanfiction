Possibly, but I disagree! Dumbledore knows Muggles are capable of all sorts of things due only to their ingenuity. Making a plane fly is an incredible feat of physics, for example, and I imagine that Dumbledore would wonder, if that's possible without magic, what more can be done without it? Are we playing by the same rules as Muggles and just using a different set of tools?
