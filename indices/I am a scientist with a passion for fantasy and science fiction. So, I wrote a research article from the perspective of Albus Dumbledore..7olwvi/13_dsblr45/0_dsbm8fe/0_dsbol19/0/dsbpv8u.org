Here we have to disagree. I think Dumbledore had too much respect for Muggles and their ingenuity, and I suspect he would have been fascinated by Einstein's theory and way of thinking. In my headcanon, Dumbledore had always know how teleportation worked---by bending the universe, or moving a wizard---but Einstein's space-time surface provided an excellent construct to describe the phenomenon. But then, given Dumbledore's inquisitive nature, he would naturally ask himself, “If space-time works to describe the process of teleportation, and space-time is a part of special relativity, what else does relativity imply about magic?” He might not believe it, but he would be fascinated by the possibility that a Muggle had learned so much about their world, whether they knew it or not!
