This was surprisingly good. I say surprising because a lot of people who IRL have a lot of scientific knowledge have a tendency to try to make magic very similar to science and start introducing mathematical formulae and rules that are reminiscent of physics/thermodynamics, essentially treating magic as energy.

Your "review" approach was a good angle to take.

When formalising magic in this way the problem is that one tends to lose the mystical (and even eccentric) aspects of the subject matter. I think this has occurred in your article as well, but the approach you took has at least minimized it.
