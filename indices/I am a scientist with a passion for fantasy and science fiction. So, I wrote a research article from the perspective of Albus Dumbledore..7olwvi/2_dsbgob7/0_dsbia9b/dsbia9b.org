Thank you very much! Sorry you didn't like some elements of the theory portions.

In writing about these things, I asked myself, “Given what we know about space and time, how do these things work?” Perhaps limiting myself to what /we/ know is why you felt that way; by restricting myself to a scientific paradigm, some readers may feel a lose of the sense of wonder. (Me personally, I think science makes everything more wonderful. Probably why I'm a scientist.)

That actually might make a fun article to write. Dumbledore's “When Worlds Collide: Can Muggle Science Inform Magic?”
