I tend to take an approach informed by the philosophy of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGUsIf9qYw8][Hasok Chang]] on scientific pluralism when I consider the interaction of the natural and unnatural worlds in the Harry Potter universe. I don't really agree with this approach in real life but it's a good model for magic, I think.

Essentially scientific pluralism is the idea that there is not one scientific truth but rather it is possible for there to be multiple, conflicting scientific explanations for a given phenomena, each one empirically adequate and yet each one describing the world in a different way. In this view, therefore, science is not about /discovering/ the way the world "actually is" but rather is the /invention/ of empirically adequate models. It's quite an interesting theory, especially when you get into details such as the epistemological status of observations using instruments built according to and with results interpreted in light of a specific theory (e.g. the electron microscope). Nonetheless in real life pluralism's biggest problem is that no one has actually managed to develop an equally empirically adequate but contradictory scientific theory in comparison to our current best knowledge (though there's some interesting work on the different formulations of Newtonian mechanics).

RETURNING TO HARRY POTTER...

My preference for theory of magic is that it describes the world in a way that is fundamentally incompatible with modern science - it will have its own way of describing substance and composition, for example, potentially based on the old Aristotelian system of physics (which was of course developed before the Statute of Secrecy). From the perspective of wizards, the Muggle periodic table would simply be wrong - it fails to account for fundamental (magical) properties of what substance is, how it behaves, etc.

But then how do you explain the fact that Muggle science works so well for said Muggles? That's where the pluralism comes in. It's not that the periodic table is "wrong". It's that it's another way of describing the world. Neither the magical theory of matter nor the Muggle one would be true. Rather they are both empirically adequate (relative to their own set of observations), each one thoroughly confirmed by observation, and yet those observations fundamentally contradicting each other about the most basic constitution of the universe.

Fundamentally, the world is split into the natural and unnatural worlds, and the two are simply distinct. There is no universal, consistent set of rules for the universe as a whole. And when the natural and unnatural clash, the unnatural overrules the natural.
