That's a cool observation (nice reference to pluralism!). So there are (at least) two possibilities: either magic and science operate on fundamentally different levels, as you suggest, or they play by the same “rules” but magic operates with the added force of a wizard's will behind them.

I would imagine that Dumbledore would feel that the truth of this is something for each wizard to decide for themselves, not entirely unlike the Kuhn vs. Popper debates on what constitutes scientific advancement (I know lots of scientists who ascribe to one or the other, or who think it's somewhere in between). Such a paper by Dumbledore would probably deconstruct both sides of the argument and give examples in support of either philosophy, and when both sides work equally well (the pluralism). He would conclude with a call for deeper consideration of these philosophies, and for wizards to accept that the truth need not be some binary outcome. Perhaps he would argue that, whenever a Muggle scientific construct helps further magical research, it should be used, but when it doesn't, to acknowledge that magic is, tautologically, magical (but to never close one's mind to the possibility that perhaps wizards have much to gain from Muggle sciences).
