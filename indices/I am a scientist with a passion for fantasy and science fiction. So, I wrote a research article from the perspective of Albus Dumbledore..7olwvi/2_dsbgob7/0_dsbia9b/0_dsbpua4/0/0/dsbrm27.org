  That's a cool observation (nice reference to pluralism!). So there are (at least) two possibilities: either magic and science operate on fundamentally different levels, as you suggest, or they play by the same “rules” but magic operates with the added force of a wizard's will behind them.

Indeed. I think the latter presents some serious problems if you want to keep it canon compatible. Even skipping over the "people have access to large reserves of energy which they can direct with their mind" point and just taking that as a given rather than questioning the biology of it, I think you still have several major hurdles to overcome in joining magic with Muggle scientific knowledge:

1. The quantities of energy wizards have access to are astronomical (or as Feynman would put it, economical). Consider the amount of energy it takes to create kilograms of matter, something wizards do with casual ease, or to fuel time travel. You end up with wizards having an amount of power at their fingertips which dwarfs that of the largest nuclear bomb. While I like wizards to be depicted as strong, I feel like this leads to some problems (where are the spells of mass description?!).

2. The conceptual nature of magic doesn't mix well with the physical approach of science. What science treats as abstractions are in magic actually real things that can be interacted with: numbers and sets, information (and specific types of information, such as words and secrets). Not to mention human social concepts like a job position and the difference between Muggles and squibs (squibs and Muggles both have absolutely no magic, but magic treats them differently - squibs can see Hogwarts, Muggles cannot. So magic recognizes the human social category of defining someone based on who their parents were).

3. The anthropocentric nature of magic. Consider the exceptions to Gamp's law. The human-relative concept of "food" forms a fundamental part of the rules governing Transfiguration, a branch of magic, and therefore part of the universe you are trying to unify with Muggle science. I think any consideration of magic on a meta-level inevitably results in the conclusion that the universe is anthropocentric and going down that route quickly leads to religion, something I prefer not to mix with HP.
