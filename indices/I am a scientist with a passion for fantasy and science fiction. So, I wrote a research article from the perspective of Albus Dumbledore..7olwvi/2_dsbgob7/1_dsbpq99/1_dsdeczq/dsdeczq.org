I like the vast majority of what Taure writes here, but I also disagree with some of it. Critically, I think Taure's answer gives some attention to (but not nearly enough) an important part of magic in Harry Potter: wandless magic. A wizard's first experience with magic is likely when they accidentally cause something to happen without the use of a wand--blowing up one's aunt, for example. This implies that wizards do not need a strict movement of a wand and a specific spell word to make magic happen (which Taure hints at but I don't think intends when they talk about magic being more than incantations and wand movements), and indeed do not need a wand at all! They simply become comfortable with the use of a wand and eventually reliant upon it as they forget that they can make magic without one. This would also not necessitate understanding the magic at all, which Taure also proposes, because a wizard can make magic happen without understanding at all what they are doing.

I agree with Taure, though, that it's all about intent and desire. So in my mind, theoretical spellcraft (which is in fact taught at Hogwarts!) would only partially cover what a spell "does". It would, instead, heavily emphasize what /magic/ does in general. Specific spells could be used as examples (see Taure's reference to the shield charm and its permutations), but it would more focus on why a wizard's will and intent combine in such a fashion as to produce a desired effect (and why failures happen, such as turning a Levitation Charm into a small explosion). It's easy to think of magic as an energy source (though I think Taure in an earlier comment said they didn't like thinking of it in that fashion); if it is, how does that energy move, and how does a wizard's will shape it? I would also imagine such a course would delve a bit into wandlore to help rectify why a wizard "needs" a wand.

Just my two cents. I fully plan to write another Dumbledore piece on wandless magic and how it works, which will delve heavily into what I imagine as "theoretical spellcraft".
