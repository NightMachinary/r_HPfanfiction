I didn't really see Taure's comment as saying that an understanding of magic was essential to performing it. I think Taure's headcanon document says that rather, a deeper understanding of magic leads to better results, but this can also be achieved through more practice.

I'm not sure if my interpretation is consistent with yours, but I always thought that indeed, magic does not /need/ a wand or incantation/wand movements, but the incantation/wand movements help to focus your intent coherently, and the preexisting magic in the wand (like the unicorn tail hairs and dragon heartstrings) help give the spells you do more power.

Ooh I would be extremely interested in reading such a Dumbledore piece! Dumbledore's style with all the footnotes is a pleasure to read, and I wish my own professors could format their lecture notes in such a way!

However, I don't think that there /is/ a single correct interpretation of the magic system in Harry Potter to the specificity that Taure has written; I think that since it's all just distilled from the evidence in the books instead of ever being stated outright. There are probably some pretty good fanfics with a bit of a tweaked magic system based on more formal rules (such as The Arithmancer) and I think they're pretty fun as long as people don't get them confused with canon.
