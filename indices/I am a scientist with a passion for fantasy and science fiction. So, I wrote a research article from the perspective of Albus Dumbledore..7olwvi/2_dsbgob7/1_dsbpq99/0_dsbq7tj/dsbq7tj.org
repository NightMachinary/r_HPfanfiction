Well, on the most abstract level, I refer you to my comment [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7olwvi/i_am_a_scientist_with_a_passion_for_fantasy_and/dsbpua4/][here]].

To be more specific, however, about how exactly magical theory and practical spellcasting interact... here is a summary of my headcanon on the matter.

The basis of the idea is the observation that magic appears to perform operations upon concepts more than physical quantities. Magic of course has physical consequences but is not physical in its fundamental nature. So, for example, you can cast magic on job positions, on information such as secrets, on linguistic items, on types of behaviour, etc.

A basic spell therefore represents an idea given reality via magic. Most spells are more complex and involve a combination of ideas in certain relationships with each other. By way of example you have the shield charm, which is the concept of "protection from personal harm" in magical form (1).

Magical theory would refer to the body of thought which elaborates upon these concepts and their magical significance, and places them into theoretical systems which relate them together into larger, more general systems of representation.

All this goes towards answering the question of what makes magic difficult, because a) we know from PS that magic is much more than incantations and wand movements, and b) we know from the wide distribution of wizarding achievement that there must be some factor of difficulty which goes beyond pronunciation accuracy and dexterity.

We also know from what unites the most talented wizards in the books, and from Hermione's success with magic following her reading of theory, that academic understanding of magic is a key component of being able to cast more advanced magic.

/Understanding/ the magic you are using is what underpins successful spell casting. I say understanding rather than knowing because it goes deeper than rote memorisation. Understanding from experience and the insight of having an innately more magical mindset and character are just as valid routes to understanding as theoretical understanding from a book.

Now, to continue with the example of the Shield Charm, we know from the books that the spell can be used in different ways. The basic version blocks spells, but it can also be used to reflect spells. The basic version protects the caster, but it can also be used as a “wall” across a room, and as a boundary around a much larger area. The basic version is purely focused on protection, but from the incantation “protego horribilis” we might speculate that there are advanced versions of the Charm which are an aggressive defence and seek to harm those who attempt to breach the protection (the movies, though not canon, would support this, as DH Pt 2 involved a shield charm which disintegrated those who attempted to cross it in the final battle, which is where in the books Flitwick cast protego horribilis).

These are all examples of what I would term spell extension. You are taking a spell from its basic form and doing more with it by adjoining additional concepts to it. Sometimes this does not require a change in the incantation, only in intent and understanding - see, for example, Harry casting the Shield Charm in DH as a wall rather than a personal shield, still using the regular incantation. Other more dramatic alterations seem to require modifications to the incantation e.g. “totalum”. To be able to cast these extensions you would need to understand how the addition of further concepts to your spell changes its magical nature, which in turn requires you to understand those concepts. For example, to be able to make the Shield Charm into the wall you would need to understand the magical concept of “the person” (which appears to include clothing, for example) and how it is distinct from other magically recognised groupings. Only when you understand this can you make the Shield Charm do something other than its default behaviour of protecting the person.

This is why the Hogwarts library contains so many long books. They're not dictionaries of wand movements and incantations. They are discourses on the magical concepts involved in spells and their relationships.

From all this you should hopefully be appreciating an image of magic and spells which is a web of connected concepts, not discrete objects. A spell is a position on the web comprising a particular combination of concepts. You can move your position in different directions to change the spell's behaviour, so long as you understand what you are doing. Extremely powerful wizards like Dumbledore and Voldemort are essentially able, through a combination of innate talent and extensive knowledge, to navigate this "web" with ease, essentially "speaking magic fluently". They are not restricted to using spells which default to certain behaviours but rather their every casting does precisely what they want.(2)

The definition of a spell, therefore, is not its incantation, but rather what it does. Two spells which do the same thing are, in fact, the same spell. Two spells which do very similar things are very close to each other on that web of concepts and the one can be easily turned into the other by spell extension.

(1)Incidentally this is (one of) the reasons why I have never bought the idea that wizards need to understand what they are defending themselves from, and therefore the shield charm could not defend from e.g. radiation. The magic is far more general than that - it guarantees protection from harm, not protection via certain mechanisms. Is radiation harmful? Some of it, yes. Other forms of radiation, no. The shield charm would protect you from the harmful stuff but would not block the safe stuff.

(2) This is just one aspect of what makes wizards like Dumbledore and Voldemort more powerful.
