For a traditional article, absolutely, and particularly so for a review. But I imagine wizard experts are considered true experts who are taken at their word for their expertise, rather than expected to reference preceding work. But I do “cite” certain works and researchers throughout. (And, if I'm to be frank, I just didn't much feel like making up that many scholarly titles.)
