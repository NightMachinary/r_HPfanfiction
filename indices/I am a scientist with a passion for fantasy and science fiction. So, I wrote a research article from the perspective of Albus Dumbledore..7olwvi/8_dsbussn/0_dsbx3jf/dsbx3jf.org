Thanks, glad you enjoyed it! I've spent a lot of free time over the years reading folklore and mythology from across the globe. Not sure where I first heard of Scholomance, but I think it features in World of Warcraft? And I clearly took some major liberties with the lore (both ours and the Potterverse's).
