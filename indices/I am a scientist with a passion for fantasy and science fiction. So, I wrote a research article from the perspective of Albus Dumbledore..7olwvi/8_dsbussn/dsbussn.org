I loved this! It sounds just like Dumbledore the majority of the time, and your footnotes had me laughing out loud on a number of occasions.

I was surprised that you referenced the Scholomance, as although I independently discovered the myth recently as part of my own research, I don't remember ever seeing it appear in any fic I've come across.
