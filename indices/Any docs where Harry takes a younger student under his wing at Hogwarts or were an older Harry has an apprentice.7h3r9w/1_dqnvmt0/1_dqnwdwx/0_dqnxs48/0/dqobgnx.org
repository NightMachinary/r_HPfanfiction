Because of the dinner where he made crass jokes, right? I never knew what to make of that scene. Am I supposed to see Sirius as the bad guy? What he did was improper, yes, but Jamie went completely nuclear in response. It just made me think of her as unstable, although I'm not certain that was the point of the scene.
