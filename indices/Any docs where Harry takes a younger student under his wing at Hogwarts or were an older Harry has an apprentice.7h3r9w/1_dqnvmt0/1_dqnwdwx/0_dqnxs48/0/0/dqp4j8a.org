That this Sirius is not the one Harry knew. And that joking about one's sexuality is not a good idea unless you know the person very well.

I interpreted this scene that Sirius crossed the line of good fun and Jamie took it as ridicule. Since Sirius is the head of house he ought to approve of any serious relationship and Jamie took the bad jokes as disapproval from a person she did not expect it from.
