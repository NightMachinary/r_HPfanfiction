Then start with chapter 5: Welcome to classes. There might be some references you will not get but the main plot starts once Harry/Jamie becomes a teacher.

When looking back at the story I tend to remember the second half a lot better because it is frankly said a lot better. Once you get past the initial angst/Sirius being a dick things start looking better and the interactions between Harry, Sally and Tonks are well worth it.
