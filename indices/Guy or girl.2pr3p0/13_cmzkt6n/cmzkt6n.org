I'm probably the only one who cares about this, but being new to the sub I have a question:

Should this be 'Discussion' as we're discussing our demographics?

Or 'Meta' as we're talking about ourselves and not the fics?

Also, I'd like to second [[/u/wordhammer]] 's answer of Yes, but I concede that rewriting the question to preclude this particular bit of snark is more difficult than it would appear at first glance.
