I probably wouldn't have been snarky, but that the question had no context- why ask? What difference would it make to the OP? Are the people who say they're girls going to get a deluge of 'hurr durr yoo iz pretty' messages?

Wouldn't it be more interesting to ask a more complicated question like 'As a person identifying yourself as a gender, do you prefer stories centered on a character with similar gender or a different gender?'
