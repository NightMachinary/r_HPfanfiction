My favourite long gen fic series is Weasley Girl, which is two books and a couple side stories so far. It features fem!Ron, but is (mostly) told from Harry's POV just like canon. It diverts wildly from the canon stations halfway through book 1 in the most realistic way I've ever seen. All the character development is great too, especially Neville and Ronnie herself.

it's later revealed that Ronnie is into girls, but there's been literally no romance so far other than Ginny's normal canon crush & Ronnie noticing Luna has nice hair.
