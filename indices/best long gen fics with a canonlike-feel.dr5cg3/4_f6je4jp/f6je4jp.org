Well, I just caught up to the fifth book of the Alexandra Quick series and feel like it's excellent, publishable quality. It's not about any of the cannon cast or even about hogwarts (it's set in America) but it manages to capture that slight mystery/coming into the world of magic feel that attracted me to Harry Potter as a kid.

It has flaws, but I honestly stopped noticing them in favor of the things I liked. The best part is, if you read through the first book there are four others with more to come!

There's excellent character development (which the main character needs) and it excels beyond any other HP work I've read in addressing and considering multiple magical cultures and how they would interact. Characters are flawed but not just for the sake of it, characters are set up as minor antagonists without sacrificing believably as individuals, and the protagonist manages to achieve a hard won competency that doesn't feel like the author wanted to make them good at something for the sake of it. Oh, and even though you feel like Alexandra is progressing and becoming a very talanted witch, it is never to the point where she is throwing around experienced adults effortlessly.
