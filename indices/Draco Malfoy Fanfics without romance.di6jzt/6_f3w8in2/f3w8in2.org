I just spent like 15 minutes trying to find this fic and I can't but I'm hoping someone else knows it. It's mad old so for all I know it doesn't exist anymore.

The story starts with Malfoy confronting Dumbledore to try and kill him and Dumbledore offering him a way out. Which turns out to be a portkey to Lupin's hideaway.

The story is basically Malfoy hiding out with Lupin being his usual douchey self while also coming to terms with Lupins lyncanthropy. It's kind of a "growing up" story for Malfoy with Lupin as a catalyst. I remember really liking it because the characters were very true to their natures. Malfoy in particular toed that perfect line of unlikeable brat and scared clueless teenager and it all plays well together.

Can't think of the name of it though.
