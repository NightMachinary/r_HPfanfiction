linkffn(2538955) is an old favorite of mine. Due to unfortunate luck and bad planning from Voldemort, Draco and Harry get thrown back in time to the Marauder Era, and with no way to get home, end up having to take the slow path. Harry is technically the main character but Draco is present for essentially the entire story.

Neither Harry or Draco are involved in any romance iirc, including with each other. The main focus of the story is about their lives together as they go through the years. It was also written pre-deathly hallows so the most of it is canon compliant to the history of the marauders, but without the whole master of death plot line (for better or worse.)
