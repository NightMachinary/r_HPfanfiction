I once read a story where Harry went by Harry, but had a "true name" of Harldr. Having the true name of someone gave a magical advantage in direct confrontation if the name is held in mind. The idea is that Dumbledore's mom named him APWBD as a form of protection.

As a story I'd give it a 4/10. I don't even remember the name. The name? I could take it or leave it. But if you rename, this is a good reason.
