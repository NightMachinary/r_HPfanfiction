I also love the fact that in the wizarding world, with all its outlandish and fancy names, their saviour is the most blandly named protagonist of all time: Harry Potter.

I just love seeing the juxtaposition of names like Dedalus Diggle against boring old Mary MacDonald. And I agree with your headcanon.
