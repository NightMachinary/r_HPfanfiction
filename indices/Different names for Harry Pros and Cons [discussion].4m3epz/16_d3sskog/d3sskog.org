Personally I don't really seeing it changed as there was a time when Tom, Dick, and Harry were common names and considering Prince Harry is a member of the royal family there is no reason to 'legitimize' it.

That said I don't mind and even like some of the changes when it makes sense and/or is relevant to the story such as in The Tears He Had Never Seen Her Cry linkffn(11575992)

In crossovers I normally find it silly to change Harry's name for various reasons except when Harry himself changes it to avoid attention.
