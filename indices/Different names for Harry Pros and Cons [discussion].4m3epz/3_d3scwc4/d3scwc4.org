Generally speaking, I think it's in poor taste to change a character's name, because it's one of those laws of fiction that you don't mess with. You can turn Harry into a girl or make Kirk and Spock gay, sure, but how ridiculous would it sound if Moby-Dick began with "Call me Mark"?

If you must change a name, however, make it one that fits, and isn't outlandishly ostentatious. Henry for Harry, I'll allow, since Harry is a diminutive for Henry and Henry is still a pretty normal name. Hadrian, on the other hand, makes no sense because his parents are named /James/ and /Lily/; why would they name him after a Roman Emperor? Also, Henry/Harry is already a name with royal connotations in England, so changing his name to Hadrian to make it sound 'more noble', is redundant, at best.

Fem!Harry's a weird one, since she is a character that doesn't actually exist, so you can technically choose any name. That being said, it probably should sound close to Harry; Rose Potter just makes me think of a fic where Ron and Hermione died, and Harry adopted an orphaned Rose.

As others have said, people don't create OCs because making a fic centring around OCs is a surefire way to make sure no one reads your fic.

As for my own writing, I pretty much never change names, even in crossovers or heavy AUs, where the canon names might come across as strange and outlandish in the new universe.
