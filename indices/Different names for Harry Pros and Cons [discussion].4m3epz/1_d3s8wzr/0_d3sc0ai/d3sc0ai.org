What is with all the Harrisons? Is it a common name in America? If you absolutely cannot go with the almost-certain Henry, and aren't trying to suggest something pureblood with an unusual choice, Harold seems mostly likely and fitting.

Harrison just makes me think Lily named him after Harrison Ford, and then it's even more distracting because /nobody ever writes the backstory and characterisation for that/.
