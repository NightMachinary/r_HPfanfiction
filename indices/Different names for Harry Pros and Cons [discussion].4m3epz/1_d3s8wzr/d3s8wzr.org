People like Hadrian if they want to make him seem more "pureblood." To me, Hadrian is too contrived; Henry or Harold or Harrison makes a better legal name.

If it's fem!Harry, I'm okay with it if the name is Harriet. Rose is annoying. It's better when the nickname for her is Harry.

Names have specific associations, and since we've all read the books, we associate the name Harry with a specific persona. If Harry is renamed to something like "Aries Sirius Black" the character is basically an OC.
