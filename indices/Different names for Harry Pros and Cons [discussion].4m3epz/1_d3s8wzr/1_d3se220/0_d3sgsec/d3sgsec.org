[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Ford][Harrison Ford]] is a famous American actor with that first name. In fact, he's not even the /only/ famous American actor with that first name. This probably brings "Harrison" to mind as a plausible first name for many authors, since most people have heard of him.
