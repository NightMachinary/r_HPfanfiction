Names should match the character. A Harry, I suspect, would be much like his canon counterpart. A Hadrian, on the other hand, would be a pureblood elitist.

For Female Potters, Jasmine I think represents a straight run at 'Harry, but female'. Rose Potter signifies a Potter closer to Lily's typical personification.

All in all, I'm fine with renaming Harry. All works in view are AU--there exists only a single canon universe, and that is the universe that JK wrote.
