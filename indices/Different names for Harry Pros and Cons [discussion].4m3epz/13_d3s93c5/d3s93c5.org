tl;dr: [[/spoiler][It works, but it requires worldbuilding on the author's part, and not just small tweaks either. Also, it's not that long of a post, stop being lazy and just read the damn thing.]]

Name changing only works in AU stories. And I don't mean lesser AU of the "Harry captures Pettigrew during Third Task" brand. Not even a brilliant AU of the "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][Ariana didn't die]] and therefore everything was different due to a slight change in the historical [[http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/][Conway's Game of Life]]" variety.

No, this requires re-working of the societal rules, structure and history to a far deeper, more significant level. HPMoR /could/ have pulled it of if Yudkowsky didn't decide to go with the most fucking pretentious name of all times, *while still keeping the first name as Harry*. Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin successfully pulls it off (even though it's a goddamned Hadrian). The Well Groomed Mind pulled it off (and with the far superior choice of Haraldr than Hadrian). Hell, even my favorite B-movie fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/Basilisk-born][Basilisk-born]] makes it work, and that is because of the radically different origins of magic, and history of the Magical World present than can be inferred from canon.
