Tdlr at the bottom

I agree it takes world building. I'm going to put what repost here my opinion on OCs.

It is a fair point. (people not wanting to read fics with OCs) I try to like OC fics when they are first written, but so often they are just used to bring the author themselves into a story. I don't mind so much of there is a reason that an OC is inserted, but only if there is some world building or reason for it.

This is also my opinion on changing the name. I think a good reason is needed. I added to my post just now about how the crossovers that brought up this train of thought were the Addams family and PJO. I understand that a godly parent might have some ideas, but why go with an overly Greek name? Apart from Percy a lot of the characters with some exceptions have fairly normal names.

Sorry for the long post Tl:dr I agree about world building when it comes to name changing and I would add that it is also my philosophy when it comes to OCs in general in fics.
