Harry Potter is one of the worse worlds to add OCs too, because the world is in many ways defined very clearly. If there's a new character, their backstory needs to reference the in-universe past. You need to add family, or explain why they have none (and this will affect the character in ways you might not want). Due to the large number of existing characters, it's hard to make an original OC that isn't overpowered or a Mary Sue.

Furthermore, if you want them to be the protagonist, you either have to go /way/ off the beaten path in terms of setting or plot (like setting it 50 years in the past, or in a different country, or making the plot revolve around something other than Voldemort) or come up with a contrived reason for the prophecy to apply to them. It's usually easier to just use Harry and change his background.

Compare it to Pokemon, for example, where there's fewer constraints on OC main characters (and also many more good examples of stories that feature only OCs). The draw of Pokemon is in the world, not the specific characters and events of a twenty-year span, and so OC main characters work much better, simply due to the differences in source material.
