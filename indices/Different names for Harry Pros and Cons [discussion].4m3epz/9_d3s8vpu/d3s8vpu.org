People don't simply make OCs because then their stories will be less popular, and then they have to create a different origin story for their character.

I don't mind changing Harry's name. Henry is often the "official" name for Harry. I feel as though Hadrian fits with the Roman and Greek names used by pure-bloods, and it's just one of my favourite names--it sounds cool.

That said, I wouldn't do it myself, unless I had a proper reason to do so and even then I would refer to him as Harry in the narrative, simply because so many people don't like it.
