Harry/Henry/Harold/James all work. Hadrian is a trash name given by trash parents and even trashier fanfic authors. Hadrian's Wall is a wall and the real Hadrian is dead, and no human being in the 21st century should be emulating either.

For the last name, if it can't be Potter, it can be Porter or Portis. Evans is great, and a similarly common last name in the UK is Jones - he could always choose Dursley, but while it would be a different name in the wizarding world, I can't imagine Harry wanting to link himself back to the Dursleys.

I've used Ezra Liber for Harry in a Skulduggery Pleasant crossover.

The thing is, in giving Harry a false name, you can still write as "Harry thought x and y", and "My name is Fakis Namen Smith," Harry said. It doesn't have to overtake Harry's existing identity.
