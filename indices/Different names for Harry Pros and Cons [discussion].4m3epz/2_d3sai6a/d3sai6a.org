Granted, I haven't read all the fics, but of the ones I did read, only one pulled off the name change thing: Circular Reasoning. In it, Harry has an alternative name, but he also remains Harry and the other name is there for an actual reason that is well implemented instead of just the author's preference for Harry having a more "aristocratic" name or whatever. And even Harry has trouble accepting it when he learns about it. He goes "my name, my name, you can't take my name from me".
