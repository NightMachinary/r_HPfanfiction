My view is a bit odd on the topic. For A male Harry, it has to be just that. Harry. He can have a million titles, and I really don't care, as long as the first bit of his legal name is Harry James. It's not Harry any other way.

Yet, on the other hand, I DESPISE people using Harriet with a passion, to a point where unless the first chapter is unbelievably well written, I'll just stop reading.

The way I see it, even if it's a 'Harry becomes a girl' story, that name will never represent them for me. It just seems like a cliche to try and make them the exact same character.

Personally, I never thought Harriet was a name either James or Lily would name a daughter, especially with the naming theme in Lily's family. Specifically if it's a born girl Harry, why would she use the nickname Harry. I don't think they need a male nickname to be similar enough to Harry's personality to almost be cannon.

I guess in conclusion, while I find some names for fem!Harry a bit over the top, and some I really don't think fit super well, anything is better than trying to make Harry female and then plaster the same name on top. It's a disservice to the original, and the OC.
