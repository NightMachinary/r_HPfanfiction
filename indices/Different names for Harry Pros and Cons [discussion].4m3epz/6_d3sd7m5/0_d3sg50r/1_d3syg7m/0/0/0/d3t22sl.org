People use canon to mean different things, I suppose. I'd argue that if you write things that contradict the 7 core books, you're not writing canon-compliant stories, /but/ if you contradict any part of Pottermore, the movies, JKR's tweets or the companion books (Quidditch through the Ages etc.) then you're still holding onto the minimum requirements for something being canon. You should still mention it, especially if you call your story canon-compliant, but then it becomes a case of degrees.

Of course some people might have broader definitions of canon (much like real [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_canon][canon]]) but some things /must/ be included, and where there are contradictions then the source material should have priority.
