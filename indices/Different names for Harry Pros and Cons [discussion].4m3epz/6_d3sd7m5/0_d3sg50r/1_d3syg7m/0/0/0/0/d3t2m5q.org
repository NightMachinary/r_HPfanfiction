Yes, definetely. For me, this is JKs world, so anything she says about it (which includes interviews and pottermore) are canon. I treat the movies like a paralel universe.

Of course I respect someone who doesn't have the same idea, and only follows the books. Hell, I'll even respect the few people who don't consider the epilogue canon. I don't like it, but I do respect it.

What irks me a little bit, it's inconsistency. Which is what this Charlus and Dorea is. THis information is in no way more reputable than Pottermore- Yet people treat it as such. People who think JK's word of what's canon and not ended with the books consider this information- which is completely fandom, it never made any sense for James and Sirius to be cousins- canon
