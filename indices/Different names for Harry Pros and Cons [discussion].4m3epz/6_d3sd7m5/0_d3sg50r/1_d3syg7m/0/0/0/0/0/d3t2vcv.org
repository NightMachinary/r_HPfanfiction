Yes. I think a lot of people see canon more as 'what can I justify/get away with calling canon' than 'what is canon'. For them, a conflict or inconsistency is a license to call it either way and then say 'well, it's canon'. It's a bit annoying because it means that you sometimes can't tell which way the author's going to go until after it's already happened in the story (for example, in a 7th year fic where Harry saves Dobby and leaves him in the Burrow during the final fight against Voldemort - per book, he'd be fine, but per movie, he's dead, and if the author's been inconsistent so far you can't tell whether they're following the book or movie).

I don't mind AUs at all (currently I actually prefer them), as long as they're not accidental. If the author has a plan for a story that requires them to change a bunch of background crap, that's fine, but if they accidentally get names, dates, character personalities and the canon timeline all messed up it's not fun at all to read.
