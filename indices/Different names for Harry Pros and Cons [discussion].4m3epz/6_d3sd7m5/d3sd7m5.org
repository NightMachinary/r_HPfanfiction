First off, this is only how I feel about non-AU stories. If the author manages to pull off a succesful AU where it is explained /why/ 'Harry' has such an unusual name, I don't mind.

Hadrian or (worse, much worse) Harrison don't work for me because they are unusual names and thus run counter to one of the core concepts of the character: despite a wizard himself, and being the son of a wizard and a witch, and the Chosen One destined to save the world, he has a very common name.*\\
Much like James Bond in his series is not called Superspy McBadass but was named after some guy who wrote about flowers.

I can live with Henry or Harold as those are still normal names, and Harry is a plausible shorter form for it.

For girls, Harriet with nickname Harry is so contrived. Rose or another flower works perfectly as themed names seem to be a thing and both his mother and aunt have a flower name (see also male Harry: Harry, Tom, James are some of the most common male names).

*Another reason I am annoyed with the Pottermore bullcrap of calling James' father Fleamont. Charlus is a much more normal name, a variant of Charles, Fleamont is a very uncommon LAST NAME.
