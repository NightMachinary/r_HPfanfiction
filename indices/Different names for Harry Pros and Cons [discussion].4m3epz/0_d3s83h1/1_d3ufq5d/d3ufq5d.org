What the? Names having power (literally) is fiction...does your name have some (very little) influence on you and other people? Sure!

Also: If you want to HIDE, why would you use your real name (particularly if you have magic and can just magic up a passport or leave the country without going through a border checkpoint or an airport!)?

All in all changing Harry's name is fine (if done for good reasons - if it's done just because than I don't like it at all!), as long as the author doesn't go over the top!
