Sure it is, if you have some outside force make Harry change (he wouldn't do it on his own, but say an attempt on his life (or several - without Voldemort necessarily being the one who wants him killed) might wake him up/change him...especially if say it's the Headmaster who thinks that Harry has to die in order for Voldemort to die and who's fed up that Harry keeps surviving (must not even be evil Dumbledore...he might regret it, but it's "for the greater good" after all)...and that's just an example ;))
