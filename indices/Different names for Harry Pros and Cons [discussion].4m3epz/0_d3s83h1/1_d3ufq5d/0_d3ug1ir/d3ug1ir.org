If you are Hiding of course you change the name you give to people, but that doesn't change the name the author should be using to refer to the character. I have no issue with Harry saying "Nice to meet you, my name is Anthony Johnson" as long as when the author is describing non verbal scenes in third person they refer to him as Harry.
