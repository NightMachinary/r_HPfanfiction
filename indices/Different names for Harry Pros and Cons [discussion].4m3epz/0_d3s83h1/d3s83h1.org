I dislike any renaming of any type. After all, a name has power, and to change a name is to change the character. You can make a story as AU as you want, but if Harry is still named Harry then he is still Harry. He draws to mind certain traits that you can sub out based off of plot differences. If his name is changed then he is greatly altered, it is no longer the same character.
