There is the fic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2141337][Gringott's lesser known branch]] (which is quite interesting in my opinion, as long as you like world building and are ok with AUs). The other parts are crossovers, apparently, of fandom I'm not really familiar with, so I've put it off for the moment. However, from what I remember, the first part can stand on its own, anyway.
