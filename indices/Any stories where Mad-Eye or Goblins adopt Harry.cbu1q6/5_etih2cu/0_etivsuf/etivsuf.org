It's a bit Gary Stu, a bit "friend of the Goblins" and a bit weird with the "everyone meets their soulmate at 12" thing, but my main issue with Harry Crow is it's just so looong and half of it is spent describing parties and conversations between characters that basically acts as exposition of things we already know or could figure out for ourselves.
