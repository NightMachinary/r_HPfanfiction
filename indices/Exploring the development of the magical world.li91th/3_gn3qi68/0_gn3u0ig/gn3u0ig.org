I actually have a pretty original idea for rapid transport that should be really comfortable, doesn't spin around like crazy, doesn't teleport (which could be great for volatile cargo and/or patients in bad condition) and could go anywhere on Earth in less than an hour. Plus it wouldn't expend single use expensive enchanted objects (Portkeys) and wouldn't be locked to fixed destinations (Floo):

Magic powered rocket spaceships. If you can make a Ford Anglia fly and a fire burn without needing fuel, it'd be pretty easy to build a spaceship straight out of science fiction. Take a large vehicle, enchant it to fly, add a rocket engine that's enchanted to not need fuel, add air freshening systems and anti radiation shield charms, done.

You wouldn't even have to make it fully space capable. Mach 10 flight in the upper atmosphere should be decently fast for international travel, the flight would be super smooth compared to portkeys and you can make the seats as comfortable as you want. Concorde on steroids but less cramped.

Assuming unlimited Î”v thrusters and the desire for a decently comfortable ride, London - Hogsmeade should be doable in below 15 mins. Way better than the Express. London - NY in 30 mins. London - Sydney in 1 hour. If it takes a while to get an international Portkey, catching the next flight could be faster, more convenient and possibly less expensive.

Assuming an enchanted rocket rather than some handwavium drive, Earth - Moon is under 4 hours, perfectly feasible. Earth - Mars would be 40 hours minimum, 120 hours maximum, depending on planetary alignment. The outer planets might be a month long trip, offer it as a luxurious cruise with a slalom through Saturn's rings as the highlight. It could be done faster with a more powerful rocket but unless a completely different magical method of space travel is developed, going faster would be somewhat uncomfortable.

All the technology needed is easily available in the spells and enchantments we see in canon (apart from interplanetary navigation, which shouldn't take too long to develop). It could be a seriously profitable business.
