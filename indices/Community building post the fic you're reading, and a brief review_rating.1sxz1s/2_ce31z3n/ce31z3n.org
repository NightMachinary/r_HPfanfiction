[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2866740/][Grey Maiden series]]

Still on book 2 out of 5. Like the style but struggling since I normally don't like to read about pre-teen years (like some romance/sex in my books) and not a big fan of Harry/Ginny pairings.

That said, this is the first story with that pairing that I've found that's in my opinion "well written" (spelling/grammar/mature perspective) so this may be the one that gets me to see that pairing as viable.
