Just quit reading: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2701458/][Petal in the Rain]] - Entrapped in a snobbish boarding school, Lily Evans mischievously escapes for one night, fatefully encountering London's most eligible bachelor, Lord James Potter. Set in 1940 during the Battle of Britain. A story of love, war, magic and deception.

4/10 - I found this fic rec'd on tumblr as one of the top 5 Jily fics. I made it through the end of chapter 9. I think it's pretty awful thus far. Lily is the epitome of a Mary Sue - literally, her only "flaw" thus far is that she sasses the abusive nuns at her boarding school (who irrationally hate her because she is poor), but really that just shows how brave and strong she is. James' portrayal isn't much better. James (rich, privileged) and Lily (poor, helpless) fall in love at first sight - no relationship development at all, they're just all of a sudden head over heels! It's so ridiculous that at points I was literally laughing out loud at the absurdity of the dialogue/writing. In terms of the plot, things happen, but I'm really not sure what the point of most of them is - it's the same basic story arcs (Lily sasses the nuns; Lily <3 James; James fights with his mother, who doesn't like Lily), the setting just changes. No depth. No character development.

It's possible that it gets better as the story goes on. A lot of people in the Jily fandom seem to love this fic and I just don't understand why. Maybe it's more suited to people who like action / romance fics and care less for drama / angst.
