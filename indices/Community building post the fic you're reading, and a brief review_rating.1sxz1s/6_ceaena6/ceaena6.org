[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5681042/1/Heart-and-Soul][Heart and Soul]], 75 chapters, M-rating, WIP

/I am on.../ Chapter 74

/Author's summary.../ The Dementor attack on Harry during the summer after his fourth year leaves him on the verge of having his wand snapped. Unwilling to leave anything to chance, Sirius Black sets events into motion which will change Harry's life forever.

/My summary/ rare non-smutty Harry/Fleur pairing, with a surprise. Starts with Harry's trial at the Ministry and goes AU from there.

/Rating/ I like it, dunno how to put that into numbers as I am a newcomer to fanfiction and I don't know how it compares to other works. I definitely recommend it though.
