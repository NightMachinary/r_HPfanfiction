Im currently jumping around, reading new chapters of the uncomplete ones (listed first) and re-reading some of my absolute favourites (listed after the break). I have read all available Chapters of the stories listed here at least once... Be warned, it's winter so everything I'm reading right now is Humor or Crack :D

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233288/1/][Faery Heroes]] by Silently Watches

#+begin_quote
  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
#+end_quote

Very funny, a little bit of super and a hint of crack but thoroughly enjoyable

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9261735/1/][Madness at the Gate]] by ZenoNoKyuubi

#+begin_quote
  The sequel to ItMoaS [In the Mind of a Scientist]. Mad scientist Harry Potter, now twenty years old, is sent to the SGC to half-join SG-1, accompanying them on missions. However, this job, which was just supposed to be providing Harry with research and allow him to expand on his knowledge, will have him make grand discoveries about himself and that of the entire magical race. Harry/Tonks/possibly more
#+end_quote

Well its mostly crack and a bit of super in a bit of a Stargate-Crossover. The previous story can stand on its own and is not a crossover but just as hilarious (and required reading before this one)

  This is a reworking of one of my very earliest stories, Knowledge is Power. My intention is to smooth down some of the really rough edges and then add a few more original chapters at the end. A time travel fic that begins near the end of POA but is AU by the end of the first chapter.
#+end_quote

Well, it's a rewrite and the original was great so whats there not to like...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8257400/1/][The Power of Paranoia]] by arekay

#+begin_quote
  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.
#+end_quote

It's pretty much a "Harry lives on his own and has no problem doing it" with a new premise... Updates seldomly but I really like it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9708318/1/][The Adventures of Harry Potter: The Video Game Series exploited]] by michaelsuave

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter; Harry's going to exploit the system.
#+end_quote

A very humorous take on Harry gaming the (video game) system to make the best of his chances. Also some very general gaming humor.

Complete stories I'm re-reading:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/][Make a Wish]] by Rorschach's Blot

#+begin_quote
  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
#+end_quote

The ultimate "Harry gets a break" by one of the best Humor Authors you can find!

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][A Black Comedy]] by Nonjon

#+begin_quote
  Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.
#+end_quote

Another classic. If you don't care that Harry gets a tiny bit super in the beginning this is one of the best Humor stories around the net.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4145459/1/][The Horror! The Horror!]] by DisobedienceWriter

#+begin_quote
  Humorous, post GOF tale. Harry goes to Africa and sets up a potions ingredient business. Wackiness ensues.
#+end_quote

A ridiculously lucky Harry sets out to make his luck in the Jungle and hilarity ensues.

--------------

Well, these are the stories which are currently being updated or already complete and have been on my kindle in the last couple of days ;)
