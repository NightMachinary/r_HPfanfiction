Just finished reading: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/][Altered Destinies]] By: DobbyElfLord Author's summary: Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald.

My summary: 7.5 out of 10. Story is pretty good. Could use cleanup on the typos though.
