Huh...from the title, I was going to suggest linkffn(9783629) The Trouble With Sorting Hats, that has a time-travelling Harry kill Voldemort during his sorting. But it's because he's exposed as a time traveller by the Sorting Hat, he explains what happened, and he ends up with the DADA position, so I'm pretty sure it's not the one you're after.

It can't be The Unforgiving Minute either, that goes back to the Third Task, not first year...
