I definitely agree with every word you say. I also liked the story a lot, but this aspect made me cringe sometimes. Especially the one in which H and S were going to lunch and they see Lily, and S really forgets about H being there.

I compare this story with “The Poison Garden”(my fave SS/HG ever) a lot. In Poison Garden, S' interest is set on H and makes the story more believable. As a woman, I cannot understand how H forgave S and gave him a chance in “An Unwritten Future”.
