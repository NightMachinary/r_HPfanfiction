Heh heh heh.

Here's my personal recs with a brief description. There's a mix of stuff unfavourable to Hermione but you can just skip those.

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

This one is a classic: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5858832/1/]]), along with linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]]).

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341/chapters/44954569]]) 6th year fic where Hermione faces consequences for the bird attack. Alternating POVs.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione (or Harry, for that matter).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12613015/1/]]) is another one. Fem!Harry, Ron's a good friend, Hermione goes insane.

(SELF PROMO): linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]) More Hermione-critical than outright bashing. AU 6th year fic where Ron tells Hermione to take a hike.
