Well, to get this cleared up. Nobody got recruited. They all went with Harry against his will.

For the premise: I like it. Maybe the possession fucked her up big time. Maybe (and I think this is one I already read somewhere) the process of Riddles Resurrection is completed and Ginny's body is Riddles new one. Having Ginny as a traitor for these reasons is pretty interesting.
