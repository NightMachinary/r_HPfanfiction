I really like this idea. A more assertive Ginny ingratiates herself with Harry after 2nd year and starts influencing him. This would work best with large divergence. Come the end of PoA Harry kills Wormtail, Voldemort keeps chilling in the woods for another decade while Harry and Ginny graduate and do their thing.
