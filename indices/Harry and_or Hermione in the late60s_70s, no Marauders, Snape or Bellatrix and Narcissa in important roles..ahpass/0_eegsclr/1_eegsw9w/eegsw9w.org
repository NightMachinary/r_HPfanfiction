Let's put it that way, I feel absolutely no attraction towards men. I cannot comprehend why anyone would be attracted to a man if you could have a woman instead. Therefore, a gay man is not a character I can immerse myself into. So definitely a hard no.

Also, canon Harry has absolutely no gay tendencies, so making him gay is OOC by default.
