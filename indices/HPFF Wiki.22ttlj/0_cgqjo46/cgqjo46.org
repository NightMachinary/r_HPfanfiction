I think a tag system like the old Livejournal communities have is a good idea (For example: AU:Non-Magical, or whatever).

Slight Tangent, Wall of Text Ahead:

But honestly, I think a big problem of the fandom in general is that the golden age was in the 2002-2006 period, so most of the best work are spread out across between archaic, poorly designed archives like FictionAlley/Astronomy Towers and HarryPotterFanfiction, blogging sites like Dreamwidth and Livejournal and personal homepages, with certain dedicated archives in between (Skyhawke for example, is invitation only, so exposure are minimal). Most modern rec lists, this Wiki included only consider the stuffs in AO3 and FF.Net, which is good in some ways and bad in others (AO3 and FF.Net consist of fairly modern writers, so the stuffs are more canon compliant, and the amount of epic lengthed fics are much higher. However, because of how the archive works, you have a lot more shits to shift through before you get the gem). This may be taking things a little too far, but a mirroring system would be nice. The popularization of AO3 and FFN helps a lot, but we still have authors deleting their works for whatever reason. Lifejournals get friendslocked, old sites goes down, etc... It would be fairly easy to keep with Google Doc, but maintenance could be a problem
