For tagging, the closest thing we've got is [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Lists:_Themed_Lists][themed lists]]; it seems to work decent enough for categorization, but wikia search is kind of horrible, so you basically have to look at the themed lists and pick one (and if a story is categorized in a list, that will appear on the bottom of the story page as a category "tag" type thing).

And we absolutely don't discriminate based on host site! :D The wiki is open to all fics from everywhere. It just happens to be that the users who have been adding stories to the database have a preference for the bigger sites.

I love the idea of a mirroring system, but I think it would require a dedicated task force. One very small and inactive wiki would never be able to get anything meaningful done. Maybe that could be a new project for the subreddit itself? That's an exciting prospect, honestly! I'd love to see that happen.
