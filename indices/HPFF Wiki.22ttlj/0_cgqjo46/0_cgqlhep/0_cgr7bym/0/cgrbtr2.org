I think I can see what you're getting at... that we could sort of use the wiki as a portal to mirrored fics hosted elsewhere? I could see that working nicely -- at first I thought you meant, like, convert the wiki to a mirroring site rather than a database, which would be more work than just starting a new project from scratch! But we could keep the wiki mostly as is, and when a fic is mirrored on Google Docs or something, then we could just create a story page on the wiki and provide a link to that mirror. I'd definitely be willing to do anything that needs to be done on the wiki side to make that happen, if a dedicated group were organized to do all of the mirroring! I just personally wouldn't want to be involved with the mirroring side of things, because I'm completely unfamiliar with the legal ins and outs of hosting abandoned/deleted content.
