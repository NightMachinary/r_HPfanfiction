I'm still active on the LJ/DW sites and love their tagging system. :)

When I'm considering a fic for the Wiki, I check to see if its hosted on AO3 or FF.net and use that link instead of one to the journaling sites. If I do need to use a link to LJ/DW, I make certain it's not friends-locked so you don't need an account or to join a comm to read it. But you're absolutely right about old archives going down. Skyehawke was inaccessible for about two weeks while the site admin was struggling through some domain issues. I don't even like to think about what might have been lost. From what I understand, Silver Snitch is gone for good.
