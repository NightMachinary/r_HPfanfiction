Skyhawke had domain name issue for years. Tien Ru has been pretty fast in recent years though, this year was kind of a fluke it took so long. The issues is in archives like Wolf & Hound (and silver snitch). I've got no idea how that thing is still running. The site looks like it was designed in Frontpage 2000, the contact email is a hotmail account, most likely abandoned and the last update was in 2003. If I have to guess, I'd say the admin had it on automatic renewal and just forgot. Hosting and domain name for a site like that is 20-30 a year at best, and it'll seem like a CC fee unless you look closely
