Not very related to what you're saying, but I'd really like a rating system. DarkLordPotter's doesn't have many fics while FFnet's favorite system doesn't really correlate with quality, so it's hard to find fics that are actually good or sort by "best".

I'm pretty sure Wikia allows polls, but whoever is in charge of the wiki should look into a better ranking system. Maybe even with a top 100 or something.

Seems to me like it would be the best use of the wiki.
