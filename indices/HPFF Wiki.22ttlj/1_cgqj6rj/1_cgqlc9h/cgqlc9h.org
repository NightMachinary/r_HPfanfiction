One of the main goals of the wiki when we started it was to incorporate a rating system, but we couldn't ever quite figure it out. You can read all of our thoughts about it [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:2170][here]], in the latter half of the thread -- basically, we really want to have a rating system, but haven't found an easy way to do it. It's been a while since we last explored the idea, so I can do a bit of research and see if there are any new options... if there are, then implementing one of them would my first priority for the wiki! If anyone at all has any ideas, I would love to hear them.

Since we couldn't find a proper way to rate fics, we just created categories of "featured fics" and "quality fics" and hoped that users could come to a consensus on which fics are the best of the best, and which are verified good (since I sure as hell can't be bothered to check every fic that's posted to ensure it isn't crap :p). That never even got implemented, though, for myriad reasons :/
