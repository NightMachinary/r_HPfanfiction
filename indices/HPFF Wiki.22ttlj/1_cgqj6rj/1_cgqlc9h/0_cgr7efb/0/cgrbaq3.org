Hehe, well yes, it is a large part of the point! :D But there really are many reasons... not enough active users, too few fics/too little fic diversity, not enough time on anybody's part to get the ball rolling, etc. There does seem to be an uptick of interest in the wiki lately, so I can try to get something implemented in the next few weeks/months. (Poor timing, though -- I just started spring quarter and I'm stupid busy!)
