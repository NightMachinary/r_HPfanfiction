  Since we couldn't find a proper way to rate fics, we just created categories of "featured fics" and "quality fics" and hoped that users could come to a consensus on which fics are the best of the best, and which are verified good (since I sure as hell can't be bothered to check every fic that's posted to ensure it isn't crap :p). That never even got implemented, though, for myriad reasons :/

Isn't the point of having a wiki/rec list a giant list of featured/quality fic :P?
