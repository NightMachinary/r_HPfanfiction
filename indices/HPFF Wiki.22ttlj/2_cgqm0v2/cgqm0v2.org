Hi! wiki admin here :)

Well, it's a wiki -- it's community-run! Don't be afraid to jump in and help out! The wiki doesn't have many admins/mods in the first place, so it's not like there are many toes available for stepping on. purpleyuan hasn't been active on the wiki recently, but does seem to be here on reddit, so I'm sure you'll hear from them if there's any sort of objection or anything -- and I doubt there will be any :)

I'll add a Science Fiction genre -- I planned on adding it as soon as I saw we got a sci fi story added to the wiki the other day ;) Our crossover, AU, etc. "genres" are actually [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Lists:_Themed_Lists][themed lists]]; basically, genres are being kept as your typical vague literary genres, and anything more fanfic-specific or HP-specific is set as a themed list (because the way we categorize by genre isn't flexible enough to allow for more diverse themes). Please, please go right ahead and create whatever lists you see fit! Just take a peek at our other themed lists and copy the formatting! And if you think there are themed lists that should be changed or are redundant or whatever, you can leave a comment on the theme page in question.

For pairings and things, I do have them set up in a certain way and don't really want them created willy-nilly -- but that doesn't mean you can't help out! There's a partial explanation on the [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Pairings][pairing category page]], and if you want to make some new pairings, I'll just PM you a brief explanation on how I do it, and you could go right ahead! It's nothing complicated or confusing, just kind of tedious :) I would love for anyone to help out with that, as long as they stick to the system. (And systems can be changed, of course, if people would like them to change, as long as there's some discussion beforehand!)

Basically, as long as you don't mess with things like the wiki layout, basic organization setup, templates, or anything like that, then just go full speed ahead with whatever! I haven't been posting new content, really, but I am keeping an eye on the activity and I go through and fix any errors I spot, so don't be worried about making a mistake and getting banned for eternity :D
