This is very helpful. Thanks!

Other than Science Fiction, I didn't really see anything missing on the Genres list, other than perhaps 'Crossover'. I wasn't certain if Alternate Universe Magical/Non-Magical would be a genre or a theme, though, since I've seen it listed both ways.

As for Themes, there are a number I'd like to add (Creatures, Vampires, Werewolves, Disability, Mpreg, Animagus, Powerful/Mage), but maybe I should wait until I have fics to add into them before I build them.

I was wondering if the Snape/Harry pairing should be divided into slash and mentor/father (non/slash) since it's one of the few pairings I can think of that divides itself pretty cleanly along those lines. Does Harry/Sirius do the same? I've not read enough in that pairing to know.

I wouldn't dream of touching the layout or templates. I don't know enough about how Wiki operates to begin to touch it!
