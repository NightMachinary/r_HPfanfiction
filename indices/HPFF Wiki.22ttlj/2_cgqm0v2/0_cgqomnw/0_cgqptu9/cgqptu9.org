There is a "crossover" themed list -- that just felt like the right place to put it, since it's more of a "type" than a genre (like, readers know what they're in for when they find a "romance" or "adventure" story, but a crossover can be romantic, adventurous, dark, funny, etc.). I'd say the same for AUs. But that's just my thinking, and the whole purpose of the wiki is to be a tool for readers, so we can change anything if there's a demand for it!

Go ahead and create themed lists, even if you don't have any stories in mind! :) The only times I'd recommend you hold off is if it's a very rare or niche theme (like "Vampire!Harry/Draco/Blaise MPreg" or something). Stuff like you listed is all super common in fanfic, so the themed lists would definitely be used.

And the pairing categories are explicitly for romantic relationships, since that's the assumed meaning when you see the format Name1/Name2. I think there's already a themed list in place for Snape/Harry friendship (maybe mentor/father, too), and more could be created for other friendship pairings. Plus, every so often, I go through all stories tagged with a pairing and manually categorize them as Het or Slash or whatever they are, so there are a few ways you can just look at a story with two main characters and tell whether they're having sex or not :p

I think if anything, it might make the most sense to just integrate the themed lists more smoothly into the genre/pairing/etc. categorization, since right now the lists are just kind of... there. I am ridiculously busy these days, but I can try to come up with something, and if you or anyone has any ideas, I can look into how to make them happen!
