  I was wondering if the Snape/Harry pairing should be divided into slash and mentor/father (non/slash) since it's one of the few pairings I can think of that divides itself pretty cleanly along those lines. Does Harry/Sirius do the same? I've not read enough in that pairing to know.

Avoid that entire can of worm and use Mentor:Snape and Snape/Harry. Luckily this is not an Anime fandom, or there would be the entire x/y vs y/x issue /shudder
