  The fiasco that is Harry's life could be summed up in two words --- Avada Kedavra. Those words have haunted him for as long as he can remember, endangering him with their very existence. He'd resigned himself to a life without a soulmate, to pain and sorrow... but then the Blacks happened. Or, one Black in particular.Whose idea was it to let a Black woman invent time travel, anyway?
