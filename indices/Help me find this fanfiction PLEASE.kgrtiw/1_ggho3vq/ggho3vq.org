I'll admit, that's not a whole lot of information you've given, but I do feel like I've read the fic you're talking about. Does a blending of the blood wards and Lily's sacrifice because of a magical explosion sound familiar? Full honesty, I don't know what fic I'm thinking of either, but chances are it might be in my favorites, which would narrow it down to a hundred or two instead 800k+ stories.
