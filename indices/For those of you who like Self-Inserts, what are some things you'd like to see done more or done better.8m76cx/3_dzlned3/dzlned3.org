An SI who steamrolls the Universe in a believable way. No, the SI will not beat Voldemort in a duel or have Goblins suck his dick because he remembered their name. But getting a few Muggleborns to defend Hogwarts with an arsenal of modern weapons World War 1 style? Blowing Voldemort's graveyard cauldron up with a well placed handgrenade?

Getting rid of Snape/Umbridge/Malfoy? You are not going to 1 v 1 them, but a point blank stunner from behind would do.

But most importantly, no fucking TEENAGE DRAMA. You've already been through puberty once. You will not suddenly lose all your adult wisdom and turn into a fucking moron who doesn't know what to do when a girl/woman is attracted to you. And remember, You're here to fuck Voldemort up, not have a sordid affair with a Death Eater or werewolf. Honestly, I doubt that anyone here would be a good match for one of the main characters, but there's plenty of fish in the sea. Getting Demelza Robins or Leanne to fall for you is wayyy more believable than Hermione or Luna.
