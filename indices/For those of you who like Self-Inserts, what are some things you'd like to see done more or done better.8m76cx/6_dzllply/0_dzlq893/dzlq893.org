Hiya!

Alright, I am going to piggyback off your post for a little bit, which I hope is alright with you. It does relate to what you have asked and I hope that I'm not just leeching off you.

Anyway, I am currently drafting a side project (I call it this because I have far too many going on right now) that related to what you have asked, at least in some sense. I did debate about writing a self-insert fic, as it's something I have never done. Of course, I would have to change it a bit so people don't read about a depressed and anxious wreck, but that's half the battle.

[[/u/B_mod]] mentioned something about creating a Horcrux, which is, arguably, something I would do if I was ever in Harry Potter. I have a few scenarios planned, but as I have never written this genre, I was hoping to fish some dos and don'ts.

Romance wouldn't be a massive part as I am, as much as I hate to say it, a homosexual male and have zero experience dealing with females romantically. But, yeah. I could use some pointers that are not on this thread. :)
