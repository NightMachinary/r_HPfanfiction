I'd like to see male SI's! It's always female SI's that become female!Harry, or his twin sister or act like a big sister or somehow end up in the black family or ship themself with snape/sirius or remus.

Not the point but I really dislike when SI's create their own company, be it to employ squibs, gain money, befriend the goblins or whatever.
