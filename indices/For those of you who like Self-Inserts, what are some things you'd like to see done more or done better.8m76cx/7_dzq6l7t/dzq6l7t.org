I want a SI who gets a crap hand dealt to them. They aren't the heir of a noble house. They are the kid of an under-employed, over-educated woman who is facing homelessness because there is no job market. Maybe they read the books their mom has, but maybe the books have to be sold before they are finished.

And when they get a Hogwarts letter, they are ticked off because they are preparing for making money to help with their new family's suffering and the Wizarding World won't help with that.

If they don't know that they are in a book series for years, what knowledge they had will be gone. The connections they made in the interim will become more important than the connections to the characters.

Who cares what happens to Harry if your parents are going to be miserable no matter who wins? Finding a way to exploit the economy would become more important than helping Harry, even if helping Harry was a necessary step towards it.
