My main issue with most SI is that they all have roughly the same motivation - fix the HP Verse, stop people from dying, vanquish Voldemort as soon as possible... They become friends with the main cast, possibly relative, join in on the adventures and such...

How about a SI that, after dying in our world, became obsessed with /not/ dying and decides to make a Horcrux? Or a SI that is so captivated with magic that they don't really care what happens with the main plot - they just want to learn as much as they can. Or a SI that joins Voldemort for some reason?
