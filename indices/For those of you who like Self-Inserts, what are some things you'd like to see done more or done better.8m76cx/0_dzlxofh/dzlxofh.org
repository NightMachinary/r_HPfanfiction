The SI should have their own motivations. I can't be bothered to read stories where the SI devotes their entire life to helping solve canon and fixing the problems of the books' main characters. Far too many writers seem to forget the main bloody premise of an SI which is that your protagonist has to LIVE in the HP world. Have some believable motivations! Where are the fics where the SI wants to pursue a good career, or help their own family, or save up for that trip abroad to some magical location. An SI should be their own person, not some weird lens through which to view and change canon.

Just once I want to read an SI where they go "you know what, I don't think my personality matches all that well with Harry or Hermione, I think I'd be far better friends with X random person here" rather than just basing all of their actions, plans and self worth off of their relations with the former main character of a book.
