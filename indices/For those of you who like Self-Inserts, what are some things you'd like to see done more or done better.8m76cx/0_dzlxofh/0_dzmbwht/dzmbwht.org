I agree! Let them have their own story for a bit without always being based around the main trio's reactions.

I sometimes wish for good SI that are with Malfoy or the Slytherins. I've seen a few fanfics that demonstrate how the main trio's can be annoying/overbearing for the character. However, they just befriend them anyway, for the sake of just helping with the Voldey situation.
