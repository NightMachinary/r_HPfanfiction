When you say feel different, do you mean in the sense that you can usually pick out a psychopath by feeling uncomfortable and hunted around them? Like, you could pick out a Powerful Magic User by the way you feel around them, sort of a deal? Or is that more of a meta-sense where they feel different to a reader but not to people in the story?
