Different in that their power is able to be felt by others, in a disquieting way - they can 'coil it' inside them, kept tight in a way to minimize the way the others can feel it, but doing so is uncomfortable. It also heavily disrupts muggle electricity/technology - whereas most magic can still somewhat coexist, the more powerful/heavy the magic is the more it'll short circuit it all.

Basically, when they're consciously hiding their power/holding it tight, they can pass for normal-ish - like how Dumbledore does. But if they /don't/, it can feel like an aura of power pushing against everyone nearby, a bit like static, with the magic flaring up in response to emotions, and that's disquieting for the more normal magic users.

It also can have a mental toll on the powerful magic users - Harry in particular in that story, due to the manner in which he gets his abilities, often has periods where he's clearly not thinking straight or being obsessed with a particular ritual//need/ for magic.
