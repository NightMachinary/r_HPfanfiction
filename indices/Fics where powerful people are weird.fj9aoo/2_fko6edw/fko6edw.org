I think the closest I've come across is linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings) - powerful magic users there /feel/ different, and have to restrain themselves if they want to go around as though normal - leaving aside some of the less... common forms of magic and the reaction it might cause.

It's not /quite/ as far as what you're saying, but it's as close as I can think off the top of my head.
