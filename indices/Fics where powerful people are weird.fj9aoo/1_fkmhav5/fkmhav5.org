There's Harry Potter and the natural 20, by Sir Poley, on FanFiction, where Mili, an adventurer from a D&D universe gets brought to the Hogwarts universe, but he can still use magic, just not like the rest of the cast. He also keeps the rules from his universe, but only for him...

It starts out in first year...
