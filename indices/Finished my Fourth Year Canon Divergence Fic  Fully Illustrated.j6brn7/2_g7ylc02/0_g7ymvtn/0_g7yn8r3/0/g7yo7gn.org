  "One good piece of advice I've read is during an argument with someone you care about, don't think about it as you versus them; rather, think of it as the two of you against the issue."

One of my reviewers left that on the argument chapter and I think it's similar to what you're trying to say. It was never about one of them being right and the other wrong; sometimes it's less about winning or losing and more about reaching an understanding.

I'm glad that you enjoyed it. And thanks. ❤️
