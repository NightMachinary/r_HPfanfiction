  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

  Yr 2: Harry has returned in time after one too many things went wrong, his careful plans have been messed up, so he's trying a few new things. He's searching for the diary, but while things are similar, his presence has altered enough to keep him on his toes! No pairings. Dumbledore/Goodguys bashing. 2nd in series. Rated M because I'm paranoid. Everything belongs to Jo!

  Harry's now going into his 3rd year again & it's getting complicated. Sirius still escaped & Harry has to deal with Slytherin politics & some extra timetravel on top of old drama. Rescuing Sirius is the number one mission, but things keep reverting & Harry is worried he can't change a Thing. Dumbledore/Goodguys bashing. 3rd in series. Rated M coz I'm paranoid. It all belongs to Jo!
