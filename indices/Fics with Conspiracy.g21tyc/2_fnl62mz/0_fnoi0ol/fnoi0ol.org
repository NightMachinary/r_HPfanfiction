Heh. Your other comment is right below this one in my messages list, so clicking that link confused me for a good minute or two as I thought I'd clicked on the wrong thing. :D

Yeah, personally I'd use the word conspiracy for more of a cabal than a single individual, but I suppose it could work if the recruited are particularly involved. If it's one spider behind the scenes pulling the threads of a bunch of individuals who don't know anything about any other members, I'd probably not call that a conspiracy, for example, but if there was more linkage and interaction, then yeah, I'd use the term.
