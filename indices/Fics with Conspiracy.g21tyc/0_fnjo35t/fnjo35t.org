One shot, Hermione-centric story where she uncovers some secrets of the Ministry. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13263345/1/We-Are-Many]])

HP-Matrix crossover. Harry discovers all is not what it seems at Hogwarts. Really well written. My personal fave when it comes to crossovers. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7370121/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Illusions-of-Reality]])
