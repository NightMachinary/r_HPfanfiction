*Phase, not faze.

And I highly doubt that it /is/ one. Given the /mildly/ racist (HA!) views of wizards at the time, and the subsequent views of society on the half-breed children, I strongly suspect that at least one of 3 things may be the case:

1. Hagrid/Flitwick/Madame Delacour and people like them are outliers. Their parents are considered weird.
2. Most hybrids are children of interspecies rape.
3. There have always been hybrids because banging other "beings" (and the occasional "beast") is considered normal.

In option one, you have deviants that go against social norms. In option two, you have children born of forced sex - a supply of hybrids that doesn't come from a /deliberate/ violation of social norms, at least for the victim. And in option three, people just accept it as part of life; we've had hybrids and such in stories and myth for ages, so considering how JKR's world works, it's possible that that's the case in HP too.

tl;dr, I think it's unlikely that it's a phase, and I don't think having a /bunch/ of people with nonhuman ancestry is particularly likely, but at the same time, having a few is normal.
