(apparently it was too long for one comment???)

Fresh peals of laughter broke out again and Remus couldn't help a chuckle escape at the mention of James' /throne/. He'd /insisted/ on cooking the macaroni, for whatever god-awful reason he'd thought of, and after Remus commented on how unbelievably /stupid/ that was, Peter had simply pointed out that that wasn't even the stupidest part of James' role. Before Remus could get in his rebuttal, Sirius was already rejoicing at what he called 'his perfectly cooked high Italian cuisine'.

It was then that Snape got up and stormed out the hall.

'/Merry Christmas, Snivellus/,' Remus heard an unwelcome voice in his head comment.

'Where was Black in all of this, Pomona?'

Septima's question seemed to dampen the mood a bit, but Remus felt that there were too many empty bottles on the table for that to last. '/Think of the Devil, though/' said another particularly annoying voice in his head. '/That isn't even how the saying goes, stupid,/' replied a more sensible side of his mind.

He ignored how the two voices sounded like two bickering voices from his past.

'Oh, that's my favourite part of the story, Septima,' Pomona replied, the slight smugness in her expression betraying the fact that she wanted nothing more than that exact question at this point in her story. 'Although I believe /Minnie/ would enjoy telling it more.'

/Minnie/ met Pomona's teasing expression with a cold glare of her own, and Remus idly wondered how many homework excuses he'd have to sit through before he could match the scowl on her face before Pomona turned her attention toward him.

'Remus?'

Well aware that she was simply stalling to build yet /more/ anticipation (he was a Marauder, dammit, he /knew/ how to tell a story) Remus just shook his head: 'I'm sure your memory of the event is much clearer Pomona, as you recall I was somewhat preoccupied at the time.'

Turning back to her captivated audience, Pomona continued, 'Oh, I'll tell it then, but even I couldn't believe what he did. And I was there!'

'Oh get on it with it, Pommy,' Septima's patience said as it ran out the doors into the fields of Hogwarts snow.

'Oh fine, /Seppy/,' Pomona quipped back, and Remus couldn't help but reflect on how much his tipsy colleagues were acting just like the students they so complained about. 'Just as I started wrapping my head around the chaos of the room, Black storms into the room wearing nothing but a towel and wrestling the damn pig into submission! I whip my wand out expecting to see the giant dog run back inside only for the pig to jump into me and knock me flat on my arse!'

Now /that/ was news to Remus, but he wasn't one to complain about someone embellishing his own exploits. The almost ceaseless laughter and the odd tear around the table made him decide the odd half-truth wasn't hurting anyone.

'So Minerva banishes the pig away from me and swings around to face Black. I was just happy I couldn't see the look of her face at the time... But then guess what Black says!' /Pommy/ was getting into the story even more than her audience at this point. A chorus of 'what's and 'tell us!' went around the table.

'He just starts smirking, I'm sure all of you who knew him remember his smirk,' Nods and wistful smiles went around the table and Remus found himself wishing he were one of the few who /didn't/ remember. 'And then he says, '*Morning Minnie, don't you look positively fabulous today?''

At this point the raucousness of the Hogwarts staff had drawn the attention of the students on the other side of the table and the uncaring teachers were receiving more than a few questioning looks. Minerva seemed to be looking on in disapproval, but any true Gryffindor could tell the difference between her 'disappointed' face and her 'exasperated indulgence' face, the latter being a favourite of Remus'.

Of course, the story didn't finish there. It was easy to tell with the Marauders' stories since they all finished the same way.

'And how many points did you take for this one, Minnie?' Pomona asked once the laughter died down again.

'You know very well I didn't deduct any points, Pommy,' Minerva admitted, seemingly embarrassed. Remus knew why, and he wasn't going to let Minerva get away without mentioning how /exactly/ they were punished.

'As I recall, Minerva,' he said, the mantra /it's still weird/ chanting through his head, 'You punished all but one of us for that day. Tell me, why exactly didn't you give Sirius detention for that?'

Indignant calls went out around the table. Tipsy or not, this coven of teachers couldn't stay silent at behaviour like /that/ going unpunished. Luckily, Pomona (not one to let go of the spotlight that easily) put to bed any possible rumours of Minerva McGonagall being /soft/.

'Oh, she tried, she did. But Black said he didn't do anything, he just found a pig outside and tried to subdue it. Oh, you know how he used to talk his way out of everything. But Minerva was well past any tolerance she had for Black's antics. He'd barely finished giving his explanation when she started shouting: 'Two Weeks! Two weeks detention, Black, for not handing in your Turtle Tortoise Trasnfiguration Task two years ago!''

And as the laughter went round the table one last time for this story, Remus found himself laughing just as much as everyone else. It truly was his most enjoyable Christmas in years, ghosts wherever he walked be damned.

It was as he thought this while looking down at his empty plate and resolving to head off to his quarters that the doors to the Great Hall burst open and Remus's world started to turn upside down.

A large black dog, pursued closely by an even larger pig, crashed through the doors and sprinted towards the table.

Sybil, whose consciousness had been doubted by many for the last quarter of an hour, was the first to react.

'GRIM! DOOMED! WE'RE ALL DOOMED!'

A young student screamed, the dog reached the table, jumped onto it, and then all hell broke loose.
