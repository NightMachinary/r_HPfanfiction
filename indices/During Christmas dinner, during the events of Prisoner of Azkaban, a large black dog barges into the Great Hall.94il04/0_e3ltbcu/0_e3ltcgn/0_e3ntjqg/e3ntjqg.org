Last part:

Remus froze as the students panicked and scrambled to get out of their seats and away from their uninvited guest. A few elbows from his neighbours and even a pasty crashing into his head couldn't snap him out of it and he soon found himself alone at the table as the pig joined the dog's protest against the excessive opulence of their feast. 

Of course, it wasn't the novelty of an impromptu swine-canine grand prix that prevented Remus from reacting but rather the shocking realization of the identity of the dog. The shaggy, sable,  pudding-covered mass currently slipping its way down the table was, of course, none other than Sirius Black.

‘POTTER!' screamed McGonagall as Dumbledore and Flitwick tried to corral the students into a corner of the hall. Harry swivelled his head towards the voice -- with his wand out and ready, Defence Professor Lupin noticed -- and cringed when he saw the look of his Head of House's face.

‘I have nothing to do with this Professor,' Harry shouted over the racket while placatingly raising his hands. ‘Watch out!' The pig had, of course, run straight at Minerva and was about to crash right into her.

It would take more than an over-sized pigmy puff to get one over Minerva McGonagall, however. With the speed and accuracy that was the envy of many a herbology professor, a swish and a flick was all it took and a silent, squealing pig was frantically thrashing about in mid-air. Another swish, a murmured incantation and a yelp coming from Remus' right indicated that the ‘threat' had been completely subdued.

A short silence enveloped the hall as its occupants slowly came to terms with what just happened, and Remus, being slightly more clued up to the *real* goings on, suddenly started when he realised that the ‘threat' was indeed much more threatening than a couple of rowdy pets. Hand snapping to his wand, Remus had the worst curse he could think of on his lips before he was, once again, beaten to the punch by Minerva.

‘Remus! Please tell me that you have, in fact, matured beyond the reckless reprobate that your ill-begotten friends turned you into and did not ruin our Christmas feast with this foolishness.'

Remus blinked in surprise at the tone of the Deputy-Headmistress' voice and had to stop himself from looking down at his feet in embarrassment. 

‘Now, now Minerva, I'm sure Remus had nothing to do with this,' said Dumbledore, mischief and amusement clear in his eyes making Remus think that he was enjoying this part of the evening more than Pomona's story time. ‘Also, if I were to hazard a guess as to where these large creatures came from, I think Hagrid would be a more sensible explanation.'

Attention once again drawn to the dog, Remus turned again and pointed his wand towards the crouching form while Minerva and Albus squabbled over how to deal with this issue, only to freeze in his place for a second time that night. Remus looked on at the dog, wand still pointed, and saw him lying flat on the ground, front paws over his eyes and moaning softly. The sight was so quintessentially *Padfoot* that Remus couldn't call forward all the hatred he had taught himself to feel over the past twelve years. When the paws hit the ground and a pair of milky grey eyes looked up at him, Remus found himself lowering his wand and all the air in his lungs deserting him.

Confusion and conflicting feelings waged a battle for the ages inside Remus' head while normalcy returned to the hall. Elves had begun restoring the feast to its former glory, while students and teachers either returned to their seats or used the excitement as an excuse to end the party on a high note. A cat, one Remus recalled belonging to Hermione Granger, stalked over to Sirius and started rubbing up against the prone dog affectionately. Spotting Remus' intense stare, the cat returned a glare and took up a protective stance in front of the uncharacteristically quiet, subdued dog.

Mind made up, although feelings still scattered and mushed, Remus turned to the still squabbling senior staff members: 'I'm not sure about the pig, Minerva, but the dog isn't Hagrid's. It's just a stray I saw walking in Hogsmeade a few weeks ago. I'll take care of it for now, no need to worry.'

Not waiting for any response beyond a brief acknowledgement from Dumbledore, Remus turned towards the dog only to find it standing behind him, ready to follow. After staring into the dog's eyes for another short eternity, Remus started towards the doors and out onto the grand staircase. A soft pitter-patter followed him, and Remus tried to pay attention to that instead of the ghosts of the hallways that now used this emotional opening as a new opportunity to assault his carefully forgotten memories. Making his way up to his quarters, his head started spinning as the battle inside his head reached fever pitch. Sense and reason fought against a deep aching in his heart, a long-lost hope crushed by a decade of loneliness, and Remus found himself stumbling into his quarters and having to lean against his dresser.

The pitter-patter stopped and Remus found he still had the sense to wave his wand and close, lock and silence the door behind him. Still facing the back of his room, his shoulders started shaking as the past five minutes caught up with him and he started to truly process what was happening. As his eyes began tearing up, his gaze was caught by a photo on his dresser that he usually had the good sense to ignore. His resolve building by the painful reminder in the photo, Remus managed to slowly start turning toward the beast behind him.

He didn't raise his head, however, and as he finished turning he found his vision dominated by a pair of dirty, broken shoes and the bottoms of ragged pyjama legs sitting atop ankles of pure flesh and bone. Sucking in a deep breath, Remus slowly lifted his head and took in the ghoulish appearance in front of him. Emaciated, shrivelled, frail, weak, all the descriptions flew out of his head when brown eyes met grey, and all Remus felt was a deep welling in his chest.

Another short eternity, and then:

‘Sirius.'
