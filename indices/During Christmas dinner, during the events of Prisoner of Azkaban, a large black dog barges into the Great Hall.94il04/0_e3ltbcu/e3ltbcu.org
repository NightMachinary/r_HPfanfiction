First half only, since I just kept on adding and my writing tends to be long anyway. I'll probably finish it tomorrow evening. I'd also love some feedback since I haven't actually written anything for a /long/ time, and I was also worried about my tenses while I was writing this. Anyway, my first attempt at a writing prompt:

Sounds of laughter bounced around the great hall, ricocheting off the bells and holly that brushed against the hair, ears and paper crowns atop Hogwarts' holiday residents. The hearth crackled along cheerfully while keeping feet toasty and cheeks toasted, a feeling of deep comfort stretching itself along the single table playing host to the Christmas feast. The single table was filled to the brim with a mismatch of students and teachers, young and old, who, for whatever reason, found themselves seeking the familial cosiness of winter gatherings inside the hard, cold walls of a thousand-year-old castle.

But the walls didn't feel cold, thought Remus Lupin, as he laughed along to Pomona's retelling of one of his friends' many misadventures during his initial courting of Hogwarts. Remus couldn't think of a single holiday he spent having dinner here where he felt any colder than he would when the hall was bursting at the seams from a horde of loud and boisterous students. Even when the distance from the sole table to the walls morphed into a mindfully vacuous chasm, Remus felt the walls closing in on him, encapsulating him, and yet he never felt trapped. Surrounded by distant walls and a motley crew of lonely strangers, the Great Hall always felt snug, the stranglehold of the walls felt secure.

Hogwarts always felt like home, no matter how many it happened to host.

Remus first discovered this as a lonely, desperate 12-year-old. Days after a full moon, while his parents frolicked around the south coast no doubt ecstatic at his decision to spare them his post-transformation blues during Christmas, he limped into the Christmas feast (the limp being an annoying reminder of a particularly brutal battle against a wooden desk in the Shrieking Shack that Moony supposedly had a long-standing disagreement with) only for his senses to assaulted by a physical manifestation of winter merriment. He knew that description was a /slight/ exaggeration, but, while staying at Hogwarts during an integral period of animagus preparation, Sirius had used it to describe Dumbledore, albeit in much crasser language, and after eventually picking himself up off the floor Remus lamented how he'd never be able to look at the man the same way gain, and the description stuck.

It was moments like these that made Remus' reacquaintance with his old haunt unbearably difficult. A constant reminder of contradictory memories, clashing his feelings and stirring up his emotional stew, rediscovering the homeliness of Hogwarts was as much a blessing as it was a jarring taunt that he would never truly feel at home here again. Even as his heart skips a beat while turning his head and getting startled by the grin of a ghost long gone, covered in knitted sweater that flashed like eyes he'd never forget, the hollow feeling that stalked him for the past 12 years had a vice-like grip that was all too familiar to a familiar like himself.

'So I'm rushing down the halls wondering what on /earth/ those devils could have done to have Minerva /screeching/, and I pull open the door of the classroom they're in only to be run over by a giant black dog and a /pig/,' Pomona managed to say in between bouts of laughter that were probably only half brought on by the story and half brought on by the bottle of sherry that was currently being jealously guarded by Sybil. 'A pig! A live pig in Hogwarts!'

Remus couldn't help the smile spreading across his face as he recalled /that/ Christmas, despite him knowing the true identity of the 'giant black dog'. He looked around and saw that even two glasses of Merlot wouldn't have Minerva (God would it ever stop feeling weird calling her that?) leaning back with laughter, although he could see the glint of amusement in her eyes and a soft smile beginning on her lips.

Snape looked about ready to murder someone.

(And God would it ever stop feeling weird hearing people call him /Professor/?)

'Honestly, I don't know how long I stayed on the floor just wondering what the /hell/ just happened. By the time I got up I swear Minerva had Potter's ear so tightly in her hand I could see it ripping at the seams!'

A young black-haired head turned his head at the last comment, but quickly ignored it in favour of his discussion with his friends. He laughed at something the youngest Weasley said and Remus turned away before memories devoured all his attention once again.

'I looked around the room and honestly could not, for the /life *of me, understand *what/ I had stepped into.' Pomona continued with the story, clearly building up the anticipation for the state of the room. He had never expected this of the dirt-covered, gentle-hearted Head of Hufflepuff. Loud and uninhibited, when Remus arrived at the school she was placed at the centre of everyone's attention, and, in his four months in the Hogwarts staff room, she'd never left. 'Four third year Gryffindor boys wearing nothing but a witch's hat and blindfolds prancing around in a circle around a sleeping Peter Pettigrew, Remus tied up by his ankle on the ceiling belting out 'God Save The Queen' at the top of his voice and James Potter sitting atop of a chair made entirely of cooked Macaroni! Cooked!'
