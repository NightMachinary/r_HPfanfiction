If she, for lack of a better way of saying it, was socialized better perhaps, but like with pureblood!Hermione, that would be a fundamental shift in who she is, in my opinion.

This scene would have been much different with a Hufflepuff Hermione:

  “You're saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. “It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar' nice and long.”

  “You do it, then, if you're so clever,” Ron snarled.

  Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, “Wingardium Leviosa!”

Either a prefect adonishing her or being ostracized because she is abrasive. The HP wiki says this about Hufflepuff:

#+begin_quote
  Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four houses; valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members.
#+end_quote

So for Hermione, I think she'd either need to be more patient or admonished for her lack of patience. As far as loyalty goes, I tend to side with the fanon that they're loyal to the group/house as a whole. I see her more loyal to a small group of friends.
