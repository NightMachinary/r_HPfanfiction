Zacharias Smith or someone? Who was a Hufflepuff, who was really crude.

You don't have to have all the traits in a house. For instance, look at Peter Pettigrew being sorted into Gryffindor, Severus Snape into Slytherin.

Hermione is hard working, going to the library even when it's something minor, she's very dedicated, she's very loyal, her patience is rather thin so is fair play, she gets annoyed when someone one ups her, for instance, but again, a person doesn't have to have all the traits in the house.
