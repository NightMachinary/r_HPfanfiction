On your comment about Slytherin, I sort of headcanon that the Hat gets a 'read' for the political situation each year by evaluating the minds of all the children it has sorted. It tries to avoid you know, putting children into life-threatening situations. I think that, Slytherin's total lack of Muggleborns is a relatively recent (as in the last hundred years) thing, because as the House has become more and more hostile its become more and more dangerous for Muggleborn students to be sorted there. So, only the most Slytherin of Slytherin muggleborns wind up there.

Obviously this is just my headcanon, but I thought it was interesting you were wondering in similar ways. After all, its not like the official sorting quiz asks "Are you a muggleborn?" If blood purity /really/ mattered that much with Slytherin, you'd think it would. It seems much more likely to me that the total dearth of muggleborns in Slytherin is more for their safety than because no muggleborns would do well there.
