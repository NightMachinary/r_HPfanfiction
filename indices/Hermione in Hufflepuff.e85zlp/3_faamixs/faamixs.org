We know too little about how the Sorting hat ACTUALLY sorts people. There are so many examples in canon of people who made no sense in their sorting for 95% of the books and then have their one moment where we go.. oh. But it seems silly for a hat to sort for that one moment they might show a certain houses colors.

Add to this, we don't even know if the original houses are the same as they once were. The most obvious example of this is Slytherin. Was it ACTUALLY a house for pure blood bigots 99% of the time and intended to be that way? Or was it just the house of the cunning alone. The hat could be sorting on a completely different spectrum compared to what we "think" the houses are based upon what students and teachers know.

Point is, people can argue all they want about what characters should have been in what houses but there are no right or wrong answers.

Speaking to your personal comment. I personally don't really think she fits in Hufflepuff that well if for no other reason than she fits BETTER in Ravenclaw, or to a lesser degree, Gryffindor. While she was hard-working, the hard-work revolved around knowledge. And while she was loyal to her friends, many would argue that was in part, because of her history of having a bit of trouble with "Friendships" and the fact that the friendship started with them literally saving her life. She was also the opposite of some of the Hufflepuff elements we "think" we know about. Such as patience, of which she had very little.
