I always argued Hufflepuff was the best match for her, personality-wise. At least early on, she doesn't strike me as particularly academic, or someone who studies out of any ambition. She's been encouraged to study a lot, so that's what she's good at.

But then again, I also think Slytherin suits early Ron's personality and Hufflepuff would be the best match for Goyle. So clearly the sorting doesn't have that much to do with personality. I always liked the headcanon that the hats sorts on ideals and values, not personality.
