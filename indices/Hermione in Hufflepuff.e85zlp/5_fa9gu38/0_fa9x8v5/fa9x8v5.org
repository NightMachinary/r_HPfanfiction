  make Ernie and Zacharias centrists in the "muggleborns have a right to be here, but I'll be preserving my purebloodness" way.

There is something to build on here.

Ernie's initially very antagonistic towards Harry, but he also gives off the impression that he's devoted to his ideals.

And he eventually becomes one of Harry's more stalwart allies. When the time comes for war, he shouts out "And what if we want to stay and fight?"

Ernie has decided he's willing to die to protect others.

Zacharias Smith on the other hand is an arrogant toe-rag from the moment he's introduced, skeptical of Harry's teaching methods, his family opposes Dumbledore's teaching methods, and when the evacuations begin, he knocks down first-years so he can be the first to flee.
