She's not really a good fit anywhere if we look at it purely from a social standpoint.

However, characteristically speaking she can fit anywhere. She /is/ hardworking, loyal, brave, intelligent, ambitious, and cunning. She's just so abrasive it would take a peer saving her from a troll for her to make a friend. Unfortunately, not too many would do that. Hermione having friends is just as essential to her development as Harry having a family.
