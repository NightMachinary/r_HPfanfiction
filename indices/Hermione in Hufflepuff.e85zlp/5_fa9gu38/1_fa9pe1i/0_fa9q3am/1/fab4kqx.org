  She's just so abrasive it would take a peer saving her from a troll for her to make a friend.

I think the Ravenclaws would put up with that abrasiveness the best though. Blunt as an axe because the only thing that matters is discovering the "truth" of a subject. I think Slytherins would be the next best choice after Ravenclaws for abrasive people. They'll put up with bluntness if it means winning. Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors are the worst choice for blunt people.

Case in point, I'm a Slytherclaw and Hermione's personality has never bothered me. We would get on fine.
