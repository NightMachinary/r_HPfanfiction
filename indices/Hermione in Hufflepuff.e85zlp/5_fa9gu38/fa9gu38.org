Because Hufflepuff is boring. There's no glory and very little drama.

You could, of course, make Ernie and Zacharias centrists in the "muggleborns have a right to be here, but I'll be preserving my purebloodness" way. You could do some unrequited Cedric attraction. Or you could write a 1st dark wandholder from Hufflepuff story because the Hufflepuffs were assholes and Zacharias (it would absolutely be him) wouldn't be running off to save her from a troll.
