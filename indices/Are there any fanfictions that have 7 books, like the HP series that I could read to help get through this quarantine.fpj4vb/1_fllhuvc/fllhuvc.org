It doesn't have 7 books but it's long enough to keep you busy for days. The first part is called initiate and the author should be Marauderlover7 or something like that. It's on ffnet. Still haven't finished it but it is nice. I really like the bits about Tonk's auror training. But it's more about Sirius taking Harry from the Dursleys prior to the first book and then it goes on when Harry goes to Hogwarts but everything is quite different.

And Cunning and Ambitious by MinaAndChao on ao3. It's a really good Slytherin!Harry story. 1-5 are completed and a few chapters of book 6 I think.

And I can't help it but: Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb sauce. Best story ever.
