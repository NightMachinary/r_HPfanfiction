Most fanfictions have short-hand descriptions in the summary. If for example you see HP/DM you know it is a love story between Harry and Draco. Or HG/RW is Hermione and Ron.

You can also make specific requests like "Please recommend long, complete fanfics to a newbie to HP fanfic. Please no slash, no smut, no gore." Modify as needed.

Alternatively search this sub, there were quite a few threads requesting long completed fics to read during quarantine.

BTW: If you find you don't like a concept in a recommended story, don't get upset and hate on the author or on the person who recommended a story, just roll your eyes and hit the back button.
