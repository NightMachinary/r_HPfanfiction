Are you new to fanfic? Or just new to HP fanfic?

You write "anything would do" - are you aware of the dark and disturbing corners? Like the internet, there are parts of the fanfic world that can be seriously disturbing if you are new to it. There was a recent thread that discussed "things you won't read" and on the things that came up was (I wish I was kidding) Hermione and the troll from first year porn. Yuck.

That said, many people have different things they won't read. I dislike creature fic, harem and gore, while others dislike so-called slash (homoerotic love pairings) and mpreg (male pregnancy fics), which are things that don't bother me too much.

I think it would be a good idea to specify what you do not wish to read and or what you find disturbing. There is amazing fanfiction out there and there is very disturbing fanfiction out there and - this is the scary part - sometimes they overlap. What I consider amazing might make you run screaming for the hills and vice versa.

Personally I think "Blood Magic" by Gateway Girl is a good introduction to HP fanfic. It covers approx. Harry's 6th year, but with a twist: Harry finds out he is the biological son of Severus Snape. I like it bc it is very well written, discusses some ideas on dark magic and wizarding society that have become accepted in the fandom as standard by now and explores some ideas that J.K. Rowling could not put into the books for various reasons even if she wanted to, like a love affair between Remus Lupin and Severus Snape.

Note that Blood Magic was written before HBP came out. After reading Blood Magic so many times, I actually disliked HBP bc I preferred the outcome of Blood Magic to the actual ending of HBP.

Another good story that would be a good introduction is Harry Potter and the conspiracy of Blood by cambangst

An elderly Harry, his adult children and grandchildren need to uncover a conspiracy against the Weasley clan and fight a new dark lord.

It is canon-compliant, so this is good if you want to read about how things might be 40, 50 years after graduation.

Finally, something completely different: Exile by bennybear

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile]]

It is about Draco Malfoy and his life after Hogwarts. He is forced to live without magic for several years and finds himself struggling through the muggle world, fighting depression and PTSD at the same time.
