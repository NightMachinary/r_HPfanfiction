The sacrifices arc by lightning on the wave is a classic long read. Complete rewrite of all 7 books. It's a “wrong boy who lived” fic where Harry has a twin brother who everyone believes defeated voldy when they were babies. It does have a slash relationship in the later books but it's easy to skip if that's not your thing (author gives warnings chapter by chapter). It's LONG. Like 3mil worlds long over the 7 fics. Well worth a go, I really loved it. It starts with “saving Connor” [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/895946/?s=1&a=s]]
