Draco catches his breath in the copilot's seat, as Pansy works on a task at the pilot's control panel.

"How could they think I'm suspicious?" He asked, between gasps. "I helped them shove Greg through the fucking airlock! Would I have done that if I knew he wasn't the impostor?"

"No," Pansy replied, not looking up.

"It's a good thing this door closed on us," Draco continued, gesturing at the heavy steel door behind them. "Potter may have caught us otherwise."

"Yeah, lucky that," Pansy agreed, distractedly.

Draco sighed. "At least I can trust one person up here."

Any reply Pansy had was interrupted by a beeping noise, and a metallic click in the far corner of the cockpit, near an air vent. "Aha, got it."

Draco looked at the panel she had been working on. "What are you doing?" He asked.

She swiveled in her chair, facing him. He did not notice the wand in her hand.

"I was just wondering if the killing curse works through these space suits."
