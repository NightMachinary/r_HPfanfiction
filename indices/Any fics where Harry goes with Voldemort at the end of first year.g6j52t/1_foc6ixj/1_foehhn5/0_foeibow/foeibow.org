His personality is still pretty much the same as in the early chapters, though of course a few years of development make him more intelligent/rational; about the same level of mental development that you would expect for a typical 11 year old. He does tend to be pragmatic in ways that most adults in the fic would consider odd for a kid. All in all, the horcrux doesn't noticeably affect his personality, but Harry tends to follow some odd paths of moral reasoning as a result of the extreme way that Petri raised him and not having any reliable mentors to look to for good advice.
