I don't think you get what OP is asking for. He wants one of the 'Most Nobel and Ancient' fics to subvert the trope. Instead of angsty teenage Harry rebelling against Dumbledore and becoming Lord Hadrian Potter Black Peverell the 3rd he says 'fuck it' and rebels against that system instead.

Or maybe I got it wrong.
