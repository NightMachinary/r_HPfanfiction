I am not a Draco fan in the least bit, but a post about the Black family inheritance got me thinking about how I had never seen a single fanfiction where Harry just doesn't accept it. He doesn't like attention, he already is moderately well off to do, and as much as he dislikes Draco he isn't spiteful. Sure after Voldemort is back from the dead then Harry would fight it, he doesn't want to support Voldemort. But there are plenty of fanfics of younger Harry activity hunting down the Black family 'fortune' for no reason other then wish fulfillment.

Sure in the long run having political power can do more good, but he is a dumb teenager. Maybe he gives up his tenuous claim and regrets it later in life.

Also, I see tons of requests for Grey/Neutral Harry, but I don't think I have read a single one. I can definitely see a Neutral Harry just not accepting because he doesn't want to deal with the responsibilities. He wants to be left out of all of it, and making power grabs at power is a good way to convince everyone else you are up to something.
