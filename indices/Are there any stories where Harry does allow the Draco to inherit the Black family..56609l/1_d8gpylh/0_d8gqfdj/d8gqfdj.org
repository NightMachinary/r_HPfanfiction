For those stories where Ancient and Most Proud house of black has political connections and obligations. The question becomes, why would morally upright Harry accept an obligitory position in a corrupt system?

If the story is closer to Canon(In which honestly Harry should have received no money, as from what I can tell none of it was Sirius's) the Black family only had "A reasonable amount of gold" however much that is.
