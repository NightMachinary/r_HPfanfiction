Kicking Gotham (linkffn(13521865)) is, IMO, a very good example of badass Auror Harry Potter specifically. DC Comics crossover, btw.

I especially like how the author throws in details about Auror training/mentality, and how it's relevant to what's currently happening.

Like when he's fighting someone, and they apparate, HP goes into an internal monologue about how Aurors are trained to be able to handle apparating foes.

Or how his enemy made a mistake by assuming he was running away when he apparated, and he goes into details about how Aurors don't back down and if you think they're running then chances are it's a trap and you're about to get stunned and arrested.

And it's not just combat aspects that he goes over like this, either.

It's little tidbits throughout the story like this that paint the overall picture that Harry is a badass auror.
