Harry isn't an auror in it, but i'm on something like a 14 chapter streak of "at least 1 fight per chapter" in my fic. Here's a taste of how an action scene looks:

-- A column of boiling water appeared, arcing over the Carrows and launching directly towards the two Flints behind them, while another column of wood formed from the wall opposite Amycus and shot directly towards him. Stone jaws grew out of the ground beneath Phinneus, trying to drag him into a pit of quicksand, while the sofa flashed and morphed into a swarm of hornets that descended on Alecto.

Shouts and screams rang out through the home. Marcus Flint, only a year removed from Hogwarts, was slow to react and took the blow from the boiling water head-on. A brief shout began but cut out almost immediately as the steam from the superheated water instantly cooked his lungs following his shocked inhalation. Boiled and blistered skin fell off in chunks, and the boy collapsed to the floor unconscious and asphyxiating. Paulus was able to erect a shield in time, the wide column striking a glancing blow against him but leaving him uninjured and able to watch his son's death in graphic detail.

Alecto used an incendio charm against the hornets, the insects burning immediately under her sustained blaze. Phinneus and Amycus both destroyed Harry's transfigurations with Reductors and turned towards the young man with curses of their own in reply. The fragments of the wood column, however, did not fall idly to the floor; as soon as they landed, they morphed into vines that immediately began to grow and seek out the Death Eaters, grasping their limbs and attempting to immobilize Amycus and Alecto. --
