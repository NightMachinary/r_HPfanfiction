How to solve P=NP and revolutionize computer science and mathematics using a time turner:

You should have received a note from your future self. Don't open it yet, as long as you have not observed it you can freely choose what to send to your past self.

Let p be the product of two unknown primes.

If the note you received turns out to be empty, write 1*1 on a new note and send it back.

If the note contains two primes whose product equals p, you solved the problem. Copy the exact message and send it back.

If the note contains two numbers that don't result in p and the first number is less than p, increment the first number by one and send that back.

If the first number has reached p, reset it to 1 and increment the second number.

Each possibility except for the correct solution should cause a change in history, looping through all possibilities simultaneously until you reach the stable state of having the correct prime factors.

Got it?

Let's open the note and see if it works!
