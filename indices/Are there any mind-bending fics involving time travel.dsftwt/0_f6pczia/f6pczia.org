Mind-bending time-travel fics coming up. I will try to not spoil anything too important, or put it behind spoiler tags:

- linkffn(A Long Journey Home): imagine what if the time-travel wasn't controlled, and that you had to go and live all the way from 6000 years to the present in order to return to your former time. This is the best iteration of the live-back-to-present idea, and its sold totally on its awesome characterization and world-building. Highly recommend.
- linkffn(Realignment): you ever see Terminator 2? Well, this fic is basically that, but the catch is 1943 Tom Riddle is John Connor. This fic really takes the action and magical show-offness up to 11, and I can highly recommend it for its unique spin on several characters as well.
- linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw): since it happens in the first chapter, I'm spoiling this. Imagine what would happen if, unlike most fics, Harry or the MC died and was sent back, but they were not the only one who had been back. Now imagine what would happen if the time-travelers were working at a cross-purpose as well. That is a fairly important part of this fic.
- linkffn(The Lesser Sadness): full disclosure, I love everything about this fic, short as it is. Its got one of the most original premises I have ever encountered in the fandom, is filled with incredible magic and OPness, and oozes personality in a way that few fics have really been able to emulate. Highly recommend this one, especially since its only a 20k read.
- linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter): ever see Groundhog Day? Or more accurately, Re:Zero if you're more into anime. This fic is basically that premise but with Harry Potter. Its interesting to explore how the constant repetition has such an emotional impact on Harry and how it shapes his behavior.

I can come up with a few more, but I hope that will satisfy your interests for now. Give a shout out if you want something else.
