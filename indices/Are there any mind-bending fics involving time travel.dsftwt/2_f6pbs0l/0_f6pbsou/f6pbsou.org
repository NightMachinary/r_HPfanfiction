  What if you had the chance to travel back in time and change just one event in your life? What would it be?For Harry Potter there is no question; he would undo the events of Halloween 1980, when the Dark Lord Voldemort took the lives of his parents, both heroic fighters for the light side. Ever since he was a kid, Harry has dreamed of being able to stop the tragedy of that fateful day.Now Harry may get exactly what he wished for...... and much more than he bargained for.
