linkffn(Anticlockwise) a time traveling fic from the perspective of a non-traveler. Sadly unfinished, but what's there is pretty nifty.

This one doesn't quite have time travel (does realizing that everybody you know has been lying about the world, year included, count?) but has a lot of mind-bending and twists involved. The one and only Harry Potter/Matrix crossover: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Illusions of Reality)
