Not really feudal. Certainly patriarchal and misogynist, but there is not excessive Lord Potter (or Lady Potter in this case) nonsense, I would know, I really hate that trope. It's more like “How much did I miss looking on this from a guy's perspective?”. And yes, there is rather detailed description of a rape (completely necessary for the story, that's the one case of explicit sexual content which is justified by the plot line), so if it can trigger anything, I would caution about that.
