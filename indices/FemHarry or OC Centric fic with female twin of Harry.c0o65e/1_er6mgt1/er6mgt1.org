Personally I like linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) and pretty much everything else in that universe, especially the one With Eru Lee in it, it is however rather philosophical, and in the main one the main character is rather immoral.

The series below is also good, however: */WARNING/* That thing has disturbing bloody things in it, the things in it is openly considered to be evil in the fic(as it should be), but that don't change the fact that it is bloody disturbing

linkffn(Princess of the Blacks)
