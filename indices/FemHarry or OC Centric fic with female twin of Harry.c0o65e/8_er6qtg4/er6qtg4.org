sakurademonalchemist has a bunch of good FemHarry fics though at 256 published fics not counting her drabble fics you will also be sifting through Bleach, Reborn, Naruto, and others some of which are slash or femslash but nothing graphic, basically just alluding to any sex.

MoonlightBushido has a bunch of good ones as well.
