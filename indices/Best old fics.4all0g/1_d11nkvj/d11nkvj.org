  Which ones most accurately predicted the next books?
#+end_quote

Probably the most amusing "prediction" was linkffn(The Order of the Phoenix by Ruskbyte), which appropriated the title of JKR's fifth book a year before it was released.

An old, epic series that was way before its time was linkffn(Harry Potter's Existence After Life by Cygnus Crux) and sequels.

Then there's the work of Full Pensieve (Mike) [[http://fp.fanficauthors.net/][(link)]], specifically Year of Rebellion. Alas, another writer felled by failing health.
