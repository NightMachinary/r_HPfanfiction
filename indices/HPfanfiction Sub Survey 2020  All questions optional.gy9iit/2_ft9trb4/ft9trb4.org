I feel like in the "do you read slash" there should be a "I have no preference" of sorts. I have read some gay!harry fics that I love in which harry is still harry, he just happens to snog a dude. These types of fic I kinda like, but the ones where he is a limp-wristed stereotypical guy that screams "I am gay" every time he walks into a room and the topic frequently comes up in conversation, I hate with a passion.
