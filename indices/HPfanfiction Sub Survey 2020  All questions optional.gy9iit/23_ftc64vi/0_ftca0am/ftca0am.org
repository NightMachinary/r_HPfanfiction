Exactly my thoughts, whatever points you said.

The Harry/Ginny dynamic is not even properly defined in the canon. To me it seems like a forced pairing. Hermione is much more of a dominant person and Harry is too. But the pairing is still better. I feel Harry/Luna pairing is the best with the canon in mind as they have better dynamics and they seem to a perfect fit of misfits.

I think ya Voldemort would sure win. The reason he doesn't win with Dumbledore is I think the fact that he saw Dumbledore as the most powerful wizard in his childhood and maybe that has become some kind of barrier for defeating him.
