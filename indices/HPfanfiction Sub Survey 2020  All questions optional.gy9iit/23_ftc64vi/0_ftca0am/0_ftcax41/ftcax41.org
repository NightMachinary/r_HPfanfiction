Everybody on the so-called Light side is all, "Yeah, Dumbledore is the only person Voldemort fears."

Says who? Yeah, young Tom feared him as a student. After all, the first thing Dumbledore did was /set all his things on fire/ in an effort to cow him. He had the power to close the school and send Tom back to his hated orphanage, and later to deny him the teaching job he coveted.

Adult Tom didn't LIKE Dumbledore, but didn't seem to fear him. If he was afraid of Dumbledore he wouldn't have dared to possess a teacher and spend a year right under his nose.
