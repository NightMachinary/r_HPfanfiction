As the chapter is called "the only one he ever feared" it's word of god Voldemort feared Dumbledore.

Dumbledore didn't have the power to close the school during Tom's years as he wasn't headmaster. Dippet was. Tom feared Dumbledore because Tom played his hand the first time they met. As such, he could never play Dumbledore like he could everyone else and this pretty much continues in the 90s. Voldemort lost because Dumbledore and Harry understand Voldemort more than Voldemort understood them.

  he wouldn't have dared to possess a teacher and spend a year right under his nose.

This favors "he feared him" more than it doesn't. Voldemort is /hiding/. He attacks Harry at a match Dumbledore doesn't attend. He spends months trying to get Dumbledore out of the castle so that he may get to the stone.
