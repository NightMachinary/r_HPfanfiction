Poll: Harry inherits someone's memories.\\
Me: That's a trope?

ETA more comments.

- I thought I was probably older than most people here. Now I know by how much.
- To the 3 people who are so rich they don't have to work: want to adopt me?
- The best worded question IMO: "If you had to choose, you would prefer: Harry/Ginny or Harry/Hermione." I think canonically neither one is a good match. Ginny only sees the hero and Hermione wants to boss him around like an older sibling.
- All of you people writing fanfic but not publishing it: why/why not?
- In a fair fight, who would win, Voldemort or Dumbledore? Most of you said Dumbledore. I voted Voldemort because he's more ruthless. Dumbledore is more interested in capturing and redeeming than conquering; Voldemort is a take-no-prisoners kinda guy.
- For the same reason, I voted that Hermione would beat Harry. She's more competitive and ruthless (just ask Marietta Edgecombe). Harry would worry about hurting his friend; Hermione just wants to win. The question as stated didn't specify magical strength or ability, just an even playing field. Personality matters.
- LOL at this dichotomy:\\
  What is your view on sex scenes? (nearly half of us) No preference.\\
  Do you read smut? (almost twice that many of us) Hell yes!
