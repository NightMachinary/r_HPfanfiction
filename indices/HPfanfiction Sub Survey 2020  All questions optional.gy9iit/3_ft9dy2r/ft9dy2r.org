Every year I'm surprised by how popular *canon* characterisation and relationships are in this survey. I feel like so much of the fic I see is Dumbledore/Weasley bashing, or Dark!Super!Harry, or pairing Harry with... the Giant Squid. And then I read this and Ron bashing is the most unpopular response of the lot, and dark Harry isn't even popular, and H/G is the most popular ship. Geez, why do I have so much trouble finding fic that reflects that.

Anyway thanks loads for doing these, they're very informative and worthwhile.
