It's telling how Harry/Ginny vs Harry/Hermione has its own question dedicated to it. And even then, it's pretty evenly split. I personally fall on the latter side of the debate (no shame on the Harry/Ginny folk, you're alright), so it's reassuring to see I'm not in as small of a minority as I thought.
