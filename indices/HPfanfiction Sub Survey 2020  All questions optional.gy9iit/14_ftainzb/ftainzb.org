Interesting to see that I'm in the minority on shield charms being able to block nukes. I personally don't think a single shield charm could block a nuke, but many layered together. Not a nuance the question captures however.

The crossover question is so balanced! Didn't think there was such balanced diversity to it. Seems like a lot of people also really like complete AUs. Personally, that questions also reflects my interest in 30k+ magical populations, different magical borders, and grittier magical warfare. All features of some of my favourite stories. I noticed however that there's no question about alternate or greatly expanded magical systems, nor are there questions about what are commonly accepted pieces of headcanons, such as wards, runes not just as a language but as actual magic, etc. All of those would be interesting insights.
