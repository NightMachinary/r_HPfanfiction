One minor issue that I have with this survey that I also had with the previous one is a lack of 3rd option for whether you consider Severus and Draco as ultimately good people, and in what way, etc. I would have preferred the options "irredeemable", "redeemable but not redeemed" and "redeemed". As it is, the survey implies a much stronger dislike for Severus than Draco, which I don't think is actually true, due to this answer limitation (the question is basically "do you consider Snape redeemed? yes or no" and "do you consider Draco redeemable but not neccessarily redeemed? yes or not".

This is somewhat reflected in the "favorite" and "most hated" characters. Both of them have roughly twice as many haters, with Draco having overall less people considering him their most liked and most hated character overall.
