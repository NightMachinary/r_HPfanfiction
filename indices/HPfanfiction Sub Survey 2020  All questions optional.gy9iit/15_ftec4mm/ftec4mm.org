Going through the responses as they are right now.

- Interesting that there seems to be fewer people who identify as homosexual than there are people who identify as bisexual, asexual, and other.

- Seems to be more people who identify as male than people who identify as female, though it seems to be less male-skewed than the general reddit population. So far, it's more even split than last year.

- Lotta students on this sub, which is not surprising, really.

- Seems like over half the respondents have written HP fanfiction but as of typing this, 50% have written it and 30% have published. Therefore 60% of people that have written it have published it).

- I am *shocked* to see that 58% (as of this comment) of people will read stories where the protagonist is a gay man. Considering the amount of 'no slash' requests and general downvoting of slash-oriented fics that transpires in this sub. The mods do great work but the general users' attitude towards M/M slash fics on this sub is definitely negative.

- It's funny that gay Harry is less popular than male slashfics in general, with less than 50% of people saying they read gay Harry stories. I guess there are plenty of people that like Wolfstar but not gay Harry.

- The reaction towards gay women is far more positive. I won't get into my suspicions as to why this is, but this is very unsurprising.

- Fem!Harry isn't too popular. I have to admit, most of the fem!Harry fics I've read haven't been very good, but there are a few damn good ones. I hope fem!Harry includes trans!Harry, because there are some really good fics out there that have trans!Harry.

- Harry-centric fics are, as expected, the clear preference.

- I'm surprised that 36% of people consider Pottermore to be canon. That seems high to me. Personally I consider only the original seven novels to be truly canon, with the rest falling under lesser stages of canonicity. Movies and Pottermore and side books are mostly canon except where they contradict the books, Fantastic Beasts movies are kind of canon except where they contradict the books, other movies, and Pottermore, and so on. Cursed Child, in my opinion, contains no amount of canon and any similarities between it and canon are purely coincidental.

- Dolores Umbridge is the most hated character, no surprise. Surprised Snape is number two. I voted for Peter Pettigrew, who is in third at present. Funny how the big bad of the series, Lord Voldemort, is only hated the most by 1.9% at present. I'd rank Voldemore number three, after Pettigrew and Umbridge.

- I personally find it interesting how the Half-Blood Prince is in the lead for 'least favourite book'. I remember most people not liking Chamber of Secrets, which is currently in the middle. My least favourite was Deathly Hallows, but I didn't expect to share that opinion with 16% of people. Finally some people are seeing the light*! (*for some definitions of light)

- Shame only 77% of people think Ron was a good friend to Harry. I'd kill to have more friends like Ron in my life. I only have two friends as good as Ron, and I treasure them greatly.

- Wow, 89% of people agree that Remus was right to tell Harry to use lethal spells against Death Eaters. I hope most of them said yes for the same reason I did: Remus was right to advise Harry in that way because Remus thought it best and Remus cared about Harry. Harry was also right to ignore that advice.

- Lotta people think Draco wasn't punished enough in canon (54%). I'm on the fence here, as I feel like overall he got pretty damn well punished. Perhaps not in school, and that's on the teachers for not cracking down on his bullying, but I think he was set up to have a real shit time after Hogwarts, plus his last two years at school were pretty rough. I say he got punished about the right amount overall.

- I don't like the idea that a well-cast Shield Charm being able to protect you from a conventional bomb. I feel like a lot of people are underestimating just how destructive bombs are. I mean, I hope no one has to find out first-hand, but bombs are /powerful./ Go look at photos of the aftermath of bombs. It's awful.

- Smut is popular, no surprises there. I personally find it /hard/ to write good smut. Haven't managed it yet. Kudos to the mods here for keeping this subreddit largely smut-free by way of rule 8. I say this not because I don't like smut, but because I'd like this community to stay outta sight of the Reddit admins, whose decisions are mercurial at best.

- Someday I will convince this subreddit that Harry/Katie is the best pairing. Someday. Still working on that Harry/Katie fic that's been in development for two years. I want to complete it before publishing it.

- Ugh, Harry/Draco's popularity is a thorn in my side. I love M/M Harry fics, but not with Draco, Snape, or Voldemort!

- I wish Fleur was an option for Hermione pairings because she's my favorite partner for Hermione.

- Interesting that people like democratic magical Britain when it's certainly not that way in the books. I'm indifferent. I've seen it done well both ways.

- Heartened by the strong dislike of marriage contracts. I have yet to read a fic that has marriage contracts that I like, and I've read most of the most often recommended marriage contract fics.

- Also heartened by very strong dislike of Mugglewank.

- Strong feelings in both directions about romantic soul bonds. I'm not opposed to the idea, but as with marriage contract fics, I haven't yet found a fic featuring the trope that I like.

- Ugh, Occlumency improving memory and learning? And most people like it! Please no, no, no! It always turns into a fic where one character is incredibly overpowered! Occlumency helps you defend your mind against mental attacks. That's it, in my opinion.

- Looks like most people also like magical genius Harry, too. Make the fic less fun and interesting in my opinion.

- Good, Ron bashing is finally becoming less popular. And Hermione bashing is very unpopular, thank goodness.

- I'm very mixed on crossovers. I've read some really great ones and a lot of very, very bad ones. It's annoying that a lot of the more popular crossovers are with anime or western animated TV shows, neither of which I have much experience with.

tl;dr: The subreddit's views are mostly unsurprising, I disagree on a handful of topics, and it's great that we've already had a great number of responses than last year.
