i didnt get a chance to take the survey so im not sure what the options where but while i would general say no to m/m slash fics im willing to read them. they just too often get into weird very ooc territory for me. its like obnoxious soul bond harry/hermione ooc just with 2 male characters. I see it most often with harry/draco or harry/snape so those are usually solid passes for me.

also harry/katie is so undershipped its crazy.

personally i like a bunch of fem harry fics, though if harry gets all weird and bitch and demanding its a drop for me, though male harry screaming at people is usually a drop as well.

one of the things i disagree with you heavily on is ron. i think ron can be written very well written but in terms of canon ron, he can sod right off. differences of opinion or getting in fights is normal between people friends, family, wives whatever. its how you can maybe forgive a tri-wizard asshat situation, but abandoning your buddies in a life and death struggle? hell no.

the other thing i differ with you on is draco's punishment. i think the teachers didnt punish people much at all at school but i think draco should have been jailed and or had massive amounts of long term counseling. he was a little shit for years which should be punished in school but when he graduated from slurs and school fights to attempted murder and leading terrorists into a school with the intent of more murder he became a much more serious issue than regret or a shitty home/school life or helping the harry at the end can atone for.

I imagine both my ron and my draco opinions are influenced by how and when i was raised though.
