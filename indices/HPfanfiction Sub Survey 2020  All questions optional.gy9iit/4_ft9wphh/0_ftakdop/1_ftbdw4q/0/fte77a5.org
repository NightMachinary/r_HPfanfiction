Interesting, I've always thought of a shield as a sort of physical and magical barrier, that stops objects or spells from passing through. Sort of like a wall. But if a shield protects from harm as a main point, that would mean it's more focused on the intent of an incoming spell, or on the effect of a physical object. It would mean that it might let a healing spell through, or a friend, all the while blocking harmful spells. That would be quite powerful actually. Neat idea.
