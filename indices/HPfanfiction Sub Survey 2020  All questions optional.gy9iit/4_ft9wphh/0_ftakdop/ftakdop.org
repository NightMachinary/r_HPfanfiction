Oh yes, that shield question had me thinking, too. I decided that a very good shield can probably stop bullets, but only if you cast the shield before you get shot at, you're not fast enough otherwise. Shields may protect against a bomb, definitely against debris etc., but possibly the shock wave would sweep you and your shield away. I'm unsure whether you could anchor your shield somewhere and whether it would survive a bomb in that case.

Nothing survives nuclear bombs. And I don't think wizards know enough about radiation to shield from that effectively.
