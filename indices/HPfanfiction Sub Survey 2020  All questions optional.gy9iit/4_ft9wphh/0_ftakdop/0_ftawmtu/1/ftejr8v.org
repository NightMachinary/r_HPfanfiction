  Kids don't know anatomy to transfigure living beings.

They don't need to know the complexities of anatomy, but the barebones "legs, shell, claws, etc" to do it. Hermione partially changed her match, which got her points. So there is a methodology to it.

And magic is all about knowledge and practice too. A Nuclear weapon is estimated around 50% blast energy, 35% thermal energy, and 15% Nuclear radiation.

I can see the first one getting blocked. MAYBE the second one, if they had wards or something heavy duty targeting heat specifically. Fire, yes. But Heat energy? I don't see too many people directly shielding against that unless they were in war time footing. Or if the enemy has a death ray or something. Or some sort of magical blacksmith.

Radiation? I can see other parts of the world knowing (and willing) to ward against it. But magical britain? The most ass backwards swamp I've seen? No, they still think guns are muskets. Hell, they probably think all of the explosions in the war was Grindelwald's doing, and any halfblood or muggleborn trying to say otherwise was being mugglelovers and trying to "uplift" them by giving them credit where they didn't "deserve" it.
