You're generalizing though. /Some/ British wizards are willfully ignorant. Some aren't. Kingsley blends in just fine, for example. Malfoy knows about helicopters. All you need is one to bring it up at the ICW or whatever. You have whole departments dedicated to knowing about muggles. Those responsible for setting up anti-nuke enchantments would know about them.
