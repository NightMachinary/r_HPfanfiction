Alright, there are wizards with specialized knowledge, who know what's up and how to deal with it. They probably cast protective enchantments around Diagon Alley, or Hogwarts, or other places like that. The average wizard still has no idea, though, and The Burrow would not survive a nuke (Who would bomb Ottery St Catchpole anyway?)
