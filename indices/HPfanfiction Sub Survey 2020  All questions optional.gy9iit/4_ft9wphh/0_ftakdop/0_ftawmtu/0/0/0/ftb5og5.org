  I doubt they wouldn't know. Nukes are a huge deal.

British wizards are wilfully ignorant about things like electricity, Muggle clothing and Muggle currency. I don't believe many of them would know about radiation. Even half-blood and Muggleborn wizards may not know very much, since their Muggle education typically stops after primary school. British wizards who were alive at the time would have heard about the bombs... but are they part of the curriculum in History of Magic now?

If anyone developed a spell against these things, it's probably Japanese wizards. They'd also teach their children about it. And maybe the wizarding communities in some other countries are not quite as detached from the Muggle world as the British seem to be, so they share more of their history and knowledge, but we don't know that.

  Well, many people survive bullets to the head but you know what I mean.

Wizards can probably heal away bullet wounds if they're not immediately deadly.
