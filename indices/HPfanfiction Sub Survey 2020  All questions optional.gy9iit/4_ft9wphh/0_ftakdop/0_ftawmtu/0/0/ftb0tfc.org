I doubt they wouldn't know. Nukes are a huge deal. Two cities got wiped off the map. Magical Ministries would look into them, and then there's the muggleborns and halfbloods who'd already know about it.

Yes. For this reason, I imagine some wizards died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Same reason you could shoot wizards with guns. They may have faster reflexes based on some stuff from canon (wizards pulling wands out faster than the eye can catch), but a bullet to the back of an unprotected wizard would kill them.

Well, many people survive bullets to the head but you know what I mean.

They'd certainly have anti-bomb spells, given WW2.
