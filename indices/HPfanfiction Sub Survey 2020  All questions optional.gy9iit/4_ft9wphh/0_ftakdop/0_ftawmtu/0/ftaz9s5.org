I meant that they wouldn't even know that there /is/ radiation to shield against.

And I guess you could argue that the laws of physics do not apply to magic whatsoever, so they can shield against nukes, energy-wise... then I'd still say you have to have the shield up before the explosion, so you have to either know that there's about to be one, or put some version of a permanent shield on your house, and I think that may be a different kind of magic? Now that I think about it, Diagon Alley could possible survive a nuke on London...
