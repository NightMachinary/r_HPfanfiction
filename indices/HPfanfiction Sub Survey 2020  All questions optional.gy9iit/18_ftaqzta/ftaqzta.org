I can't help but think that the questions regarding sexuality depicted in fanfiction should have more qualifiers.

While I tend to avoid them, I'm personally willing to read fanfics that feature homosexual males, so long as it isn't smut. In fact, that's the main reason I avoid them at all. Too often I'll see slash pairings and it ends up being a lot more smutty than I'm comfortable reading.
