I view Umbridge as the only character who's evil for her own pleasure. Even Voldemort and Snape had relatable motives for being villains, while Umbridge is mostly a 2d character who's prejudiced and abuses her small power every time she gets a chance, just to get things her way or to humiliate other people.
