I remember reading a fanfic where Marge realizes that Harry /isn't/ the problem. I actually tried reading it several times but kept giving up because it just seemed like the fanfic author made /everyone/ a good guy except for Vernon and Petunia. Marge and Lucius Malfoy were /friends/ in that fic. Before Harry was involved.

That one was just too far.
