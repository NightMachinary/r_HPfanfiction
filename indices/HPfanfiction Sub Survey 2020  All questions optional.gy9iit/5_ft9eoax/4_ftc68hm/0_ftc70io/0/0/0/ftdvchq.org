I've read one (one chapter in someone's collection of one-shots and story starts) in which Marge marries some rugged fisherman and adopts Harry. I don't remember the setup - just about that much. I do remember Harry telling Oliver about seabirds handling the wind well in storms, and Oliver wanting to do quidditch training under those conditions.
