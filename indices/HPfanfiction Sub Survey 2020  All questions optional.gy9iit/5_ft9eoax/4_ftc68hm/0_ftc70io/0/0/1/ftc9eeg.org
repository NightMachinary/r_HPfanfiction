I read one where Marge has custody of both boys for some reason (Petunia and Vernon in the hospital, I think). She treats Harry like dirt, of course, locking him up at night even. Over time she comes to realize that he can't possibly be the one sneaking out at night to eat the food and leave a mess. She also starts to see that he's more polite and more willing to do chores, and gets upset at Dudley's attitude. Don't remember if I finished reading it though.
