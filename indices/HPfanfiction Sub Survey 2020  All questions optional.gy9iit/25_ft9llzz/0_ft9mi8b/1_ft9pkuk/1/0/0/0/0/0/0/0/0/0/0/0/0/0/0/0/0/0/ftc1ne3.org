The Midwest does not consider you not white if you have brown hair and brown eyes lmao. Where are you getting this idea?

You're pulling this ideas out of your ass. Pretty much 99% of people in the US would consider you white. Just because some midwest people were mean to you doesn't make you not white. If they said you weren't white then what race were they saying that you were? Asian?

By not asking the race question you're actually saying my experience as a non white person doesn't matter. Cuz let's be real, I experience life a lot differently than you as an actual white person even if a couple of hicks were mean to you. And certainly very differently than a black or hispanic person.

Obviously everyone's situation is different and everyone has different experiences so then why even bother to ask any demographic question at all like gender identity, age or sexuality? Especially because gender identity and sexuality is so fluid these days.

I have an actual degree in statistics and have a lot of experience with survey design so I can guarantee you that 99% of people know their race. And that is an actual important factor that affects a lot of things whether you like it or not.
