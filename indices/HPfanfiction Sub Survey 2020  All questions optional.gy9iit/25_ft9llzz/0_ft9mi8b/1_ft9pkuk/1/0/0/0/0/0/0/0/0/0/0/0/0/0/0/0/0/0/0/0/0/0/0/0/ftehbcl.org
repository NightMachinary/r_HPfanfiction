Then subset the data to only use North America and europe. Are you even listening? Do you know what the word subset means? If you look at the data which you can do so by scrolling up and clicking, its heavily north American and European.

Also you said yourself that you're white so I'm not "diagnosing" you.

You also failed to read that I listed a category earlier of middle eastern/arab. I suppose I could include North African as well. So yeah in the census people from the middle east would be considered white but in the racial categories I listed, its a little more inclusive.

So are you done talking out of your ass now that I've proven you wrong?
