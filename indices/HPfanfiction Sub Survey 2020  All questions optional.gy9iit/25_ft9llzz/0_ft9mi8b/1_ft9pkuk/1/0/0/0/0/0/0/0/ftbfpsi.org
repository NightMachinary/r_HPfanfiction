The categories I would have for race are:

White Black Southeast Asian (India ect) East asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean ect) Biracial Middle eastern/Arab Native American Eskimo Polynesian/Pacific Islander Other Write in category

Ethnicity: Hispanic/Not Hispanic

That literally covers like 99% of people.

Trevor Noah can pick biracial or black, it probably wouldn't really affect the data all that much. Most people doing the survey are primarily from North America and Europe so at least 50% of people would classify him as black.

Almost no one doing the survey is even from Africa so your point is kind of moot. If like 5% of people have difficulty choosing their race then its still valid data.
