Obviously a lot of health disparities come from actual RACISM but you're literally ignoring that some disparities do literally come from genetics as you've mentioned and the above link.

Just because black women dying at higher rates isn't attributable to biological differences in race doesn't negate the fact that there are some issues that are attributable to genetic differences in race that aren't solely coming from socioeconomic factors.

idgaf if on a small amount of biracial people in south africa would check black or biracial. the fact of the matter is that only an extremely small amount of people taking this survey on the subreddit would actually be from south africa. therefore your point is moot.

obviously there's going to be outliers and you account for them if you know what you're doing.

Again, I have done actual research in the healthcare field regarding race differences so I know that it's an important question

How about you educate yourself on your privilege because I genuinely am interested to see the racial make up of the sub. I'm guessing it's overwhelmingly white but I can only guess because no one asked the question.

It's funny that the world of HP explores the theme of pureblood and muggleborn as a metaphor for race differences and yet a survey can't ask that question.

As a white person you don't have to think about race at all because you have systematic white privilege but when you're not white it does matter and so it's completely valid for me to be interested in it.

Stop quoting south africa as this extremely rare instance of someone not sure if they're biracial or black seeing as almost no one who did the survey actually comes from africa.
