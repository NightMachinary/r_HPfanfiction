I've been telling you about my lived experience, which is anecdotal, yes. You've been making up statistics about what race 99% of Americans believe I am, which is considerably worse, especially for someone who claims to be a statistician.

And I really hope you'd understand that just because a lot of people say something on a survey, that doesn't mean that thing is true. If most Americans say on some survey that the sun goes around the earth, that doesn't mean the sun goes around the earth. If most Americans confidently check some box for “race” on a survey, that doesn't mean that confidence has any basis in reality. Most Americans who check the box for “black,” for instance, would not be called black in South Africa. America defines blackness by the “one drop rule” where any sub-Saharan African ancestry at all makes someone black, even if most of someone's ancestry is ethnically northern European. Many Americans classified as black have coloring significantly lighter than mine.

I'm sure that most people, when filling out a survey, check the racial box that fits the local definition, which is fine for purposes like measuring local racism. You really need to understand how useless this local measure is in an international survey.

And wow, here comes the racism. There are major differences in health outcomes between different races in America, because of the RACISM in America, not because of biological racial differences. Except for a very few traits, like pale skin being linked to skin cancer and dark skin being linked to vitamin D deficiencies, there's no biological difference between races. There's no biological test to determine what race someone is. Racial categories have [[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/race-is-a-social-construct-scientists-argue/][no biological basis.]]

For instance, there's no biological reason for black women in the US to have a [[https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/u-s-finally-has-better-maternal-mortality-data-black-mothers-n1125896][maternal mortality rate]] that's two and a half times as high as the white maternal mortality rate. The cause of this disparity is that women who are seen as black get much worse medical care than women who are seen as white.
