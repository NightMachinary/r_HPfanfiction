I was referring to your claim that 99% of Americans would say I'm white. You made this claim despite having never seen me, and despite the fact that very many people have told me I'm not white. I'm white by US census standards, which calls North Africans white, although you say they're not white.

I'm still waiting for you to provide evidence to support your claim that 99% of people agree with you that I'm white. I don't care about your healthcare survey, other than to worry that it wasn't done properly, considering it was done by you.
