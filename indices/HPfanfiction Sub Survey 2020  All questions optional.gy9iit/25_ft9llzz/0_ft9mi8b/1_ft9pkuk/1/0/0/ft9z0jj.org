Where I was born, I wasn't “other,” I was unambiguously a particular race. Then I moved somewhere else, and suddenly I wasn't that race anymore according to local standards, which confused the heck out of me at first. People I considered to be the same race as me didn't accept me as one of them. They'd tell me I'd filled out the survey wrong if I tried to identify as the race I'd been assigned at birth. So what should I put on this survey?
