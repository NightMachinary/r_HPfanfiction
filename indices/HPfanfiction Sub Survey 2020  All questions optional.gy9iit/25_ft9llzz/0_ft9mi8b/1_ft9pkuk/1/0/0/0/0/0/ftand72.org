I think you're getting confused between race, ethnicity and nationality.

I know I'm gonna get downvoted for this but the only people that I've ever met who push back hard on racial categories and "there's only one race, the human race" are just white people.

You can be both hispanic and white. Or hispanic and just native would technically be the race. And honestly 99% of people can pick their race on say the US census.

And again, write in options are available
