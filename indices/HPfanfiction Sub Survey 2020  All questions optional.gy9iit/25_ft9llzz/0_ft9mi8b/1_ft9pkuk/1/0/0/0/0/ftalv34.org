I'm not biracial, according to the standards of where I'm from. Both my parents are the same race, according to those standards. I don't think either would qualify as that race in the place I moved to. I'm not sure if they'd count as the same race as each other there either. I didn't stay long enough to learn these distinctions. I have since moved to a place that uses the racial categorization system I grew up with.

The point you seem to be missing is that while people in different cultures have made up all sorts of different rules to sort humans into distinct racial categories, all these rules are completely arbitrary, and the rules from different cultures contradict each other. While there's some reason to survey race locally to, say, measure discrimination against a particular race in that particular area, attempting to do a worldwide survey of race is pointless.
