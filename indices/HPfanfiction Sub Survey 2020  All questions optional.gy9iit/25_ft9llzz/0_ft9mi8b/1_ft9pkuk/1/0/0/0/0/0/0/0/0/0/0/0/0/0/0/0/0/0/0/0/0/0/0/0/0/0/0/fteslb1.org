OK, if you want to say Arabs aren't white in your survey, go ahead. Europeans are white, North Africans aren't white. And you're certain that if you took pictures of, say, some North African farmers, and some Southern European farmers, 99% of the Americans you survey would be able to tell which of those farmers are white and which aren't. 99% of them would agree with your classification system instead of the federal one or the midwestern one, and 99% would sort these people into your preferred racial categories.

Where have you published the results of your survey? Since I'm very interested in seeing it.

Also, when did I say “race doesn't really determine experiences”? I don't remember saying that. Please copy and paste where I said that. What I did say is that people's perception of my race has a huge effect on my experiences. Where I'm perceived as white, I have white privilege. Where I'm perceived as non-white, I don't.
