If you really want to know the racial composition of the subset of this group that lives in North America, make your own survey to study that. Make up whatever classification system you like.

I've said that people in one place call me white, and people in a different place call me nonwhite. I'm not “really” any particular race, since all of these racial categories are arbitrary local opinions, not reflecting any underlying reality. Where I live now, I fit into the white category, since it's broad here, so I check the “white” box when asked.

If you think the US census is wrong to lump Arabs etc into the “white” race, go argue with the federal government. The point is right here, but you're still missing it. Even in the US, there are many different, contradictory systems of sorting people into races. You use one, the federal government uses a different one, the place I was born and the place I lived in my twenties use different systems. Which system should a survey in this international group use? Your personal favorite system? Why that one? Why is your favorite racial classification system better than anyone else's?
