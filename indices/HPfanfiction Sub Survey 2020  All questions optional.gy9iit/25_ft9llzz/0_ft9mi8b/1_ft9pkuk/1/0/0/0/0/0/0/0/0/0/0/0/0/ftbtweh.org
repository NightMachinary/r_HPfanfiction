I'd believe your comment if you were a metamorphmagus who did the experiment of living with every skin tone in every state of the union, and got those results. As it is, you're talking out of your ass.

Race is constructed very differently in different times and places. Just look at the history of [[https://theundefeated.com/features/white-immigrants-werent-always-considered-white-and-acceptable/][who's considered white]] in the US to see the various ways it's been defined.

I moved from a place in the US with a modern, inclusive definition of whiteness, to one with a narrower, old-fashioned definition. Neither of these definitions is more valid than the other. They're both used, in their respective locales, to discriminate against people who don't fit the local definition of white.
