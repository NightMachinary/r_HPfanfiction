You've been making claims this entire thread without backing them up and using only anecdotal evidence. Ive analyzed a lot of surveys before and guess what, of the people that answer only a small portion put "unknown" for race cuz its not a difficult fucking question.

And guess what there's major differences in biology and risk factors for diseases based on race and a bunch of hicks in the midwest calling you an outsider isn't going to change your biology.

Race really isn't defined that differently in parts of the US. You're just exaggerating your situation because you have a slight tan lol. It's kinda cute how you think you can count as a minority just because you have a tan.
