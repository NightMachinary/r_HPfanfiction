I didn't say I wouldn't put white on a survey. I said that how people define their race depends on their culture's definition of race. I did try to identify as white, persistently, and was repeatedly told that I shouldn't do that because I'm not really white. I think I may have been invited there in an attempt to make the organization more racially diverse, and people didn't appreciate me messing up their plan.

I have a ton of privilege in some parts of the US, and considerably less in other parts. It depends on whether I'm white by local standards, which is absolutely not guaranteed. I don't know where you got this idea that only a small minority of people are in my situation, or if we are a small minority, our experiences don't matter.

What would be the point of some percentage of people putting “white” on this survey? Much of the Midwest would look at that number and think that that percentage of this group is blue-eyed blonds. Much of the east coast would look at that number and think that that percentage of this group has ancestry from somewhere between Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, and North Africa. The survey results wouldn't actually contain the information people think they're getting.
