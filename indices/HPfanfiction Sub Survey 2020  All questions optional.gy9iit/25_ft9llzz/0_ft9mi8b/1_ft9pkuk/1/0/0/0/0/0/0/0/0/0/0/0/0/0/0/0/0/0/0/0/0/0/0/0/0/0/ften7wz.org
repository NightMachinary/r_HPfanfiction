I mean I'm fine with the US lumping Arabs into the white category. For the purposes of comparing groups for Harry Potter fanfiction reads id separate them because they probably have a different experience than white people with European roots.

You're just using your situation of anecdotal evidence to say that race doesn't really determine experiences and while yes obviously every has a different life, there are a lot of shared experiences that I have more so with asians than I do with white people even though my parents are white.

Yeah I'd love to do next year's survey since I have actual experience in survey design. At the very least I'd fix the age ranges.
