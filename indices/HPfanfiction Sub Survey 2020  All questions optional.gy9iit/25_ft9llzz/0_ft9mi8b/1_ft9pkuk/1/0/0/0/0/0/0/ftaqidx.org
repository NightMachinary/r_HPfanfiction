I'm giving this one more try. I don't want to use myself as an example, so I'll use a celebrity, like Trevor Noah. Go google him if you don't know who I'm talking about. What race is he?

In the US, almost everyone would look at him and say he's black. Cops would say he's black and treat him like they treat black people. If someone called the police to report him as a suspicious person in the park, they'd say he's black.

If people actually listened to him talk about his parents, or read his book, they might reclassify him as biracial.

In his native South Africa, he is definitely not black. Literally no one there would call him black. He was born in the race they called “mixed” which was illegal at the time, so he tried to pass for the different race they called “colored” which was believed to be a different race than “mixed.” Growing up, people in his neighborhood called him “white” because he was the lightest-skinned person there, and most people in that neighborhood had never seen a mixed or colored person, much less someone I'd call a white person.

Do you see the problem now? What race Trevor Noah is depends completely on where he is and who's doing the classifying, and what system of classification they're using. If he's in this group (Hi Trevor, if you're here!) and filling out this survey, what race should be put down? I think he's in NYC now, so should be put “black” according to local standards? Everyone in his native country would say that's wrong, he's definitely not black.
