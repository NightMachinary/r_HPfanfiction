Ok but literally either way you're still just white. I mean yeah there are literally some super racists who don't consider Italians to be white but on a survey literally any rational person in your specific situation would put white.

I'm asian and some asians would probably not consider me to be a real Asian cuz im adopted. That still doesn't change the fact that I put Asian on a survey. Its not some big philosophical question.
