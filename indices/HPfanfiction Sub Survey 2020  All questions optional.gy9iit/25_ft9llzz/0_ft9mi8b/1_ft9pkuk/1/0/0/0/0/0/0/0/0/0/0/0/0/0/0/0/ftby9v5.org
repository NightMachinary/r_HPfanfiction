You're in an extremely small minority of people who look white and wouldn't put white down on a survey. Either way, it wouldn't affect the data enough to fuck it up. Its a valid question to ask if the survey is asking for demographics.

And of course now we get to the part where "race is a construct" as usual being told to me by a white person who has a ton of privilege and benefits significantly from being white passing or in your case, actually white.
