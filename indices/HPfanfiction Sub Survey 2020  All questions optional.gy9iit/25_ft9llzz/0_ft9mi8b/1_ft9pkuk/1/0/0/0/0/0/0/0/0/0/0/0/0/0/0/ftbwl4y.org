There are entire midwestern states full of people who don't fit your definition of rational. I might agree, but it's not because their definition of “white” differs from mine. No definition of “white” is the correct one by any objective standard. They're all completely arbitrary.

People aren't born knowing what race they are. They pick up their culture's definition of race. If I'd stayed in my hometown, I'd definitely put “white” on surveys, because that's what everyone told me I was my whole life. If I'd been born in a different place and stayed there, with everyone telling me I'm not white my whole life, I wouldn't spontaneously invent the idea that I'm white and put that on surveys.
