You have “an actual degree in statistics” and you're saying that “99% of people in the US would consider you white.” Wow, you work fast, showing my photo to a statistically significant sample of Americans from all states and finding that 99% of them happen to agree with you. Do tell us your survey design. How big a sample did you survey? And where did you find my photo, anyway?

OK, “blue-eyed blonds” was an exaggeration, but you really do have to look like all your ancestors were from north Western Europe to count as white in parts of the Midwest. If you haven't been to those places, count yourself lucky.

I'm not talking about a couple of hicks being mean to me. I'm talking about a large university and the surrounding college town, either considering me entertainingly exotic, or accusing me of coming to this country to steal jobs from “real Americans.” Being born in this country apparently doesn't make me a “real American.” I got a lot of arguments like, “But you can't be an American; your skin's too dark.” That's a direct quote. I also got a lot of compliments on how well I speak English, and questions about how long I've been in this country, and when I'll be going back home. I've had years of experience being non-white in this country.

The difference, of course, is that I could leave and go back to a part of this country where I'm considered white. It's certainly a privilege to be able to do that, and I'm not denying it.

The subject here is survey design. I would certainly hope that you, with your “actual degree in statistics,” understand the problems with attempting to create a worldwide survey about something that's defined so differently in different places.
