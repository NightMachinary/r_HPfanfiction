I repeat, this is an international group. You don't have the authority to tell everyone to conform to American's peculiar racial categorization system when filling out a survey. Even if Americans are the majority here, that doesn't justify annoying the minority.

It's fascinating that you're confident enough in your racial categorization system that you feel confident in diagnosing me as white, despite the fact that you've never seen me, and also despite the fact that an entire town full of people would disagree with you. For years, many, many people considered me non-white, either while harassing me, or while using me as their token non-white friend.

OK, I'll shut up about South Africa and talk about white people. Officially, according to the US census's standards, people from the ethnic groups of North Africa are white. Most people from Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Libya, and Egypt are officially white, according to the US government. Do you honestly believe that if you did a survey of Americans, showing them pictures of typical-looking people from these countries and asking the survey question “Are these people white?” 99% of them would say yes?
