Literally almost every survey I've ever taken has a race question.

You ask race then you ask ethnicity (hispanic/not hispanic) because its not mutually exclusive

You can always have an "other" category or a write in category. I would really wonder how someone functions in the world if they get upset about a survey asking their race.
