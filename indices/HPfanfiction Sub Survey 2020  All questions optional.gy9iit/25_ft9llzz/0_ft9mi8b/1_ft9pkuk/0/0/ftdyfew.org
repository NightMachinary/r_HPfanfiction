I really fail to see how it would be so controversial since a major theme of Harry Potter is blood purity which is a thinly veiled metaphor for race.

You can recognize that there are differences in race without being a racist. And I personally as a non white person would be genuinely interested in seeing that question.

if white is over represented, i would wonder why when historically fanfiction has always been female dominated because it's only been until recently that more women have been able to give their perspective in TV and Movies.

Are there differences in the fics that POC write/enjoy reading? Maybe certain types of fics appeal more to POC because of lived experiences that many share

I don't see how the question is any more controversial than gender identity, sexuality or age.

Y'know, it's funny that JK rowling has been getting a ton of shit for not being inclusive. And i've only ever seen maybe two fics that have main character OC's that are non white.
