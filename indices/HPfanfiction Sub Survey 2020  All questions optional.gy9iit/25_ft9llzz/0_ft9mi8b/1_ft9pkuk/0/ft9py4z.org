People get upset about a lot of things, including being relegated to being considered "Other".

If I was doing a political survey, probably the controversy would be worth taking the risk, because being able to break down political data by race can give useful insight.

In a survey of fanfiction opinions, I am less convinced that there is a reason to wade into controversy.
