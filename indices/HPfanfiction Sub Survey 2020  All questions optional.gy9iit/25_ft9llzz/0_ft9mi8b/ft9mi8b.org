Because there's no way to do it without offending someone.

The problem starts with the fact that there are a great many races/ethnicities in the world, and the closer you look, the more differentiation there is. Races that might seem homogeneous to outsiders are often made up of many sub-groups who no not appreciate being conflated with each other.

So you have a choice:

1. List all races comprehensively. The resulting list would be so long that it would break the Google Forms results page, so you wouldn't even be able to read the results.

2. Be selective about what races you list. The decision about what to exclude is almost certainly going to offend someone.

On top of that, you have the additional issue of the existence of some races being highly contentious. The obvious example being "Hispanic". Many people in the US consider "Hispanic" a race. Meanwhile, many people in South America who Americans would call Hispanic consider themselves white and are offended by being called Hispanic - they consider it an act of European imperialism and arrogance to restrict whiteness to rich economies.

Now, the way individual nations manage to get around these problems when performing a national census is to talk about race according to the dominant consensus within their own borders. E.g. American census has Hispanic as an option, but Mexico's does not. And the way they get around needing a long list of every ethnicity in the world is to focus specifically on the most common groups within their borders. But this sub is an international community, and it does not make sense to design a survey from the perspective of a specific country - in particular, I am keen to avoid producing a survey which is either American-centric or Euro-centric.
