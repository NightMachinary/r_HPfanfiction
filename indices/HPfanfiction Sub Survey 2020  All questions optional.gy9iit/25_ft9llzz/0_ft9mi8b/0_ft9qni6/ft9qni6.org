Now that you mention it, I wonder how I'd report my race on an international survey. Since race is constructed differently in different places, I've been classified as different races in different places I've lived. I guess “How is your race classified where you're living right now?” would be a way to phrase the question, but some people might prefer to give the race they were assigned at birth.
