Well you have only two freed elves in canon I think. One is Dobby (but he is very different from any other elf) who tries but fails to find any job and ends up working (earning a salary) for Hogwarts. The other one is Barty Crouch's elf who spends her days at Hogwarts drunk and crying over her "failure" as a servant. But they don't have to be "bound" to a master to survive.
