^ This was the essence of the argument I was going to make. I think that if the question were framed in a way to clarify that there would be proper, gradual, systemic changes made towards eventually freeing the elves while helping them adjust, probably everybody would be in favor.

Given that the predominant house-elf response to freedom that we see in the books is disgust, it's not totally surprising that the gut reaction is just to do what the elves want and not assume the wizards know best like always - this was my own gut reaction, before I thought about it for a little longer and reminded myself that systemic change is a thing that exists. After all, even Dobby, who was free and wanted wages, felt the need to bargain Dumbledore /down/ to a galleon a week before starting work at Hogwarts.

I think the question itself is a really tough one to write in order to capture this nuance, though! I don't really know how I'd make it feel less like a leading question - perhaps something along the lines of "House-elves should be freed even if freedom makes them uncomfortable"? Still seems leading, but this time in the other direction. Point is, polls are hard, man - I wouldn't take a simple agree/disagree as an indictment of people's opinions.

Props to Taure for, as usual, putting together something thoughtful and comprehensive for us on this forum!
