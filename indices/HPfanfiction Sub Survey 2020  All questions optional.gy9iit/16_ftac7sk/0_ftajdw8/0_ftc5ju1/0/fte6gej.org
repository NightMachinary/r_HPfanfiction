House elves are ashamed of freedom. It's been ingrained into them that they are to be loyal to their families, and that setting them free is the ultimate punishment, probably worse than death. Shame is hard to change. Hermione is going to be in for a long-term project with the house elves.

There are probably also people who think that, since house elves are a magical species, maybe they really don't want to be free (with few exceptions), that's their true nature, and we're projecting our human viewpoint onto them. But that's too short-sighted, because they aren't actually a different species, it's literature, and literature doesn't exist in a vacuum, it's always connected to us, our culture and history.

I think that more than two possible answers would have given a more differentiated picture. Something like "Yes, free the elves immediately", "Yes, free them as part of long-term cultural change", "Free only the elves who want to be free", "No, they like being servants".
