Forcing Ron and Hermione to carry the idiot ball for an ENTIRE BOOK re: Malfoy almost made me angry enough to have blood pressure spikes. You're telling me the two most likely people to understand Harry's concerns about the horrible little shitbag are suddenly super peachy with giving that ferret the benefit of the doubt just because they haven't actually seen anything yet? I have so many issues with year six that I'm STILL having massive "white girl can't even" moments over it. The whole Malfoy thing is just the tip of the "Andi's bitching about Harry Potter again" iceberg that I'm pretty sure my husband is tired of slamming into.
