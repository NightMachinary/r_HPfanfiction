HBP was the calm before the storm, but it felt meh for me. Ron and Hermione not believing Harry that Draco was a Death Eater just doesn't make sense when both were present and fought Voldemort's Death Eaters at the Department of Mysteries and saw Lucius there. This is a guy that was chatting shit about Mudbloods dying and Cedric's death being the first of many to come.

The DA not continuing is another thing. They know Voldemort is back and the DA barely survived against the Death Eaters. Why would they not attempt to further learn how to defend themselves? Neville was tortured by Bellatrix, Susan Bones lost members of her extended family, Hermione almost died because of Dolohov's spell, they should all be continuing the DA instead of Hermione being jealous of Ron/Lavender or Neville being ashamed of not being able to continue with Transfiguration.

Voldemort doesn't make an appearance, which is kinda disappointing given that he's the antagonist. The worldbuilding in OOTP with the Aurors, the Order, and the Ministry isn't seen as well. The Order being a paramilitary force does nothing, the Aurors just capture Stan Shunpike and the Ministry is still concerned with optics instead of having contingency plans for Voldemort.
