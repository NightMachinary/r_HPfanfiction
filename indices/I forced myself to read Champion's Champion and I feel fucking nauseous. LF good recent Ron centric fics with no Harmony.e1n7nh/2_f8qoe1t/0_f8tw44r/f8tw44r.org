Exactly. Don't force yourself to read awful things. Honestly, the humor doesn't age and it's not particularly well-written as well.

I don't know. I think you'd enjoy a fic that makes fun of certain fanon tropes like Potter ever After. Hermione trying to hide Harry at her house and getting it burned down because death eaters can use phonebooks is pretty funny. Making fun of poor renditions of characters is always good for me.

I also think the first half of Rise of the Wizards has some great writing in the first half that makes it palatable (at least for the first half) despite quite a few cliches and yes, Hermione bashing. I mean seeing the misunderstandings escalate is just something you rarely see done. I think it also helps the author doesn't typically write Hermione in a bad light, so while she was bashed and I disagree with the reasons why about the degree of bashing, it was actually good writing.

But Champion of champions sticks to one joke repeatedly that wasn't really funny. Seventh Horcrux in comparison had a running gag with multiple takes and subtle jokes.
