I'm sorry you had to go through with that.

Though, why would you do that to yourself? Honestly, you dislike Harmony and Ron bashing, but you forced yourself to read though a fic that is for the most part Ron bashing with some Harmony sprinkled in.

Treat yourself better, I wouldn't force myself through some Hermione bashing Snarry.

If I had anything to give you, I would, but with my reading habits I would just be regurgitating something I saw on this subreddit. Again I am so sorry.
