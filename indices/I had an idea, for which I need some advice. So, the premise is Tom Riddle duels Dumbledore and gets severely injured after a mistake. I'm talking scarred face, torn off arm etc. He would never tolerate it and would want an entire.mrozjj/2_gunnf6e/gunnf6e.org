He's a Dark Lord and he's already experimented with Inferious to guard his Horcrux, right? You could write something exploring Dark Arts/necromancy and creating a new body or altering the body of a dead wizard to become his new vessel. It would be disturbing, but then if it wasn't a skin-crawling, taboo kind of magic we'd probably have seen the Gilderoy Lockharts of the magical world make themselves new bodies whenever they started to show signs of aging.

(I bet the more sycophantic Death Eaters would /volunteer/ to be their Lord's new host body, for extra creep factor)
