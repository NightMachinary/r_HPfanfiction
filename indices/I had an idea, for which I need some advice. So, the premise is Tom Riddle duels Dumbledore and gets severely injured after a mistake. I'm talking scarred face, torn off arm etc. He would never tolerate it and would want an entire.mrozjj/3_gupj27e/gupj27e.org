It's a difficult question since I think the motives behind it are not quite clear. Why would he want a new body? It isn't for functionality since he could conjure himself silvery appendages. I mean the books make it clear he isn't vain and a glamour could take care off his appearance making him look lile whomever he wanted for public's sake. (At least in established fanfic lore) Perhaps if he saw his injuries as a weakness, a sign of his defeat he might want to erase every trace of it.

I guess you could simply reuse the ritual he used in 4th year, arguing that since - unlike his temporary body kept alive by Naginis venom - his scarred body would keep him his good looks.

Of course there is also the way diary Tom Riddle absorbed Ginny's soul and life force and thus managed to manifest himself physically. Perhaps have him look for someone who willingly gifts him their soul or have him drain away someone's life power.

You could also make him alter the horcrux ritual, trying to rip out his whole remaining soul - perhaos it would include suicide - or suicide by proxy and make him possess someone. Perhaps the body of hiw muggle father whom he dug out of his grave and reinstated through necromancy/dark magic.

Skin transplantation - him cutting out the skin touched by magic with a knife and then replacing it by the samd part of some unfortunate victim, merging it with his own skin through magic, a la Frankenstein

Ohh another creepy idea would be if he did the same thing like Nagini in Deadly Hallows. He would seal himself into the body of a dead person whose looks he appreciates/or has transfigured to his liking. Unfortunately for him to be able to fight or something he has to rip himself out of it and fight in his own body. That would paint a truly gory picture
