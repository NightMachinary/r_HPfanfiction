  It must be canon.

I don't think JKR has written a Harry and Ron have an auror mission story. :(

If, however, you mean it must be canon /compliant/ I offer you A Stricken Lament linkffn(11269724) and Vows linkao3(3993565) Although in A Stricken Lament Harry is the boss, Ron has a different partner but it still a good read, so far at least.
