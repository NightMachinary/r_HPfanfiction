  The Ministry of Magic is proud to say there hasn't been a Dark Lord in ten years, thank you very much. They wish Britain would remember this and not panic over dead magical creatures and vanishing people. Still? Senior Auror Ron Weasley doesn't care what the public thinks. He just hopes that all might someday be well. ---Auror mystery, Harry-Ron friendship, and canon ships.
