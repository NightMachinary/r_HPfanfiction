Melindaleo's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11317075/1/These-Cuts-I-Have][These Cuts I Have]] and its continuation, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12787674/1/Some-Cuts-Leave-Scars][Some Cuts Leave Scars]], are reliably fantastic reads! linkffn(11317075), linkffn(12787674)

(I also want to recommend a great non-canon post-war fic called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/282139/1/After-the-End][After the End]] linkffn(282139), written and finished before The Order of the Phoenix came out. It follows Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, /and/ Sirius and Remus after Voldemort is defeated, and despite having been written before the last three books, the characters feel familiar and the repercussions realistic.)
