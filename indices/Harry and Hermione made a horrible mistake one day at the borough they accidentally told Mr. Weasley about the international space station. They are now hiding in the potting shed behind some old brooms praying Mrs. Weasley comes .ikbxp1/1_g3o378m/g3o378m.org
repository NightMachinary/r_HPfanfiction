It'd actually be pretty simple. Aguamenti gives you water, heat it up in a magic fuelless fire and send the resulting steam through a nozzle and you've got yourself a simple monoprop MTR engine running on limitless propellant. Acts the same as a normal rocket, just without the thousands of tons of highly explosive fuel and the unlimited delta-v cheat enabled. Strap that to the back of an existing flying car with attitude control, add a navigation system (maybe based on the Marauders's Map) that can tell you position and velocity in 3 dimensions, off the shelf programmable solar powered calculator for orbital mechanics, super-sized bubble head charm around the entire car for air, and that should be capable of reaching the ISS, Hubble, and if the engine has enough thrust even the lunar surface in only around a day. For reaching other planets you'd probably want something larger, more comfortable because it'd take a week or so. Other stars would still be years away with a magic rocket, you'd need a completely different system for FTL.
