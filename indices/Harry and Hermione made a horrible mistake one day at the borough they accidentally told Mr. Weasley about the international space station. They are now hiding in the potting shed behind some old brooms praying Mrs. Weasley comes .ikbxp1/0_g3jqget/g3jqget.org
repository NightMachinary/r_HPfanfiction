You have a history of deleting old posts that you feel did not receive enough attention and reposting them. This is a repost, although unfortunately I cannot link to your previous post because reddit apparently does not save deleted posts in one's saved section despite the fact that links to them would still work.

There is nothing inherently wrong with this. However, given that every time you repost you make the exact same glaring grammatical errors that render a prompt illegible, I'd feel that this subreddit (judging from the previous responses to my past requests) would appreciate if you took the time to edit in the future. As always, I will provide an edit to your post title below. You can simply delete and repost with the edited title. I would be more than happy to edit your posts in advance in the future as well.

To reiterate myself, I see nothing wrong with a repost, so long as you edit the repost which you've clearly spent large amounts of time on. These are major glaring errors. Borough and the Burrow are very different unless you do mean an administrative unit of a city.

  Harry and Hermione made a horrible mistake one day at the Burrow; they accidentally told Mr. Weasley about the international space station. They are now hiding in the potting shed behind some old brooms praying Mrs. Weasley comes back from the market soon because no one wants to explain rocketry again.
