The good: An interesting concept detailing different cultures clashing in multiple different ways. Could provide a very interesting look into societal advancements.

The odd: I have a hard time picturing a northern Wisconsin-Irish woodsman with a superiority complex. I'm all for subverting troupes but it will be very hard to write a believable character that has lived in that environment for his entire life, is a working class likely no-nonsense type that truly believes himself superior. He's likely been around and understands those cultures and hasn't sat back in a manor wondering why everyone isn't as good as him. It'll probably be excellent if you can make that character with those motivations come off as a real, but that's going to be very, very difficult to write.

The whole notion of 'leaving the cities' is kinda anti the time period you put it in. In fact, you're talking probably around 1880-1885 assuming the protagonist is old enough. I think it would be better served set pre civil-war for what your last paragraph puts it in.

Of course, I also thing there could be a fascinating story about the clash between the wizarding world and the Industrial Revolution. But that's not establishing new laws or governments, because by the 1890s that's pretty much set up. Especially in the Midwest.
