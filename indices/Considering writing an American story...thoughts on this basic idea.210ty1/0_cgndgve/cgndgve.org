I've also often wondered about Wizards in America. I'll never write it so here are my ideas on US Wizard School story.

- A yellow VW Beetle driven by a Squib or Wizard picks the kids up for school
- The wizarding school is disguised as a large Pennsylvania or similar east-coast farm complex.
- A sport more like baseball, but with magical elements.

You seem to be going more for the origins of America though. Good luck.
