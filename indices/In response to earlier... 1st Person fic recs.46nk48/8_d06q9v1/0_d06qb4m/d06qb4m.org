[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1171672][*/Professor C. Binns: A Personal History/*]] by [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/PurpleFluffyCat/pseuds/PurpleFluffyCat][/PurpleFluffyCat/]]

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

  Long before Harry's time, there was a Christmas play at Hogwarts. But it all went horribly, horribly wrong. The whole sorry saga caused emotional trauma lingering to this day, and otherwise sane teachers still shudder at the thought. Here's the carefully researched True Story.
