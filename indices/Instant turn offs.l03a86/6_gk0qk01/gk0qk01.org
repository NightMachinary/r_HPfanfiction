I actually like sentient hogwarts when its shown to be a distinctly Non-Human sentience, like a magical version of an AI or a genis loci. But some things that are a turn off fic wise would be Slash in general, fics that have literal 12 year olds try/succeed in gangraping another 12 year old or rape as a plot device in general, obviously bad grammar in the summary, too many overly specific tags, when crossover fics take the mc(Harry Potter) and replace him with someone completely different but keep the name and fics where less than 50% of the pov is Harry and/or following Harry's tale, the fandom is called Harry Potter not Ron Weasley not Draco Malfoy not Hermione Granger and certainly not Severus Snape.
