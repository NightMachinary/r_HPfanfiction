Snape was a teenager too when he joined the Death Eaters. A bullied teenager who lived in a dorm for roughly 10 months out of the year with racist kids who, presumably, at some point decided to recruit him to their cause. So, he was a bullied teenager who has just lost his only friend, had a shit home life, and suddenly found his dorm mates being inclusive toward him despite the fact that he had (in their view) a less than ideal bloodline. I can't imagine Death Eaters start their recruiting by saying “hey, we're going to be mass murdering terrorists, want to join?” They were likely able to very very persuasive when they wanted to be, and Snape would have been a very vulnerable target to them.

And then, after a few years, he left and risked his life working against them despite the fact that the “good” people pretty much universally despised him.

I'm not saying Snape is a good person. He's not. He's a grey character, and was designed to be a grey character. He did both good and bad things in his life and was aware that he made many mistakes.

But if you honestly think that a bullied teenager, who lived in poverty, had shitty parents, and never got any help from authority figures, who ended up joining a group that was on the opposite side of his worst bullies is completely irredeemable, I'm a bit concerned about what you think about all of the teens in real life who end up joining gangs in similar circumstances.

People aren't just good or bad. They can be complex and self-contradictory and can be victims of their circumstances. This doesn't absolve him, but dismissing him outright as a shit person for joining the Death Eaters is shortsighted and lacks an understanding of social pressures and the urgency one can feel to better their life when all they've known is despair.
