Which he then left, and died fighting. Sirius sent Snape to his death, I'm of the opinion that 12 years of emotional torture is probably enough of a punishment but that doesn't change what was done. Remus deliberately hid information that would aid in the capture of Sirius, he did not tell anyone even after Sirius had broken into the castle. He was brought in specifically because he knew Sirius and could aid in his capture, but he never shared. These are not minor problems. These are personality flaws that are actually on the same level with those that Snape has.

I like bashing generally, but it irritates me when bashing comes at the expense of the characters actual flaws, The Marauders are flawed characters, just like Snape. They get into the most grey area anyone in the series gets to, so I'm generally annoyed when I see any of them propped up while the others get the shaft. Besides I think Snape bashing is generally pretty bad. He had a specific MO when it came to tormenting Harry, and it annoys me when people forget about it for a cheap "Haha I'm the greatest" moment. For a non-Snape example, would you like it if a Hermione bashing story made her big character flaw that she went around stealing stuff, as opposed to say, her desire to be the best? It's a new character flaw, which I would argue is less interesting than the original. That's how I generally feel about Snape bashing.
