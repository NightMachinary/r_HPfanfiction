My point is that they are all flawed characters. Snape did some good in the end, the Marauders did some bad. I don't like the idea of painting characters without flaws and without redeeming features. It makes the characters less human than they should be. This doesn't make bashing bad. I just think the caricature should come from their real negative traits.
