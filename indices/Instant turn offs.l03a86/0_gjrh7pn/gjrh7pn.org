Not acknowledging that the whole Snape and James situation was complicated.

Instead portraying Snape as the poor innocent victim and it's totally James' fault that he became a Death Eater and James is an abusive asshole who totally didn't deserve Lily and probably potioned her and Snape is her true love and...
