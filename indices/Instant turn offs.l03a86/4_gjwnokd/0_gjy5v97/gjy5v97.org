Not only that but Hogwarts has been in service as a school for a long time and was enchanted/founded by some very interesting people.

My headcannon is that Hogwarts isn't really sentient, but has 'Direction.' When the diary was on the loose with the Basilisk running around, all those people got stoned instead of killed, which unless the diary was specifically aiming for that, is a huge coincidence. I like to imagine the castle's 'keep students safe' enchantment was subtly nudging things the whole time. Oh, a water puddle! Oh, shift this ghost a little to stone them both, etc.
