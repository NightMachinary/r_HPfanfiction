Totally understandable! Fanfics are supposed to be something that helps the reader, be it simply for entertainment, for escape, or in some cases, processing real life grief or trauma. I'm not surprised that this story would be upsetting for some.

To be honest I had almost forgotten to put the CW on the front of my review, but after reading your comment I'm glad I didn't forget it.
