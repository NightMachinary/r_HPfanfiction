I remember reading that, and I wish I didn't. Nothing wrong with it, but if I had read the descriptions more thoroughly I think I would have passed.

I hate the thought that people could subject a child to that kind of emotional abuse. I definitely hate any real world parallels. As someone who reads fanfic as a form of escapism, that story felt way too real.

Was quality fanfic, just not my cup of tea at all.
