Huh, not sure what you mean by intellectually engaging? If I'm following your train of thought correctly, you're looking for something possibly a little more literary and a little less instantly gratifying, with some depth to it?

Try linkffn(A Squib at Hogwarts) - brilliantly written, short, and atmospheric.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick]] is really high-quality, probably takes some engagement to sympathize with the protagonist since for some she's not instantly likable. The characters are really complex and take some time to engage with. If you liked Pureblood Pretense you should like this series, it's a little less explicitly written but really well crafted.

For me I found linkffn(Forging the Sword) similar to but better than OTWTG - had much stronger thematic cohesion and was also better written. The character development is really good, and what's extremely impressive is the author's command of the flow of the material from a single point of divergence. Really asks some questions of the direction Rowling took.
