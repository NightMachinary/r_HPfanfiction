You could try linkao3(Train To Nowhere) which is exceptionally well written. It's very AU but I think it fits your criteria? There is a lot to unpack, and while it's often quite slow moving in terms of action, it is still constantly engaging.

Also linkao3(The Ghost of Privet Drive) which is a sort of self insert? It's complete, which is a plus. And is very well written and fun while also playing with some interesting concepts. It felt like it went off the rails a bit at the end. But I really enjoyed it for its originality.
