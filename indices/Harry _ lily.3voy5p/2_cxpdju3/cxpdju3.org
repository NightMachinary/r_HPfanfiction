Thank god you are not asking for Harry/Lily pairing.

There are plenty of good Harry meeting Lily stories. My favorite is *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855). In this one, Harry went back to 1975 and turned Bellatrix. The story is creative, credible, funny, and contains tons of intrigues. [[/spoiler][There are lots of actions involving the Marauders, including Lily competing against Bellatrix for Harry's affection]]

Another one of my favorites is *Stages of Hope*, linkffn(6892925). Here Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Luna travelled to an alternate dimension in which things were significantly better. The last third of the story was basically written in Lily's POV.
