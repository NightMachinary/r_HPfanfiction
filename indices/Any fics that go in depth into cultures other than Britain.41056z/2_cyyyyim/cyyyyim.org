In "Patron" I've got French and Bulgarian cultures , some stuff on Jamaica and an upcoming excursion into the Magical Ottoman Empire, but most of the "culture focus" is on the AU Wizarding Britain. Though since it's very different from canon (it's much more progressive and liberal in some places than muggle Britain, and at the same time more archaic though tempered by custom in other areas) it might also qualify as "culture other than Britain".
