  "Leave with me, now!" Severus Snape yelled at the golden trio in the middle of their hunt for Horcruxes. Join them as they travel to Cape Breton, Canada to hide from the Dark Lord and devise a new plan of attack. They soon realize that living as muggles, under a new system of laws, is more challenging than anticipated. A North American Marriage Law AU story with a twist.
