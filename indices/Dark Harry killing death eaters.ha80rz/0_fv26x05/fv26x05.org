I like this prompt. Here, have a little scene I wrote for a confrontation between Dumbledore and this Harry :D

--------------

Two men were standing across from each other, wands loosely in hand but stances betraying tension.

One was old, the notion of him on a battlefield such as this so dissonant one would have to shake their head at it. The other was young, younger than even the youngest soldiers. A child, really, but his eyes... they were those of a merciless killer. No madness was found in them, no, instead only cold determination.

Between them, behind them, all around lay corpses strewn. Most simply dead by mortal wounds, slashed throats or chopped flesh, but some were burned, others seemed to be dried out, or swollen. A few were barely skeletal, and the rest bore ever more extreme warpings upon their flesh.

"Harry." said the older man, his conversational tone alone capable of causing another bout of dissonance, were there any around to witness it beside the two.

"Dumbledore. Are you here to stop me? Prevent my revenge?" replied the other, his voice tainted by malice. It had a raspiness to it, like someone who smoked too much, and he scratched a faint scar crossing his neck.

"No, I am not. You've worked hard for it, and I am still a teacher. Gravely disappointed I may be in your choices, they still led to the victory I was hoping to see before my twilight years." At the word /choices/, he swept his other hand about, indicating the disfigured bodies.

"You don't care? About the torture, the killing?" One of the 'bodies' proved to have held on to life, only to be silenced with a complex gesture performed in its direction. There was the unmistakeable, sharp /Crack/ of bones, and the man's head slumped to the side, twisted away from its shoulders.

"Harry... If this were the first of Tom's followers you had murdered, I would still hold out hope. But I've heard the whispers on the wind, read the stars. Times are changing, and you are responsible. I would do everything in my power to protect your soul, but alas... well, if I thought absolution was still possible, we wouldn't be having this conversation." The colors around them became more vivid - the snow gleamed in the moonlight, red blood glowing scarlet where it marred the ground, the shadows deepening into an unnatural darkness. Then, it was gone again.

"I see."

"Indeed. Harry, how many have you murdered? Do you know who remains at Tom's side?"

"I know Bellatrix is still alive. Luring her out was my next goal, she must pay for her crimes. I'd thought about stunning her and sending her to Augusta, but she's a crafty one. She might escape." While talking, he had begun to pace, clearing a path through the bodies to avoid stepping on them. Finally, he stood with his back to the older man, waiting for his response.

"A logical deduction. A witch of her caliber always has some tricks up her sleeve, and in her madness, she has become unpredictable, and therefore dangerous. It would be more prudent to end the threat before it can continue growing any larger."

"Did you just... ?" he turned back, but the old man was gone.
