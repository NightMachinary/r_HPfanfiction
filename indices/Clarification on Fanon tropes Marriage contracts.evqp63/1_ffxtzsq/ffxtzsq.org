Basically, make everyone entirely unmotivated.

- Some random ancestors made a marriage contract about children they didn't have because, ... because why not.
- This contract definitely can't be broken and does not expire, because, ... well, just because.
- It so happens that after 527 years, now is the first time that the conditions apply, and it's Harry and Daphne because, ... I mean, the author wants them to hook up, so there.

I think that about covers it?

Or did you mean in a historical sense. In that case, they were drawn up for the purpose of alliances. Family A has a daughter, they want to win influence in family B, so they (meaning, fathers -- children naturally don't have a say) draw up a contract stipulating the marriage of daughter A to son B when they are old enough. The idea is that nothing creates stronger bonds than family -- which, incidentally, is why the notion of creating a contract when no offsprings to marry off are around, until some indefinite time in the very far future, makes absolutely no sense at all. The point is not the contract, it's the marriage.

And obviously, contracts can be dissolved if both sides agree they should. If only one side wants out, they can try to buy their way out, or, if they just break it (depending on what kind of legal system you have -- from sophisticated to none) pay a fine or invite some more hands-on response to restore honour.
