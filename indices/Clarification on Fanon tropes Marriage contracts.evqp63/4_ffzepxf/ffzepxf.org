There are two purposes of marriage contracts in fanfiction (AFAIK):

1. Create some unrealistic pairing, just because the author wants it (e.g., Dramione), I don't know much about the stuff, because I try to keep myself as far away from it as possible.

2. Show how the British magical regime is completely corrupted, and the main hero/heroine/Hermione should stay away from it. Example would be linkffn(11916243), which is quite decent, except the main pair is insufferable ([[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/review-of-escape-and-mr-and-mrs-percy-weasley.html][my full review]]).
