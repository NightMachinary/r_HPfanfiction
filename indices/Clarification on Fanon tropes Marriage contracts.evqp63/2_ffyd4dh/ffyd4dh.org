Penalties can be anything: economic, social, magic, life, etc. We have magic to arbitrate this, so go nuts.

Most of the riders can be anything, because they are mostly used as treaties/agreements.

There's two types I've seen for the "A wild Marriage Contract Appears!":

- "There's no way in hell this is ever going to happen, the treaty is done, we're happy." (spoiler alert: it happens to both protagonists of this fic!)
- They actually want it to happen, but the stars haven't aligned yet.

The most agreed common concept I've seen requires the Ancient and/or Noble family system. Family A wants to enter an treaty/agreement with Family B. They don't have any eligible members for an equitable marriage, so they make up a contract and post it for POSSIBLE members/heirs down the line.
