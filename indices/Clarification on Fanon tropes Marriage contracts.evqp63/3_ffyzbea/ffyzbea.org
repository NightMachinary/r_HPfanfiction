You can, of course, change it however you like, but most that I've seen go something like this:

- Marriage contracts are almost exclusively used by (Ancient and) Noble families, and while some may consider the practice archaic those who follow it and those who don't isn't always based on which houses are "light" or "dark."

- The heads of family get together at some point to create a contract between the families. Usually in fics, at a certain age a child of the house (usually the heir) is encouraged to start looking for a partner. The head of the family may provide them with a list of suitable options, or more likely give them free reign as long as their chosen partner is approved of.

- In writing up the contracts, the biggest focus tends to be on how inheritance is handled. There may be a clause dictating the must have /x/ number of children, usually to ensure there is always a heir for each family line -- this is ecspecially emphasized if each family only has the one heir with which to continue their line. It can also include how money is managed, whether vaults are combined, etc.

- Then there is the inevitable sub-trope: the surprise contract that our protagonist suddenly gets dumped on them. One example would be the ancient, magically binding contract between two families that for this reason or that has not kicked in until now, which is somehow the first time in centuries that the conditions have been met. The second is that a charector's parents had a contract drawn up when they were first born, and they only find out about it when they come of age. In both these situations the story almost always plays out with one or both of the parties involved being rather jaded by the situation but coming to fall in love. These stories are tricky to pull off, but when done well can be pretty great. It throws together two charectors who suddenly have to develop and get to know each other.

Interestingly, except for in the case of the last one these contracts tend to be rather voluntary. Often times the protagonist must get married but who they choose is more or less up to them. Not always, of course, but it's interesting to play around with. I've read a lot more where the love comes before the contract.

A while back I read an interesting Harry/Daphne fic with a contract but for the life of me I can't seem to find it anywhere. Perhaps someone else can point you in the right direction? From what I remember, the Potter and Greengrass families created a contract a couple of generations back as part of buissness deal. The terms have finally been met, and Daphne is now bethrothed to Harry. The interesting thing was that since the contract was written some buissness fell through or what not, essentially meaning that Harry would get everything and they get almost nothing. The twist is that Harry can simply agree to dissolve the contract... But he doesn't. He kind of comes off as a dick at first since Daphne is clearly (and vocally) uncomfortable and angry with the entire situation but he doesn't back down.

Some interesting world building and charector development if I remember it correctly. Might be a good one to look at if you want to explore the technical and/or economic ramifications of the trope.

Also, almost every fic in this trope is Harry/Daphne.
