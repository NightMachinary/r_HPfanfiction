As far as my understanding of them goes, marriage contracts were the historical precedent for what are now prenuptial agreements.

They would have been used between the groom's family and the bride's to establish the distribution of resources. Generally something along the line of a bride price or the bride's dowry.

Like most contracts, there are penalties for breaking them. Extramarital affairs might be penalized or if a child was not produced within x time of marriage.

In theory, any rider could be stipulated in the contract so long as the parties agreed to them or if there were snuck into the fine print.
