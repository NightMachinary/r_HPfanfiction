Usually the contract is set up between two peoples parents or other ancestors (With no two people able to fulfill it the contract remains until it can be). The trope usually comes with the Lord Potter thing as well and the contracts are used to make alliances with other families. The punishments for breaking it can include things like forfeiting your title and place on the Wizengamot to the offending family as well as a sum of money. (This is why the Weasley's are so oor despite being an old pureblood family.) Sometimes there is a set age where they have to have children/get married etc. Usually the males family pays the brides family also but not always.
