I read something a bit like this once. Hogwarts was mad at Harry for some reason and made getting anywhere really difficult. Tripping, rearranging his positioning inside the castle, the moving staircaises, activating non-convinient secret passageways and stuff like that. Harry stuck like glue to other students to get to casses on time.
