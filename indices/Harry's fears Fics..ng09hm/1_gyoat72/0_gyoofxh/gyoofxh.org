If you don't want to go through the entire fic, it's at the end of Chapter 50.

  Harry looked at the boggart which had currently been turned into a clown. Harry wondered what the boggart would turn into, he didn't have any fears that he was aware of. Darkness, water, heights and so on didn't bother him. Harry wasn't scared of any animals either, of course if they attacked him then he'd be scared in the moment but after or before that he would be fine. So what would it be?

  Harry watched as the boggart shifted, it grew wider and taller, and it grew a mustache.

  "Uncle Vernon?" Jet asked in a confused voice. Standing in front of Harry was his Uncle Vernon, face purple with anger, belt wrapped around his hand.

  "Of course," Harry sighed as he closed his eyes. "of course it would be you." Harry said, he opened his eyes and glared at the source of many of his nightmares. Harry raised his wand and aimed it at him. "Riddikulus." Harry said, a beam shot out of his wand and hit the boggart, in front of the whole class it shapeshifted, but they were all rather suprised when it turned into Ron Weasley.

  "Mr Potter?" Professor Lupin spoke in a questioning voice.

  "You said something funny," Harry shrugged. "pathetically funny counts." Harry said before he turned and walked off, once again walking past a red faced Ron Weasley.

For context, it's a Slytherin Harry fic with the kind of bashing you can expect from this author. It's not a bad fic, from what I remember, but it might not be everyone's cup of tea. Jet is Harry's snake familiar.
