Harry takes an iron ball moving a 150 MPH+ to the skull and only cracks it. He then falls off his broom and survives with that cracked skull. Wizards definitely have the resiliency to survive bullets.

Indeed, surviving bullets is not a rarity in the real world either. It's not like in the movies where you get shot once in the chest and you die instantly. Even lethal shots into the brain may not disable an attacker.

I would also caution you against reconciling scientific models of the world and magical models of the world. Magic overrides these "mundane" models in the HP books. Spells are not related to muggle ideas of energy. Conjuration of water alone is a massive amount of energy, as much as and greater than nuclear weapons. It's clear that magic does not operate under muggle scientific models of the world in HP. As another commenter mentioned, Dresden is a great book series where magic does operate under scientific models of the world.

Instead, magic overrides the mundane in HP. When Dumbledore transfigures something, he changes the nature of the object. He doesn't exert energy on the object to change its chemical bonds and atomic orientation. Magic is conceptual.

Muggle firepower is always at a disadvantage against wizards.

Bullet? Bomb? Nuclear bomb? A shield charm works. Or they can apparate. Or they can employ a myriad of other spells.
