I think you are overstating just how far magic augments someone, It obviously does to some degree otherwise Dumbledore would not have managed a perfect breaststroke at age 115. This is especially true if you decided to take the phrase "perfect breaststroke" literally, and not harry just being inexperienced. If you're doing it properly and pulling your upper body out of the water on each breath, it takes a lot of strength and endurance to keep going.

All that said a sniper round not even penetrating his skin is ludicrous. If wizards were even remotely that durable then the troll in book 1 would have been either been a non-threat OR so have muscles so strong that levitating and hitting it with it's own club would have done nothing but annoy it.
