The Dresden Files has some fun with this. Dresden says the best way to kill a wizard is with a sniper rifle. He's dead before he hears the shot and can get defenses up.

Then you have a Warden (think Auror) luring a nigh-immortal monster into a nuclear testing ground and apparating away just before the boom.
