I was thinking on the same lines, only in reverse, like, what kind of muggle firepower would you need to take down a wizard? For an average hogwarts student, a bullet would do. The bullet travels just to fast to be able to cast any sort of protection. For an average auror, i think a guided bomb would do the trick, for voldemort, dumbledore&grindelwald, a small nuclear bomb, and for merlin, maybe one of the biggest nuclear bombs, like tsar bomb or something, i think no matter what spells you know and are able to cast, the intense heat, pressure and radiation will kill you eventually.
