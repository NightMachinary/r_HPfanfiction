linkffn(Rebuilding) is dramione but Pansy is in there as a full character.

I see someone already mentioned provocative-envy and you should definitely check her out. Great ones involve linkao3(Chaos Theory) and linkao3(Greenwich Mean Time) but I would also recommend checking out her [[http://provocative-envy.tumblr.com/pansy][tumblr]].

Also [[http://slytherinsqueen.tumblr.com/tagged/fic%20rec][this]] is a list of Pansy fics.
