she was a blood supremacist and you can coherently characterise her as an anti-black racist because of her comment to angelina. and just a bully in general. i think the point from jkr's perspective is that while draco was uncomfortable with murder, stopped being a blood supremacist and mellowed out in his later years, pansy remains a bully and probably never had a problem with evil? she doesn't really deepen her characterisation like she does with +her male characters+ draco
