  I mean, what did the girl do that was so bad?

Not much at all, but she didn't do anything that was /not/ bad either. So while Draco did much worse stuff, he got to show character traits that went beyond 'petty bully' and was humanized, while Pansy remained a caricature of the schoolgirl bully with no positive traits at all. JKR doesn't hate Pansy because she's a schoolyard bully, she hates Pansy because that's /all/ she is.

Of course, you can always give her sympathetic traits in fanfiction. Most go the 'scared kid' route, which just makes her an inferior version of Draco. I remember enjoying linkffn(Monochromatic by Provocative Envy). Really good writing.
