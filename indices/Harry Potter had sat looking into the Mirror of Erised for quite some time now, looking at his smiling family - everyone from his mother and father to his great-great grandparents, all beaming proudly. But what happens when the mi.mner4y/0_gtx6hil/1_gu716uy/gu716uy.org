I have a personal head-cannon that the Mirror of Erised is actually Solomon's Mirror, which along with his ring, allegedly allowed King Solomon to command "all the unclean spirits of the earth," as well as to conjure and command the loyalty of fallen angels.

So the idea that Dementors were born out of the mirror, actually works quite well. Either way, I can't imagine something stepping out of the mirror would bode well.
