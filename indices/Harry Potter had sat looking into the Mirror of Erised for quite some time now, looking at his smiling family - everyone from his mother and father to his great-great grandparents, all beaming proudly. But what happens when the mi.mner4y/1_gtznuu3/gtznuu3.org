Harry blinked rapidly, trying to focus on the mirror's glass in front of him instead of his family in it's image. The glass rippled again, ever so slightly, like the giant squid fathoms below the surface of the black lake.

One more subtle shimmer, and then the slight imprint of Lily's hand on the other side of the glass. She pushed, her palm flat and squished as the mirror started to bend.

Harry was transfixed by the image, the scene, the opportunity to actually meet family that had loved him. Lily's hand pushed through the mirror to her elbow, but the glass held its form, if not its shape, coating her skin in a fine, crystalline glove.

Harry gulped, nervous and eager, the sound of his heart racing in his ears. The echoes of cracking glass, splintering and shattering tinkled in the back of his mind as Lily's face pressed hard against the other side. She had her arm through the mirror to her shoulder, slowly and carefully reaching for what she couldn't see with her face as smooshed close as she could get it.

"Mum?"

Harry whispered in the dark, and Lily's arm stilled immediately. She jerked back in shock, and then immediately her head and other arm joined the first as she reached through the mirror like a window directly towards Harry.

She mouthed something he couldn't understand, still in shock, and then made grabbing motions with both arms, calling him towards her. He was only a step away from her, just outside her reach, and with one final deep breath Harry stepped into his mother's glossy arms.

The hug was nothing he'd ever imagined it could be, and countless more things he would have vehemently denied had anyone asked. Cold and hard as the glass that covered every bit of her through the mirror, impermeable to the tears just leaking from the corners of his eyes, strangely positioned and and as foreign an experience as anything he'd ever felt before, Harry just grabbed his mum's back and surrendered to the hug.

One long blink later, when Harry's pulse had settled and his tears had dried, Harry opened his eyes in a field amongst his family. The room, dark and silent as it ever was, retained no evidence of the night save the few footsteps in the dust and the partly closed door they trailed in from.
