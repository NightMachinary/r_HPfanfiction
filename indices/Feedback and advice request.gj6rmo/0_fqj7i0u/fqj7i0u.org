That's an interesting point actually. How did Hagrid know to go to the Dursleys? Well. It's possible Sirius contacted Dumbledore about the Potters' death, and Dumbledore sent Hagrid to get Harry while he went ahead with McGonagall to secure the street at Little Whinging.

And then, after settling the situation with Harry, Sirius gifts his motorbike to Hagrid because he knows he's probably going to Azkaban forever for this, but he feels like he absolutely has to avenge his friends by murdering Peter, which, you know. Doesn't end up really working out for him, though the end was the same.

Not sure if this analysis is what you were looking for, but those are my thoughts.
