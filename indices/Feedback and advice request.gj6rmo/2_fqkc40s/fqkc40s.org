This event is where a lot of the manipulative/evil Dumbledore stories get some of their justification. Remember that Hagrid stated that he was told to bring Harry to Dumbledore. That means that Dumbledore knew something had happened to the Potters and rather than going himself he sent Hagrid.

So this implies that Dumbledore was monitoring the Godrics Hollow house and when the attacks occurred rather than the "only wizard that Voldemort fears" showing up to protect/help the Potters he sends Hagrid who was kicked out of school (eg did not finish his education) and only had his broken wand in his umbrella (which suggests that he could only do less powerful spells eg he wouldn't be able to magically battle any deatheaters).

It is never explained how Dumbledore knew that something happened nor why he didn't go himself instead of sending Hagrid.
