I read that differently to you. To me that doesn't spell automatically that Dumbledore knows about this particular spell and it is banned it specifically but that is it part of a whole general subject range Dumbledore hates.

Not there is a rule of "don't inquire about horcruxes" in the Hogwarts rulebook but "all 'soul magic' is banned on pain of Binns-ing".

Not that Dumbledore would immediately know what is being talked about when he hears the word "horcrux" but that once he heard the word it is expected to be trivial /for him/ to research the rest.

And there still remains the fact that the Harry-horcrux differed significantly from what was known of horcruxes and thus might have been misidentified as some magic effect.
