  We definitely know that Dumbledore knew before fourth year. There is a moment when Harry is telling Dumbledore what happened at the graveyard and Dumbledore looks happy when Harry gets to the part of his blood being used in the ritual. It means that Harry has a higher probability of not dying when Voldemort killed him cause his blood in Voldemorts veins is tying him to the mortal plane (or smth like that).

This holds whether Harry is a horcrux or not.
