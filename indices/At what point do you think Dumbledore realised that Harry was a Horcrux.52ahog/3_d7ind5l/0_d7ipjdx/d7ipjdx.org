I think you're right.

In HBP, didn't Dumbledore tell Harry that he only realized Voldemort had started making Horcruxes after he saw the diary? Dumbledore had seen that first Horcrux, and guessed that if Voldemort treated it so lightly then there must have been more.

Dumbledore then realized that if Voldemorts soul was so fragile, a part easily could have broken off onto Harry. Since this theory depended on already knowing how fragmented Voldermorts soul was, he could only have figured it out after he realized Voldemort had been making Horcruxes left right and centre.

That would mean the earliest he could have realized Harry was a Horcrux was the end of CoS.

He might have had a shadow of an idea when he found out Harry could speak Parseltongue, though.
