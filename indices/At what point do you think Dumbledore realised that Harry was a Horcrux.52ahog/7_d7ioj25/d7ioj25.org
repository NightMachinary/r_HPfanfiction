I think he knew defenetly that there's some link between Voldemort and Harry. But he wasn't sure 100% about Voldemort having Horcruxes or even what they are until later in Harry's school years. Pretty positive, it was around Harry's year 5 when Dumbledore done more research / started looking for clues, and also avoided Harry. He was like 85% sure, but didn't know what it means for Harry, for Voldemort and what to do at all.

I think people also understimate how rare is the info about Horcruxes. There were no indication, that anyone before Voldemort tried to create more than one, and if Horcrux in a living being is possible.
