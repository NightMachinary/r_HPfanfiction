I would say he strongly suspected at the end of CoS. The Diary confirmed that Voldemort knew of and could make a horcrux, which thereby explained the strange properties of Harry's scar. Before that point I imagine Dumbledore speculating, but also considering other options as equally or more likely.

I would then say he received final confirmation just before Christmas of OotP, where he found out Nagini was a horcrux ("but in essence divided?") and thus confirmed that a) it is possible to make multiple horcruxes and Voldemort had done so and b) living beings could be horcruxes.
