  /Some say that Dumbledore knew it from the moment he saw Harry after his parents died./

*This*. I'd say "suspects" not "knows", but it was from the start.

He even comments about it, chapter one HP:SS (US edition):

  Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.

  “Is that where ---?” whispered Professor McGonagall.

  “Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He'll have that scar forever.”

  “Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?”

  “Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well --- give him here, Hagrid --- we'd better get this over with.”

  Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house.
