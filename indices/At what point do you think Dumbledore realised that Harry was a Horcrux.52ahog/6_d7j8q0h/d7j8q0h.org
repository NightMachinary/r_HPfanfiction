I think Dumbledore is a little Gandalf-like - he had his /suspicions/, but he isn't all knowing, and it's far easier to sort of allay your fears with "don't be silly, that isn't possible", or at least, "something weird is in that scar, and Volde has disappeared, is possession possible" and gone off and started researching.

I think he knew that Volde had /some/ form of immortality, but he didn't know for sure until he actually saw the diary. Then, like Gandalf heating the One Ring, all his suspicions were verified.

Trouble was, JK tried to make him too all-powerful, and Harry also saw him as such, because adult, and powerful wizard. But in reality, he was just a very clever man, who was very powerful, and very old. Not infallible, and not all knowing.
