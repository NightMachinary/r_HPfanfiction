Scars were "useful", because Dumbledore had a scar above his knee that looked like the London underground map, or something like that.

Which is bullshit on so many levels.

What use is a lightning-shaped scar? For attracting fan-girls? For getting stupid and inconsiderate questions? /"Can I see it?"/ Fuck off, Ron, you berk.

/Very/ few wizards need to use the underground. Between apparition, floo, and portkeys, only Hagrid is handicapped enough to have to use the underground. And he did so without any access to Dumbledore's knee.

Dumbledore's scar was definitely magical. That means that Harry's scar was either just an ordinary ugly scar that should have been removed or healed, or magical in some unspecified way, benevolent or sinister. Why didn't Dumbledore find out exactly what Harry's scar was?
