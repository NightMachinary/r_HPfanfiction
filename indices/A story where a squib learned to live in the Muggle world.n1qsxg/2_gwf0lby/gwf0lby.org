Summary (copied from the wrok): Roxanne Weasley, daughter of George Weasley, thought that all she had to worry about once she turned eleven was avoiding her brother Fred's pranks, working up the courage to occasionally talk to someone outside the family, and learning magic. But when she doesn't receive her Hogwarts letter, Roxanne has a lot more to deal with. Squib law states, she has to go to Muggle school!
