To build off [[/u/jdaev][u/jdaev]] recommendation, Exile is really good. Draco is not a squib in this story, but he might as well be after the war. It's also fairly realistic in terms of redemption --- he doesn't become a good person overnight, nor does he get to forgive himself for what he's done.

I really wish we've got a sequel to it. Especially one detailing his eventual return to the magical world.
