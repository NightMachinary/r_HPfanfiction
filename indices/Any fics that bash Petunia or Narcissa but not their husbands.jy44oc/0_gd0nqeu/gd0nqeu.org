ohh there is one where Dudley ended up having magic and Vernon just basically goes “Well if he's gonna be a wizard, he might as well be one of the best.” and Petunia starts to despise Dudley. It starts in first year and shows how the dynamics would change and Dudley and Harry at some point start to become really good friends. Fair warning though the fic was abandoned around 2010 or around then though it does have many chapters.
