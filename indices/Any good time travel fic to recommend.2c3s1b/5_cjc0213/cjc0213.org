Some of the best writing of the genre is by Deadwoodpecker with her [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward with Purpose]] series.

Sarah1281's humorous story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]] is recommended.

For something a bit different, Perspicacity [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5116751/1/The-Life-of-Brian-A-Super-Harry-Parody][has]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][written]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6581693/1/Yule-Time][a]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/6/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][few]]. Though his writing is a bit hit and miss at times, the story ideas are pretty original for a well trodden genre.
