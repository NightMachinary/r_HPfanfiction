[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8127137/1/Palimpsest][Palimpsest]] Not really a time travel, Hermione sends what is effectively a tweet back through time. After a long break, just updated.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]] Fem Harry, no pairings...sort of. This is one of the best stories I've ever read. Highly recommended. Currently updating, usually once a month.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backwards with Purpose]] It has two sequels, considered a classic. Canon pairings. All three are complete.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]] End of third year, Hermione makes a time beacon where they can return to that point. So far there has been 6 loops I believe. Harry/Hermione pairing. Probably a dead fic though.
