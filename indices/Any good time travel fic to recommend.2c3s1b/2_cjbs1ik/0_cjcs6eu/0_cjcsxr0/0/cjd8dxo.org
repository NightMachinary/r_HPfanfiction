I started Vanity a while ago but never finished. Didn't Hermione come back from the past fairly early in that story? I can't seem to remember exactly why I never finished the story. Maybe I should check it out again. I know I started Consequences of Meddling with Time as well but it's been a while since I've read that one as well.

A couple of my favorite Snape/Hermione TT fics are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8455295/1/An-Unwritten-Future][An Unwritten Future]] and [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=17758][For All Intents and Purposes.]] Thanks again for the recs.
