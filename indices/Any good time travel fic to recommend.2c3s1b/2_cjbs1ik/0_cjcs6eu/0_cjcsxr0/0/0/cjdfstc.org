Yes, in Vanity Hermione comes back fairly early in the story. It's basically The events of HBP from her point of view. It's one of my favorite stories.

In Consequences of Meddling with Time, Hermione makes several accidental jumps back to when Snape was a student. Snape spends those times taking care of her and protecting her.
