[[http://www.ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=26009][Yet Everything Remains the Same]] This story was excellent. Snape/Hermione pairing. Snape is sent 30 years into the future by Voldemort to see who the child in the prophecy is. Meanwhile in present day, Hermione is living in Spinner's End overseeing a museum she set up to honor Snape, who died in the war. Heartbreaking, but just a great read IMO.
