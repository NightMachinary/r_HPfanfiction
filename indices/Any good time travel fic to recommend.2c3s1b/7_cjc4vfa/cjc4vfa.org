My own offering to the genre is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4284788/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Alchemist-s-Apprentice][Harry Potter and the Alchemist's Apprentice]].

Harry has an accident and winds up studying under Flamel. I had plans for him to join Hogwarts as a contemporary of Dumbledore but we never got there. Half an additional chapter is complete, but sort of shitty and boring so I never bothered revising and posting.
