I would guess that it is because, instead of primarily expanding/continuing the world, many (most?) authors want to make changes to / play around with (we'll politely not say rehash) the basic cannon plot. There are only so many ways of doing this: go AU by having some event or circumstance suddenly deviate at the author's discretion or have the characters react differently by having future information/abilities which implies time travel. Add in that the characters and tone change over the course of the books and some people want to mash later canon elements with earlier canon plot, and time travel it is.
