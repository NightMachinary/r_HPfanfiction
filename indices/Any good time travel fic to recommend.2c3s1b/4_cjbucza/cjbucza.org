I really like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destinies]]. Harry goes back in time to kill Voldemort as an infant and gets entangled in the war against Grindelwald, it suffers a bit from pre-DH syndrome, but not very much. There is a sequel, but it's a lot weaker and unfinished.
