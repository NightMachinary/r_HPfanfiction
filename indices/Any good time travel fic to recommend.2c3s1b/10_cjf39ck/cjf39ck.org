There's always [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][Circular Reasoning]]; which is kickass in the same kind of way as Wastelands of Time. Sadly it is only updated every now and then. It's pretty good, but most people who like timetravel have already read it (sometimes more than once).
