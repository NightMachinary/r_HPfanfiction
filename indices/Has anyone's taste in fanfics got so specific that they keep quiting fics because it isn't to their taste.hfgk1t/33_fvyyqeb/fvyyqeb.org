Yeah, there are a lot of tropes that I couldn't stand anymore. Some were okay at first (like Harry in Slytherin and being besties with Draco), but they're usually accompanied with excessive politics than no 11-year old should be doing anyway, bashing, etc.

I think back in the early days of HP fandom, bashing were rare and far in between. And a lot of the tropes I find annoying today weren't as widely used back then, so I was able to enjoy fanfic more.

And then book 7 happened and suddenly everyone is a critic.
