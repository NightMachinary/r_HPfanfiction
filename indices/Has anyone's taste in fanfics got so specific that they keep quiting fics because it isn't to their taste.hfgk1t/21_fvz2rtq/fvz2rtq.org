I really really cannot take Ron and Dumbledore bashing. Not even a minuscule amount.

Also can't bother with Harry x Hermione. Just can't. I'm sure I'm missing out on quite a lot of good fics because of this. But I just don't like Harry and Hermione having anything more than a platonic relationship.

I'm also kind of getting tired of Neville wanking.
