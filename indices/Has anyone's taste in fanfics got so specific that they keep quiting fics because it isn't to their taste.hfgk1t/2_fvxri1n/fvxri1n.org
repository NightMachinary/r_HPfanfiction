For me, most of the time it's a matter of the story being well-written and the characters making sense - and therein lies the crux of the problem. There's just certain things that, while they're /possible/ to do well, almost never actually /are/.

I can read a well-written bashing story - but 90% of the time, the bashed character is a caricature of a villain, whose plan could be neatly written off as "never gonna work" by any given 5-year-old.\\
Same goes for Lord Potter or Creature Harry - I've enjoyed a few, but most of it is written like some angsty teen's power-fantasy.

Then there's the myriad stories that are plagued by writing problems because the author is either not a native English speaker, doesn't bother to proofread, or loses the thread of their own story because they never planned past the start.

TL;DR 90% of /everything/ is crap. It's that hard-to-find 10% that you need to look out for.
