  most of the time it's a matter of the story being well-written and the characters making sense

This is absolutely how I feel. I can enjoy most plot points as long as it's well-written and the characters both make sense and are somewhat close to canon. The problem is even most fanfics I see recommended by the community are poorly written or straight up garbage - I'm so god damn picky, I hate it.
