That's kind of a maxim in many magic systems, in HP case the only ritual we saw it being used required the "donor" to be there and to be willing to give the blood.

I would expect the test to be something like placing it into an enchanted parchment, bowl or something like that.

But then again, Wizards have stuff like the Marauder's Map, that can tell one's name regardless of any disguises, magic, or form. Maybe the Goblins could use something similar if they wanted.(We know they don't because Hermione fooled them with polyjuice)
