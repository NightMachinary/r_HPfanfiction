  Gringots performing any kind of blood test

I honestly don't see the problem of them having a way of validating identities with a magical DNA test.

I understand and agree with how bad it is the Goblins being impressed by Harry being polite(LOL), but I don't see the problem of seeing Gringotts handling stuff like they were a law firm, especially regarding wills and money.

The problem is when they come back with a list of surnames for him to add and more rings than "Sauron gave the Kings of Men" for him to dazzle girls with.

Also, Dumbledore having placed magic blocks on him just shows me the author read too much Naruto fanfiction, and it gives me a good laugh while closing the tab.
