There's a long list of plotpoints that are big red flags that the story that is readable in chapter 1-2 is going to go bad pretty quickly. I don't read stories past Harry being polite to the Gobblins and that being treated like a miracle, or Gringots performing any kind of blood test for magical ability or heritage. Double so if the magical ability shows up as percentages with blocks on abilities.
