Making a character less likable or more antagonistic is not bashing. Bashing is exaggerating the negative sides of a character to comical levels or straight up invent shit to drag them down.

For example, let's say that Harry doesn't come across Hermione at Halloween, and she survives due to accidental magic (like Neville did). They don't become friends, Hermione stays lonely and grows bitter at her isolation. That's not bashing. However, if Hermione betrays Harry to Dumbledore in exchange for some books, well that's bashing.
