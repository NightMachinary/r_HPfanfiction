Bashing, from my understanding, refers to taking a canon character and making them less /likeable/ or more /antagonistic/ - which has surprisingly little to do with how /well-written/ or /believable/ they are.

If a well-written villain in a fanfic would, given their original personality, be on the side of the heroes in that situation? The character is still being bashed, because they're placed in the role of an antagonist.
