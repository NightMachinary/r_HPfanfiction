Yeah. I'm demi, so if sex is the catalyst for a relationship over traditional romance fluff, I get super annoyed and stop reading. If I can't relate to the characters behaviors, I can't read it. I also make it a point to not even bother clicking on harem fics because of how tropey and terrible most of them are. I'm sure there are outliers, but I don't care. Lol give me substance and compellingly interesting relationships. Not "who is the protag who's totally not a self insert male fantasy banging this week".
