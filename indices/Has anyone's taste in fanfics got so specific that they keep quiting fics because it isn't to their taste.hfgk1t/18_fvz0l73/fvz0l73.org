Yeah... I got into fanfiction because of HP and Twilight (I still can't believe I read those books and read fanfiction based on it), and for a very long time, I didn't touch other fandoms. I read ff with super!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, Harry with magic trunks and five additional wands (one of them has to have a piece of basilisk!). I read time travel fics and fics bashing Weasleys, Snape, Dumbledore, Hermione, and fics with Independent!Harry and Lord Potter Black Gryffindor Peverell Merlin. And it was alright. I guess I enjoyed those tropes at least a little.

But after some time, I got bored with all those tropes and lost interest. I moved to asoiaf and asoiaf fanfiction and MCU fanfiction and forgot all about Harry Potter.

Now, I'm back, and I was sure after such a long time, I will have hundreds of fics to read during the pandemic, and I will rediscover the magic of HP again, but for the last two weeks, all I've been doing was skimming through ao3 and ff.net, and I still haven't found even one fic to read...

Everything feels wrong somehow, and though I'm an adult now and I want to read something more serious, I also want to feel the magic in magic, and I can't find that in most fics. Characters feel weird, storylines are boring, and magic is too complicated and too ordinary. To be honest, the realisation that I may be done with HP fics depressed me more than three months of self-isolation.
