Which is fair, but some people here just tear into authors and their works as if the authors themselves couldn't ever possibly see it. These subreddits are treated like private conservations and not like speaking to an amphitheater. Fanfic authors are also fanfic readers.

And what do some of the comments here tell new and learning writers? That if their work isn't perfect and doesn't meet all these standards that they are bad writers. Talk about discouraging.

All I'm saying is that there are actual people involved. If you can't imagine reading the comments to the author in person, maybe rethink the consideration you are taking in writing it.
