First off, I apologize for the poor wording. I was trying to communicate that his views are not exactly what is expressed in the fic, (the fic is very exaggerated) but the irony thing was wrong.

I don't think he's racist or mysogynstic. Writing a male fantasy doesn't make you misogynistic, just like a straight girl writing fetish wolfstar smut isn't trying to fetishize the gays. It's fanfiction, and people can write fantasies that don't reflect how they act in real life, even if real views are sprinkled in. All of the evidence suggests to me that Noodlehammer is much more the kind of person to not believe in something then believe in it, and that his fic is more of a reaction than action, if it is something at all. And you still haven't addressed my argument from earlier.
