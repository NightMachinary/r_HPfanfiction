He says he holds a variation of the beliefs that a) religion is bad and despicable and b) that places like Africa and the middle-east are shitshows.

On its own, these are both fine beliefs too have. The one you seem to be having trouble with is that he thinks that Europe and the US didn't make them that way, which is an illogical rejection of colonialism. That's not really what he's saying though, as evidenced by him saying later "the backstory doesn't matter." It's not that he doesn't know colonialism exists, it's that he's tired of people defending the present day dystopian of these countries with colonialism, as if a) that changes the facts of their existence and b) they wouldn't have discovered how to be shitty in their own special way eventually like the rest of the world.

You could also have issue with Harry's reasoning ability and say that even though Noodlehammer says Harry doesn't give a shit about race, he's just using that to cover up the fact that he's defending his racism with "facts and logic" about the country. To this I say: you have the wrong context. In this story, Harry has to deal with the country and its representatives, not random joe shmoes, so this holds true. That means that Harry's views indicate Noodlehammer doesn't care about race either.
