Not in Germany, if one party is below 14. Although the law dictates that such a scene must be realistic and explicit, which means that probably anything related to magic is not illegal. I'd certainly love to see an attorney argue that werewolves knotting due to alpha/beta/omega bs while impregnating a man is realistic, with a straight face.

Then again, you can have nudity and statutory rape in a movie and it's rated 6+ and we watched that one in class.
