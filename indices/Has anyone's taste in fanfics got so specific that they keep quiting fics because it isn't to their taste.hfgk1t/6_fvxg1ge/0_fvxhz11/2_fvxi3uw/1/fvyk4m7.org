I haven't read much of RobSt, but I have two very different opinions on the two stories of his I've read. A Different Halloween was good but certain events in Harry Crow were (to me) extremely cringey and I had to stop reading because of those.... /problematic/ plot points.

He's a competent writer in the technical sense (I think? It's been a while), but he tends to have some pretty rabid H/Hr 12 year old soulmate shit going on and I can't do it, personally.
