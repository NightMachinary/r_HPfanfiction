Nothing wrong with that.

The conflict arises when people start praising an author's fics while ignoring it's problems. Sometimes, those people praising may also directly or indirectly insult the ones that dislike the fic.

Of course, there are also people that will go for your throat if you so much as say a single good word for what they dislike, but those people are not really reasonable (or nice).
