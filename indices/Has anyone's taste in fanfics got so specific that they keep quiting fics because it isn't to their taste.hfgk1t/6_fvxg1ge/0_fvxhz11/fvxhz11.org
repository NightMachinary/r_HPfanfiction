I also think that a lot of people here are on your wave length, but there is a subsection of users who are judgmental and negative about fics which makes those who have the same openness stay quiet.

Edit: which like being so judgmental is crazy to me because fanfic authors write for fucking free. and they frequent these fanfic subs. can you imagine pouring hours and hours into writing for free as a hobby only to see some a-hole on reddit complain that the metaphors are heavy-handed lol
