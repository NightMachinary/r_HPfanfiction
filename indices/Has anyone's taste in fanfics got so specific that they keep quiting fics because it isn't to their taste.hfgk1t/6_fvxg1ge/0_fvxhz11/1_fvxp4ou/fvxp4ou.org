It is not about bashing. Of course, I won't tell authors “what you are doing is useless crap” as much as I won't tell small child that her drawing is bad. They enjoy it, they may even find some readers who enjoy it, good for them all. However, nobody forces me to read it, and I have to do this filtering for myself otherwise I will be killed by the Sturegon's Law.

When I write reviews (and sometimes rather harsh ones) it is always implied (and I work on being more explicit on this) that the story was at least good enough to be read and reviewed. Really bad stories are not to be reviewed, just silently ignored.
