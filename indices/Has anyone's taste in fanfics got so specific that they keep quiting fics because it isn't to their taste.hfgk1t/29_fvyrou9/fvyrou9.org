I have this problem. I've been reading since about 2006. My specifications are now me wanting more sophisticated plot lines, thought out character development and more specifically characters that could easily be regarded as true potential cannon. Like I need my stories to have flesh and make it feel like I've been put into a fly on the wall observer if that makes sense.
