Yeah that's reasonable imho. When I was reading lots of fanfic years ago, I was pretty selective and would skim a story before deciding to even start reading it, and would quit them all the time. There's tons of bad fiction out there (Sturgeon's Law) but even limiting just to the good fiction, there is way too much to try to read.
