Funny, I feel quite like the opposite. I used to be fussy with my fic selections, making full use of the filters. Complete works only. Should have romance. Specific het pairings only (started with Drinny, changed to Dramione, then other M/F pairings that took my fancy).

But I gradually deviated from these filters gradually. Kinda like relaxing my wards and letting some deatheaters in (but I'm not saying it's bad, per se). I learned to tolerate works in progress, especially if it's riveting and well-written. I learned to read M/M pairings. At one point I found myself reading a monstrously long Remus x Snape (is there a name for this ship? Like Harmony or Wolfstar or some other cutesy nickname?) and wondering what in the ever loving fuck happened to me.
