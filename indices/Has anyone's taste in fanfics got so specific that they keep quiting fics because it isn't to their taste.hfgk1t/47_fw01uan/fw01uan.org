About two years ago I started reading fics in english, which isn't my first language, and since then, i can't really enjoy fics written in my mother language, they just seem strange. From time to time, i'm in a mood where i want to read such specific things that i have trouble finding fics to my liking, because there just isn't anything new that i didn't already read.
