I've always been extremely picky. There's a long list of fic tropes I can't stand and the sad thing is a lot of them are present in my favorite types of fics.

Is it that hard to write a Slytherin Harry fic without delving into mentor Snape, best buddy Draco, evil Dumbledore, and bashing the Weasleys? Or a Sirius raises Harry fic without any Lord Potter-Black-Peverell nonsense? I respect that people enjoy those fics but I don't and it sucks when they're the only ones available.
