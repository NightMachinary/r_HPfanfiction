My list is more about stuff that I can't stand. Bashing or character punishment for example, out one of my personal un favorites, evil Dumbledore. I don't mind an antagonistic Dumbledore, mind you, but when he's evil, villainous, or commonly quoted as saying, "For the greater good!" it rubs me wrong. Likewise, I tend not to like those stories where the main character suddenly becomes super powerful (magically, financially, politically, ect) with a half assed reason or no reason at all. I want to see that power earned, or played for laughs in a comedy story.
