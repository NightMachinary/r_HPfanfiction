Same, I do tend to cycle through trope styles as well.

I'm starting to wonder if age is a factor, it's like my patience and enjoyment for anything Draco related (redeeming him that is) wears thin more quickly each time I go through it.

Plus my standards for the quality of the writing keep going up, it definitely takes a certain level of skill to properly turn a character without it feeling rushed or forced.
