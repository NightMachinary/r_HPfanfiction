This is definitely me too. I'll see recommendation from this subs, start reading them, and then just nope out because I can't tolerate this or that from the story

A lot of highly recommended story from this sub is like that. No offense to the people who like them but despite the prevalent of “pet peeves thread”, people still recommend story with things like bashing

Yesterday I read two stories that was recommended here, From Ruin and Cold Blood and despite the interesting premise I just couldn't handle the bashing

Sometimes I'll find something interesting but most of the time I usually close the tab a couple of chapters in
