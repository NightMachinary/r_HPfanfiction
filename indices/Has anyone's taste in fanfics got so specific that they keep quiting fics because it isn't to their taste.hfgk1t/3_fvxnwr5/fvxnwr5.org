Yeah definitely, I reach a saturation point for certain tropes/scenarios. Once they become annoying I get turned off soon as I see it in action, even when the rest of the story is really good and the trope in question is a minor part of the fic. Usually it's when things are over used or I realise they don't make sense and cant ignore it any longer.

Like, I read a really convincing comment about why it's unrealistic that Snape would be Draco's godfather. Now I cant stand to read about it and it's part of so many stories!

My options get more narrow every day lol.
