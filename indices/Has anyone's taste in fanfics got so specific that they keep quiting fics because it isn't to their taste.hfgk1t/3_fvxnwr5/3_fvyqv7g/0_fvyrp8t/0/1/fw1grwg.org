That's one major benefit of/problem with fanfictions. Sirius dying tore a hole through my heart but reading SO many fanfictions where he lives has patched it up pretty good. Similarly Fred, in my headcanon, is happily alive and still works at WWW with his twin brother.

But so many things that I "know" about HP universe might very well be fanon instead of canon and I'm not sure which is which. I don't mind though. I'll happily pick the parts I like. :-)
