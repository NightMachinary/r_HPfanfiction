Sorry, tried to find it but no luck (I have a feeling it was a comment thread that got way off topic from the main post). So kudos to the OP for doing the hard yards, sorry I cant link you but what I recall is this:

The main issue is that Lucius is a blood purist from a prestigious family and Snape is a half blood from an impoverished background and with a Muggle name. He just doesn't have the status to be worthy of Draco (from a Malfoy perspective).

Lucius is (I think) a few years older in school, so even if he welcomed Snape to Slytherin or helped recruit him to the Dark Lord's service, that doesn't mean they were friends or close in a personal way. If anything this establishes even more a relationship dynamic where Lucius is the superior one and wouldn't see Snape as a capable equal. Not at that stage anyway.

The other point was that Lucius wouldn't need to make Snape Draco's Godfather for future perks or leverage, because Lucius would expect that as a Malfoy (as someone who 'helped' Snape in their youth and as former comrades) that Snape would own him the respect of doing everything possible to help his son anyway.

For me personally, I also think there is an issue with the timeline. Snape was 20/21 at the time, so again I think too young to be Lucuis' choice at this point. Draco was over a year old when Voldemort lost his body, I'm not overly family with godparent tradition but I assume the people in question were already chosen and at this stage I also assume the Malfoy's were still confident in Voldemort's victory. No need for a double agent as a fail safe. They could have picked him later but Lucius was probably free & clear legally before Snape was.

Add another 10 years and I can see that Lucius could have developed a decent friendship with Snape, one with more respect, but that would have come later.
