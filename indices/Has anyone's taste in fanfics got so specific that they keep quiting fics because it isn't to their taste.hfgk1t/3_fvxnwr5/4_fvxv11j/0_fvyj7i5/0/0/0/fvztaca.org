I like to think the spy thing became a semi-public knowledge after the war, because, if I remember correctly, Moody tried to send Snape to Azkaban, so I think everyone must have learned then.

Yeah, maybe but was Draco born then? Or maybe only select Death Eaters know he is "spying" and since I like to think Lucius was a trusted death eater would know about it. But maybe as you said they got close because they have things in common now.
