He didn't start spying until the prophecy, so would Lucius or anyone even know he was a spy? I never thought about it until now, but what is the point of having a spy if everyone knows?

Maybe they got close because at their core, I think the Malfoy's were semi-reasonable people, and not just out for bloodlust, and Snape is the same. Birds of a feather etc.
