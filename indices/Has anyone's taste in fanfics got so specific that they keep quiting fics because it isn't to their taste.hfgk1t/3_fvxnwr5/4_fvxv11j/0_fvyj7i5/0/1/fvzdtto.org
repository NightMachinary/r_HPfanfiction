That was my interpretation too. Since I imagine Lucius would know that Snape is spying for Voldemort, while Dumbledore thinks Snape is his spy (in Lucius's knowledge anyway) and he's cunning enough to know that if for some reason, he and Narcissa don't make it through the war but the light wins..Draco is saved or vice versa
