Not the comment you're looking for, but I always thought it was strange for a couple reasons: Lucius is at least a year ahead of Snape in school and they didn't hang out (a couple of Snape's friends were mentioned... Rosier is one of them off the top of my head, but not Malfoy), and pureblood vs halfblood are the big ones.

Added to that... when you choose godparents for your kids, you pick from close, long time friends and family members. Snape is neither - he's a fellow terrorist that he's been on (I assume?) somewhat friendly terms with for maybe three years at the time of Draco's birth.
