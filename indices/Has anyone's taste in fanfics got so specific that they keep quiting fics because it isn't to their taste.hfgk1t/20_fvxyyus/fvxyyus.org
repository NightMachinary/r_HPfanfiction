I think I'm going two ways on this. I'm more discerning about the quality of the fic so that cuts it down and I'm only reading long fic (100k+) so that also cuts it down, but I'm open to a lot more ships/eras/characters etc now so that's increased my amount of fics. When I started I only read marauders fic but quality and length weren't as much of an issue. Now I'll read most things if they're long and we'll written!
