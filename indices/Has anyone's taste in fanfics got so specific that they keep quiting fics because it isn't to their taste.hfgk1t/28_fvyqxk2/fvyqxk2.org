I used to love Harry/Hermione and hated Harry/Ginny.

Then I broke up with my then gf, when I realised she acted almost identical to Hermione in most fanfiction. Entitled and trying to change everything for what she believes is right.

Since then I dont read h/hr, no matter how many good things I've heard.

Used to like Haphne but that got old real quick
