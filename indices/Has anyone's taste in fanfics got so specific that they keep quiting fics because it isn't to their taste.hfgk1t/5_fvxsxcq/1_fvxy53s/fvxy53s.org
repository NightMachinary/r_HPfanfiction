The problem, in my opinion, is that for specific storylines there's usually one story that starts the trend and become popular. And regardless of quality, there's going to be a bunch of similar stories, just worse, until there's just a pile of stories so similar that you can't tell them apart.

But then again isn't that just like YA publishing? How many Twilight or Harry Potter clones came out in the years after those two became popular?
