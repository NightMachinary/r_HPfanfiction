Not really - I am sufficiently voracious, and thus constantly hungry for more reading material, that my bar is somewhat lower than it otherwise might be.

Basically, as long as the grammar and spelling aren't eye-searingly awful, and there aren't the specific things I strongly /dislike/, I'm willing to give a fic at least a shot.
