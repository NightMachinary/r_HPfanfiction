I'm exactly the same. When I started reading fanfiction I was like: "mpreg when well done is fine". Now I'm like: "yoo this fic has kne line mentioning slash I'm out cya". I'm the same with other tags like old Hogwarts and stuff. Used to love marauders gen fics and now even reading canon backstory for james and lily in a fic turns me off. I've found that exploring other fics based around other books and films like star wars etc really helped me open my view on hp fics.
