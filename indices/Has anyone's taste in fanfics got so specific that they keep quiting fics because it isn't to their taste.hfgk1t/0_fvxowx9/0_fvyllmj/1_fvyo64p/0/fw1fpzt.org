I disagree. Stardust was a fun, sometimes cutesy, adventure that totally deserves the ending that the movie gave it, not the one that the books did. The book should have stopped at the 12 second mark [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtKJCIeozQ8][in this video]] which is where the movie did.

I did watch the movie first though, so I might be a bit biased.
