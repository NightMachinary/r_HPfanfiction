Yeah, we will have to agree to disagree here. I really don't like the Hollywood iron rule of the fantasy films, where every one of them has to end with the epic battle of the Good versus Evil. And I like the films (or stories generally) which go against the trope, for example the film [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_(film][Once]]) which ends as it does.
