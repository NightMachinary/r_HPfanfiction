Ugh, definitely. A lot of plotlines get so old and I oftentimes find myself quitting after the first 5 chapters. It's such a struggle to find an appealing, original story. I've been struggling the most with finishing multi-chapter romances. It's so hard to find any that don't follow this form:

1. Used to be enemies/unacquainted/just friends, forced together by chance.
2. Such sexual tension. Hormonal encounters ensue.
3. Oh no! Someone did something!!! Awkward avoidance/rejection/bitterness/hate.
4. They still have to work with/see each other. [insert Awkward Penguin]
5. Apologies/Reconciliation
6. *AHEM* We all know what happens after that, right?

It's so boring and overused. Some romance publishers even have the basic plotline as a requirement for incoming manuscripts (*sigh*). That being said, I can totally relate to you. Happy fanfiction hunting!
