It's gotten to the point now that the moment I read or even feel the story is gonna hit one too many cliches I immediately stop. Cliches are a fun read when the writer is fully self aware of what he's doing, but when the writer is doing it unironically, I think that's the best way I can describe it, i stop cold.
