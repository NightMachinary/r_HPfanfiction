Same here I learned I absolutely hate when harry doesn't get hedwig or his wand in the story. Or the story focuses on fluff. Despite the fact it has an actual plot. Than just tells us the plot instead of showing it. I dont mind fluff but damnit don't let it take over the story to the point plot stuff becomes purely exposition.
