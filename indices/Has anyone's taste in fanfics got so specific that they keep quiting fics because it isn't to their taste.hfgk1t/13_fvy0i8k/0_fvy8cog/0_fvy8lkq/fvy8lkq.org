hmm true sometimes even the formatting puts me off - especially with some that just runs straight on for like twenty or so lines and it's just so hard to read I click right out

like I love fanfiction but sometimes it gets hard to find like fics that I would really love or like to read when ive read most of the fics that always get recommended (which are the ones that get the most kudos/reviews anyways and is how I filter them lol)
