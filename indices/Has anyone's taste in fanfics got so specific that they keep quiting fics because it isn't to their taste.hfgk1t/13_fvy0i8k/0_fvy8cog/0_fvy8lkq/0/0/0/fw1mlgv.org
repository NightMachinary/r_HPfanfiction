linkffn(The Curse of Truth by butalearner)

This fic is not only first person, it's also a self-insert. And it's also written in present tense. The unholy trinity, right?

Well this story is written so damn well that it shattered my preconceived notions of those "annoyances". Do give it a shot, it's well worth the effort.
