I have a number of entries in my "stories I've read" file that have a comment on the order of, "Started good, getting worse, not good enough to continue."

It's interesting that, in my experience, the ones that start relatively well and then deteriorate greatly outnumber the ones that have a rough start and get better. I suppose it's the difference between getting tired of a story in the first case, and improving as a writer for the latter.
