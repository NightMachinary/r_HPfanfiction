yea definitely - especially when im reading fanfics i remember loving to bits a couple years back - the writing i liked then and now has changed so drastically that I can't really stand to read through the whole fic - or when i fall in love with a particular trope and start reading through a lot of those fics - until a certain point where I realise that they're all so similar it's not even interesting anymore then yea

tho generally it really depends on the first few chapters of the fic I'm going thru - if the writing is alright and i get hooked enough on the story then I'll probably keep going but that's getting rarer and rarer these days tbh
