It's the opposite for me now. I feel like I've read EVERYTHING that's exactly to my tastes so now I'm branching out to shit I would never had read 3 years ago. A FILFY Teacher? Not a chance in 2018. Now? Fuck yeah, that's some good shit, even though I've never watched High School DxD. Browncoat, Green eyes? Never seen Firefly, but god damn am I bored of my 312th Harmony fic.
