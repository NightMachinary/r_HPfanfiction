Goddamn it, are you me? Never watched Firefly, Stargate or Star Wars. Have read almost all the good crossovers in the past few months. (Hype for Havoc side of Force)

This is exactly what it feels like. A couple, "Harry is a Dragon and it's okay" and "Harry Potter: Squatter" update regularly, so I tend to wait for them, bit other than those I'm only surviving at crossovers at this point.
