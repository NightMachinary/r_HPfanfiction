What turns me off most often is poor writing; when the pacing is off, or the author just has characters say "yes" to things that they shouldn't be agreeing to so fast, or at all.

The next most common thing that puts me off is when Harry goes around being instantly best chums with everyone he meets, particularly Draco (I just personally don't believe he has the potential to be much else besides a racist asshat, even in first year) because Harry in the books should not be capable of that kind of gregariousness.

Next thing I hate is all the female characters, particularly the love interest, being basically interchangable with a supportive sex doll. I want female characters who can stand up for themselves, not just be tokens to be traded between Harry and the villains for drama!

Lastly, I hate it when a fic "reveals" that Harry's name is /actually/ Hadrian or Harrold or Harrison or something. Fuck that noise.
