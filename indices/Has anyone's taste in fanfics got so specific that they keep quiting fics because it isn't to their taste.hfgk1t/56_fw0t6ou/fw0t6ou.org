It's kinda the opposite for me; I've got favorite tracks for fics to take but if they deviate I'm not too upset, but I've got a handful of tropes and tracks that I absolutely detest and will immediately turn me off of a fic. Self Inserts, OC heavy/focused stories, stories where the main character develops another characters powers in the summary^{1}, stories where the author unceremoniously transforms the main character into their OC without any plot based causes ^{2}, or stories where the chapter/wordcount per thousand is heavily biased towards the chapters if it isn't a Drabble or similar style of fic^{3}.

^{1. crossovers where the summary tells you that Midoriya or Jaun or Naruto or Harry has suddenly been Peter Parker'd into having Spider Powers. Usually those will cram their main character into another's origin story with just a few name changes. And bits of the crossover world are excised and just enough to support that origin are inserted. It just feels lazy, and I don't want to read about someone who has no connection to Marvel developing exact replicas of Spider-Man's powers. Similarly, I don't want to hear about Harry getting caught in the opening of a portal to the afterlife and getting Danny Phantom's powers, et cetera. However, if they get One For All'd and the ghost of Trafalgar Law decides to give Jaun his Cut Cut Fruit and teach him how to use it or something similar then it's ok as long as it doesn't linger too long on that.}

^{2. It's fine if someone's going to introduce new abilities or personality traits/flaws to a character but I prefer it if it isn't just suddenly introduced, especially if it's done in the summary. I remember a fanfic where a 9-10 year old Harry reads a few books of Fairy Tail manga and decides it'd be cool if he had Lightning Dragon Slayer magic and because he apparently had an early onset case of 8th Grader Syndrome he bit down on a 9volt battery in an attempt to eat lightning. And because Harry Potter magic is usually written as pseudo-sapient and generally awesome and caring, it nearly destroys him sucking in the electricity and then uses it to recreate the magic he had hoped to gain! And this was how we were introduced to the story, and it wasn't a quick thing either. And unless it was really damn well written I'd likely drop it if it just starts with Harry having a full grasp of his lightning powers and we never see how he got them, save for a quick note in the summary.}

^{3. I like stories where it's about 1,000 words per chapter [1/1], 15,000 words per chapter is exceptional [1/15], but if a story that isn't a Drabble story where every chapter is its own self contained micro story, maybe even with little micro sequels or multi-part stories, has just 500 or 700 words per chapter would be mentally exhausting. Imagine picking up a book and every page or two is a chapter. That'd be a pain and if I have no way to return it, I'd likely be figuring out what happens when you run a book through a charcloth maker.}
