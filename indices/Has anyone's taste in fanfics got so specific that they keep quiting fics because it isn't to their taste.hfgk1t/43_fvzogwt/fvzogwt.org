Pretty much the only thing that'll make me drop a story 'forever' is if it's mechanically bad. Tropes and pairings (at least, pairings that are silghtly believable) can get me to drop a story temporarily based on my mood. I'm not going to read a tragedy when I'm in the mood for some absurd humor, for example.
