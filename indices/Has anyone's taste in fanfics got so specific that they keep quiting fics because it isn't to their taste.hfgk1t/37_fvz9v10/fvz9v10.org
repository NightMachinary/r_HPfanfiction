I can read just about anything the only thing I can't stand are Fanfics that use the movies as a timeline. Harriet as a name for female Harry. And claiming a Canon Divergence fics that also includes “oh but this also”. It makes me what to rip out my hair and scream ‘Canon Divergence can't change History and Rules of the universe your playing in'

for example if you want Harry to be wearing headphones and listening to music at school for whatever reason immediately 1) it can't be a iPhone or even an iPod. Harry was born in 1980. Your best bet is a cassette player but then you have to explain 2) why muggle technology works around magic. If your canon divergence is Harry's smarter or sneaker or something happens during his childhood to make him different that doesn't mean magic and muggle tech can suddenly work together.

Edit: and I can't stand Crack Fanfic. Random doesn't equal funny.

Edit2: also if a fanfic is written in the first person. I don't know why but I just can't.
