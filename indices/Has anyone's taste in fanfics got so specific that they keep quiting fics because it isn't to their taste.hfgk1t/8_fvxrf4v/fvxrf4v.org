Yes. I can't read Weasley bashing fics anymore. I went through a bit of liking Ron bashing, it got to much though, and the fact the twins were always good no matter what got really annoying.

Nice and helpful goblins, nope.

Harry and Malfoy are friends despite him being a blood purist.

Can't read them now and don't want to.
