The problem you've been having with the twins is the same one I'm starting to have with Neville.

I just started a fic that was somewhat promising only for Neville to suddenly show up, reveal he and Harry are "godbrothers", and tell him how much he's been secretly "supporting" him all these years. Then Harry decides that Ron hasn't been as good a friend (when he hasn't even been in the fic yet).

The worst part? This all happens right as a big emotional scene was about to happen and yet everything and everyone there pauses so that Neville can be a Gary Sue for a bit.
