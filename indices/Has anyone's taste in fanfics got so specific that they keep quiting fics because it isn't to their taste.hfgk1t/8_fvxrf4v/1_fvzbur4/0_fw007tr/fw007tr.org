Yeah Neville is always the good guy but usually on the sidelines, I've never seen him as a Gary Sue, you mind linking the fic? If there is Ron bashing I prob won't read it all.

I'd love to read a fic of Neville as a blood purist but still a Gryfinndor, I could see him as a better antagonist than Malfoy.
