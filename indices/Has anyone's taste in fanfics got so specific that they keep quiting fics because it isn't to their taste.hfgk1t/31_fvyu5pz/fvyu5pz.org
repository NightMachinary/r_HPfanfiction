Absolutely. There's a lot of things that I used to be just fine with that I can hardly stand anymore. Anything to do with "soul bonds" for one---they almost never have any proper build-up for the romance bit. And the Weasley-bashing in Harmony fics is getting wearying. Like, I kind of get where they're coming from, and it's fine in GoF, but most of the time they ramp it up way too high. It's fine if the fic is designed to be humorous, but most of the time they try to be serious and its unrealistic. I mean, honestly. It shouldn't be that hard to make a halfway decent build-up for romance. They shouldn't just get together. You shouldn't need to invent all sorts of new stuff... just apply logic in the favour of the ship you want or whatever. At this point I'm mostly just reading pure humor fics because the serious ones are mostly an awful mess.
