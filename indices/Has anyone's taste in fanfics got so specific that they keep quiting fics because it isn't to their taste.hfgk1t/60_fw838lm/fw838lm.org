My desires regarding tropes ebb and flow. Sometimes I can deal with badfic tropes if I want some escapism. Pairings can be a matter of mood, too. I prefer more gen over relationships nowadays. I can hardly read threesome now, never mind Harry/Harem. But I have certainly gotten way pickier about grammar and formatting meeting a minimum bar.
