Honeslty yes! I really want a specific Hermione critical fanfic, but I find one that starts well but it's either a one shot, or ends up being ridiculous in other ways.

Or if I read some bashing fanfics it becomes very black and white, with like Snape/Lily Harry being the golden bunch who do no wrong and James/Sirius/Ron/Draco being so evil and everything they do is wrong and if they get pranked oh well they deserved it.
