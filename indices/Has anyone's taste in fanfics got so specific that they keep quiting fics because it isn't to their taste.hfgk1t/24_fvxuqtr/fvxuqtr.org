This has definitely happened to me, but in a slightly different way than you. When I started reading fanfic, I knew it would slightly difficult for me, because I'm kind of not interested in Harry. Don't get me wrong, he's great, but Harry!Centric fics are just not my cup of tea. When you filter in the 90% garbage, you aren't left with that much.
