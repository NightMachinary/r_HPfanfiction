I haven't been reading fanfic long enough to avoid based off tropes/pairings. What turns me off from a story is poor proofreading and what appears to be a disregard for any proper spelling. If, in the first three paragraphs, you've misspelled 20 % of your words, I will immediately stop reading. I don't have the time to try and figure out the word you're trying to use, there's spell check in every major writing program, use it.
