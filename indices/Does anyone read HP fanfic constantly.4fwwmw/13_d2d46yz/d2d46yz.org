I follow a lot of WIP stories, so I'll read them whenever they're updated. Colubrina updates rather frequently (once a day for "Rebuilding" and biweekly/monthly for most of her other stories) and the other stories/authors I follow are more sporadic but seem to update every couple of months. If I see a story that I like, I'll read it over the course of a week, same as if I read a book.
