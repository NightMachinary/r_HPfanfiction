I have to alternate between HP fics and other fandoms (or, you know, actual books) or I start confusing what happened in which story. Or, they have to have no overlap, like a 4th year redo and a post-Hogwarts.

That said, I have definitely been reading more HP than anything else for the past 2 years. And I generally read 4-5 hours a day if I can.
