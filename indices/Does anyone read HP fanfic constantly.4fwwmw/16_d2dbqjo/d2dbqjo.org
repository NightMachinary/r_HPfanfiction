I've read Fanfiction nearly constantly, or at least more often than not since shortly before OotP was released. I've read a lot of crap stories, I've reread a lot of stories. I've cut back in the past few weeks, but that's only because I switched phones and my library was corrupted and I'm working to rebuild it.
