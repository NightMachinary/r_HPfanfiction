When I first got into fanfic around 10 years ago, yes. It was a combination of two factors: firstly, there was so much to read and secondly, I had yet to develop the standards and preferences which now prevent me from reading most fics. So I just read (almost) anything and everything.

Today, 99% of fics I see I don't like the look of. And of the 1% I do like the look of, I've already read almost all of them. So my fanfic consumption is now mostly limited to new releases.
