I read HP fanfiction every day and have for about three years straight now. 50% of my free time is spent reading fanfiction and 50% doing other stuff. I also read fanfiction for about 20-30 minutes before bed most nights. I read a variety of pairings/tropes so there is ALWAYS something new for me to read. I think I've re-read only about 7 or 8 fics so far.
