I started reading fanfic when I was about 13 - 5 years ago now - and I read constantly. Now I'm that way where I don't read it too much, I have to be in the mood for it and more often than not I read a story that I know I like! I hate being disappointed in a story that I thought would be amazing, so I stick to what I know is good! I think if a story can stand up to 4/5 rereads, then it must be well written.
