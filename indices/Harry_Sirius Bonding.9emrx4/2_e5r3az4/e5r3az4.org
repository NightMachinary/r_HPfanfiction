I really, really like this /Too Far From Home/ linkffn(5757945) though the Sirius/Harry bonding doesn't come in until the later chapters. Premise: Harry is sent to a parallel universe by Voldemort after GoF, and living with the Potters isn't...ideal. Lots of angst, good character studies, some really surprising action (though it takes a while). Cons: Author is extremely slow in updating, but is still working on the story.
