I have three that I read a while back, first one had Harry trying to rationalize the working of luck potion or charm and a magical drink that makes you burp and thinking the magic somehow bent the universe to his whims, he goes about doing experiments with and on draco malfoy and other students to try to disprove this theory, otherwise logical fallacy prevails, enuse crack humor and shenanigans as he actually realizes esoteric rules about magic while trying to figure out how simple things everyone takes for granted work, like how the summoning charm works or where do vanished things actually go and how do post owls find third destinations and so on. His thought experiments usually end with people's embarsment or just trying bro ignore him.

Second had a similarity with TMOR, in that it had a logical harry potter that alongside Hermione realize wizards are lowkey stupid in first year. they discovered since explanations and theory behind even first year spells are so vague they start experimenting with finding loopholes in "established" spells and theory. They abuse and spam the summoning charm, find a way to focus and overpower lumos into a laser beam, play with gravity using the levitation charm, and a verity of other physics breaking feat's to beat every obstacle and enemy in the first three books. The adults simply keep dismissing their accomplishments and unbelievable, and some including other students think they are prodigious magical savants. Don't remember if there was more.

Third was a fic where harry basically realize he can use magic early on because of abuse and starts by leaning to aperate. Dumbledore sends snape to capture boy-who-lives and erases his memory. this keeps happening however where he rediscovers an old magical ability he had perfected through trial and error, and a new one to escape his relatives. After about the fourth time he is captured each time making it further even onto mainland europe, he learns to bypass memory charms entirely. By the time he reaches hogwarts and through Canon adventure he just solve most problems in a very cavelier fashion using fuck-all whatever magic he wants, because as a child everyone ever told him how things were not possible and he did them anyway, he basically just ignores conventional wisdom on how magic is supposed to work. Keeps being told he needs a wand but he doesn't and can't get his to work so he fakes using it, or he's told it's impossible to aperate within hogwarts and does so anyway. No one can figure out how he does these things except Hermione, who is aghast so they write it off as because he's the boy who lived. Dumbledore keeps sending Snape to fix problems harry causes without realizing it or meaning to and drives snape of the deep end. He gets along great with luna, and by sixth year dumbledore finally realized harry had become and obscurial since a young age and survived this becomes the power he knows not.

These are not so much the character saying fuck it but his actions basically ignoring the norms unintentionally to the detrimental sanity of others. Sorry I can't provide links but I read them a while back and can't find them either.
