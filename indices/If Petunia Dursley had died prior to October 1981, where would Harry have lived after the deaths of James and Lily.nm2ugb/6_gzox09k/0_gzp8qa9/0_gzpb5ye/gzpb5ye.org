He was in some way, related to Dorea and she's a Black. Given that Lily had no other living relatives, Andromeda and Narcissa could still be a possibility, even if there's no direct relation between them.

Looking for the Potter's family tree (not that any of it is cannon, but we can have an idea either way) on google, it says that Henry Potter is Charlus cousin, meaning he is James' cousin twice removed and Harry's cousin trice removed, making Dorea Harry's cousin trice removed by marriage. This same supposed family tree says that Euphimia was a Grengrass (we don't know, truly, but if werey going with it, might be possible).

That would mean Harry could grow up with Daphne and Astoria as well.
