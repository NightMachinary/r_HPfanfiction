If Lily had no known living relatives Harry could very well go to a Potter related family. James was Sirius' cousin twice removed, if I'm not mistaken. His grandmother (or something, we don't know the exact relation between Dorea and James) was a Black, I think. Harry could have ended up being placed with Andromeda (most probably if the Ministry had no say in it), or Nacissa.
