Probably with Lily's next closest relative.

There is a big difference between a functional “no family” and “no one who shares blood for a blood-dependant magic spell.”

Lily's parents and grandparents predeceased her. But did her grandparents have siblings? Did her great-grandparents have siblings? Did her great-great grandparents have siblings? Did any of those people have descendants who yet live?

It's usually possible to find someone with a blood connection if you look hard enough. That grandparent's sibling's child would be the same generation as Lily's parents, and would only be Harry's first cousin once removed. Their child (same generation as Petunia) would be Harry's second cousin.

If we have to go a generation further back, we're talking second cousins once removed and third cousins. Still plenty of ‘Lily's blood' to power a spell.
