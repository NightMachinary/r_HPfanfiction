Chiming in with anecdata to support your stance: My neighbour is a direct descendant of Charles II, but this does not make her royal. Charles II was notorious for his many mistresses, and 400 years later it is probably hard to have English ancestry and NOT be related to Charles II, which means my neighbour would be related by blood to hundreds of people she has never met. "Blood relation" (therefore able to use the blood protection) is different to "family". I imagine it may be weaker than a full sibling but it would be better than nothing.
