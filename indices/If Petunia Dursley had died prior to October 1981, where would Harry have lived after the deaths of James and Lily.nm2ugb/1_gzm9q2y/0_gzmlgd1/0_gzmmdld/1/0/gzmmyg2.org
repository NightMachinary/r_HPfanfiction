JK was using the general, more intimate version of “no family”. There was no need to challenge it, because Petunia is still alive.

But she /also/ said that James had “no family” and yet that “all purebloods are related” - two statements that directly contradict one another. Harry must have blood relations on his father's side /because/ all purebloods are related. But James did not have any immediate family that survived him, apart from his son.

The same is true of Lily. No one exists in a vacuum. Everyone has ancestors - and therefore distant relatives. JK never denied this.
