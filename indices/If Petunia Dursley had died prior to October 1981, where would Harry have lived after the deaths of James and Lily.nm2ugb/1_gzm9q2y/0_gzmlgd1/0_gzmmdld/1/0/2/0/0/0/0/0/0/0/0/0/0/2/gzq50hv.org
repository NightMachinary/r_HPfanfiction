/When Harry looked into the Mirror of Erised in 1991, he saw both his maternal and paternal grandparents, among a number of other relatives he had never met.[9/

From the wiki. Harry has lots of relatives. If you read the book, he has a number of great aunts and uncles on MATERNAL and PATERNAL sides. All of which could have lives and were off somewhere else.

You are wrong. Accept it and move on.
