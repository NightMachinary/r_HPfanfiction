I don't care whether you agree with me or not. I am not even arguing that the situation Harry's in makes sense. The whole thing started out was from me pointing out that JK said she wanted Harry to be alone for plot purposes. That's something she actually said. If you have a problem with that, take it with her, not with me because I can't re-write the story to comply with your needs.
