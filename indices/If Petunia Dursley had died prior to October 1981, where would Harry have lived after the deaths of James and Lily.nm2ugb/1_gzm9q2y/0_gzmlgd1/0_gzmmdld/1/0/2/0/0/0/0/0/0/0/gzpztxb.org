Okay that is the most ignorant statement ive ever heard.

You can still write a story about magic and fantasy but portray it REALISTICALLY.

If I wrote a story about a zombie apocalypse and literally nobody died - thats unrealistic. If I wrote a story about a three year old girl with powers and she was cussing and going to Harvard at four years old - thats not realistic.

Literally nobody here agrees with you.

Unless literally every single family member of Lily's has been an ONLY CHILD UNTIL LILY AND PETUNIA - it is ABSOLUTELY NOT possible for her to not have distant cousins or aunts or uncles. It's NOT POSSIBLE. Get over it.
