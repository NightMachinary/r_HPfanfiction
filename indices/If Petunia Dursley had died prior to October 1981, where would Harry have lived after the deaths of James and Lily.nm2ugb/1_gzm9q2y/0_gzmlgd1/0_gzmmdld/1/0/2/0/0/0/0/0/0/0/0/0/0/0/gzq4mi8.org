Oh my god...you are a real person in this planet I cant believe anyone could be this idiotic ....

It. Is. Not. Scientifically. Possible. For. Harry. Not. To. Have. Distant. Relatives. Alive.

Its not possible.

Literally. Do you SERIOUSLY - like in ALL SERIOUSNESS - believe that Lily's ENTIRE LINEAGE OF EVANS were absolutely NOTHING BUT /ONLY CHILDREN/?

like, nobody in their entire family EVER had brothers or sisters AT ALL?

Its not possible, dude.

Harry also comes from a long line of purebloods. Literally the Potters are closely related to the Blacks.

Andromeda and Tonks is literally Harry's cousin like God knows how many times removed.

Malfoys are also related to Harry. By distant blood.

So are the Notts. And the Greengrasses.

They are all related.

Living relatives.

And on Lily's side there are brothers and sisters on Lily's side. Dont be dense, dude. Its not possible.
