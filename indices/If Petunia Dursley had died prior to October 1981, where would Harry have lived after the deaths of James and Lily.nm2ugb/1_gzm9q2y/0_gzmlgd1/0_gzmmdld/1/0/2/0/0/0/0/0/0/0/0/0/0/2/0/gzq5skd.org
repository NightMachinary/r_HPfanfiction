That's a mirror projecting an illusion. I can't be wrong about it because I am not arguing against anything. I'm simply parroting what JK said. The only thing I don't think I'm wrong about it is that you are the kind of person looking for unnecessary drama and is obsessed with having the last word. Therefore you can have it in the next comment. This debate is over.
