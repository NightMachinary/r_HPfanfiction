In this scenario, Sirius may not go after Pettigrew. Without Petunia, Dumbledore has no obvious place to send Harry immediately so he may not be able to send to Hagrid to retrieve him and bring him to his new home. Then without Hagrid to insist on taking Harry on Dumbledore's orders, Sirius can't go off and track down Pettigrew. Then Sirius would end up raising Harry, because he'd be able to clear himself as not being the Secret Keeper.
