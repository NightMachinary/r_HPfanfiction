Yes, completely fanon. JK Rowling has said that Harry didn't have a godmother. There's nothing in canon that indicates that the Potters and Longbottoms were friends (let alone close enough to name each other their children's godparents) other than them being in the Order together. Frank and Alice were likely several years older than the Potters, given that they were respected Aurors when they were tortured and Auror training takes three years.
