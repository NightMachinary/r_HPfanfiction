If Harry was taken to his godmother Alice Longbottom directly after the attack the Longbottoms would have had a short time span (ranging from a few days to a few months) to fortify their dwelling even more, rather than downgrading their security in the false belief they were safe from Voldemort.

There is a chance the Death Eater attack was foiled and Harry & Neville grew up like siblings.
