I suspect if that there were no remaining relatives for lily. Dumbledore would try to put him in a magically protected place under someone he could trust perfectly. My first thought was aberforth at the hogs head. But that might be too public for his likening. Perhaps mad eye? Someone trusted, and magically powerful. Though the problem with that is then Harry might have been too headstrong and paranoid for dumbledores plans.

Overall I'm thinking with the long bottoms. They were tortured the day after which is around the time Harry was delivered to the Dursley's. So if he was going to the long bottoms the death eaters would have arrived to the longbottom parents, dumbledore, hagrid, and possibly mcgonagall. Making it a completely different story.
