Without Petunia, I'm not sure Harry would have grown up in the Muggle world. While "protecting him from his fame" was one of the main arguments for putting him there, the main reason was still the Blood Protection.

Assuming that Harry doesn't have any other relatives (which means that the blood protection is not an option), I doubt the Muggle world would have been judged safe enough against all the people who may have an interest toward him (either to use his fame or avenge their Master).

I suppose Harry would ultimately been raised by a Magical Family, but while the decision would (or should) be in the hand of the Ministry, I have no idea about which family would be chosen. Though, while it's up to the author to choose, I would not consider the usual family as suitable:

- The Weasleys are poor (it's an argument since they may not be able to take care of Harry's financial needs), and have already 7 children.
- Depending of the timing, the Malfoys are either still suspected Death Eater or are still doubtfull because of the "Imperius defense".
- Dumbledore (even if he may use his fame to get him) is a very busy man, with no experience with children (and has also a limited interest toward Harry since he doesn't know yet of the Horcrux).

From the usual "guardians", I guess the Tonks would be the best choice (though Andromeda family ties to Sirius may be a bad point), but I don't see any reason they are chosen compared to the tens of unnamed Magical family that would also have volunteered.
