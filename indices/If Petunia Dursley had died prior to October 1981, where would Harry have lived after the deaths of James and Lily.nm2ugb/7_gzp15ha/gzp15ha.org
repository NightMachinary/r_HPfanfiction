First question is, "Does Dumbledore know they're dead?" If not, then presumably whomever CPS sticks with the baby abandoned on some poor bastard's porch in the middle of the night. I don't see new widower Vernon staying in the house he and Pet bought if he can avoid it.

If he does, then probably try sticking Harry with some of her relatives to maintain protections. Which would be more difficult. If that fails, then I'd think a suitable magical family. Maybe the Boneses?
