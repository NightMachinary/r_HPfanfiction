I don't think so, Vernon would've ditched him on steps of some Church or orphanage as harry would be just orphan child of his dead wife's dead sister with no benifit and a already toddler child of his own, and this is if petunia already had Dudley before Lily was murdered. If petunia was involved in whatever that killed elder Evans than existence of Dudley and relationship with Vernon is not possible.
