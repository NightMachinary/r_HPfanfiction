Side note: I don't think that orphanages were around still in Harry's time, he likely would have been put in foster care and as he was a baby, adopted. There's a great fic about Harry who grew up in the foster care system called linkao3(Harry Potter and the â€˜superhero' origin story) that really captures the working class British atmosphere.
