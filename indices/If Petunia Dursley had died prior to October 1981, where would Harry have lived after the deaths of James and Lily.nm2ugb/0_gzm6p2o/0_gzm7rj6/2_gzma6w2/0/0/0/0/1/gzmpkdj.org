I don't know what the English word is. There are some kind of residence (or dormitory I guess) where the children are put before a foster family is found for them (or in some case when the child can't be placed).

I guess they are technically pretty similar to orphanages, except children are not really supposed to stay there. Unlike the orphanages from Riddle time, you also can't just enter there to choose a child to adopt (adoption tend to be a very long process now, in Europe at least).
