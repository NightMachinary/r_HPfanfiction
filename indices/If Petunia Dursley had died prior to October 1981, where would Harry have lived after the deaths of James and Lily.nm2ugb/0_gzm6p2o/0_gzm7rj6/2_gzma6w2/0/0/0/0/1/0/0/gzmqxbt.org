In a sense, though there are some difference (such as the size as said by Serena_Sers).

I think the biggest difference is that these foyers (called "Foyer de l'enfance" in my country so "Children Home"?) are not supposed to be a long term solution. Children are only supposed to be there until a place is found for them (as in a foster family). It can only become long term when there are no other options (like when the children as already been to several families and brought back).

The system is far from perfect and there is regularly adult who grew up there that talk about the experience, but it's still a lot better than most of the old orphanages.

Anyways, a Harry growing up there can still have a very shitty childhood, but it's probably better to not make him like Oliver Twist. Children is these homes are still fed, and not forced to work as an example.
