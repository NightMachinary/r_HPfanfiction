There are similarities between the 2 systems (which is normal since one is used to replace the other), though the name is not the only thing that changed.

As an example, there is a pretty common scene in the "orphanage! fics" (either for a young Riddle or a time traveler Harry) where the children a basically put on display (asked to play in a room), with adults coming and chosing which one they want to adopt.

Such a scene would not be possible with the current system, and adoption could only happen if several conditions are fulfilled (like a child having already lived 6 months with the foster family that want to adopt him).
