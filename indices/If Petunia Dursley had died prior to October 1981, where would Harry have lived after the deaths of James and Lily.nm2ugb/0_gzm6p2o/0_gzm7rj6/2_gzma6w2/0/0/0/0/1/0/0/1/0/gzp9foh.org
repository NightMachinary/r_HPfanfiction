Well, with the current system, the "orphanage" would not have the responsability of finding him a family. There would be a public servant (in the "child protective service" or whatever they call that in the UK) responsible for his dossier while the "orphanage" would only have to take care of him.

Also, considering Tom Riddle circumstances (a healthy baby whose mother just died in childbirth), I don't think they would have any difficulty finding him a family since he doesn't have any "bagage", at least at first.

What could happen is that every Foster Family end up bringing back Voldemort (probably because he did magical things), until no family want to try anymore and Voldemort is stuck into one of these dormitories until he gets his Hogwarts letter.
