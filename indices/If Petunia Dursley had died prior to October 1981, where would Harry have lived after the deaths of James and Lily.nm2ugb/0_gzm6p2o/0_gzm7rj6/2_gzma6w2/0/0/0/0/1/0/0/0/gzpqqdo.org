A children's shelter! You mean a children's shelter! Or a group home. They are very similar. At least, I think that's the U.S. equivalent to a foyer de l'enfance. Also, some children's shelters (at least in the U.S.) could, in fact, give Oliver Twist's orphanage a run for its money in the "Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Place for Children to Live" contest.

Not all of them are bad though.
