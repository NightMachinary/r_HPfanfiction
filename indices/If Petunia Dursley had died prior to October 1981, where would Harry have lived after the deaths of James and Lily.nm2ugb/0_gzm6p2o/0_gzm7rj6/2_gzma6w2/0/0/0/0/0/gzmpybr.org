I don't know what foyer is, but in my country they go into group homes until they find a permanent place to stay and those are very different to orphanages as they have small groups, a family like structure etc. I think it's similar in the other European countries that outlawed orphanages.

Edit: And there are of course so called "Krisenpfegefamilien" which can be translated like foster families for crisis who take children in for a short time if they have no place to stay and need a family immediately (for example if they are babys, toddlers or children with special needs). They can stay there for some month until a permanent place is found if they are orphans or (more often) came from an unsuitable family.
