  Isnt the whole idea of an Orphanage for Orphans to stay there until they grow up or Adopted? I mean if they arent adopted they still grow up there so in a sense it's that same.

It's really not. An orphanage was like an animal shelter but for children. There were no real regulations about how many children lived in one orphanage, no real regulations about what education and what care they got and the main difference was, that an orphanage was a permanent solution while todays variants of children homes, group homes etc have the goal to bring children into families or at least have something close to a family structure.
