Even if Harry died in the forest, Voldemort and the Death Eaters were all but defeated. Harry would of willingly given his life for the protection of everyone else. The reinforcements still would of arrived from Hogsmeade, Neville knew to kill the snake. Would be awesome to see Ron and Hermione start fighting like 2 people possessed though.
