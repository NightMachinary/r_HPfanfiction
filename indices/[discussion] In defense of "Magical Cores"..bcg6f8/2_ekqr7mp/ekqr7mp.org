I just dislike the idea, because wizards are wizards all of them is a wizard

magical cores also feel very video gamey

sorry harry, I cant cast this spell as my mana is low

It does not really fight in harry potter where people throw spells willy nilly and only seem exhusted by the mental and physical exertion

it also does this weird thing with power scaling where its a hard limit

when magic in the hp is difference, you might be talented at one branch and suck at another

it feels like dragon ball z, which as soon as it introduced power levels dropped them in the next arc

I often drop fics unless they are very good that use magical cores

magic might be easier as you cast the spell, but why you need to bring the core nonsence into it

people get better at fencing the more they do it but do they have a fencing core
