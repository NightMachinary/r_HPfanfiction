I actually like Magical Cores. But more along the lines of inner strength. It's not something that could be measured. Wizards don't have X amount of energy and then they collapse. Instead it's a bit like sports. Wizards can exhaust themselves if they cast powerful magic or use a lot of charms in a short time. And with practice this "core" grows somewhat because you use it daily.

So in a wizards duel the cores aren't really what matters. These duels are fought between wizards who have used their magic daily for a long time. It's their skill and creative use of magic that leads to the win.

So, yeah I like magical cores, but as an abstract concept that leads to exhaustion after a while. Especially in the younger years.
