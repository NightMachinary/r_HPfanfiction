I've always been a fan of the idea that magical cores are their own branch of magic and considered a curiosity to most wizards and witches.

I also kind of like the idea that someone who isn't using their core can give it away to a squib but this is something rarely done since a squib can't give it back and most people are reluctant to make such permanent decisions even if they are never going to actually use it.
