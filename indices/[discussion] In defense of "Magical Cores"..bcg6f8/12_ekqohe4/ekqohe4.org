I'm not a huge fan because the ones I've seen with them, it's a reason Harry as a teen can pwn people 3 times his age or something. If you're going to have a “magical core” make it something like it grows as you do letting you do more magic more effectively. The quantifying LF magical cores I find irritating though. I always get a dragonball z vibe from it personally. If it's used well it can be interesting but it's usually not imo. The idea is fine if it's executed properly but the reason people hate on it, like other tropes is because it's generally poorly executed. Also the idea of magical cores being a mana bar is irritating for me because I don't personally read video game fics and that's another vibe I get. I enjoy fics where people try casting spells and they're unable to because their magic hasn't grown enough yet.
