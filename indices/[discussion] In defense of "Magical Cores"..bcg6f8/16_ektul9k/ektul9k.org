I really dislike the name and the whole exhaustible, limited supply thing. - Though I don't have anything against exhaustion in an I've-just-run-a-marathon sense. However, we are clearly shown in Canon that some characters have a greater raw power than others. Knowledge and aptitude and having the right wand and so on are definitely part of it and it does seem to increase with age. But I think all else being equal that, for example, an eleven year old Dumbledore would still have had greater raw power than an eleven year old Goyle.
