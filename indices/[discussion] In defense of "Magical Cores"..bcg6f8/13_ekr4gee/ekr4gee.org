Well, now I'm imagining an entire system of magical organs. A wellspring which synthesises magicites from nutrients/carbs/other energy the wizard/witch takes in, a charger which charges/purifies new/exhausted magicites, and a flowcore responsible for the flow of magicites throughout the body.

And like, if you have an arrhythmic flowcore, then your magic might flow to where you want it to go, which makes your attempts to cast spells do strange things (like conjure a buffalo on your chest).\\
If your charger is borked, it'll overload your magicites or spill extra magic into your lifestream, resulting in too-strong spells and easily-triggered accidental magic, or worse it might not properly recharge your magicites, leaving you with a tiny amount of magic.\\
And if your wellspring doesn't work, it'll eventually leave you with no magicites, which means no way to command magic. So, squib.
