I like the idea of scale or intensity being different. Essentially output should be what varies. Magical exhaustion is stupid. A more powerful wizard will repel more dementors with the patronus, produce larger scale transfigurations, and just in general more intense and area-of-effect. Skill can come into play to mitigate this, reducing requirements and making dueling more efficient.
