  To me, magic is about as quantifiable as 'political power'. After all, nobody has ever said that [insert politician here] has a powerful political core, nor that they their success ever came from a pool of political energy.

To me, magical talent is as quantifiable as intelligence or athletic talent. There are aspects that can be measured, and there are easily observed differences between individuals, but it is so multifaceted and context dependent that reducing it to a number would be reductive. (And yet there are still numpties in real life who go around touting their IQ scores, etc.)

  In the HP series, there is no magical cores or power levels. Sure, you could state truths such as Snape being far more skilled than Harry across the board, but magical cores and magical pools (or mana) don't exist in canon. Snape is much more intelligent than Harry and thus much more skilled at magic by extension, and also worked far harder than Harry if his spell inventions and potion modifications show anything, but magical cores and mana don't exist.

I certainly did not argue for the existence of a "magical core", but what I am saying is that there is a component of magical ability that is not tied to intelligence. If intelligence is all that is needed to be an excellent wizard, why then is it Harry teaching Hermione the Patronus charm and not the other way around? Hermione mastered many spells off-screen, yet this is one where she needs Harry's help with.

  Yes, magic can be detected, but that doesn't mean anything about magical cores and mana. Such a thing would be a basic filter: if a child is capable of magic, they are classed as magical, but if they are incapable of magic, they are classed non-magical. There wouldn't be some squibs who are 30% magical and other squibs who are 0% magical. Either a person is magical or they aren't.

Nothing in humanity is ever binary. As we are learning now, even gender and sexual orientation aren't binary. They exist on a spectrum. Why then would magical ability be binary? My argument is that magical people exist on a spectrum, and that what canon shows as powerful witches and wizards, while having intelligence and other qualities necessary to foster their talents, also have this unmeasurable greater magical talent than other average wizards and witches.

Sure, if a child has magical talent they're classified as magical in the eyes of society. But there are examples throughout canon of people having special talents, such as parseltongue, occlumency, legilimency or metamorph abilities, that others lack. People having a knack for certain branches of magic, like Lockhart with memory charms and Ginny with hexes, that other lack. And they're not necessarily all presented as paragons of intellect. There are examples of children who can consciously harness their magic from a young age like Tom Riddle and Lily Evans while there are children who are late in displaying accidental magic like Neville Longbottom.

These individuals like Voldemort, Dumbledore and Lily Potter, they have some knack for magic that others lack, and I don't think it is solely years of study and long practice that is the key to their feats and powers. It is this ineffable quality that I would call magical talent. And just has there are individuals who have this talent to spare, there must surely be individuals who feel it's lack.
