  I certainly did not argue for the existence of a "magical core", but what I am saying is that there is a component of magical ability that is not tied to intelligence. If intelligence is all that is needed to be an excellent wizard, why then is it Harry teaching Hermione the Patronus charm and not the other way around? Hermione mastered many spells off-screen, yet this is one where she needs Harry's help with.

Because Harry is much better than Hermione at DADA (as well as basically anything else that cannot be solved by quoting the textbook, such as Quidditch). Remember that the only reason Harry even learnt the Patronus when he did was because Lupin taught it to him privately, and the only reason Lupin taught him it was because of Harry's experience with Dementors on the Hogwarts Express. If Harry never had to experience the Dementors, he never would have bothered asking Lupin to teach him the Patronus Charm and he wouldn't know what the Patronus Charm even was. Besides, canon Hermione was never a truly perfect genius and would have spent her time studying magic and history that she actually found useful. We see this with her brewing the Polyjuice Potion because the trio needed to find out what Malfoy knew about the Heir of Slytherin, or studying Magical Law and Magical Creatures to help with Buckbeck/SPEW.

Yes, Hermione is the best student in Harry's year at magic, but being the best in her year doesn't make her a perfect genius who knows everything. It is repeatedly stated and Hermione's OWLs (9 Outstanding + 1 Exceeds Expectations) are further proof of this. *The Patronus Charm is a very unusual spell precisely because it doesn't require prerequisite magical talent or intelligence to perform: just willpower and particularly happy memories. The Patronus Charm and the Unforgivable Curses (at least the Cruciatus Curse) are the rare exceptions to how magic works, not the typical rule of thumb.* The reason Hermione struggles with the Patronus Charm is that while she obviously had a happy childhood, none of those memories were particularly special or notable since her entire childhood would be happy. For someone like Harry, who lived a sad and oppressive life with the Dursleys, his happy memories would be more special to him than Hermione's would be to her due to how rare it was for Harry to be truly happy prior to learning he was a wizard.

We know that Hermione was capable of using the Patronus even in fifth year, so its not like she was incapable of it. She struggled to use it in front of Dementors all that well in DH, but that is because she can't handle pressure like Harry since he has much more actual experience. The fact that Harry taught her the Patronus is due to the Patronus being like almost every single spell in canon and because Harry is just straight-up better than her at DADA. It shouldn't be a surprise that Harry is better than Hermione at DADA since, in reality, DADA is the closest thing to actual combat that Hogwarts formally teaches and the two things that Harry outclases Hermione at, DADA and Quidditch, are the two most physical aspects of magic.

  Sure, if a child has magical talent they're classified as magical in the eyes of society. But there are examples throughout canon of people having special talents, such as parseltongue, occlumency, legilimency or metamorph abilities, that others lack. People having a knack for certain branches of magic, like Lockhart with memory charms and Ginny with hexes, that other lack. And they're not necessarily all presented as paragons of intellect. There are examples of children who can consciously harness their magic from a young age like Tom Riddle and Lily Evans while there are children who are late in displaying accidental magic like Neville Longbottom.

The thing about those talents is that none of them are truly genetic at their core. Parseltongue and Metamorphmagus, while inherited gifts, can be replicated to varying extents. Parseltongue is just hissing so with enough failed attempts and patience, anyone could open the Chamber of Secrets if they knew where it was located. Metamorphmagus are basically just auto-Transfiguring themselves without need for a wand or Potion, but we know magic can replicate this well enough (Polyjuice Potion and Human Transfiguration). Occlumency and Legilimency aren't even special talents since they are learnt abilities that could be learnt by anyone with the right mindset and practice (as proven by Draco in HBP).

Yes, people have a knack for certain branches of magic but in the examples you provided, that is due to practice. Lockhart was actually above average but was very lazy, so only spell he actually put effort practicing was the Memory Charms; his proficiency with other spells got rusty from lack of using them out of laziness. As for Ginny, she is an example of telling rather than showing. Yes, she hexed Zachariah Smith at least once, but Ginny never actually proved to be talented at hexing like how Harry was good at Quidditch/DADA or like how Hermione was good at everything else. The only thing Ginny actually showed herself to be good at is Quidditch, and she proved she's very good at it because she put in practice to become that good.

All it really shows is that hard work gets results. Hermione spends all her time in the library studying and revising; she gets 9 Outstandings and 1 Exceeds Expectations. Ginny spends her childhood practicing Quidditch; she's one of the best Quidditch players in the school. Lockhart's arrogance and laziness causes him to hyperfocus on taking shortcuts; he gets rusty with magic except for Memory Charms, the one thing he actually put hard work into practicing.

As for the accidental magic, that doesn't matter. I'm sure Harry did much more accidental magic than Hermione given the environment he was raised in, yet that doesn't change that Hermione was more intelligent. Magical talent is tied to intelligence, that's just how it is. A nature knack for controlling magic would be a sign of superior general intelligence in most cases, but Tom Riddle nor Lily came with greater mana or magical power than any other child. Any magical child, if they had full control of their underage magic, could do most if not all of those things. Some say that Harry accidentally Apparated in PS, or perhaps he accidentally flew similar to how Lily could float in the air.

Lily's accidental magic, unlike Tom Riddle however, was a matter of Rowling's insistence on making Lily a saintly Mary Sue character. Lily's use of controlled underage magic conflicts with Rowling's actual portrayal of Lily abilities as being at best comparable to Lupin and at her lowest, a tiny bit below him. She never figured out that the Marauders were Animagi when they were all students (its possible she never knew even as an adult), and its strongly implied that Hermione figured out Lupin was a Werewolf faster than Lily ever did. Rowling tells us Lily was a saintly beacon of perfection, but she shown us that Hermione was more intelligent than Lily. Its like she wanted Lily to be a perfect character yet never wrote her actually accomplishments in line with such a thing, as if she couldn't decide on that.

There is a reason that James and Sirius were considered the best in their year, not Lily, even though none of the Hogwarts Professors knew about the Marauder Map or that they were Animagi. There is a reason that Snape is the one who invented many spells and corrected potions, not Lily. There's also the debatable implication by Rowling during HBP that Harry's learning from Snape's annotated textbook was meant to parallel Lily being taught directly by Snape during their earlier years in Potions together. This is because Slughorn compares Harry's Potions talent to Lily despite the fact that Harry's notable Potions talent came entirely from Snape's textbook, then we learn the HBP is Snape, and finally in DH we learn that Snape loved Lily.
