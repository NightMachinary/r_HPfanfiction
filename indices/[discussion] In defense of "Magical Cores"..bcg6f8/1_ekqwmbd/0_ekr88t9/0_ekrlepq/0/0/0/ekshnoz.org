  Do you have a source in canon that backs this up? We are shown that these curses require strong emotion, but it is never shown that they are unique in that regard. In fact Pottermore says this: So it's definitely a sign of Harry's magical ability that he is able to cast this so powerfully as a 13 year old. Harry's unhappy childhood made it harder for him to cast it, not easier. Your reading of this seems incredibly wrongheaded

In OOTP, Bellatrix basically said that intent is all that really matters with them.“Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?” she yelled. She had abandoned her baby voice now. “You need to mean *them*, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain - to enjoy it - righteous anger won't hurt me for long - I'll show you how it is done, shall I? I'll give you a lesson -”. The fact that Rowling opted to use the word 'them' rather than 'it' suggests that Bellatrix's statement applies, likely to varying extents, that it takes a dark intent to use the Unforgivables effectively.

Obviously, the Unforgivable Curses are magically unrelated to each other, but its likely all three became legally unforgivable purely for the fact that simply casting them proved premeditation or malice along with how easy they were to cast; even Crabbe and Goyle, who both failed their OWL exam for DADA as we learn in HBP, could cast the Killing Curse. It would be impossible, for instance, to cast the Killing Curse without prior intent to commit murder. As Bellatrix suggests, simply wanting to hurt someone with Crucio isn't enough since it would require the cast to take true pleasure in making their victim suffer. The Imperius Curse likely falls under a similar thing regarding the desire to brainwash/dominate the victim, given Harry's doubts during the Gringotts heist that his casting was good enough.

As for the Patronus,when I say it doesn't require intelligence to cast, I mean that being good at Charms doesn't help someone cast the Patronus Charm better. Hermione is significantly better than Harry at Charms, but her Patronus is nowhere near as good.

Furthermore, the Patronus Charm isn't even formally taught at Hogwarts at OWL-level, meaning the average wizard isn't going to learn it. If I had to guess, the Patronus Charm would be taught in 7th year DADA, but most wizards wouldn't study DADA at NEWT-level. They'd either get an Acceptable or they would fail outright. I think Fred and George say in HBP that the average wizard can't even do a good Shield Charm, and that would likely be taught in 4th or 5th year DADA.

Remember that for most wizards, the only thing a Patronus actually does is repel Dementors and Lethifolds. That Patronus Messaging feature was invented by Dumbledore and would only be known by members of the Order, not anyone else. Most wizards aren't going to encounter Dementors and Lethifolds, so they would likely never get taught it in Hogwarts, or they would deem the Patronus a useless spell compared to learning more useful magic (like the Undetectable Extension Charm or mastering something like Reparo or Accio).

Unless a wizard was in Azkaban or worked with Dementors, the odds of a regular person encountering one were slim to none so there'd be little reason for people to learn it. Why learn the Patronus Charm when a wizard can learn the infinitely more useful Undetectable Extension Charm, or they can hone their skill at Apparition or the spells/potions they have already learnt? Learning the Patronus Charm would be a waste of time for 99% of wizards since the Dementors in Britain, up until Voldemort's return, were all under Ministry control so the average wizard wouldn't need to fear the Dementors if they being kept under control.

  If Wizard A consistently beat Wizard B in a series of magical duels, them both having similar education and experience, wouldn't you consider Wizard A more talented? And if your answer to this is no, then you clearly have a different view of what magic is than I do. Magic isn't just exams they get graded on, it's what they use to live their lives.

Duels are primarily about reaction time and reflexes/aiming. Even if Wizard B was more intelligent and more magically talented than Wizard A by a significant degree, if Wizard A has much better reflexes or physical reaction speed than Wizard B, then Wizard B's superior talent mean nothing if they can't hit Wizard A. *You are right that Wizard A would be more talented, but being magically talented and being skilled at duelling are two very different things.* Hermione is much more magically talented than Harry across the board, but in a duel, Harry reaction speed and hand-eye coordination is much better, so he'd be fast enough to accurately hit her first. Especially since most of the advanced magic that Hermione actually uses in canon is useless in a duel (e.g. the Protean Charm) but is extremely useful in everyday life (i.e. literally any scenario that isn't a duel), and that is what truly makes her more talented than Harry. We even get a hint of throughout the series with Draco, who is arguably Harry's equal in overall magical talent, yet despite this, Harry won every duel they ever had and is significantly better.
