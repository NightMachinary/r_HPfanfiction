  The Patronus Charm is a very unusual spell precisely because it doesn't require prerequisite magical talent or intelligence to perform: just willpower and particularly happy memories. The Patronus Charm and the Unforgivable Curses (at least the Cruciatus Curse) are the rare exceptions to how magic works, not the typical rule of thumb.

Do you have a source in canon that backs this up? We are shown that these curses require strong emotion, but it is never shown that they are unique in that regard. In fact Pottermore says this:

  The majority of witches and wizards are unable to produce Patronuses and to do so is generally considered a mark of superior magical ability.

So it's definitely a sign of Harry's magical ability that he is able to cast this so powerfully as a 13 year old. Harry's unhappy childhood made it harder for him to cast it, not easier. Your reading of this seems incredibly wrongheaded.

  The thing about those talents is that none of them are truly genetic at their core. Parseltongue and Metamorphmagus, while inherited gifts, can be replicated to varying extents. Parseltongue is just hissing so with enough failed attempts and patience, anyone could open the Chamber of Secrets if they knew where it was located. Metamorphmagus are basically just auto-Transfiguring themselves without need for a wand or Potion, but we know magic can replicate this well enough (Polyjuice Potion and Human Transfiguration). Occlumency and Legilimency aren't even special talents since they are learnt abilities that could be learnt by anyone with the right mindset and practice (as proven by Draco in HBP).

They can be replicated, but with great difficulty. Difficulty those who possess the natural talent don't need to deal with. With Occlumency and Legilimency they can once again be learned with great effort, yet some wizards and witches find it comes to them naturally, like Voldemort. This is my whole point that there is no binary wizard/not wizard. Each wizard has talents that make them special, or a lack of talents that makes them mediocre. And it isn't tied at all to intelligence. Parseltongue is canonically tied to blood. The only reason Harry and later Ron could speak it was because they were holding onto pieces of Voldemort's /soul/.

  Yes, she hexed Zachariah Smith at least once, but Ginny never actually proved to be talented at hexing like how Harry was good at Quidditch/DADA or like how Hermione was good at everything else

That's where you're wrong, Horace Slughorn takes notice of her because of the power of one of her hexes. He's a clear connoisseur of wizarding talent having collected so many up-and-comers of various sorts throughout his career, and she's from a poor blood traitor family. It's clear his reason for inviting her was genuine, and that is canon proof that her hexes are powerful enough to set her apart from other students. Whether you agree with canon or handwave it away as Rowling making a bad choice is on you.

  Lily's accidental magic, unlike Tom Riddle however, was a matter of Rowling's insistence on making Lily a saintly Mary Sue character. Lily's use of controlled underage magic conflicts with Rowling's actual portrayal of Lily abilities as being at best comparable to Lupin and at her lowest, a tiny bit below him. She never figured out that the Marauders were Animagi when they were all students (its possible she never knew even as an adult), and its strongly implied that Hermione figured out Lupin was a Werewolf faster than Lily ever did.

Dumbledore never figured out that Slytherin's monster was a baslisk. Does that indicate at all that Voldemort was stronger than him as a student? Lupin is a professor during PoA, someone that is a prominent figure in the school and whose absence is noticed by all students who take his classes. During their school days, Lupin as a student was just one amongst a crowd. There is no urgent reasons why Lily would need to figure it out as a fellow student and for you to take these two facts to show Lily being the lesser witch is incredible.

Rage about canon all you like, the fact remains that only two characters in canon are shown having controlled magic as children, and one of them was Voldemort and the other was Lily, the witch who came closer to killing him than anyone else save for Dumbledore and Harry.

  Magical talent is tied to intelligence, that's just how it is. A nature knack for controlling magic would be a sign of superior general intelligence in most cases

You are not really showing anything from canon to support this, just your opinions and they are drifting into headcanon territory. Is DADA not a branch of magic? Harry could beat Hermione in a straight up duel throughout most of canon. Yet she is unquestionably smarter than him. You grant that physical talent is a factor, yet then go on to insist that all magical talent is purely mental. By your own admission this is not the case.

If Wizard A consistently beat Wizard B in a series of magical duels, them both having similar education and experience, wouldn't you consider Wizard A more talented? And if your answer to this is no, then you clearly have a different view of what magic is than I do. Magic isn't just exams they get graded on, it's what they use to live their lives.
