  The problem is that like most talents, there should be a distribution curve of some kind. Being human, wizards would no doubt want to measure and compare this somehow, even if the measurement is somewhat questionable.
#+end_quote

To me, magic is about as quantifiable as 'political power'. After all, nobody has ever said that [insert politician here] has a powerful political core, nor that they their success ever came from a pool of political energy. Such success is judged on subjective things like charisma, or perhaps objective truths such as reliability (i.e. how many of their policies from their manifesto did they successfully enact) or general election results.

In the HP series, there is no magical cores or power levels. Sure, you could state truths such as Snape being far more skilled than Harry across the board, but magical cores and magical pools (or mana) don't exist in canon. Snape is much more intelligent than Harry and thus much more skilled at magic by extension, and also worked far harder than Harry if his spell inventions and potion modifications show anything, but magical cores and mana don't exist. Human intelligence translates to magical talent, as demonstrated by every talented witch and wizard in the series, but that doesn't make certain wizards more "powerful". Dumbledore, Voldemort and Grindelwald are geniuses but that is no "magical core" that makes them special. Their supreme talent is an extension of their intellect and their wide knowledge of magic.

  It's mentioned that there are off-screen means used to detect which children have magic, and a tantalizing hint that there may be a subset of individuals who have magic, just not enough to be invited to attend Hogwarts
#+end_quote

Yes, magic can be detected, but that doesn't mean anything about magical cores and mana. Such a thing would be a basic filter: if a child is capable of magic, they are classed as magical, but if they are incapable of magic, they are classed non-magical. There wouldn't be some squibs who are 30% magical and other squibs who are 0% magical. Either a person is magical or they aren't.

The quote you provided is, unsurprisingly, from the very first book. Rowling put several things in book 1 (and to a lesser extent, book 2) that she either retconned in later books. In PS, Hagrid somehow "flew" to the Hut-on-the-Rock despite later book telling us he can't fly brooms or Thestrals due to his size. In PS, we hear second-hand about Draco's tale of avoiding muggle helicopters on a broom pre-Hogwarts; even if Draco was lying or exaggerating, it would still mean that Draco in the first book knew what a helicopter was, showing that pure-bloods were never as ignorant of muggle technology as Arthur Weasley would suggest.

Most notable is that up until Goblet of Fire, the Death Eaters were simply called "Voldemort's followers" as the term Death Eater didn't appear until GoF. Similarly, we didn't get the word Auror in the series until GoF, hence why they were never mentioned in the previous book since they were never mentioned as arresting Sirius.

Remember that we didn't learn what a Squib was until book two, which came after the following book after the quote from Neville. Rowling wouldn't have mentioned Squibs in PS, just as she never mentioned the Death Eaters or the Aurors. So when Neville says "they thought I might not be magic enough to come", the actual implication is that Neville is really saying that his family thought he was a Squib up until he bounced down the garden. Neville not mentioning the word Squib is because Rowling didn't mention it at all in the first book.

  It's fascinating to me because the Kwikspell products were made for someone, even if Filch couldn't get them to work for him.
#+end_quote

I always assumed Kwikspell was made for adult wizards who failed their OWLs or needed brushing up on stuff they learnt up until fifth year. To me, Kwikspell is basically the equivalent of paying a tutor to teach you Maths up to a GCSE-level. For example, if all you have is a GCSE in Maths (or even failed it outright) and you haven't done any serious work with numbers in over a decade or more, you might have gotten rusty or downright forgot how to do fractions or algebra or graphs as efficiently as you could when you were actually studying the subject at school.

When it comes to the OWLs studied by Hogwarts students, many people forget that Exceeds Expectations is above average; the average grade would be Acceptable or maybe a Poor. The average wizard wouldn't do NEWTs at all, or perhaps only study 1-3 subjects; they wouldn't study 5 subjects like Harry and Ron, and certainly wouldn't study 7 subject like Hermione.

An average wizard who took their Potion OWL exam 30+ years ago with, at best an barely-scrapped Acceptable or more likely a Poor/Dreadful, probably isn't brewing Potions much (if at all). Such a wizard would pay Kwikspell to tutor them and while they won't turn out amazing or anything, they'd learn enough to function in society, like how passing your English and Maths GCSEs with a C-grade or higher is really all most people end up needing in society.

So Kwikspell wasn't made for Squibs; Filch was just in denial/delusion, like how Petunia (albeit a muggle) thought she could get accepted into Hogwarts if she wrote to Dumbledore. If anything, Kwikspell was intended for wizards like Stan Shunpike who presumably did poorly at school, or for the average wizard who failed their OWLs for important subjects like Charms/Potions/Transfiguration.

  There are clear gaps in ability between different characters, and it's not always down to intelligence. Crabbe, a complete idiot, is able to cast a powerful Fiendfyre curse.
#+end_quote

But you're conflating the potency of Fiendfyre with their ability to cast it. Nowhere in the series was Fiendfyre ever said to be a difficult spell to cast nor particularly impressive to do. Its a dangerous curse that could potentially kill its own caster, and did so in the case of Crabbe, but Fiendfyre doesn't require anything beyond the average wizard to cast. Its just really, really dangerous to the extend that only a complete idiot would actually use it the way Crabbe did (i.e. using Fiendfyre within an enclosed space that only has one exit, putting the caster's life at risk too). Why else do you think none of the Death Eaters ever use the spell during the entirety of DH, not even Voldemort or the likes of Bellatrix and Dolohov? Its because all of the Death Eaters would still have enough common sense not to use an excessively-dangerous spell that would likely kill themselves when they can just spam the Killing Curse or other duelling spells instead with zero-risk to themselves.
