  To me, magic is about as quantifiable as 'political power'.

Just because you can't quantify it, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. "Political Power" might not be what we name something, but there is definitely something innate that makes some people better politicians than others.

  The quote you provided is, unsurprisingly, from the very first book. Rowling put several things in book 1 (and to a lesser extent, book 2) that she either retconned in later books.

Did she ever retcon that thing about Neville though? If anything, there are other indications throughout the book that hint at some sort of inborn talent that is definitely variable, not just have it or not.
