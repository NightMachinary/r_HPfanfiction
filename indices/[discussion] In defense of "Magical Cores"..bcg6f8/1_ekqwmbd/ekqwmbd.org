The problem is that like most talents, there should be a distribution curve of some kind. Being human, wizards would no doubt want to measure and compare this somehow, even if the measurement is somewhat questionable. It's mentioned that there are off-screen means used to detect which children have magic, and a tantalizing hint that there may be a subset of individuals who have magic, just not /enough/ to be invited to attend Hogwarts

  Great-uncle Algie came round for tea and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my great-auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased. Gran was crying, she was so happy. *And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see.* Great-uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.'

It's fascinating to me because the Kwikspell products were made for someone, even if Filch couldn't get them to work for him.

J K Rowling has poopoo'd this in interviews, saying that if you're a wizard you're a wizard, yet clearly even canon disagrees. She's clearly trying to give a feel good answer to obscure a harsh truth that we aren't all the same and there are children who are more talented and children who are less talented. There are clear gaps in ability between different characters, and it's not always down to intelligence. Crabbe, a complete idiot, is able to cast a powerful Fiendfyre curse.

However, it is never explicitly mentioned in canon, and to me a clear mark of good Harry Potter fanfiction is when an author is able to imply these distinctions of magical ability without explicitly bringing up "core size" or "power levels".
