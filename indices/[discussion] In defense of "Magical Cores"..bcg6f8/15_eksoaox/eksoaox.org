I am pretty neutral to this, but overall I find it a good compromise solution. Magic in HP is OP to the core (excuse the pun), and there is no mention in canon as to how and why some wizards can be more powerful than others. Its obviously not memory, because Hermione would eventually dwarf Dumbledore and Voldie, and its not the mental discipline neither, as Snape is far from being on par with Dumbledore.

Magical cores are a neat solution to this, as your power level is an innate thing. The concept gets too much crap. And its not like someone with a weaker core will always lose to someone with a stronger one. Its just that raw power will be different and it gives a somewhat ok explanation as to why.
