My own thoughts sort of go along with the starter of the thread but i always viewed it as a mix of four things.

1. Natural inborn talents of magic, humans are a diverse lot so some of us have knacks for different things. A good example could be people who just get math, others don't. How nievelle just was good a herbology and Harry DADA.
2. Natural intelligence and use of intelligence factor's in a lot hence Hermione, Albus, Tom etc. all were suppose be the greatest of their generations in ways.
3. i always believed in a "Magic Muscle" so to speak. the more you use it, the easier it becomes to use and stronger. the better trained it is. Different people would have very different limits here based on factors here. the muscle becomes stronger and stronger, and like a real muscle some people have different limits, natural factors for using it. Combine the first two to use it better < IE, working out smarter rather then over training and not using your intelligence, or How some people are better at squats or dead lifts due to the body>
4. magic core. Yes, i do believe in a core per say.. its more just the amount of natural magic one can hold, while others can hold less or more which can be increased by age or rituals <as mentioned tom did stuff to himself in canon and fanon>. Its also filled by outside given a small amount of time.. This explains alot. think of it as a cup refilled by magic that just exists in the earth? universe. reasons below a muggle has no pool at all, just the difference here. a squib has one which allows their bodies the health benefits of it. they need a touch of magic to do Potions and protect them. Squibs magic core allows them to see the world but their magic muscle and core are so weak they can't do much of anything.

these 4 tie together.. a squib maybe Low in the bottom 2 so unable to use the first two fully as the talent and intelligence can only do so far. But look at characters like Albus, and tom. they are the rare people who would be great in all four.
