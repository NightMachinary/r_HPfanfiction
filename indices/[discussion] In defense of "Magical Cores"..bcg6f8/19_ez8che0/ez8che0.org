He was honestly appalled. There were a few students that were convinced that magical power was determined from birth thanks to some kind of magical core, an absurd notion if there was ever one.

"It has come to my attention that there are many misconceptions between the students about the nature of magic. I have decided to take it upon myself to clear as many of them as possible" Harry spoke softly, his voice smooth.

This was his sixth year NEWT class, what should have comprised only the most talented. Of course, because of the discontinuous teaching of Defense the grades had to be adjusted and therefore many students could barely produce a solid shield.

Harry walked between the desks, the enchantments in the classroom making sure he was heard regardless of his position "I won't start a philosophical debate with you today" he continued, to the relief of a few "I shall explain to you all what little we understand of the reality changing force that is magic thanks to observation, trial and error for thousands of years. Magic is, quite simply, the exception to every rule of nature; it is one of the primordial energies that composed the universe at his birth".

As he said this, Harry drew his wand, and thanks to a bit of fancy spell-work the walls, floor and ceiling of the classroom resembled the outer space "The universe is vast and unexplored by the likes of us humans. We should not be arrogant enough to believe it to be an open book: many are the mysteries that humanity cannot hope to comprehend"

With another practised flick, the scenery changed back to the classroom, leaving awed students. Before they could regain their senses, Harry flooded the room with pure unaltered magic, making everyone feel dazed by the sheer amount. It was a bit of a dirty trick, as he merely guided the natural magic of Hogwarts to condense in the room, but he was a bit of a showman. He let go of it, allowing it to return to its mysterious patterns.

"Then why, you may ask, are we able to wield this immense power as if it was natural? Unfortunately, the specifics of such are still unknown, but many speculations have a few humans that had lived near a particularly strong source of natural magic to have developed a 'sense' for it. It would have, with time, changed in what we know today as the ability to wield magic".

There were many nods, but a few looked confused.

"Professor, why are there a few wizards of such power then?" Asked Matilda Smith, a Hufflepuff. Her classmates made murmurs of agreement, thinking about Dumbledore and Voldemort, a few even of their Professor.

Harry's lips stretched wide, like a cat who ate a canary "Now that is the burning question, isn't it? Why do a few gifted manage to become so powerful. To understand this, we have to take a step back. Basically, magicals interact with the omnipresent magic, as it's a figment of the universe's reality, and use it for numerous purposes. Magical 'power' is in reality the ability to manipulate this primordial force. The more one understands it, the more one uses it, the more one's body is capable of sustaining the effort, the more one is 'powerful'".

The Professor gave his students a few moments to process it all, and was rewarded when everyone started to get it. Harry smiled and decided to simplify it even further, for the sake of the few hard-headed ones "In the end, it all comes down to how much you know about how the spell works, how much in tune with magic you are, how fit you are and how much practice you have. Think of your magical ability as a muscle. It is the brain which gives you the order to move, and the more you have exercised it, the more strength it will produce; if you know how to do the task at hand well, you'll be able to minimize the effort. It's as simple as that" he continued, staring in the distance and thinking about how much easier his life would have been if he had a proper magical education.

Harry shook his head and decided to wrap things up "It is true that a few are born either more in tune with magic, or more talented in a determined field, but it is the same with physical constitution. Muscles can be built, and so can magical skill, one has only to have the dedication for it".
