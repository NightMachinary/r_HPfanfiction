Any attempt to put numbers on power will fail because 1) Power isn't numerical and depends on the scenario and 2) it traps the author into needing to pull even more asspulls than normal if they want to overcome. It also gets people into the "Bigger is better" cycle where the new enemy needs to have a far larger number than the last one.
