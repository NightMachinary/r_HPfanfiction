  I don't like mana pool because canon absolutely never even implicitly mention it.

It really depends on what you see mana pool as. If it is something finite that doesn't grow than it isn't implicitly mentioned. If you view it as some inborn power that varies per person and experiences growth, there are hints of it throughout the books.
