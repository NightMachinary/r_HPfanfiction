You could argue that Voldie had some latent/inherent inborn talent, to be able to do what he supposedly did before Hogwarts.

The idea of "mana pools" feels wrong to me, but I don't see anything wrong with some people being "stronger" than others. Someone naturally smarter will have an easier time developing their magical talent, no?
