My main problems with magical core is that in brings the idea of "inborn talent" and "mana pool".

I don't like mana pool because canon absolutely never even implicitly mention it. Magic is a mental exercice, like solving equations. A wizard can end up too tired to do any spells (even if he would then be 2 mn away to fall asleep standing up) but I hate the idea that a wizard could stop casting spell in the middle of the fight because he is empty.

As for inborn talent, it's mainly because I don't think it goes well in HP universe. Not only does it bring a system of "cast" (Your magical core is only worth 75, no matter how hard you train you will always be a trash, I am born with a magical core of 120 so I am superior) that I don't like, but it also doesn't fit with Harry Potter magical system.

For example, in Harry Potter, the most powerful spells (most damaging one) come from the Dark Art. But the Dark Art is "hard" to practice since it mainly focus on emotion. Even a trained monkey like Crabbe can make a lot of damages with spell like the killing curse just because he want to kill hard enough. On the other hand, Dumbledore doesn't use Dark Art, doesn't destroy a lot of things and yet he is more powerfull.

Another example is the spell Fiendfyre. 2 people use it in Harry Potter, Crabbe and Voldemort (at least in film, would have to make sure in books). One spell destroyed everything in the Room of requirement, including the caster, the other only tried to kill 2 people. Which spell did the most damages? Crabbe's. Which spell was the most difficult? Voldemort's.

This is why I don't even like the mention of magical core in Harry Potter (Well that and all the lazy writing of Harry being OP because Magical Core).
