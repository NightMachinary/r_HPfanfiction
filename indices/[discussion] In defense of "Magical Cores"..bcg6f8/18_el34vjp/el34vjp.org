This is how I view it... (It's what I use in my fanfics)

Genetic traits that govern magic capabilities. It kinda fits canon too.

Magic core (M or M') incomplete dominant gene. Everyone has it, but the strength is different. + MM - powerful + M'M & MM' average + M'M' - weak

Mage circuit (C or c) mage circuit is recessive. It's like a circulatory system to magic, so while everyone has magic not all has the potential to use magic. +CC true muggles + Cc & cC wizarding descent + cc Wizard/witch

I view magic like a cardiovascular system. Everyone can walk or run but not everyone can be a sprinter or a triathlon.

Circuit suppressor (S or s) suppressor is a dominant gene. +SS True muggle +Ss Muggle descent +ss wizard/ witch

Types of squibs

Core squib (hedge wizard) - has M'M' genes, not powerful enough to cast wand magic. Kinda like a person with weak heart.

Circuit squib - has a Gene suppressor but otherwise capable of magic - curable

Support squib - has inbreeding defect so severe that magic is rerouted to life support function. - curable
