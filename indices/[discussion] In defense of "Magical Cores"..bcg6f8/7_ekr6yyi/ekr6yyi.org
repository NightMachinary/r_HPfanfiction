My problem with Magical Cores is that it flies in the face of everything that magic canonically is. There is no evidence of anyone being more innately powerful than anyone else, Dumbledore and Voldemort are considered to be as powerful as they are because of how much they know and intuitively understand about magic. I would argue that you could cast spells of various kinds all day and your arm would fall off before you "ran out of magic". I know that some people would point to Harry's struggles with learning the Patronus spell and him looking exhausted after each session he has, but that's clearly because of the mental and emotional strain of having to face down his Dementor Boggart each time.
