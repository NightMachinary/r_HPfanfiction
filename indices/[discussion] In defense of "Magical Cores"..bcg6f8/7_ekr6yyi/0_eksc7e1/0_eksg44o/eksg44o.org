  On the run out of magic topic we know that Harry was exhausted while training the Accio spell

See my above comment regarding the Patronus spell. It is entirely possible to exhaust oneself doing a purely mental task (ask any University undergraduate), when you consider just how much of an energy hog the Human brain is. Add to that the ephemeral nature of magic, which I believe is connected intimately to the soul (which is why we generally only see ghosts of wizards and witches, not Muggles (the echo of Frank Bryce that came out of Voldemort's wand near the end of book 4 being an obvious exception, and one I ascribe to how the Killing Curse is represented via Priori Incantatum)), and when one considers that the soul is theoretically infinite, so is a wizard's or witch's capacity for spellcasting, which I argue is limited by knowledge retention primarily.
