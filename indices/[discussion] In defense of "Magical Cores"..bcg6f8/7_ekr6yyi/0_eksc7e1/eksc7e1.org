Wizards in fantasy usually differ from Sorcerers in having their own source of power instead of using external energies. So, magical reserves should always be a thing, just not necessarily important enough to mention them as every magical human could simply be born with the same, making skill, efficiency, what truly matters.

On the /run out of magic/ topic we know that Harry was exhausted while training the Accio spell, not really a physical activity but perhaps mentally, and Dumbledore.. well, there were many other factors for him. The truth is that we must ignore canon simply because we are never show /shit/ in the books. JKR never expanded on how training their magic affected the students, she cared more about fancy rocks and childish rivalries.

For all we know magic grows by eating and Ron is the strongest wizard alive!! ~sigh, Poor Ron.
