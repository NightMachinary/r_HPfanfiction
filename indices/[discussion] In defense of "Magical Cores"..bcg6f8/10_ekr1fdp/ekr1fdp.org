I don't have problem with magical cores /per se/: I know the canon says nothing about it, but it doesn't say anything about many topics, and it is quite possible that magic works as a any other power in humans, and one just does get tired and one is more powerful than other.

What I *do hate* is the ultra-powerful Harry (or Ginny, etc.). It usually leads to lazy writing, poor plot design, etc. The only two wizards in Britain who have right to be more powerful than others are Dumbledore and Tom Riddle. Other may be more experienced and trained (e.g., Moody in duelling), but when Ginny explodes a head of a werewolf (or Draco Malfoy) in linkffn(The Bonds of Blood by Darth Marrs) by the Bat-Boogey Hex, it just breaks the universe.
