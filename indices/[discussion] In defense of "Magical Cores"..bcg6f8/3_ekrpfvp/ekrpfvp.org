I don't care about most tropes, you can give me Lord Hadrian Potter-Evans-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Pendragon that has a soul bond with Tom Riddle, also has a magical contract with Draco, Daphne, Padma, and Ginny, has a veela-bond with Hermione, a life debt with the Weasley family and I will read it as long as it's written well.

Magic as a Mana Pool isn't really a problem, a magical system with limitation is good. It could become a problem when a person could cast a certain spell endlessly. Most people here seems to think that magic is a mental excercise, but does it basically any different with mana pool? I mean you could only use magic as long as you're not mentally exhausted (mana pool isn't empty) and using magic is tiring because you're using your mind (mana) constantly.

I don't like it when people began to use magical core/mana pool to create a numerical scale. Something like 'Dumbledore is a high magus because he is a YY level on XX system' or 'Goyle is almost a squib because he's only YY level' just doesn't sit right to me. Magic in HP is soft, there shouldn't be any system that can be used to determine if a person is more magical than the other. Of course I hate when magical core is used to powerboost your MC.

I don't care if that's your headcanon tough, as long as you don't use it explicitly in a fic I wouldn't mind.
