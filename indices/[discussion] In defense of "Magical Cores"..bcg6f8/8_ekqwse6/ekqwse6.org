  Magical Cores are just the Mana/PP pool a certain which or wizard has available for use.

This is exactly why I don't like magical cores. Trying to apply some sort of video game logic to magic is as dumb and useless as midichlorians in Star Wars. It's magic; it doesn't need to be explained, it doesn't need to be quantified, it just exists.
