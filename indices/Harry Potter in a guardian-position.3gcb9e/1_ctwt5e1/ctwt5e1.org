These are the nicest and best I've seen so far (though admittedly I haven't read much in this area). They're really great, the first short story, which starts out a little awkwardly, is just sort of an introduction to the second longer one. They are epilogue-compliant, but don't match some of the things JKR continues to share on Pottermore.
