My guess is that "coot" is such an unusual and old-fashioned sounding word that authors think it fits the Harry Potter universe. And it doesn't sound out-of-place for a politically powerful young Lord Potter-Black-Peverell to say it in a formal Wizengamot setting, as it would if he'd said "Dumblefuck".

Once it entered mainstream fanon, authors began using it because everyone was familiar with it, and probably assumed it was canon or based on canon. Because Voldemort says something similar - he calls Dumbledore an "Old fool" at some point in the books.

Epithets tend to be lazy writing, especially if they're recycled and regurgitated common ones. "Bushy haired bookworm" and "Green-orbed Gryffindor" are the worst. If you're writing a fanfic and use epithets in narration instead of actually using people's fucking /names/, you're doing it wrong.

Don't do this, for the love of Merlin.
