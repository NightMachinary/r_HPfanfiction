Man “orbs” instead of eyes is the /worst/

I just picture these horrible green painted pebbles lodged in someone's eye sockets. Makes me think the whole eye has become distended and bulging and entirely green. No thanks

Yeah epithets suck. My pet peeve is slash where the author constantly uses “the shorter wizard” because it has weird sexual power dynamic implications and also like, come on. How often are you thinking about someone's hight/eye color/crappy hair irl?
