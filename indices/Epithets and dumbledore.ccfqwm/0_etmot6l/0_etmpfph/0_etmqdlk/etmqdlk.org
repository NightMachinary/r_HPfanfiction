The reason why slash authors do it is because they're trying to avoid ambiguous pronouns. Compare "She took off his shirt" to "He took off his shirt" for a sexy scene with two partners. The hetero pairing makes it obvious who's doing what actions, but with the slash pairing it's unclear.

They think that it's clunky and slows the flow of a sentence to refer to someone's name every time they reference the character. Because they can't use pronouns (he/him/his) without it becoming ambiguous who's doing what action, they instead refer to hair color, eye color, Hogwarts house, or broomstick preference.

  The green-orbed Firebolt-owner took off the blonde Nimbus 2000-owner's shirt.

Now we're cooking!
