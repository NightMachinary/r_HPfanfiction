I thought it was one of these canon details that I forgot. It's really strange how it's always exactly the same phrases.

I read some fics where it was Petunia (or Vernon) who made sure to mispronounce his name, just because she's bitter and they have history. And it made sense, you know.

It's a real mystery why old and new fics alike make sure to use it. It really does not bring anything at all, and is even less impactful now that it became a gimmick.

But I'll guess that it's probably more like the use of Voldyshort (which makes no sense at all, for me) and others in this vein; a way to take part in the fanon community more than anything else and to show that Harry is not in league with either/has no respect for them?
