If you haven't read any of Brennus' stuff give them all a look, he enjoys tackling overdone cliches and giving them a bit of a spin. Slytherin Harry, Never went to Hogwarts adult Harry, Marriage contract, and I believe he's currently working on a super powered Harry story. All his stories are H/G and he doesn't publish stories until he's finished writing them so you don't have to worry about abandoned fics.
