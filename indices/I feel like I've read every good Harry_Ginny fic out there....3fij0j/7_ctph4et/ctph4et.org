Have you read [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129747][The Thorny Rose Trilogy]] by Brennus? It's a H/G fic with viewpoint from Ginny. One of the more upbeat stories out there, reads like a train and I'm still not bored of it after reading it thrice. I looked over it because of I didn't know it had multiple stories at first.
