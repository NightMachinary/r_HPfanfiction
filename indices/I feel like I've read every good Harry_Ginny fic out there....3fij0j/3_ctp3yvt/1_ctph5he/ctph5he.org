  It's very AU as it was written before OotP but it's probably one of the best fics about the pairing and one of the classics in the HP fandom.

I loved it when I read it because of the excellent writing and adventure/Drama elements, not to mention the wonderful characterization of Draco Malfoy, but I wasn't a fan of the Harry/Ginny romance. Ginny was too OOC. Unavoidable, given that it was a story written pre-OoTP, but it jarred at the worst possible moments.
