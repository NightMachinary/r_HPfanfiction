You say you've read most of the major novel length fics so I'm not going to recommend the obvious. However, have you read [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=619][After the End]]? It's very AU as it was written before OotP but it's probably one of the best fics about the pairing and one of the classics in the HP fandom.
