You haven't. I have been reading fanfics for years now and I still find one that captures my interests every couple of weeks. There are thousands of them, and many of the obscure ones are the best (I am not really a fan of the stereotypical soulbond!Harry/Ginny).

I am planning to make a masterlist of Harry/Ginny stories soon (I've already got about 45 really good ones, there are still a few on my reading list yet), but till then here are three relatively obscure ones that you might not have come across:

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=12260][Curse Breakers: The Maya]] : /Thirty year old Ginny Weasley is the preeminent curse breaker in Central America. Her job allows her to ignore the aftermath of the Second War, but when she is given a new assignment, she finds that the Mayan tombs hold not only the keys to the ancient civilization, but the key to the ghosts that still haunt her and Harry Potter/

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4130255/1/Phantom-Limb][Phantom Limb]] : /A young man realizes he's been the victim of a prophecy. He struggles to make sense of his place in an unfamiliar world. Sound familiar? Nothing's familiar to this young man. Nothing except his aunt Arthur. New readers: give this one some time./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/637123/1/The-Phoenix-and-the-Serpent][The Phoenix and the Serpent]]: /The Dark Lord has conquered death, but Dumbledore's plan may yet gain a bloodless victory. Joined by a pair of unlikely bodyguards, an aging Auror and a brash Duomancer, Harry must leave behind everything--his friends, his school, even the girl he loves--to find the one thing that may defeat Voldemort. But can even the Boy Who Lived succeed if the journey should take him to the darkest part of his heart?/
