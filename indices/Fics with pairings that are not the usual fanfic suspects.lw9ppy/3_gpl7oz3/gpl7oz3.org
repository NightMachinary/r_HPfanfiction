Aside from those two, Jeconais on [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/][fanficauthors]] has several solid fics with pretty out there pairings. I especially recommend the two longer Harry/Gabrielle fics, White Knight, Grey Queen, and Blue Steel (which doesn't have a real pairing, but dances around some very unusual ones)
