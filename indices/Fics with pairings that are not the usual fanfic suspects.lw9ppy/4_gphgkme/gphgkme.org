Can't think of too many super long ones atm but here's what I got:

This is Harry/Romilda: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12407725/1/A-Question-of-When]])

This one is Harry with Fem!Tom (though romance isn't the focus). linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7186430/1/]])

This one has Harry/Penelope (though also not a focus of the story): linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959046/1/The-Lesser-Sadness]])

If you're into rarepairs that don't involve Harry, there's Arthur/Bellatrix: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19393591]]) and Arthur/Petunia linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11676102/chapters/26278335]]) The second one is part 1 of a longer series.
