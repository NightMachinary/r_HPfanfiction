Closest thing I can think of is a 5th year fic where just before harry attacks malfoy after the match the chasers stop him and the twins by kissing them. Katie and Alicia the twins and angelina harry. It wasnt a bad fic but they shoehorned Hermione into the relationship and while I dont dislike the harmony pairing I dont like when they use another pairing to force it.
