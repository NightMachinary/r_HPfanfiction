I on the other hand frankly prefer to either make divination a developed enough art that we can get an actually reasonable explanation for how the prophecy came to be while creating a standard level of either how much it is relevant (must it be completed as said or not? Is the exact wording important or just the general idea? Can it be circumvented? Is it self-fulfilling? Etc).

Play it for shit and giggles by using it to make situations progressively more ludicrous until reality can't take it anymore and quits.

Or just do away with it and make up some other excuse.

F. ex.: Voldemort went after Harry because the date of his birth -the last day of the seventh mont-/ his linage/whatever could be used in a ritual to boost his powers; Lily's ritual messed it though and made it so they share their total magical power instead of it being all Voldemort's, so now he have to kill Harry to go back to his full-power.

Harry originally had all his growing power plus Voldemort's until Voldy comes back and pulls his half back into himself plus some more; as Harry always relied mostly on Voldemort's power he now has to actually build his own reserves to the point of being able to fight Voldemort while playing what amounts to tug of war with his enemy (who is much more experienced in such things) over their shared might.

Voldemort on the other hand has to deal with having an unstable grip on his magic which prevents him from doing things he previously would think nothing about -such as fighting singlehanded a large number of skilled opponents or dueling Dumbledore one-on-one- until he can kill Harry to get back to being almost invincible.

Other things could also play a part in their rivalry, such as the blood protections rendering Voldemort unable of taking an unlimited amount of magic from Harry or truly killing or gravely injury him directly and through his DE until he reaches seventeen years of age.

P.S.: Was just trying to make an example of how to circumvent the prophecy entirely but then it kind of grew beyond control and I liked the overall idea, will make a prompt with it
