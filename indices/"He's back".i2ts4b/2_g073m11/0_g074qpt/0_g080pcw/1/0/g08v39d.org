Definitely. If I were to make a prophecy in any book I work on, I would include some pretty obvious hints in hindsight that make it obvious EXACTLY who the hero is. It's a big, red flag for anyone with knowledge at what I'm hinting. Though yes, the prophecy would be vague, but only one person would be the clear hero.
