Tell me about it, in ASOIF the prophecy of the prince that was promised for example is so open to interpretation that it could point pretty much to any of the characters. Even the term /prince/ isn't enough to take /anyone/ out of the run as prince and princess are said the same way in the language the prophecy was made.

In the end most of us decided to just ignore the prophecy in it's entirely and then just act properly surprised when the GRR Martin finally cut the chase and give a BS explanation that only makes sense in hindsight despite the fact that it could be used to describe anyone depending on how far we are willing to stretch it.

Really, most cases prophecies are just used as a generic excuse for plot-devices.
