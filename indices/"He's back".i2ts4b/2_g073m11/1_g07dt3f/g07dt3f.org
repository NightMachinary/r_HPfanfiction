Forgive me if I'm wrong, but from a canon point of view isn't the actual importance of the prophecy debatable. Dumbledore seems to indicate that the real value is that 'Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy', a phrase that indicates in itself that the prophecy isn't inevitable. Furthermore, the prophecy runs:

#+begin_quote
  /The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies.../
#+end_quote

Whilst one might interpret 'the one' as an indication that no-one else could it could also be interpreted as a sign that Harry is the one with the /power/ not necessarily the only person who could. The main import of the prophecy is that /either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives/. The phrase 'neither can live' is interesting here, it doesn't seem to suggest that once one is dead the other is invincible, but that (given that both are technically alive for large portions of time) whilst they live their lives will be consumed by this battle.

Harry is uniquely positioned to defeat Voldemort, but I am not certain that it is set in stone that he is the only one who could ever defeat him.

Anyway, I do agree it would be interesting to see that scenario.
