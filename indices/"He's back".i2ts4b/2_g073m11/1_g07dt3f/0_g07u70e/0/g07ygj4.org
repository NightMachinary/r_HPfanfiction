'Dumbledore is saying that the prophecy is completely true'. Your interpretation isn't one I'd dispute in a sense, however, the fact that 'thing that makes it true is the people involved' does suggest that it doesn't guarantee immortality which is really the point I was trying to make.

I agree with your assessment entirely, it's just that that assessment doesn't prove that Voldemort is functionally immortal if Harry dies.
