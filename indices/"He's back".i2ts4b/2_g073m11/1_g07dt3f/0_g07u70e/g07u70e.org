Dumbledore is saying that the prophecy is completely true, but the thing that makes it true is the people involved. There's nothing that the prophecy says that isn't blindingly obvious to anyone. It was totally self-fulfilling. In other words, it's not predestination, it's just saying the obvious after it made the obvious happen.

As soon as Voldemort heard the prophecy, it was guaranteed to play out that way. Voldemort was always going to try to kill whoever he thought could beat him. Lily would never have abandoned her son to go be Snape's widow waifu. Therefore Harry would always have the blood protection. Therefore Harry would always survive, with a massive grudge against Voldemort that would ensure he would never peacefully coexist with him. Voldemort's pride would never allow him to let his defeat stand without publicly murdering Harry. Therefore they were always going to fight until one of them died.

The reason Harry is the one with the power to defeat the Dark Lord is because the Dark Lord has to publicly be seen to kill him. If that weren't the case, Harry would have died ten times over.
