I do agree with you on the point that Prophecies aren't set in stone. Prophecies by themselves are somewhat a very confusing and complex thing, according to me at least.

Let's start by /assuming/ that Prophecies are true, word of god, bound to happen whatever. But the gist of it is, what they predict happen. So assume it as case 1. In case 1, let there be subcases:

1. Voldy takes the prophecy seriously, decides to go ahead with his murder plan, kills the Potter parents. Basically, what happened in canon. Now in this case, the prophecy was self fulfilling. The prophecy existing is what lead to Voldy failing to kill Harry. It's almost as if it's guiding events so that It happens the way it has predicted to happen. This is a scary thought because this shows us that no one is in complete control of their actions.

2. Voldy thinks the prophecy is fake, and decides to ignore it. Keep in mind, we have still assumed that the prophecy is "the truth". In this case, there are a hundred other ways through which the prophecy could be fullfilled. Hell! Even this one single line can be interpreted in a lot of ways.

  *"Born to those who have thrice defied him"*
#+end_quote

Defy could mean a lot of things. If someone were to disagree with Voldemort on what the best ice cream flavour was, or say they debate against Voldy three times in school or something, then that is defying, innit? Then, somehow, another candidate for the prophecy would arise. Again, the prophecy is self fulfilling.

The gist of case 1, i.e. when the prophecy is true is that it is so uniquely worded that it is open to millions of possibilities.

Now, case 2. Prophecies don't predict the future per se, but the most likely possibility, or the most possible reality, if you will. I personally think this is the case. Voldemort had three choices that night, kill the Potter brat, get rid of the Longbottom brat, or do nothing. At least this is what he believed were his choices at that time, after putting two and two together. we can further condense these two choices into - To Kill or not to kill.

From case 2, the most logical conclusion would be that many factors, I repeat, many factors lead Voldemort to make the choice to Kill. However, there was still the small chance that he would have decided not to kill.

The prophecy, or whoever/whatever commissioned it knew that killing was the most likely choice, it also knew about the small chance of killing not being the choicd, and thus the prophecy was tailored in such a way that it would push Voldemort to go for the former decision. (To kill)

That leads us to question - What if, even after knowing the first half of the prophecy, voldemort decided not to kill? My answer, and my belief would be that then the prophecy wouldn't have existed in the first place, or it would have been worded differently

In the magical world, anything is possible. If time travel is, then so could be the concept that time isn't an endless stream flowing in one direction (unidirectional), but is in fact an endless cycle. We believe the past to influence the future or the present. However, if we take the above mentioned concept/theory that time is an endless loop, then it is possible for the future/present to influence past events, but just not in a very straightforward way.
