I absolutely agree that prophecies are confusing and complex, if you take any historical prophecy they're practically intended to be so as they tend to exist within a living political discourse (although that naturally has a complicated relationship with fantasy fiction).

The thing is though that I think it would be justifiable to argue that there are multiple forms of 'true'. A prophecy can be true without necessarily coming true in an explicit sense. Evidently within Harry Potter they can be pretty precise (as in the case of the Wormtail prophecy). However, it should also be noted that there's no guarantee that Harry will be the last child born at the end of the seventh month (whenever that is, September, July, something else) whose parents have thrice defied Voldemort. There's no particular reason to be certain that the cycle won't start over again given Voldemort's paranoia and sense of self-importance.

I generally agree with you. The prophecy does whatever happens push Voldemort to kill or try to kill, and perhaps more importantly it aligns with his fundamental nature. However, I don't think that there's anything within the prophecy actually means that Voldemort becomes permanently immortal should he defeat Harry.

Time as a loop, or a simultaneous moment of sorts is an interesting possibility as far as the prophecies go, and in fact as far as any prophecy goes. Does the past echo in the future or the future in the past?
