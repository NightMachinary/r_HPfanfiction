That... that's rather big.

If you think of it like that, the prophecy is effectively saying Voldemort will ALWAYS be defeated. With the only possible way for Voldenort to ensure he cant be defeated being to successful conquer the entire world and enforce a global calendar with less than 7 months. Otherwise there will always be a reoccurring loop of children being born that have every chance of being capable of defeating Voldemort. Particularly when you consider how loose a term 'defy' is, and that there is no given time limit on WHEN Voldemort has to mark them as his equal (he could technically mark someone as his equal literally seconds before he defeat)
