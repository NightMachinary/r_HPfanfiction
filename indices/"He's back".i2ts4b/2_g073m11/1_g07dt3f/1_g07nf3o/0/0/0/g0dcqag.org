I'd put it more in terms of the possibility always existing for victory or defeat. Every dictator has the potential to be defeated, it doesn't mean that they will be. He might defeat every single one. The power to vanquish him doesn't necessarily mean that he will be vanquished. It's the beauty and the horror of a world with freewill.
