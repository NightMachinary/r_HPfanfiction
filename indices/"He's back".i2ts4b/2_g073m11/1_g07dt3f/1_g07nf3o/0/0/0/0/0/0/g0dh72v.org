See that's another problem with how vague the prophecy is. "Defying" him could refer to any number of different things. Some others in this thread have even pointed out that even disagreeing with Voldemort could be seen as defying him.

The only piece of information we have really that implies it will be a MAGICAL baby that defeats him is that its Harry's story and he is magical. But when you just consider the prophecy alone, from the POV of the Harry Potter world instead of the story, it basically says Voldemort is going to lose and there is jack shit nothing he can do about it short of deleting all seventh months forever
