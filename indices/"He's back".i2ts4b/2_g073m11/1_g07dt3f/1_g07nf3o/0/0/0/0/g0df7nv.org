Yeah, sure, but your forgetting, it only takes one successful attempt and Voldemort is defeated. And without forcibly changing the global calander, there will be an INFINITE number of potential prophecy children that can attempt to kill him. Being born, every year.

Hell, the prophecy doesn't even say that the kid has to even be magical. Power doesn't only refer to magic. That means there is an average of 360,000 babies born every year (UN stat of average births per day worldwide) on the 31st of july that have the potential to stop Voldemort.

And that is only based on one version of a Calander.

It is statistically impossible for Voldenort to survive/win unless he eradicates the very concept of a seventh month
