I really dislike it when prophecies aren't objective truths. They exist, they /will/ happen, just in the way you least expected it. If you work against a prophecy, you will only hasten its arrival. The way these work is not by controlling the future, but by being so open-ended that they can literally refer to anyone. They give a truth, but the question of that truth being worth anything is at the very core of every prophecy myth.

This is why I dislike both those "Harry is cool and edgy and ignores dumbledork and his shmophecy" and those "harreh m'boy I've been controlling your entire life to bring about the prophecy" interpretations. Those aren't how prophecies work. You can't defy them, and you can't influence them. They will happen, one way or another. All you can do is try to save as many people as possible as they play out.

The struggle against Fate is one of the core principles in literature, and one of the oldest philosophical concepts.
