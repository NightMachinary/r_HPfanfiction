Easy enough - the prophecy specifies neither the year, nor the method of defiance, nor even which calendar-system's seventh month. Between the lunisolar Jewish and Chinese/<other east-Asian> calendars, the lunar Islamic, and the various other traditional calendar systems of Asia and the Americas, we have tons of 7th months floating around throughout the year.

Furthermore, for the lunar and lunisolar calendrical systems, where the new month is based on the New Moon, the "seventh month dying" could be stretched to mean "as the moon whose rebirth will herald the seventh month dies", which /does/ add in additional death/rebirth symbolism, which adds the days around the new moon at the start of those seventh months.

And all of that assumes we're talking about literal birth, and not some kind of rebirth, by adoption, religious conversion, naturalization, gaining a title or degree (e.g. someone gets their PhD in some obscure field that happens to perfectly detect/counter Horcruxes somehow, and their PhD advisors are Squibs who have thrice written scathing rebuttals of Voldemort's goals)

Even if you say that the month is tied to the prophesied one's background - why, that merely opens up some kind of heartwarming multicultural hodgepodge union where, for example, you have Goldstein born on the last day of Elul, Cho born at the end of seventh month on the Asian calendar, Prof. Vector (via PhD), Cedric (born prematurely, at the end of the seventh month), Hermione (adopted at the end of her seventh month of life), the Patil twins (naturalized as British citizens at the end of July), etc.

Of course, they have no idea, they're just doing what's right - but it works.
