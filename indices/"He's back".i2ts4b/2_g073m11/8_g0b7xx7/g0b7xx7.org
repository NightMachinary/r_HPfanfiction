If Harry dies and Cedric lives, then by definition we aren't sticking with canon events, so we can't really say whether or not the prophecy makes him immortal.

However, in the setting, the prophecy is a prediction of one, specific, person who may have the power to defeat Voldemort. It doesn't preclude someone else---or a team of them---from doing so. It would be very difficult, of course, and probably uglier than what happened in canon.
