Well even further, Harry would be immortal as well because Voldemort is tethering him to life by creating his body with his blood/keeping Lily's protection alive. That's why Dumbledore has that look of triumph in his eyes for a moment when Harry comes back from the Graveyard.

In reality, the way this would go down is Harry awakens alone in the middle of Little Hangleton graveyard. Everyone is gone and he has to make his track back to Hogwarts.
