One thing you should consider is that many Marauder fics are light-hearted. Some writers want to portray the best friends angle or wolfstar/jily fluff and don't concern themselves with sticking to canon too much (as ambiguous as Marauder era canon is). From that perspective, you can see why Peter gets the short end of the stick.

The other thing working against Peter is that JK Rowling dismissed him in her interviews. Her answers about Peter only resurrecting Voldy because he was afraid of him/of his active followers don't really make sense with the rest of story. We're shown that Peter is instrumental in Voldemort's return. I can't imagine how Voldemort would have returned without Peter. So Peter has this big role in PoA and GoF because of plot purposes, but then he's doesn't do anything interesting in the last 3 books. Wasted potential if you ask me. If the author of the books botched Peter's character, you can hardly expect the average fan writer to do much better.

Something I haven't seen explored in fan fiction is the possibility that three Marauders became better people as they got older but Peter didn't. There could be some qualities of teenage Peter that hint towards the future he chose without making Peter the odd man out. I see many fans who will admit James was a bully but "James changed/the Marauders grew up," yet no one really explores the possibility that James could have been a bully who matured while Peter could have been a bully who didn't. There is more to the Marauders than being bullies, like their friendship, becoming Animagi and joining the Order, but if you gloss over the bullying completely, you lose the angle that these friends are changing as people at different rates. They're only 21 when the Secret Keeper switch happens. It's tricky to keep that balance in a fic where Peter might be very flawed, but he isn't being bashed and still has nuance as a character.
