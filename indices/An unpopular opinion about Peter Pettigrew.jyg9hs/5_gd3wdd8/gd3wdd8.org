I do think Peter is generally underestimated in fanfic. He was friends with the other three Marauders for a reason. James trusted him with his life. Sirius claimed that he would have died for him. Remus was forever grateful that Peter became an animagus.

Peter was clever enough to become an animagus (with help but he did manage it). He was clever enough to frame Sirius for his crimes. He was clever enough to be instrumental in resurrecting Voldemort.

That said, GOOD Marauder fanfic takes this stuff into consideration. Let me drag out my standard list of Marauder recs:

/The Outcast,/ a short story, by Gilipin shows everyone as well-intentioned. Peter is clever, but a lot of his pain stems from not being the cleverest in the room.

In Marauder Lover's /White Flags/, a teenage Peter has already turned but it's clear that his suspicious behavior gets handwaved not out of contempt, but out of longtime friendship.

In Divine Comedian's constantly-recommended /They're Hiding Inside Me,/ Peter is part of the group decoding what happened to Sirius. I love his first entrance into Remus' mother's kitchen; the automatic comfort he brings Remus, the casual knowledge that Remus' mother bakes on full moons.

Stoplight Delight's unfinished epic /Against the Moon/ shows Peter struggling academically in comparison to his friends. It also shows how his insecurities stem from his family of origin. His father is in prison and his sister is a squib, which to me is a great headcanon.

Star of the North's /Story of Four Friends/ has Peter as a fully-fledged member of the team, too.

And I always ends with Hyphen's classic comedy /The Speculum Curse./ The titular curse emphasizes everyone's strengths by emphasizing their weaknesses.

Good writing of Peter can be done and has been done.
