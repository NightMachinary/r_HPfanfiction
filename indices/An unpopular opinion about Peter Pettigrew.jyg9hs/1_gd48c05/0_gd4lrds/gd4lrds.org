  If it weren't for Sirius unprecedentedly breaking out of Azkaban because of a stray newspaper, he could have been taken into Grimauld Place! (or however it's spelled)

Well, if Sirius hadn't broken out of Azkaban, the Order wouldnt have been using Grimmauld Place because Sirius wouldn't be there to let them in...

If Peter was still Ron's pet by book 5, there would be no need for anyone to be in Headquarters - even if that HQ was a different place to Grimmauld - because Voldemort wouldn't have risen again and the Order wouldn't have reconvened.

  He was thwarted by a baby when he delivered his masterstroke against the light. Then immediately changes up when he knows it has gone south and is able to frame his friend. Bad ass. Shameless, despicable, badass.

This though. This is true. Peter thinks on his feet and makes the best of any situation. Really up until about Book Six he's doing ok, and then once Bellatrix and the other terrifying DEs are a factor, he's in too deep. But yeah, you're absolutely right. He's a survivor, and he has balls of steel to cut off parts of his body on more than one occasion. I don't think I could cut off my own limb, but then I've never had to choose between "cut off hand or be killed by mad wizard" so what would I know ðŸ¤£
