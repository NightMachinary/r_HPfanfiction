No, I'm arguing that, as is proven by Voldemort's need to have flesh and blood servants, that incorporeal spirits can't do the required magic to get a body. So without help - such as how he needed Quirrell to drink the unicorn blood and attempt to take the stone, and he needed Peter to make the potion and provide the flesh - he can't come back.

It's canon that Voldemort as a spirit is basically useless, because it's shown that the only attempts he makes to come back to life are made when he has a fully human servant. He can be as motivated as he likes, but it's clearly fact that he can't do it alone with the methods he's aware of.

Which brings me back to my point - until Pettigrew is spooked out of hiding and left with no other choice, who is actually willing to be that servant? The fact that Quirrell was the only person he managed to recruit as a new follower in 13 years doesn't say much about his abilities whilst a spirit, and as I've previously pointed out, until 93-94 none of his original DEs who aren't in Azkaban are able or motivated to help him.
