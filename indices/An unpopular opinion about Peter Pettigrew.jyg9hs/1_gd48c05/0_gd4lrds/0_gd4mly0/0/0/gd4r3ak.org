I think you are underestimating magic and its breadth. You're basically arguing canon events were necessary instead of just sufficient conditions for Voldemort's ressurection. The first book was the first attempt, which failed. I think it at least demonstrates that Voldemort would keep at it and find a magic. You don't have to believe in canon events happening, only that Voldemort is motivated to bring himself back.
