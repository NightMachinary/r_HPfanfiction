  Even if Peter hadn't appeared, Voldemort would still be trying to ressurect.

But who would have helped him? Of all his supporters left on the outside I don't think a single one would (Snape truly had no desire to by that stage, Karakoff is too cowardly, Lucius enjoys his comfortable life on the outside, Crabbe and Goyle Snr do nothing that Lucius hasn't endorsed...) other than Barty Crouch Jr. /But/ Barty Jr could only break free of his father's Imperius with help from Voldemort - and Voldemort only knew where to find Barty Jr /because Pettigrew brought Bertha Jorkins to him and she had the info./

Voldemort couldn't resurrect himself. He was incorporeal. He also couldn't have done the Bone of the Father potion if he'd possessed someone, eg as he did with Quirrell, because the Flesh of the Servant must be /willingly given./

So, without Pettigrew being scared out of hiding by Sirius, the chances of Voldemort rising again are absolutely minimal. The whole chain of events from Book 4 onwards, or indeed anything similar, couldn't have happened if Peter was still living as a rat. He was the only one of Voldemort's servants who was put in a position where it was prudent or achievable to seek the Dark Lord out.

It's likely Barty Jr would have eventually sought Voldemort out, as the Imperius would have failed once Barty Snr died. But Barty Snr was only in his sixties or seventies when murdered, and if he'd aged normally, well we know wizards live into their hundreds and by that time, Peter would have been an old man (old rat) and probably beyond giving a fuck as he has a nice comfortable life. He only stopped living as Scabbers because he was forced to. If he'd genuinely been laying in wait for an opportunity to barter his way back to Voldie, why didnt he kidnap Harry from the dorm prior to the events of POA? Nah, Peter would never have exposed himself if his hand hadn't been forced, he was far too happy living the life of a pampered pet. His return to Voldemort was pure necessity because his deception had been exposed.

TL;Dr if Sirius hadn't wanted to do the crossword, Voldemort would still be a spirit.
