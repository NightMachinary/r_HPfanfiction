Just one defense of my statement there. I didn't mean specifically Grimauld. I just meant, he had the idea that Voldemort would be back, and he would be in a position to scope their hideout, wherever it would have been. Not claiming he knew that he would be outed and eventually raise Voldemort himself. That only happened because the first thing was thwarted.

He would wait until another supporter, or Voldemort himself, resurrected. And then exchange his way back through giving away the Weasleys or whatever he was privy to through them. Just because canon events don't happen doesn't mean other events wouldn't. Even if Peter hadn't appeared, Voldemort would still be trying to ressurect.
