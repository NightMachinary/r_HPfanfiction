He's a follower. He followed the Marauders when they ruled the school, and Voldemort when it looked like he would rule England. I think the overemphasis is on his supposedly cowardly nature. I like to say, Peter is very brave, he's just shameless.

Cowardly people cutting off his own hand and finger? Nah son.

He was thwarted by a baby when he delivered his masterstroke against the light. Then immediately changes up when he knows it has gone south and is able to frame his friend. Bad ass. Shameless, despicable, badass.

A coward would flee the country. He STICKS around to hide as a rat in a Wizarding family who are strongly on the side he JUST betrayed. Meaning he knows the Dark Lord will be back, and is in a position of having information all that time! If it weren't for Sirius unprecedentedly breaking out of Azkaban because of a stray newspaper, he could have been taken into Grimauld Place! (or however it's spelled)

It would have been a huge opportunity to betray them to Voldemort, he would have once again almost single handedly taken the light down!

Peter has whatever anti-plot armor is! Total bullcrap how his plans failed. And it took steel to make and act them out.
