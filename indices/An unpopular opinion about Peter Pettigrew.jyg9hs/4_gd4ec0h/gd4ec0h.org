I'd never really considered including a backstory for Peter in the fics I'm working on, but reading this made me have some ideas.

I agree with you, and I don't like the retcon job that JKR has done with the Sorting Hat "oh, it puts you in the house with values you admire...". I also don't like the way Peter is consistently written off as being someone that James, Sirius and Remus merely tolerated. He was part of their secret club, their inner circle, the "Marauders". They helped him become an animagus, he was definitely one of the fold.

So, my hastily created theory goes like this. Peter's sorting wasn't a fluke or a mistake, he has plenty of Gryffindor traits, including /wanting to be the centre of attention/. But in a cohort that included James and Sirius, Peter was overshadowed.

He wants to be the hero, and not be the weakest member of the group. Maybe he learns that Snape is now spy for the Order, and decides if /Snivellus/ can be a mysterious and dangerous double-agent, it would obviously be possible for Peter himself, so he gives it a go. Maybe he's hoping he'll even expose Snape as actually being a double-agent /agaunst/ Dumbledore. But then Peter gets made secret-keeper for Lily and James, so he hatches a plan. He can send Voldemort right to them, but then swoop in and save the day himself. He gets to be the hero, even better if he's actually the one who saves James, and he gets his 15m of fame.

Only the plan goes wrong as James doesn't hold Voldemort off long enough for Peter to arrive, and by the time he gets there, the Potters are all dead, Sirius is baying for blood, and Pettigrew has to vanish.

But by ensuring Sirius is painted as the villain of the piece, Pettigrew can still salvage something he wanted - he gets to be the hero, even if he has to fake his death and live with "posthumous" respect and regard.
