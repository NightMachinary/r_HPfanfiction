Honestly, I've always believed that the sorting isn't about what traits you have but what you hold in most esteem. It would help explain why certain people get put into certain houses as it's obvious that some people don't fit their houses traits.

I haven't read the actual books in a while, only fanfiction so I might be forgetting some things.

Percy, I believe, would have been in Slytherin however his families influence and the war prevented him from having a good view of it. Perhaps even the twins as they seem to have a single-minded desire to run a joke shop.

Hermione probably could have gone into Ravenclaw however heard about Gryffindor and how everyone favoured it and was influenced by this.

This then helps explain how whole family lines get put Into the same house as they've been brought up that way with the idea that a certain one is better.

Therefore this could help with how Pettigreww was put into Gryffindor. He values bravery while not always showing it.
