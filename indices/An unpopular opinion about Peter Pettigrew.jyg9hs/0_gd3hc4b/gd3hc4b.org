I imagine Peter at eleven years old was very much like Neville at the same age.

It's just that Neville repeatedly decided that loyalty was unquestionably more important than fear, whereas Peter became driven by his fears to the point of being willing to do anything to protect his own neck. Divergent character development, similar starting points.

Sorting is about what you're looking for, not who you are. Nobody's much of a paragon of anything at eleven.
