I agree, as you say, Neville's loyalty to his closest friends and loved ones was unquestionable. Peter's mistake was to succumb to his fears and insecurities and in the end watch over him alone, forgetting about his friends and even his family. I also find parallels in the sense that both characters had talents for certain fields of magic. Neville, on the one hand, excelled in herbology, Peter, on the other, in transformations, making it clear in his facet as an animagus, which also speaks volumes about his ability as a wizard.
