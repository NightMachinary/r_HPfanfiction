Great post, OP. I think a big thing about Peter's portrayal in fic that really bothers me is the amount of times he is shown as someone who was just tagging along. That James and Sirius and even Remus never really liked him, he was just /there by default./ He was a yes man, a useful cheerleader and scapegoat. And that makes his betrayal into /something James and Sirius caused,/ not the absolutely devastating act that came out of nowhere it was supposed to be.

And, I just don't think that's quite the case from the information we get in canon.

The very fact that Peter is chosen to be the secret keeper shows that James held him in high regard. Fic often paints it as an insult, assumes Sirius was saying "who's gonna suspect Peter he's so dumb and weak." That absolutely wasn't the point. The point was everyone would assume it was Sirius, because everyone in the wizarding world from Voldemort down to the man who cleans the toilets in Gringotts apparently knew how ride or die James and Sirius were. It wasn't saying "no one would suspect this weak ass rat," it was saying "hmm, maybe let's not go for the super obvious choice of Sirius just to be safe." I mean, if anyone should be offended by The Swap, it's Remus as apparently he was the only Marauder not trusted enough to be a part of it.

Now, I think the reason this misinterpretation of their friendship happens is down to two things stated in canon.

1. In POA Madame Rosemerta refers to Peter as the one "always tagging along after James and Sirius." But that is an /adult woman's view of the friendship between teenage boys./ Adults don't understand teenagers for a start, and Rosemerta saw them, what, once every six weeks for a couple of hours. What would she actually know about the bonds of friendship between them? Sure, faced with such strong characters as James and Sirius it's probably hard to see anyone else as anything other than a sidekick. But that's the interpretation of an outsider, and therefore not a valid comment on the Marauders friendship.

2. Also in POA, Sirius refers to Peter as always hanging out with the people who could protect him - and how it used to be the Marauders and then he realised James wasn't the biggest bully in the playground any more, that was Voldemort. OK, this is more valid than anything Rosemerta says, because it comes from an actual Marauder. But we also have to take into account that Sirius has been sat in a cell, alone but for creatures who zap your best memories, for twelve years. He's been specifically obsessing about Peter's betrayal for those twelve years. Is there any wonder he views their entire friendship in a negative light? I mean, with the hindsight available to him when examining those memories, especially in such a negative environment as Azkaban, it was nigh on impossible I would imagine for him to remember anything good about Peter. The man Peter became ruined his life, and that colours his memories of the boy Peter was and their friendship.

The other issue with understanding Peter's betrayal is threefold, although this time it's a lack of information.

1. We don't know /when/ his defection took place. Was he secretly chumming up to the Junior DE whilst in school? Doubtful, because let's assume if that was the case Snape would not be able to risk rubbing it in James's face, thus either exposing Peter or scaring him enough that he goes back to the Light Side. Logically, it must have happened some time when they were between the ages of 18-21, but we just don't know.

2. We don't know /why/ his defection took place. He briefly says something in POA about being afraid Voldemort would kill him if he didn't - but why was he in a position to be directly threatened by Voldemort anyway? What were his actual reasons? Did they threaten his mother? Did they torture him? We just don't know.

3. We don't know /how/ his defection took place. Did he go voluntarily after receiving threats? Was he kidnapped and forced to take the Mark? If the latter, why not go to Dumbledore for help?

That lack of information is really unhelpful, as the picture painted by canon is really that he woke up one morning and thought "fuck this I really want to give being evil a go."

Now, if Peter was, as fanon portrays, someone who was never really liked by his friends and by the age of 21 had ten years of resentments against James and Sirius, maybe it makes sense that one day he snapped and decided to get nuclear style revenge for a decade of what he perceives as bullying. But I think, if you read between the lines of canon, by 1981 the outsider in the Marauders wasn't Peter. It was Remus. So what excuse does Peter have? The truth is he has none, and that's what makes his behaviour so devastating. I know the scene in POA film where Harry is all "hE wAs ThEiR fRiEnD" is the height of bad acting, and at the time he thinks the friend who betrayed them is Sirius, but the point is correct - the fact James and Lily were betrayed by a friend makes it so much worse. And the fact that so much fanon work /gives Peter an excuse/ actually, for me, takes away a good part of the sting of his betrayal.
