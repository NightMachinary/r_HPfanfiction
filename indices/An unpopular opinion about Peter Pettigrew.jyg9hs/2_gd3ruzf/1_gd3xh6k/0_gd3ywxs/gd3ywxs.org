See, if he was a spy (and I like the idea that he could have been, and Voldemort actually got the location of the Potters from him with legilimacy) that sadly doesn't explain him framing Sirius. If he was a spy - Dumbledore will have known. All he had to do was go to him and say "I should have told you I was the secret keeper and he got the location out of my head"). Then it's an accident, everyone is satisfied with the explanation, Sirius and Remus actually think he was really brave and so on. (Tempted to write this one).

But the fact he framed Sirius in 1981 and then in 1993-4 went to rejoin Voldemort when, let's be honest, he could have just gone and lived as a pet rat with a Muggle family who wouldn't have had a clue and no one from the wizarding world would ever have found him again, shows that by at least the age of 21 he is committed to Voldemort and his cause.

Are there any fics out there that actually explore how and why he got to that position without falling back on the cliche of "James and Sirius used to forget Peter existed unless they needed a scapegoat," which just isn't an acceptable or realistic reason imo?
