All your points are really very accurate and that pleases me, the main problem lies, unfortunately, in much of both the canon and the fanon of the saga, really do not offer clear details about what led Peter to commit such decisions, in my scenario, for example, could have been something that involved his potential forced incorporation into the Death Eater and a threat to his family, we know nothing of a father of Peter, could he have been the first victim in the family circle of Peter? Probably, the next on the list would be his mother, and Peter, I believe, was very attached to her and would do whatever was necessary to protect her, as any son would do, even if it led him to make mistakes that he would regret later, and now, as far as his incorporation into the Death Eaters with the Dark Mark, I want to get used to the idea that he was forced, maybe he just wanted, initially, to serve as a spy and nothing else, in exchange for protecting his mother, without having anything more to do with them, and at the moment of truth, the Death Eaters, with the presence of Voldemort himself, put the mark on him. I clarify that that is the scenario I devised for such a situation, nothing is clear, but that for me could be a potential answer.
