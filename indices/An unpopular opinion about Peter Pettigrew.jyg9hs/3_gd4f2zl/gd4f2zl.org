I don't think Pettigrew was driven to Voldemort's side as purely by fear as some portray. When one looks at the graveyard scene, he has /no/ trouble or hesitation throwing a Killing Curse at a random teenager, which suggests some real talent/experience with a spell that supposedly requires intense hatred to cast. Later, the first thing he does with his new silver hand is test how much strength it has by crushing a twig to powder. To me, that comes across as less "sniveling cowardice" and more "power-hungry amorality".

If I were going to write the Marauders, I'd probably depict Pettigrew and Sirius as the group's collective id: Both would, albeit for different reasons, push towards crueler or more dangerous pranks - Sirius because he's even worse at considering the consequences of his actions than most teenagers and really hates anyone that's too similar to his family, Pettigrew because he doesn't care if people get hurt as long as he's safe and on top. Remus would be the halfhearted voice of reason and James the instigator and charismatic leader.
