I couldn't agree more, Peter was their friend, they liked him and trusted him for a reason. And that's what made his betrayal so painful. I think you might enjoy my WIP. I've had a lot of compliments on my portrayal of Peter along the lines of 'I keep forgetting I hate him.' 😂😂 (although it does focus more on wolfstar 🤷‍♀️)
