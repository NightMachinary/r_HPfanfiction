#+begin_quote
  The epic tale of Remus Lupin and Sirius Black, from their first meeting until their happily ever after.A young werewolf who hasn't experienced human touch for six years meets a young pure-blood who's never known how it feels to be loved. The story follows Remus and Sirius through Hogwarts and beyond. Slightly AU in the beginning (mainly Remus believing he can infect people through skin contact), but goes major AU after the events of Halloween 1981.
