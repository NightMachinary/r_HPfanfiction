This is actually a pretty common theme in fantasy stories wherein a wizard sticks their soul somewhere, if somebody gets ahold of it they can(depending on setting) if they know what to do with it do and make the wizard do just about anything with it.

I believe its inspired by a variation of the Koshei the deathless myth.
