/You might belong in Gryffindor,/\\
/where dwell the brave at heart,/\\
/for increased bravery and bad decisions TRY RED BULL/

/You might belong in Hufflepuff,/\\

/but if you're worried they're not, GET A GO PRO and hide it in your dorm!/

/Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,/\\
/if you've a ready mind,/\\
/try the new LUMOSITY APP on iTunes/

/Or perhaps in Slytherin - 50% OFF AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AT RIDDLEMART/
