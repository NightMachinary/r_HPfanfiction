Sacrifices Ark --- major themes of the story are about Harry trying to resist the temptations of the “dark magic”, Harry trying to not turn into a “dark wizard” \ sociopath, the antagonists being afraid he'll turn “dark”, /and/ almost all antagonists trying to constantly annoy him to the point where he'll snap and turn, in fact, into a “dark” lord. Seriously, there are many good things to say about that story, but it can be very hard to not give up on it because of all those repetitive aggravating [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictBall][drama balls]] that the author seems to be very fond of, for some reason.
