Here's what I can recommend:

Linkao3(Searching for a Happier Ending by Kemartin2009) Hr/Severus Snape/Remus Lupin, still updating. Hermione returns to teach at Hogwarts after being abroad for 10 years.

Linkao3(This Life by coyg_81) Hr/Draco/Blaise Zambini, still updating. 8th year fic where Hermione and Blaise are Head Girl and Boy respectively. Post War. This is fine, though the plotting could be better, as in slower.

Linkao3(The Hedgehog's Dilemma by shadukiam) Hr/Harry/Draco, still updating.

Linkao3(Changing Scenery by aethling) Hr/Harry/Draco, still updating. This is a Veela!Draco fic, so Harry and Hermione are his mates. It's entertaining and well-paced.

Linkao3(Fourteen Thousand Galleons by Frumpologist) Hr/Harry/Draco, complete. Hermione has just divorced Ron, and owes 14,000 galleons to the laywer. She is employed as Scorpius' governess.

Linkao3(for as long as you need us) Hr/Ron/Harry. Complete post-war fic. It's a one-shot. It's pretty grim.

Linkao3(Sugar and Spice by InLoveWithForever) hr/Draco/Theo Nott, complete. It's pretty fluffy and smutty. Takes place during 8th year. There is a sequel which is now up and updating.

Hope this helps!
