  After years of self-imposed solitude in the United States, Hermione returns to Hogwarts to work in peace on her pet project, a special potion she's developing. Her progress is stuck, so she turns to the most talented Potions Master she knows of, Severus Snape, to help her. At Hogwarts, she reencounters Remus Lupin, and sparks fly, but those aren't the only sparks that are flying. Starts out RL/SS, becomes HG/RL, and more eventually.

  Seven years have passed since the war ended. Hermione has everything she's always wanted, but she still isn't satisfied. When she mentions she's bored to Harry, she didn't think that her boredom would be alleviated quite this way. And she definitely didn't expect to see Draco Malfoy again after all these years, and not like that. Well, she certainly wasn't bored anymore.

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses. Meanwhile, George's parallel isolating tendencies show Harry what might have happened if he'd not given into temptation.
