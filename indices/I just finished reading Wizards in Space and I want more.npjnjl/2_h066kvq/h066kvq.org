There's a magical space travel subplot in linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay), though it really only gets going late in the story. Quite interesting once you get to it. Ron learned a bit about muggle space travel and got inspired.

(The flair you want is Request, BTW, rather than Recommendation.)
