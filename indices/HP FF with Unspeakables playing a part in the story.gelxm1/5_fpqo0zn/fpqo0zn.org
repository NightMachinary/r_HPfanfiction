The Lost Son series (apparently called the Paradox of Plurality but that's only on [[http://www.mags-nificent.com/MSW/LF/Paradox.htm][this one site]] which is also the only place it's easy to get to all three pieces) by Lachesis AKA Lakhesis AKA moiraithanatoio. It's brilliant and heartbreaking (and Snarry so skip if you don't care for such).

For some reason, the author never claimed/posted the stories on the moiraithanatoio AO3 account. The first two stories are there under Lachesis thanks to the ISF archivist (The Lost Son linkao3(7866325) and The Ripple Effect linkao3(7876195) ) but not linked as a series and the third story, The Vanishing Twin doesn't seem to be there at all. The three stories are all on the moiraithanatoio LJ account, but with no tags so you have to go searching or know the links to find them. (For the record: 4696 (3 parts), 7147 (5 parts) and 8587 (2 parts).)
