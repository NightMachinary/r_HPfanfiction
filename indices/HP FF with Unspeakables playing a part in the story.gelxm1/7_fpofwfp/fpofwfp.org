Well you can try Angry Harry and the Seven by Sinyk where the unspeakables take a much larger role in stopping Voldemort and the Deatheaters.

You can also try Harry Potter and the Unspeakable Time by DrgnMstr. It's roughly 244K words but regrettably it's abandoned. It's got a squad of unspeakables doing everything they can to stop the dark lord(s)
