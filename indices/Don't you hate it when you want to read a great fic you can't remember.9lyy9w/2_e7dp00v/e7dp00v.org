My problem is that I read so many shity fanfics that I can't remember which one had Harry doing a necromantic ritual to give Moaning Myrtle a body so she could join his harem and which one had Harry having awesome shape-shifting powers so he can impregnate Hedwig and the horntail from the Triwizard Tournament...

Completely serious about those two stories by the way I have no idea what they're called. There's a slight possibility that it is one single story but I don't think so.
