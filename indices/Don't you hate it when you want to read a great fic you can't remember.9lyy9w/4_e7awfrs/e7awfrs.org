I hate this ! I remember reading this fanfic series I really adored about how things would have turned out had Snape not turned to the Dark Arts and Lily would have chosen him instead!

It was quite a fascinating read and I cannot remember where I had originally found it : (

I've never read that fanfic though but that must have been a really cool read to see Harry with siblings...I hope you find it !
