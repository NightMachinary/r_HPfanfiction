Yes, I do. I literally made my first reddit account to post fic searches on this sub.

And you know what? I was disappointed more often than not. Oh, the people here are brilliant and they found the fics right quick, but sadly they were only great back when I had nothing to compare them to. Now I'm afraid to re-read everything I have read more than two or three years ago so as not to destroy the memory I have of them.

I hope you'll have more luck with your fic.
