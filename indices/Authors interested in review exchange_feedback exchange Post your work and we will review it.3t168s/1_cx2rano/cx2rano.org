Here's my WIP, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11506688/1/Captive][Captive]]. It's a Dramione warfic, and it is definitely on the darker side of fanfic so if explicit violence isn't for you I'd maybe tread lightly. But if the slowest of burns is your thing then this is it.

As far as what I'll read: I can get behind most ships, espically if it is done well. However, I won't do any Snape shipping or any adult/child relationships. I'll leave light reviews and PM you with any major critique ^ _ ^
