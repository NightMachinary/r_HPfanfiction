  I'll review every chapter of whatever I read.

I don't understand people reviewing every chapter of something if they're reading it when multiple chapters have been released. It just looks like spamming to raise review-count at that point.

Unless there's something important to correct or inquire about in a specific chapter that is not the most recent one, just leave a single review in the most up-to-date chapter that summarizes your thoughts and says all you feel you need to say.
