That's why I did allow for "something important or... [chapter] specific". But what I was mostly referring to as irritating was precisely that "it was great" review, posted for each chapter by a new reader. It just seems to be spamming to boost review count and I honestly wouldn't put it past some people to make short chapters and throwaway accounts for precisely that purpose.
