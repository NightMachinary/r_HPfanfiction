Yes, yours is an exceedingly rare request. I've only read two fics with that kind of pairing:

*Rise of the Wizards*, linkffn(6254783): Harry got Daphne and Ginny, but Ginny was only a very minor character.

*The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig*, linkffn(7135971): Harry was forced to marry Parvati for political reasons, and he was not happy about it. He still spent most of his time with Ginny, who has taken a Bellatrix like role next to Harry.

Then there is this awful marriage law fic: *Harry Potter and the Restored Legacy*, linkffn(7110923)
