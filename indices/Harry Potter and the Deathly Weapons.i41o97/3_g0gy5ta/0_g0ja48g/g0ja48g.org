Guns are not useless since they allow for very easy ambushes (the bullet hits you before you hear it fired) and at much higher effective range. They also allow you to pin people down since most shield spells in canon are static.

I mean, the Battle of Hogwarts was turned by a bunch of House Elves and Centaurs armed like a medieval peasant mob (various knifes and the like, arrows). So if even such primitive weapons were enough for the best Voldemort could field, imagine a real weapon. A bunch of machine guns for suppressing fire, a few mortars to flush them out of cover and so on. The only truly useless weapon would be a flamethrower.
