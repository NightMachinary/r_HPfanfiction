Oh god, now I want a Metal Gear Solid--esque AU where Hogwarts is a seven-year-long elite secret boot camp for child soldiers, with a Voldemort as a tortured antihero holding a Snake-themed codename, Harry a genetically engineered freak that the government wants to use for their own ends, Dumbledore a ripped badass mission control that helps Harry during his adventures through the codec, long weird-as-hell philosophical debates about the nature of war and humanity, and crazy action.
