  Maze knew there was something different about the bone-thin child in rags she'd seen rummaging through a trash can for food. She was going to find him again and figure this out. He shouldn't be any harder to track down than a rogue demon after all, his appearance was quite distinctive. Scruffy black hair, round glasses, and a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead.Contains a quick overview of the Lucifer (TV) fandom.
