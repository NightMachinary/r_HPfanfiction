I like this one but really didn't understand why the /transfiguration master/ couldn't just... human transfigure Harry. It's clearly possible to do so - if people can be transfigured into animals, then they can be transfigured into other humans, including the opposite sex.

I don't know the rules concerning fertility (though I doubt it's possible), but transfiguration of surface attributes and hormonal glands should have been possible.
