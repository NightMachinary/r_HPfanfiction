Or perhaps /because/ of cosmetic spells...

Now I have this notion that Tom Riddle was a fine lad and growing into a decent wizard who was maybe too enamored of his own good looks. Confronted by an unacceptable blemish on his nose, he cribbed one of those fashion spells from a senior Slytherin, only to have it remove his nose entirely!

He constructed a replacement that matched his original just perfectly, but it tended to lose cohesion over weeks, due to the lingering effect of the curse that removed the original. In his desperation for a cure, he searched deeper into forbidden texts, finally coming to the conclusion that this sort of thing had been incurable since Biblical times (leprosy, that is). His only recourse was to change his persona so that being noseless made sense and was done on purpose.

If only that Slytherin hadn't played a prank on him, so many might not have lived in fear, died too soon.
