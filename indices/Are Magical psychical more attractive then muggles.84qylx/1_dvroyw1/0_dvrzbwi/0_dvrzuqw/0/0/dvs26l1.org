I would imagine most would take Transfiguration for NEWTS purely for that reason alone. You underestimate how much unattractive people wish to be attractive. Life is considerably better when being attractive.

And you likely wouldn't even need to take the class then to do it. Someone else could teach you, you could teach yourself, or get someone else to do the Transfiguration for you. It's amazing what a tweak of the nose or jaw can do for a person.
