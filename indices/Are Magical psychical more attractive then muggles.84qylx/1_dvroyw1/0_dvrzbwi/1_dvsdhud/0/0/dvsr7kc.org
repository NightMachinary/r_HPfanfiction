Yet it is exactly the kind of magic people will WANT to dabble in and to try out over brunch.

The biggest danger in human transfiguration is getting stuck. Which is not as much concern in cosmetic transfiguration. Then there is the fact that the Weasley twins invented Canary Creams - a 'safe' human transfiguration - before taking any NEWT level courses and nobody batted an eye at that. Hagrid gave Dudley a pig's tail, another person doing human transfiguration without having done his NEWTS.

Also notice that those courses are more concerned with full-body and non-human transfiguration, states where you may lose connection to your magic and the ability to return to your normal body if you don't know enough.

In conclusion, in context of cosmetic transfiguration the dangers are overstated and people are irresponsible enough to try transfiguring themselves and eqach other regardless of what the Hogwarts curriculum says.
