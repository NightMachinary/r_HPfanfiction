  Good example, wrong conclusion. Because, do you know what happens to people who splinch themselves learning to apparate? They get put back together and try again until they either succeed or give up.

According to Mr. Weasley, a lot of adult wizards don't even bother with Apparition. It's exactly the right conclusion: If Human Transfiguration requires a lot of talent and education (it does), then it's not something you can do well unless you are taught it. So it's not something you can just pick up with a few pointers from friends over lunch, otherwise no one would bother with NEWT Transfiguration requirements for jobs like Aurors.

  And do you know how consistent splinching can disincentivise your use of apparition? No, you don't you said already as much. By wasting your time having to get yourself back together.

This is just non-canon. Mr. Weasley (in GoF) says that it's the /danger/ of apparition that makes many adult wizards not use it at all, to the point where they prefer brooms over it. Losing body parts hurts. The issue is pain and danger, not just time lost. And that many wizards are OK with using brooms over Apparition, it's simply a fact that time lost is not the real issue, since brooms are much slower.
