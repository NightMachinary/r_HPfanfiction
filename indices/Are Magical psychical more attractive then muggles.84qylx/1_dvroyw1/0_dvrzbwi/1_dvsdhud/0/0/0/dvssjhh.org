  Yet it is exactly the kind of magic people will WANT to dabble in and to try out over brunch.

That is besides the point. The issue isn't desire, but whether or not they can actually do it. And from canon, we know not everyone can, e.g. Neville.

It's not just getting stuck, there's the issue of even getting the change correct in the first place, which (contrary to what you said) is dangerous when making cosmetic changes to the human body. Imagine trying to correct your jawline (that is, altering the bone structure in your face) and screwing it up even a little. Say you take away too much bone and your jaw breaks when you try to talk? Or you need to reorient the positioning of the bone and you cause it to poke right out of your face? That's a real possibility if you can't even get into NEWT Transfiguration, and to undo the damage you couldn't simply Untransfigure it, you'd need a medic wizard.

The twins were described as talented (by Hermione), but not academically inclined, and would have been rather motivated to study and work ahead of their coursework where it concerned their future employment. This a completely different scenario than the "getting tips from friends" scenario you gave before. And the Hagrid example really doesn't work for you. His attempt almost completely failed and produced a small, unobtrusive effect. Cosmetic alterations can have much more invasive effects and correspondingly require a much more delicate and detailed alteration so that the change doesn't negatively affect the body afterward.
