Good example, wrong conclusion. Because, do you know what happens to people who splinch themselves learning to apparate? They get put back together and try again until they either succeed or give up.

And do you know how consistent splinching can disincentivise your use of apparition? No, you don't you said already as much. By wasting your time having to get yourself back together. After all, you leave body parts in places where you do not want to be and have to pick them up again. And by the fines the ministry levies on you when they catch you doing it.
