That's like saying "Because professionals can undo splinching, there's no incentive to avoid it", even though we know that's exactly why Apparition isn't as preferred as a Portkey in many cases. A number of wizards don't even have the talent or knowledge (education) to do this at all. And having bones sticking out your face, or messing up your eyes from attempting to modify the shape of your eyeline, or what have you, are pretty big consequences.
