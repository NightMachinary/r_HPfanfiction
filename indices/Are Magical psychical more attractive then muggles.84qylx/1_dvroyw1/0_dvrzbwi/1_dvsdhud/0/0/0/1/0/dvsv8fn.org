  If you get it wrong you go to St. Mungo's and let them fix you. Then you try again

This basically conceding the point. If your friends are giving you tricks and tips and you have to go to the hospital as a result, then it's not the sort of thing you can or ought to be learning in that way.

  We are talking people using pre-designed magic. Which requires next to no talent.

That's clearly false, otherwise transfiguration wouldn't be such a hard branch of magic (which it is). Learning spells takes talent too, otherwise everyone would be Hermione. I'm not even sure it's true that the twins were inventing spells as opposed to using created spells as part of commercial products. We know at least some of the spells were standard spells (e.g. the Shield Charms applied to hats) so there's more evidence to suggest they were applying known spells to objects and creating know spell effects.

Neville's problems in Transfiguration were never said to simply be about confidence (that's more likely to be true in Potions), he just couldn't do the coursework adequately to move beyond OWL. That's why McGonagall told him to go with what he wanted to do, not what his grandmother wanted.

There's no reason to think Hagrid could have properly performed the spell with a proper wand and there's every reason to think he couldn't (he was expelled as a 3rd year).
