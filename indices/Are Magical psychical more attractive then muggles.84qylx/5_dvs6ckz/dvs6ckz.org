Thinking about this, it occurred to me that the standards of beauty shift from culture to culture and over periods of time. Back when being overweight meant you weren't starving and/or working from dawn to dusk like the average plebe, a beautiful woman would be the one who was rounded and full-figured. In our time, when being overweight is more common among the common, having the drive and extra time necessary to maintain a fit and slim body are hallmarks of modern beauty.

So what does that mean for the wizarding world? As many have mentioned, magic has the capacity to change appearance drastically, yet there are plenty of prominent people who aren't noted for their beauty. Given that unnatural beauty is often associated with being false or enchanted, the valued and prominent person would have a natural and unassuming appearance. In fact the culture is guided by the Statute of Secrecy, so the best wizards and witches would be the ones so plain as to blend in with muggles.

The other prominent feature of the best of wizardkind is age; nearly everyone in the Wizengamot appeared to be well past the age of maturity, and the most powerful and influential were over a hundred. It may be the case that the Professors at Hogwarts deliberately age their appearance in order to command greater respect from their students.
