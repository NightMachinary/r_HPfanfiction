I think you may be interpreting descriptions of people very differently than I do. Rowling often uses very simple, but consistent descriptions. But peopel are rarely explicitly described as handsome or ugly. Tom Riddle is described as handsome, and Harry has a liking for girls with sleek, long hair, so those are described as pretty. And Sirius and Bellatrix come both used to be handsome/beautiful. But otherwise not so much.

Mostly we get (paraphrasing some):

Scrawny, with knobbly knees

Pale, pointed face

Bushy hair and large front teeth

Gangly and freckled with a long nose

Glasses that amplify eyes and make her look like a large insect

Face like a toad

Greasy hair and sallow skin

Toothless grin

Face covered in scars, with a gash for a mouth and two different sized eyes

A mass of dark hair, with beetle black eyes

Duckfooted and hunched shoulders

Face like a pug

Gorilla arms and piggy eyes

The priceless descriptions of the Durlsey family

I could go on, but I think the people who get really positive physical descriptions in the Harry Potter books are pretty rare. I don't really know where you get the idea from that there seem to be few bad looking people.
