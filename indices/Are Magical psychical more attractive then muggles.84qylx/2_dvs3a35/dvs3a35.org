I assume magicals and muggles are both born human. They physically have the same parts as any other human species. Think of Merope Gaunt. She was born with physical defects because of so much inbreeding. Tom Riddle Senior was described as incredibly handsome which is where Tom Riddle Jr got his looks. So physical looks are just depended on genes and what someone in their own opinion finds attractive. Magic is just another thing a person either inherits or not. Not every witch or wizard is a veela so to speak. They have a choice on whether they want to â€˜enhance' their appearance or not like every other human being.
