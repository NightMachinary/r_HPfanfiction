Can only think of Harry Potter And The Escape To New York.. that said, it is a crossover with Beauty & The Beast (1987 series - but I never saw it and could easily follow, as the crossover happen after the series' plot).

You should also know it is a Harry/Fleur/Hermione story, so probably not for everyone. I greatly enjoyed it though.
