linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) is a very AU fic of the wizarding world that features a Voldemort-less world (seemingly).

linkffn(The Skitterleap) an even bigger AU where Dumbledore lost the famous duel, and now Harry is a soldier in Grindelwalds army to be sent on a mission in Eastern Europe.

linkffn(Black Luminary) another AU where the less pureblood centric families decided to flip the table and take power decades before, and now Harry deals with the consequences

linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) has Harry literally thrown into Middle Earth during the the Third Age, so Voldemort is completely out of the picture

Linkffn(The Other Side of the Coin) is an AU where Tom became the DA instructor instead and Dumbledore was a bit more vicious
