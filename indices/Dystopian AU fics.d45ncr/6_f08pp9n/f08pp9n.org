linkffn(Behind the Curtain by bobika; Eclipse of the Sky; Paid in Blood; A True Daughter of Black; Worthy of Magic)

Eclipse and Paid have elements and situations that fits the dystopian theme, especially in Eclipse when they go to Dublin. Paid has the dystopian scenario in the extended universe, but it is told through memories and not exactly in it.

Daughter has dystopian side of it because of what happens closer to end, but I can't say more without spoiling it.

Worthy of Magic and Behind the Curtain are truely dystopians, though Worthy only becomes so about halfway in, but they are both fantasticaly amazing stories.

EDIT: its amazing how many times I mistake Beyond the Curtain with Behind. Thank god I know the author's nickname.
