Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died)

Did the dark lord die on Halloween 1981? No, he's just taking a vacation... The Death Eater attacks continue, the Order has to retreat, and the public stays terrorized, until Lucius Malfoy heroically stops them and becomes Minister.

20 years later, the Order returns to take Britain back.

Hermione Granger, +brainwashed soldier+ /loyal Wand/ of the +dystopian+ /rightful/ government, who was +brutally kidnapped+ /saved/ from her parents at a young age, has to stop the +returning Order+ /terrorists of Dumbledore/ before they threaten the +dictator+ /Minister/.

Oh, and there's this weird half-Naga snake face guy who's being sighted in various places, but that's just a conspiracy theory of the /Quibbler/, right?
