The only one I can think of where Harry unwillingly gets the Dark Mark is linkao3(419407). He's only defiant towards Voldemort though; he gets along quite nicely with Tom.

Someone already mentioned Crybid's A Dangerous Game. linkao3(13059681). Harry is forced to join Diary!Tom but not Voldemort.

ObsidianPen's No Glory is an AU just after Voldemort won the war. That's probably closest, but only one of the Light is forced to take the Dark Mark. linkao3(7502151).
