Authors will have Harry accept his parents' death by having Voldemort repent/he was insane at the time and acting on a prophecy, shifting the blame to Snape/having Harry not care because he never knew them.

The numerous innocent people thing is easier to get around. The good side kills too is often used to argue Harry's eventual acceptance. Harry having diary!Tom as a friend beforehand and his loyalty to his friends is another argument.

linkao3(5090342) is a good example of that.

Or the author tries to write Voldemort as manipulative and explains himself in a way that seems plausible.
