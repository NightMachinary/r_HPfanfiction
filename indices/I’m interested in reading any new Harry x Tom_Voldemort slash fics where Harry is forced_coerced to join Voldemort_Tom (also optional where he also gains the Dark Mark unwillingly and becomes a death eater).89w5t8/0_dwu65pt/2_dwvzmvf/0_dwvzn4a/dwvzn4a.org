  Harry Potter didn't have that many friends. Each and every one of them was so rare and precious - Harry would protect them with his life. His newest friend, however, just may cost him more than he can pay.Mostly pre-slash (and a wee bit of slash) between Harry and Diary!Tom Riddle. Part of the Little Things verse but can be read alone. My take on the Harry/Diary!Tom cliche (because sometimes I get this itch to re-write all my favorite cliches the RIGHT way :))
