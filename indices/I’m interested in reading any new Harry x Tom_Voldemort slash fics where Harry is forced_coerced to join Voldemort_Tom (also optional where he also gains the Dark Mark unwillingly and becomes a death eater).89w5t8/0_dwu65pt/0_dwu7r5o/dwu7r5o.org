A lot of authors shy away from it, because it's hella controversial. So they make it so that Voldemort either didn't kill Harry's parents or potters!bashing. Another way out is that poor Voldemort was just crazy and didn't know what he was doing. Also Harry can just not care for whatever reason(sometimes it's a good one, most of the times it isn't)

And the obvious one is time travel, where it hasn't happened yet.
