linkao3(Red Sorrow by lupinlaughed) -- not Harry-centric, but he's still a major character. I read this a while ago and while there were some parts that were a little slow, it was overall pretty good.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) -- WBWL done really well. updates are slow, but there's a lot of really well written fic there already. Not exactly Dark!Harry but lots of cynical Harry

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/270848/chapters/427550][Session Transcripts]] --hands down one of the best and most original (both plot-wise and stylistically) fan fics I've ever read. For some reason, the bot never links the fic, so I attempted to link it.

linkao3(The King's Indian Attack by Nectare) -- fabulously written; also contains one of my favorite portrayals of Severus Snape.

linkffn(They Shook Hands: Year 1 (New Version) by Dethryl) -- honestly I don't remember a ton about this one because it's been a while since I read it but I do remember that it was good enough for me to read through the entire series
