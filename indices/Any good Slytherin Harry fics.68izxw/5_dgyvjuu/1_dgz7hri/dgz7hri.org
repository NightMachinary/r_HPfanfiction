Red Sorrow was legitimately finished today, and I really liked the ending. However I'd never call it a good SLYTHERIN Harry fanfic. His character is very well written, but he shows absolutely no Slytherin traits. I'm pretty sure the only reason that the author put his character into Slytherin was to make sure that Harry had reasons to interact with Snape, and that Snape would have some conflict between Harry and Ariel.
