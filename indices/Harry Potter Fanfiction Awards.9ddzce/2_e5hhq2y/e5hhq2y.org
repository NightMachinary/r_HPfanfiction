I have a few awards from SIYE and Mugglenet. I don't take them too seriously, but they are a nice recognition from others that your writing is of a decent quality. I take the SIYE ones more seriously because they are by popular vote and SIYE has a decent audience. MNFF not so much becayse the site is essentially dead, but they were the site I went on way back so i have a soft spot for them.
