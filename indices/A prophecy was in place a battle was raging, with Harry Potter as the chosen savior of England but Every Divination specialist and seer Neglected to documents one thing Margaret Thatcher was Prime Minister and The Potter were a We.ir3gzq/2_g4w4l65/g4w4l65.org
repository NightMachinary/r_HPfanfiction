I don't know if this is only for the prompt or if you really didn't know, but Harry is from the West Country, not Wales. Also, he isn't the saviour of England, but of Britain, which includes Scotland and Wales. England isn't named much in the books, because the wizarding community has been mostly united since the tenth century with the establishment of Hogwarts, so well before any national identity as we know today form. Margaret Thatcher also stopped being PM ten months before he even learned about the wizarding world (which really doesn't matter since he lived in Surrey from 2 November 1981 until 1 September 1991 when he started living in the Scottish Highlands for ten months a year until summer of '97).
