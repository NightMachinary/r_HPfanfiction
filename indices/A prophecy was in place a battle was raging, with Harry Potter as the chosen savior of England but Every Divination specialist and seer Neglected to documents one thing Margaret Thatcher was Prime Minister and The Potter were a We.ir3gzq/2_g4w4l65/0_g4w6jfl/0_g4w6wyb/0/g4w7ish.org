I think at least for the story I read previously professor mcgonagall ended up raising Harry and that's why he was Scottish. And quite frankly I'm sorry that you feel you are confined to such a small segment of the fandom when it comes to reading stories you should cast your net far and wide to find the true gems within the fanfiction archieves. Quite frankly quite a few authors can surprise you with the magnificent quality of their writing. I hope you continue to find stories that you can enjoy I know sometimes that can be difficult When you are looking for something very particular within the fandom.
