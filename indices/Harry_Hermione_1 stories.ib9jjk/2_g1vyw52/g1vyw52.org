There are a few other fics, but the quality is somewhat lacklustre or they fall under rule 8.

I can't think of a good longer fic with H/Hr/+, the best in that regard would be "Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass", but that only implies the Harry/Hermione part in the end (even if it does that rather well).
