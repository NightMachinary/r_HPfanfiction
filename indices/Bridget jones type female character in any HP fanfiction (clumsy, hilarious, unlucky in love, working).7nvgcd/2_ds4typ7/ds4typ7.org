Yes: linkffn(She Said What? by Zayz) is one of my favourite Marauders era fics, with Lily turned into a diarising Bridget-Jones-esque character.

It starts off /very/ jerky in style, but the writer gets into her swing with it and develops a better diary style with less blatant swearing, so if you aren't sure of the style, stick it out a few chapters first.
