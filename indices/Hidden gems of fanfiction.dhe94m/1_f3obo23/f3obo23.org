This is an absolutely hilarious melting pot AU. Harry is an actual Horcrux and is therefore borderline indestructible, Hermione is deaf and developed legilimency abilities, Draco is barely capable of using magic and tends to use non-magical weapons to compensate, and Ron is childhood friends with Luna, and has all the strangeness that would bring.
