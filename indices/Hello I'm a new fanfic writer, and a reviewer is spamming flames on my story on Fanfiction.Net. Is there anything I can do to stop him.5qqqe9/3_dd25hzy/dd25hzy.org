don't let them get you down. 99% of flamers are just stupid jerks who have never written a word in their life. What do they get out of flaming you? some kind of perverse satisfaction at demeaning your ideas or story? Lame. Just because I do or don't like your ships or plot devices, doesn't mean I have license to call you out. Write for you. Try to improve yourself and your writing, Get better at grammar and spelling, or whatever technical thing you need to do. But write what you would want to read, make it good, and if you get flamed or called names, ignore it. There are plenty of us readers who will give you advice and encouragement.
