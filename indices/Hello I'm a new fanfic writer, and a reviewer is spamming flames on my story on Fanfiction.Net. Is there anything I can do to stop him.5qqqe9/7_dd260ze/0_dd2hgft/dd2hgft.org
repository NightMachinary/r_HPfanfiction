  If a signed review, you can always reply with something like, "Are you autistic? You are presenting yourself as such."

Yeah, don't do that. Ever. Not only will it make you sound like an idiot, you'll be engaging the person who's trying to goad you into an argument.

There we go. Do that one. If OP's that upset by the flames, they don't have to deal with them. Why bother? There's no need to respond. Just block them. Enjoy doing what you're doing.
