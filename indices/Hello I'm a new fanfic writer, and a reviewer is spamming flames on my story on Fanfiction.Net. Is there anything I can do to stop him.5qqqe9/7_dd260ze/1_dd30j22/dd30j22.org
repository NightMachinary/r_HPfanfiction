  "Are you autistic? You are presenting yourself as such."

That. Is stupidly offensive to a large minority. If you said that on the street, and not in a place where people have time - though rarely use it - to think about what they say, you would be stupified faster than you could blink. Please, look up autism. Look up brain damage. They don't have control, they aren't /normal/ in a manner you would consider. Unless you know someone with that condition or are suffering through it yourself, it is not something you should throw around lightly. I don't know how else to say that and I'm not in the mood to make this seem brash and eloquent. Just, please, think about what you post before you post it. We have all been there, and it has ruined more people than you can count without the aide of magic.
