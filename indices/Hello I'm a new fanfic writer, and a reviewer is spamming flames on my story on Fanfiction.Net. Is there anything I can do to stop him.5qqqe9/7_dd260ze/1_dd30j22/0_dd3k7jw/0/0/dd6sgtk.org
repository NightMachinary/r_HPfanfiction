I've friends with kids on the autistic spectrum and I have spent time around autistic children and adults (I work with one of the latter). It's a medical fact borne out in my own observations that one of the patterns of behavior that someone on the autism spectrum commonly may present is a dogged repetition of phrases, words, or actions with little or no awareness of how such are received.

Repeated flamers can exhibit a similar pattern. My suggested reply was not intended to slam autistic people, but rather to mention that the behavior evokes certain assumptions that one might make. One could, of course, take the coarser (and less healthy) tack of simply telling the flamer to fuck off and wishing him or her a slow, lonely death.
