I'm bad at putting words to paper in most situations and, I wasn't trying to scold you. Rather, put down my thoughts. I'm currently enrolled in a psychology class and am coming to terms with the fact that the brain controls a large part of our personality. I know that sounds daft, but it's hard to understand that I'm not me because I'm me, but that my genetics and the things I've witnessed in my life dictate that.

I know your not here to listen to my ramblings and are probably just trying to justify your own actions by lashing out at my poorly worded attempts to show what I think of your words, but I didn't mean any harm. I'm not trying to be offensive and will once again enforce reading things over more than once before posting them. I don't like offending people who don't possess control, and don't condemn that because any medical study will say virtually the same thing.

I can try not to be blunt, but in regards to people with conditions such as autism they are not normal. Their brains do not act in the manner which a majority of the planets does. That's not to say they are wrong, or that they should be held up as a paradigm of miss behavior, it's just to say that it's more difficult for them to act and react in certain situations. I can't justify it, I'm not a doctor, but you can do the research. The internet is a wonderful and dangerous tool.
