If a signed review, you can always reply with something like, "Are you autistic? You are presenting yourself as such." And then ignore them. (If they're persistent flamers, there's a good chance that they are and questioning them on this can be effective in getting them to at least look at what they're doing.)

"Block user" is another option; I tend to use it infrequently, however, since flames amuse me (and my penning scathing replies to same, even more.)

You can block anonymous reviews entirely. I tend not to because, again, flames and amusement.

If the review is particularly abusive, you can report the review to the site mods (there's a button next to the review to do that), though I doubt you'll see a particularly snappy response. They tend to be too busy dealing with incipient plagiarism accounts, which happen several times a day.
