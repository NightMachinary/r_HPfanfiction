Oh totally! I have a feeling that in the HP universes most muggle fairytales are based off of magical things they weren't supposed to have witnessed, or that occurred before the statute of secrecy became a thing in 1689. Over the years these stories were passed down the generations and became old wives tales and then fairy tales.

ETA: technically this was confirmed in the PoA video game I think, where Snow White is said to be based on an actual event where someone used the Wiggenweld Potion to wake a woman who had drank or been poisoned with the Draught of Living Death
