You know, I don't think I've seen a story where she starts a genuine cult around him.

After being traumatized by her experiences, it leaves her a little... erratic.

First recruit? Her old and bullied (not to mention vulnerable) friend, Luna,

The roots begin spreading, covertly, through the abused, neglected, and occasional 'normal' character that has ulterior motives (but has a "revelation" and genuinely "converts") or hidden faults.

Amusingly, the teachers and older teens overlook it all because it's just 'kids being kids' being 'fans'.

It'd allow for some interesting characterizations for characters not really given much of a limelight.

Susan Bones, who feels overshadowed and pressured by her family life/legacy, finds sympathetic ears in this group. Hannah is dragged in by proxy, but finds herself slowly warming to the group.

Tracey Davis, who doesn't come from pureblood roots unlike her other, more 'acceptable' housemates (like Bulstrode), is isolated and bullied. Sympathetic ears and help.

Colin and his brother, who think Harry is the best thing since sliced bread anyway.

Katie, who outside of her kind personality and happy outlook, actually has a lot of issues/fears.

Heck, I could even see Cho, before she grew in popularity as Ravenclaw's seeker, being quietly dragged in because of her intrigue of Harry (since she's 13, it'd probably be her first crush or that awkward line before it -- we were all there growing up, heh).

It'd be a fantastic way to go nuts on new characterizations instead of the same old, tired cliches.
