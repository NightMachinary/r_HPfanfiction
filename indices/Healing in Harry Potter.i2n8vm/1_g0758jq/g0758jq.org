Aww, fuck. I think you just made me accept the whole "wizards are sturdy, quidditch isn't dangerous" schtick I've been fighting so hard against all these years.

This can also excuse all kinds of miracle medicines existing in the wizarding world. Like a better treatment for cancer.

it totally makes sense for magical injuries to simply be the "level 2" of getting hurt in the HP universe.
