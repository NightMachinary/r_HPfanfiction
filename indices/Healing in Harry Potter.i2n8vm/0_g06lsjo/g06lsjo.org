Yeah, I always got a strong "Theme Hospital" vibe from St Mungo's - weird illnesses, even weirder cures. I feel like magical healing should consist of stuff like standing on a hilltop on the full moon with a frog on your head.

The moment healers start talking about cells etc. is the moment I lose interest. Just as I expect transfiguration to describe matter in a way that is completely different to chemistry, I expect healers to describe the workings of the human body in a way that is completely different to biology.

As for the nature of a wizard's constitution, I agree that it is different to a Muggle's. Not only are we explicitly told so in FB1, but it's the only possible way that wizards can survive e.g. being hit in the head by a metal cannonball flying at over 100mph. If that happened to a Muggle their head would just explode.

  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override 'mundane' nature, but not 'magical' nature. Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it; he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula. Similarly, bones broken in non-magical accidents such as falls or fist fights can be mended by magic, but the consequences of curses or backfiring magic could be serious, permanent or life-threatening.

In addition to wizards having a general physical hardiness, this quote indicates to me that there are three categories of things:

- Non-magical threats which wizards are immune to.

- Non-magical threats which wizards are not immune to, but which they can cure easily.

- Magical threats, which cannot be cured easily.

The given example of immunity is a non-magical venom that might kill a Muggle - wizards are said to be able to comfortably survive it. This suggests an innate immunity/resistance to some things, perhaps as a part of wizards' general physical hardiness.

Meanwhile, the example of non-magical threats that wizards are not immune to but can cure easily is a contagious disease.

Initially I had thought that maybe the distinction could be internal/external e.g. wizards would be immune to Muggle illnesses which derive from internal factors (e.g. genetics, developmental disorders, etc.) whereas they would be able to catch (but able to cure) Muggle problems which come from external factors like pathogens. But that doesn't quite work - a venom is an external source.

I think I prefer to phrase it like this: wizards will have an innate resistance to maladies whose medium of attack is largely physical or chemical rather than biological. Injuries, venom, corrosive substances, toxic metals, radiation etc. would fall into the former category. Pathogens would fall into the latter.
