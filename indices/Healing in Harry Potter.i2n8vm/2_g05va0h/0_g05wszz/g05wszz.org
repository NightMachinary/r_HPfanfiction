Hermione posits that the venom dissolves the stitches, but no conclusive answer is ever provided. That said, it's really not that difficult to learn how to suture wounds. Worst comes to worst, you put a needle through the wrong type of tissue (and these are cuts that go down to the spinal cord) and the stitch tears free (source: spinal surgeon and the fact that I learned some basic subcutaneous stitches). That seems unlikely, given wizarding resiliency and the extreme interest of Augustus Pye. Arthur also implies the magical nature of the injury prevents muggle remedies from working.
