This makes me want a HP crossover with House, where House diagnoses and treats magical mysteries and maladies at St. Mungo's, with his leg pain being incurable due to a ridiculously dark curse.

Or House replacing Madam Pomfrey as Hogwarts's nurse; I can just imagine how hilarious he would be having to deal with all of the Hogwarts students.

Hell, it could even have Harry becoming like House, with Voldemort's Killing Curse hitting Harry's leg and causing permanent damage that caused him pain as he limps around being a sarcastic, cynical ass, but with his own mix of kindness and gentleness every now and again. Bonus points if Harry and Snape still hate each other but have a grudging respect for each other, as Harry has to acknowledge Snape's skill in Potions and knowledge of the Dark Arts, and Snape has to acknowledge Harry's ability to diagnose and treat magical injuries and illnesses.
