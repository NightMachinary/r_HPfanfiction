I usually listen to epub books and sometime i download fics as epub (using [[https://fanfictiondownloader.appspot.com/]] ).

I got from the android market (google play now) [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flyersoft.moonreaderp&feature=related_apps#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEwOSwiY29tLmZseWVyc29mdC5tb29ucmVhZGVycCJd][Moon+ Reader]] and [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.svox.classic&hl=es][Svox Classic Text to Speech]].

And i use that to listen to ebooks (epub) or pdfs :)

Hope that helps you
