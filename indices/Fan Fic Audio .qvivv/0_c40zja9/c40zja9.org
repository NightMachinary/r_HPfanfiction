The name for this kind of material is podfic, a contraction of podcast fanfic if that wasn't immediately apparent.[[http://audiofic.livejournal.com/][AudioFic]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Podfic/works][Archive Of Our Own]] have some good ones, [[http://podslash.livejournal.com/][PodSlash]] is all slashy and [[http://hp-podslash.livejournal.com/][Harry Potter and the Podslash]] is too, but more HP-specific. Depends what you're into, I'm a slash guy myself. Hope this helps.
