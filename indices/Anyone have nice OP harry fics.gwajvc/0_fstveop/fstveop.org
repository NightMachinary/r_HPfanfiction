There's linkffn(Ah, Screw It) which is actually a crossover between /Harry Potter/ and /Stargate/, though one doesn't really need to be familiar with /Stargate/ to enjoy it, I think. The interesting part is while it does have a manipulative Dumbledore, he /also/ comes around eventually. The Weasley bashing is relatively minimal.

Also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/RobSt][RobSt]] writes a /lot/ of fanfics that both bash Weasleys and have manipulative Dumbledores.

I would stay away from /In This World and the Next/ by RobSt, though. Even as tolerant as I am of Weasley bashing, I think it takes the bashing way too far, as it's a time travel fic, and rather than working to redeem the character before they commit unspeakably evil acts, they just punish them for the crimes of their future selves.
