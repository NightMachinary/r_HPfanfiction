Use fanfiction reader by spicy mango (for android)

Pretty much works similar to original app except you can download and read them offline. Since it saves the fics in form of html, you can still read them even if author deletes them on site. You even have an option to back up and restore entire bulk of downloaded fics. So you can transfer the fics to other android devices just by transfering the .bak file.
