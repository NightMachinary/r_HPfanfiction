I think with the Calibre FanFicFare plugin, you can put in a list of links (each separated by a newline), and it'll download them all for you.

I haven't used it in awhile though, so I'm unsure.

Also, if it gives it in epub, it's very easy to bulk convert to mobi. It probably lets you download in mobi though.
