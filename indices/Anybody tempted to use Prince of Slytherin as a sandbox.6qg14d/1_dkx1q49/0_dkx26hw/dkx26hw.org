While PoS has some bad writing segments, it's not all doom and gloom. It can be partially attributed to the large cast of characters. Not only do we get a full story from Harry's perspective, we get a fair amount from Peter, we get a pretty good look at Jim, we see Ron up close during the 2nd year incident and a fair amount of Ginny, etc. The pre-Year 3 interlude stuff is largely from the perspective of other characters and is, for the most part, effective setup (if not a bit too wordy, particularly the Ron segment). The original HP series was 1.08 million words, but each year in this fanfic is comparable to the length of OotP. Length isn't inherently bad. PoS makes an effort to hit all the major story beats of each story, even though it fails to do it concisely in many places (there are chunks of first year that could've been drastically cut down with little to no detriment to the plot or worldbuilding). Really, I'd love for the author to go back and make a full-scale edit when the fic is done, axing large parts of the story to make for a more tightly-woven narrative.

One example is how explicit the worldbuilding is. Like, I feel as if chunks of the fic would have fit well in a separate author's note doc that people could look at and that the author would keep in mind while writing the fic rather than being delegated to narration/exposition. Leaving stuff unstated/to be assumed, or specifically outlined in an external reference, would make the story more manageable without negatively impacting the worldbuilding. You see this with some of the more effective "video game mechanic" fanfics, which keep all the nitty-gritty details separate from the main fic.
