The website that does them (FF2Ebook) doesn't really work reliably with FFNet anymore - the FFNet admins changed the security on their site and bots are struggling to work around it due to the way they access the site to download fics.

It's just something we gotta be patient about. Someone will adjust their downloader bots to make them work properly again soon enough. :)
