They mostly heal, except if the wound is on the neck, I think? tbh that was kind of a plot hole, the one guy Duncan sliced across the voice box never healed right. And if they lost a limb, it stayed lost, but I always thought if it was near them when they revived it would reattach. It varied greatly, they could die by explosion and be fine in five minutes or five hours, they didn't take long to heal fully.
