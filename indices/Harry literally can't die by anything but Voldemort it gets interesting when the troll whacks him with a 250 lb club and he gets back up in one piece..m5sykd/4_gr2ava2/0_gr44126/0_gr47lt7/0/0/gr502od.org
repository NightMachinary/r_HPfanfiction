Huh. I did not know that it was healing and not the claws. You learn something new every day. :)

And I honestly have no idea if you are aging yourself - I only vaguely knew that there were superhero cartoons, but I have no idea when X-Men cartoons would've been made specifically. That could've been yesterday, could've been decades ago.

My exposure to superheroes is basically second-hand internet knowledge, the first avengers movie, whichever spiderman movie had the green armoured dude in it, the first season of the Arrow tv series, and the Logan movie - I also have vague memories of a friend introducing me to a spiderman videogame back in the day, but I don't remember anything about it beyond swinging through the city.

Superheroes are really not something I engage with at all, unfortunately. :)
