His superpower is actually his accelerated healing ability. It was what allowed him to survive the surgery to put the adamantium (the fictional indestructible metal) along his whole skeleton and give him his classic claws. I always found that so interesting about him. You think it's the claws that are his superpower but they're not. I'm not an active fan of superhero stuff these days but I remember getting up early Saturday mornings as a kid to tape X-men cartoon episodes. ðŸ˜‚ Am I ageing myself with that comment?
