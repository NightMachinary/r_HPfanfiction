  Apostrophe (') is used in abbreviations like you're, (you are), it's (it is) we're (we are, not where (where are my keys?).

  For possessive form (drink your tea) there is no apostrophe on any forms (my, your(or yours), his, hers, its (note the diffence to the abbreviation it's), our (or ours), their (or theirs)).

This is not correct. The apostrophe is used for possessives after a noun.

E.g. "That's Taure's tea, leave it alone." or "The mug's edge was chipped."
