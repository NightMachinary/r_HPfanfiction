I wrote it while I was a bit upset, so it came out as a nonsensical ramble. I meant specifically things like "its" vs "it's" and "you're" vs "your". You haven't seen the use of "he's", as in "he's hands were black from ink", though? I have a couple of times, and I want to tear my hair out from just writing it myself...
