Hold on. Is this implying that people are writing, "You'r tea monstrous." Or "His's tea is no better."

As a rule I think grammar is flexible in fanfiction just because there are A LOT of really pedantic rules in writing as well as the fact self editing always will miss something... but this is just vile.
