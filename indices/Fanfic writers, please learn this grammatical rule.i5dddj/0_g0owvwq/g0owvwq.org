my recent one is 'should of/could of' instead of 'should have/could have'.

I mean, seriously? and that too in 'with strength of steel wings', the same author as 'blindness'. Love both to death, really amazing world-building, writing style is awesome, the flow is done quite well, and then everyone says 'should of' as if they're illiterate.
