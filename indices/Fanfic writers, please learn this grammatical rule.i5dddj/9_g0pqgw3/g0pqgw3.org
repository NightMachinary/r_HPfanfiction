Not everyone's first language is English! Not everyone knows English grammatical rules, jesus, English doesn't know its own grammatical rules half of the time.

Be happy you are being given these wonderful stories for free, if it bothers you so badly, don't read those authors, or reach out and offer to edit their work for them.

In my own work and writings, I'm a stickler for correct grammar and making sure the syntax is just right; but in other's amateur work, I can let it slide, I can correct it in my head as I read and move on, I can appreciate that these wonderful people are donating their time and their soul to share their stories with me and may not have the resources (money, or even time or knowledge) to get a proof reader and editor. It is not a professional product, I won't hold it to the standards I expect of a professional piece.
