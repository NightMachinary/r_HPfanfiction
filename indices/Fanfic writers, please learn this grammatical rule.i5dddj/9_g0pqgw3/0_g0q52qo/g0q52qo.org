Fun fact: Most people making those kinds of "stupid" mistakes are actually native speakers.

Non-natives may still make those kinds of mistakes, but they usually will either make way more, or way less.

Yes, you can. So can most people. But you know what happens if you have to stop every 3 words and correct something? It gets tiring. And if the plot is mediocre and the pacing is off then adding those mistakes just makes the work not fun. And then I drop it, I and many others. The author just lost a bunch of readers.

You know what's funny though. We, the readers, actually want to /read/ stuff. It may sound strange to you, but the readers are also humans with desires. As such, people like me and OP will make threads like these in order to encourage authors to get better and write better fics. That way, the author improves and gets more readers, and I get more fics to read. Win-Win.

You sound quite condescending saying "I am a professional but I don't hold these poor smucks to my standards, that would be unfair!". What if they don't have time, money or knowledge? Does that mean that they don't deserve to improve? That they don't deserve to be given a chance to improve? You didn't mean to sound like that, but that's how it came out. It sounds quite insulting to all those people trying to get better despite their limitations.
