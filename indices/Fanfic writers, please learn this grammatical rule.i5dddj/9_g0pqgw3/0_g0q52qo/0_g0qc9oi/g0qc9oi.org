Honestly, if I have to stop every 3 words to correct something, or I just can't tolerate the way something is written, I ditch the fic and go find something else. Id not comment to say that I've ditched it, usually plenty others have said the same, and to keep bashing the author would feel cruel in all honesty. Believe me, i too want to read stuff, I spend an inordinate amount of my day reading, like more than is probably healthy, there's a reason I'm currently on book 50 of the year so far (though thats a slow year, a few years ago, thanks to depression, I think i did 33 novels in 45 days, insomnia makes for a lot of reading time). I dont tend to read fics that are less than 100k in length just because that is my preference due to how quickly I read. I never said I was a professional (I'm in accounting, not literature), I simply meant, I wouldn't hold fan fic writers to the same polished editing standard that I would expect from a traditionally published author, because they don't tend to have the team of professional editors and proof readers behind them, it just doesn't seem fair to do so. I've often considered reaching out to become a beta reader, its actually something I'd love to do at some point; unfortunately I'm an absolutely impatient binge reader and only read completed fics because I hate waiting for the next chapter to come out. (Though if proof reading/editing a novel length completed fic is something an author would want doing, i'd be so down for that) I appreciate that peoples writing style and their grasp of language gets better as they evolve as writers, its one of the reasons I love long fics, especially those written over a number of years, I love watching the storytelling and their voice evolve and become clearer, its actually a joy.

You may feel I was condescending in the way I worded my post, I felt the tone of the OP was condescending as well, so I matched it (or I did in my head, I'm not a writer, dont claim to be, while I'm articulate, I know i ramble and dont always present the clearest point)

I find that you can usually tell a native speaker from the way they write, I'm a lot less patient with their mistakes than I am with those who you can clearly tell arent native speakers.

But hey, if I enjoy what I read, I keep going, if I don't, I stop. Life's too short to read bad fiction.
