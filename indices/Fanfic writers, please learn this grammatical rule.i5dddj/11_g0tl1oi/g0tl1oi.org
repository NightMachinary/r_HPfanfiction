The rule I'd like more people to learn is the one concerning the use of "I" and "me" in compound subjects and objects. To get it correct, see how the sentence reads with the "I" or "me" by itself.

"Harry and me went to Diagon Alley" produces "Me went to Diagon Alley." It's understandable, but unlikely to be something any of the main characters would say. It should be "Harry and I went to Diagon Alley."

"He's giving private lessons to Neville and I" produces "He's giving private lessons to I." Also incorrect, and this one should be "He's giving private lessons to Neville and me."

The same applies to "he/him" and "she/her."
