One that always drives me nuts is seeing people mix up "except" and "accept." I'm aware they sound a lot alike, but they're spelled entirely differently and not even close to eachother in meaning.

I mean, when people mix up "affect" and "effect", it's still annoying, but at least the two words are very close in spelling and meaning, so it's easy to see how one might mix up the two.

Another one I've seen often enough to annoy me is "steal" vs "steel". I don't really people accidentally referring to the act of theft as "steeling", but I do see people refer to the act of bracing themselves as "stealing".
