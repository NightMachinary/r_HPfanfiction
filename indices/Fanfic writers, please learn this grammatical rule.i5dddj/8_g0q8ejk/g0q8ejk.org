Not gonna lie, with my writing there's probably so many apostrophes in the wrong places or there isn't an apostrophe in the place it should be or something like that, but I've been taught about apostrophes so many different ways since like year 4 they just confuse me now ðŸ˜‚ but if I were to post something, I'd edit it over and over to make sure all spelling and punctuation is right (tho there would definitely still be a few apostrophe mistakes no matter whatðŸ˜‘)
