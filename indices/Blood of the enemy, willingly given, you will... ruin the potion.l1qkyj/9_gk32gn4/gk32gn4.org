I am greatly enjoying the examples given in this discussion to attempt to subvert the ritual. Thank you for putting forth this post.

I've been contemplating this myself. I'm writing a fic where Snape gets caught up in magic gone wrong breaking the space/time compendium for him. He gets thrown into Nov of Harry's early school career. He's deaged and practically on Death's doorstep to top it off, but Madame Pomphrey is a badass and brings him around. He poses as his own bastard son, no one being wiser than Pomphrey and 'older' Snape. 'Older' Snape gets cozy with Quirrellmort in hopes of preventing everything. It doesn't, but it makes Voldie trust him to help during the tournament. They replace the bones of the father with bones of random animals. 'Young' Snape also hijacks the cup so he, disguised as Harry, donates his blood instead. He /is/ an enemy, but his premeditation makes the donation voluntary rather than forcibly. Hopefully all the alterations will hinder Voldy from successfully returning... but maintains 'older' Snape's viability as a spy if Voldy returns anyway. I'm having fun with it.
