I've seen this in a fic or two, usually crack-ish ones. Don't track the trope so I can't say which ones, but it's been done.

For the record, I've also seen an OP Harry levitate grass and other random ingredients into the cauldron when Wormtail's not looking. All those cauldrons he watched Neville explode (and his own sabotaged ones) gave him the idea.
