Would it ruin the potion... probably not. In fact, it would probably help.

The main theme of the ritual was "Dark Lord takes what he wants". Flesh of servant, bone of father, blood of enemy. Domination.

If the blood is willingly given, then the theme changes a bit.

A bit like with unicorn blood. If taken by force, it will still be a potent healing agent, it will just carry an equally potent curse. Thus, willingly offered blood would still provide power - and potentially also control over the donor, since blood in magic is usually "sacrifice/life/power". The act would translate to "I give my life/existence/power/essence to you" - very bad for Harry.

Now, contamination (even dirt) or swap (one fic had a small sack of assorted liquids harvested from Arcomantula glued to the wrist and disguised) would work, because the rituals are supposed to be pretty unforgiving of mstakes, and not providing the agreed upon payment (blood of enemy).

*My headcanon* is that you could fuck Voldemort over if you added granite dust at the same time as 'blood of the enemy' - as blood of the earth, it could result in Voldemort basically declaring enmity with the planet, which in turn is often considered the source of magic. Fun times!
