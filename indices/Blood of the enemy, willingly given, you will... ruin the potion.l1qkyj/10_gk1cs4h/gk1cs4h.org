/"Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken, will resurrect your foe," said Wormtail as he stabbed Harry in the arm, before the blood dripped into the vial./

/"Help yourself, Wormtail, by all means, take my blood," hissed Harry and Wormtail froze, unsure what to do, but the blood had to be added now for the ritual to go on right.

/"You're bumbling with the ritual has caused me to return at a fractured state, I'm required to take further steps to rectify it, thus distracting myself from my plans" said Voldemort as he looked in Wormtail's eyes, which were wide with absolute fear in them. Voldemort forced his way into Wormtail's simple mind and found what had happened. Potter's flippant remark about telling Wormtail to take his blood had botched the ritual. Magic had its strange way of leading a life of its own and one simple word could change an entire ritual. Voldemort thought Wormtail was a fool not to gag Potter./
