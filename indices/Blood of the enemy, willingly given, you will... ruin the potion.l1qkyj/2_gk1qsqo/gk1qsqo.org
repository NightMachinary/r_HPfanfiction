Oddly i'm working on one of these right now. Sneak peek

​

*Harry Potter and the Importance of Intent.*

/Because it's a loophole, but everything has it's risks./

Harry and Cedric nodded to one another “A Hogwarts victory!” they agreed and grasped the Tri-Wizard cup. Harry felt a tugging sensation behind his navel, as if he'd been caught by a giant hook, and the maze vanished into a swirling rainbow of light. Oh.. a portkey.

Harry fell to the ground when the portkey ended... on a wet grass in ... a graveyard.

This didn't seem right. And the stabbing headache in his scar boded poorly.

“Kill the spare” said a childish voice, someone chanted the incantation for a killing curse and a bolt of Green light hit Cedric Diggory, and he fell, his eyes open... and unseeing.

Harry tried to rise to his feet, but the pain in his head from his scar, the pain in his leg from the acromantula venom... Harry fainted.

Harry woke, to a hard poke in the stomach, tied upright on a ... grave. Harry twisted his head; he'd been tied to a statue of an angel of death. And the stabbing pain in his scar wasn't helping.

There was a huge... massive cauldron on a fire with something silvery-white in it. A short wizard in robes was stirring it.

“Last stir Peter, then the final ingredients” said the childish voice from nearby.

Harry looked over at the voice; it came from a tiny baby-sized bundle. A bundle he suspected was giving him a splitting headache.

Next to the cauldron, on a gravestone, lay a knife and a strip of cloth. And Harry's wand, next to another wand.

“Bone of the father, taken without asking, you shall restore your son” said the wizard... who looked like a thinner, lined Peter Pettigrew. He waved his wand, and below Harry's feet, the slab cracked, and a trickle of dust flew across the air into the cauldron.

“Flesh of the servant, freely given, you shall restore you master” said Pettigrew, picking up a knife from the nearby gravestone and ... cutting his whole hand off and dropping it in the cauldron, where it landed with a splosh. Pettigrew, white-faced and shuddering, bound the stump of his wrist in the cloth, and using his teeth and remaining hand tied it off.

As Pettigrew staggered towards Harry, holding the knife, the cloth wrapped around his stump stained red with blood he said fairly clearly “Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken, you shall restore my master.

Pettigrew pulled Harry's sleeve up and stabbed into Harry's arm with the knife.

Harry had an idea... not a great idea but he'd always thought well on his feet, as it were.

“Here... have it” said Harry, trying to relax as the knife cut his arm and the blood pooled on the knife-blade. When Pettigrew turned and headed for the cauldron without cutting Harry's hand off, Harry breathed a sigh of slight relief. Now... to see if he was right in his guess.

Peter dripped Harry's blood from the knife into the cauldron, and the liquid flared with a white light, bubbling and roiling. Then Pettigrew dropped the knife, and picked up the bundle, clumsily removing the wrapping from a hideous red baby “Quickly Peter” hissed the baby, and Peter dropped the baby into the cauldron, which continued to bubble. Harry's headache flared and faded. The light in the liquid faded, and a great cloud of steam billowed out of the cauldron. Peter stood, clutching his stump. Waiting.

When the steam dissipated, the cauldron was full of liquid.

“My Lord?” croaked Peter, his stump dripping blood now. Harry wondered how long you could go without healing if you cut your own hand off. There were a lot of large blood vessels after all.

When Peter resorted to using the stirring spoon to search the cauldron, Harry started to feel hope. He'd stood within eyeline of Neville in potions for years, and this looked like a potions-stuff-up.

Peter panicked for some reason ... and pulled the spoon out, the end having melted.

That was about when the cauldron exploded.

Harry woke up, lying painfully on a pile of rocks, the ropes wrapped around him a lot looser. His glasses were missing, his breath sounded strange, and he had a dizzy feeling that he had lost a lot of blood. And it was getting dark. Squinting, Harry determined that he was lying on the ruin of the statue he'd been tied to. He crawled out, still partly wrapped in ropes, that seemed to be partly shredded. In the distance, Harry squinted, he could see the cup glittering.

When Harry touched the cup, he was whisked off by portkey magic, landing in a very painful thud into the ground. Time must have passed, or something, because the sky was dark now.

Harry rolled painfully onto his back.

--==0==--

Harry woke up in an infirmary bed. The smell told him that if nothing else. Harry opened his eyes to the light, the white arched ceiling. Hogwarts infirmary.

“He's woken up” said Madam Pomfrey.

She blurrily fed Harry a bad-tasting potion. Then another. And then another. All the while talking about the weather and Harry's last quidditch match.

“Um” croaked Harry “I'm not well am I” he just managed.

“The explosion, whatever that was, did a lot of damage” said Madam Pomfrey.

“A lot?” croaked Harry.

“We can re-grow all the lost body parts. It's going to take a little while” said Madam Pomfrey.

Harry fell asleep.

Days of swallowing potions and eating small portions of food hand fed, and Harry squinted at his bandaged hands and arms “Madam Pomfrey, I'm burnt all over?” he asked.

“It's... cuts from pieces of cauldron and er... a dark potion.” said Madam Pomfrey.

Ron and Hermione came in around the cloth barricade, looked and tried not to look upset.

The way they avoided mentioning how hurt Harry was told him a lot.

A week later, with new eye-glasses Harry got out of bed, pulled on a dressing gown and took the crutches and went to the bathroom. The mirror told a tale. No hair, and his skin was a mass of burn scars that showed no sign of healing. Harry grinned to himself, his teeth very white and his eyes bottle-green “But you should see the other fellow” he said reassuringly to his own reflection.

His bits were growing back, so at least going to the loo wasn't too awkward.

Although Madam Pomfrey didn't want Harry to, he limped on crutches to the last day of term, in school robes. His hands and face looked terrible, but as he kept telling himself, the other guy looked worse.

The Great hall was full of talking students, but that all stopped when Harry limped in.

“Hello everyone, I'm not dead. Just badly burnt.” said Harry “Don't enter the Tri-Wizard tournament” he joked.
