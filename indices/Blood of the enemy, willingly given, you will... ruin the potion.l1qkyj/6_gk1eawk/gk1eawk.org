Even if Harry would have made sense of it in that moment and said "yeah? well have it then" I don't think it would have worked because it would still imply Harry was saying that to deter Voldemort from using it. An enemy such has Harry was with Voldemort would definitely not want their foe resurrected and anyways the incantation was pronounced after Wormtail took Harry's blood.
