I think that might be the only situation that it could work. That said, it could still depend - we're never told the full ritual, just the major component. For all we know, Harry's desire to kill voldie could fully satisfy the enemy requirement. The fact that he did not set put that day to give his blood means that it might still be forcibly taken. This might just come from my love of fics where magic is semi- or fully-sentient, just in ways that are hard for humans to understand.
