There's a few versions that I've seen in fanfiction:

1. It weakens the potion, so Voldemort "isn't as powerful" as he could have been - and inevitably, it's not explored exactly what that means.

2. They stop, just move a few steps to the left, and take the very dead Cedric's blood instead. "The Enemy" is pretty much any non-Death-Eater, after all.

I remember one fic where Winky, directed by Barty Junior, was the one to get the blood - while Harry was in the hospital wing and hopped up enough on something to believe it's for Poppy to examine it. That had Outcome Number One, from what I remember.
