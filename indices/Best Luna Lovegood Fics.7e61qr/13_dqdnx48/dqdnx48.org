Luna/Theo

Colubrina has a few stories with Luna and Theo Nott that I like. Most are short one-shots with the exception of "The Ones Who Ran", which is longer.

The Ones Who Ran [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11173524/1/The-Ones-Who-Ran]]

When the impossible happens and the bad guys win, would-be-heroes are thrown together with terrified partners in a plan none of them really want. "I know I'm part of what must be the worst day of your life," he said. "I know I'm the enemy. But, I swear, I'm not going to hurt you." Theo/Luna. Draco/Hermione. Blaise/Ginny.

Sunshine and Tomatoes [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11573650/1/Sunshine-and-Tomatoes]]

Theodore Nott had every intention of ignoring the Marriage Law - the very idea the government could force him to get married was absurd - until Luna Lovegood smiled at him in the dingy office, tomatoes in her hair.

When Luna Lovegood and Theodore Nott use the same tree to read under during her fifth year they become friends but can romance survive when you're on different sides of a looming war?
