I really enjoyed /I Know Not, and I Cannot Know---Yet I Live and I Love/ by billowsandsmoke. It's a one-shot that explores the relationship between Luna and our favorite Potions Master, Professor Snape from when she joins Hogwarts to when he dies. I think Luna's quirky characteristic is on-point without making her stupid or crazy as many fics do, and Snape's characterization makes sense too.

Also, it's not a romance, so don't worry about that.
