"Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection" is one of the first novel-length fics I ever read in Harry Potter. It's Complete. No pairings (Beyond Luna having a crush on Ron).

It's Luna's perspective of /Order of the Phoenix/ and it was actually published *before* /Half-Blood Prince./

Excellent pacing, with an emphasis on Luna's loneliness at Hogwarts. The development of her friendships with Ginny, as well as an OC-roomate, are simultaneously very sweet, and very tender. There's also heavy emphasis on /why/ Luna is the the way she is, though I dare not elaborate further. It's best to be read.
