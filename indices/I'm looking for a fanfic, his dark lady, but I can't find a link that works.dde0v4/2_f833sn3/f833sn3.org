You can download it somewhere, safely. I think you can find it on fictionhunt or something and download via the epub option. If you then download an app like lithium you can read downloaded fics in said app. Spoiler: it's really not that great of a fic.

It has like a single smut scene with an oc and uses the neglected harry for his brother the BWL trope with a lot of bashing.

Oh and Harry is a stereotypical Slytherin as a Gryffindor would see them and he's friends with Snape (yuck).

I know what it's like to wonder about the quality of a deleted fic. Don't waste your time on this one. The only potentially promising thing this had is a female Riddle but it got nowhere before the story got abandoned.
