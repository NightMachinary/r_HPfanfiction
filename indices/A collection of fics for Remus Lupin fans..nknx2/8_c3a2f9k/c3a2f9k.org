[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6275865/1/Remus_Lupin_PI][Remus Lupin, PI]] (20) by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2062884/Larry_Huss][Larry Huss]]. Completely AU, Remus takes Harry from the Dursleys, changes his name and sends him to Hogwarts while everyone wonders what happened to the 'The Boy Who Lived.' I'm hesitant to recommend this because it doesn't resonate with me as others have, but it is an interesting premise, and well-written. There's a 'male-fantasy' storyline with Hermione, Luna and Padma wanting to have their way (at a much too young age) with Harry, but Remus' story is quite interesting.

EDITed to add UPDATE: This fic is now complete. I recommended it while it was still a WIP, but now that it's finished I probably wouldn't have. It was interesting at first to consider the different choices Remus made and how those changes affected the overall HP storyline, but the last few chapters were subpar. The overall story itself might be interesting for those who would like to see the characters meet different fates, but it's not one of the better ones out there.
