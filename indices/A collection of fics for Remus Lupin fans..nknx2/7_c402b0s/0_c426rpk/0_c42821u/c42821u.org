Aww, thanks! I'm quite selfish in that I made this thread so I'd have a convenient place to store my own faves, but /all the better/ that others get a chance to enjoy them. I know I waded through more than my share of bad fics to find a few truly good ones, so I'm happy to spare anyone else the trouble, especially fellow Remus fans! Feel free to post any good ones that you find as well. I'm /always/ looking for more.
