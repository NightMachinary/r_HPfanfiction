As a writer and a reader, I agree that it's beyond rude to just take down your work. I hate when people do that. (My favorite writer, for instance, has a website and at one point, it had lessons for the language she wrote for her books, and then she arbitrarily decided that she didn't want to put it back up when she moved servers, and I actually get extremely angry at her for that because I was half way through the lessons. It would take her like two seconds to put it back up!!)

But, as a psychiatry hopeful and a sufferer of GAD, I have to make an exception for this person with my anger, because mental issues suck so completely. For both selfish (I'll admit it) and not-so-selfish reasons, I hope she feels better soon.

Thanks for posting the link anyway, and for taking the time to figure out why it went down. All of these stories are great, and I'm glad you recommended them! =]
