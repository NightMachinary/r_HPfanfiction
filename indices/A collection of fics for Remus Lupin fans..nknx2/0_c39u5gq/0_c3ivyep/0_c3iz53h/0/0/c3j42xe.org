Yeah, I'm not really angry at the author, I can empathize with her plight. Which is why I didn't email her as she suggested, but came here to get it off my chest.

I had a friend who was a talented painter, yet would continually paint over certain pieces that several friends had told her they loved. She'd paint it, show it to us, we'd gush, then she'd later decide it wasn't good enough and destroy it, and we'd be crushed. I've always felt that any art form is a purging, and once it's out there it's out there. Don't judge, don't second guess, just let it go, ya' know? Just a peeve of mine.

And heck, this story won some fanfic awards. Maybe that's not a big deal, but it at least means it didn't suck, as so many fanfics do. I can't remember the majority of that particular story, but I liked it enough to not only favorite it myself, but also to recommend it, and so did many others. It's a pity that isn't enough to make the author able to appreciate her own work.

I'm happy to hear you're enjoying the stories! I've waded through so much trash to find them, and while not all of the ones here are as good as I might hope for, I at least wanted to help some others have an easier time of it.
