Damn. I'm really starting to hate LiveJournal. It was there before, but now I'm denied too. I found that link from [[http://www.coffee-and-chocolate.com/2007/11/05/and-when-i-have-lost-everything-i-will-remember-this/][here on Coffee and Chocolate]], and it looks like it's been a working link since at least 2007.

I tried to google it, hoping it was posted on another site, but found [[http://paperclipbitch.livejournal.com/][this from the author]]. Apparently she doesn't want people to read her stuff, for now, and says maybe it'll be back in a few weeks.

I wish these stupid sites wouldn't block/remove stories. I understand that fanfic sites are respecting the authors' wishes, but could you imagine if a published author decided later that they wanted all their books destroyed? You put it out there, it's out there, so let others enjoy it. Sheesh. /rant
