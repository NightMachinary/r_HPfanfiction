This is Remus' story of his time at Hogwarts, and since it's unfinished I have no idea how far it will continue. There's plenty of Marauder action and Remus has a romance with an OC (Original Character). It's delightful. Well-written and riveting, with plenty of insight into his character and the people around him. Plus it's one of the best all-around Marauder fics I've read.
