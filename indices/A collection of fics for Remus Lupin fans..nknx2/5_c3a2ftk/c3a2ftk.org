[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2984737/1/Midnight_in_the_Owlery][Midnight in the Owlery]] (1) by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/236893/The_Treacle_Tart][The Treacle Tart]]. A good writer can make any pairing believable. This author turned out a lovely Snape/Lupin short story that I adore, even though I'm not a fan of Snupin. Completely AU, after the war these two emotionally-battered survivors reach out from their isolation. Their communication is perfect.
