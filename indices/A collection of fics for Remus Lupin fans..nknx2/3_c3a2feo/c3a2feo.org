[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2511561/1/Of_Blood_Ice_and_Fire][Of Blood, Ice and Fire]] (20-WIP) by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/718439/mercutio_rane][mercutio-rane]]. This is an older story that may well have been abandoned. The author wrote the last few chapters, but lost them in a crash and hasn't updated the story in years. AU, after the war, Umbridge has instituted some severe anti-werewolf legislation that forces them to undergo transformations at London City Holding, which is a brutal and deadly internment camp. NoblePrat!Remus risks his life to fight the discrimination. Even though it's not finished, it's a riveting story.
