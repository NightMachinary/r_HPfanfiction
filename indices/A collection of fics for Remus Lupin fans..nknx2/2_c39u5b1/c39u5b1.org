REMUS AND TONKS GET TOGETHER

(M) [[http://pandoras-fic.livejournal.com/2985.html][Consequences]] (28) by [[http://pandoras-fic.livejournal.com/][pandorajones]]. Super sexy, very flirty, yet angsty story. Tonks makes some poor choices, and seems a bit needy at times, but this is an excellent, well-rounded, well-written story that also showcases her Auror duties and the other Order members.

(M) [[http://www.thequidditchpitch.org/viewstory.php?sid=2626&textsize=0&chapter=1][Things I Have But Could Have Done Without]] (11) by [[http://www.thequidditchpitch.org/viewuser.php?uid=1204][modestyrabnott]]. This Tonks falls for Remus not because she needs him, but because she understands him. This is just a lovely story, and with only 11 chapters it will leave you wanting more. It's still well worth reading.

Another excellent story encompassing their relationship, and features Tonks' parents. While this was published before DH was released, Remus has an illuminating conversation with Ted Tonks that almost foreshadows, if not explains, him later leaving her in DH.

(M) [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3477455/1/Foot_In_My_Mouth_Heart_On_My_Sleeve][Foot In My Mouth, Heart On My Sleeve]] (1) by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1062330/Ms_Avi][Ms. Avi]]. Author's tagline: "Tonks, Master Bungler, thinks she should be quite used to making a fool of herself. So why does she get so flustered whenever she does so around a certain werewolf?"

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3540537/2/Midnight_in_the_House_of_Good_and_Evil][Midnight in the House of Good and Evil]] (2) by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/225422/Wild_Magelet][Wild Magelet]]. Author's tagline: "On the surface, Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks don't seem to have much in common. But then, on the surface, number twelve Grimmauld Place is the least romantic location in London. In an unlikely setting begins an unlikely romance."

The Rookie Series (13) by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1133405/jncar][jncar]] has Tonks and Remus meeting during GoF, while the new Auror is questioning the witness to Sirius Black's getaway, and follows them through DH. It's broken into 5 stories: 1. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3272821/1/The_Rookie][The Rookie]] 2. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3434239/1/Smoke_and_Wind][Smoke and Wind]] 3. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3499876/1/Drifting][Drifting]] 4. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3627652/1/This_Stony_Pass][This Stony Pass]] 5.

[[http://humongousbighead.homestead.com/shiftstoc.html][Shifts]] (40) and [[http://humongousbighead.homestead.com/shadestoc.html][Shades]] (42) by [[http://humongousbighead.homestead.com/hpfics.html][Fernwithy]] are each stand-alone 'novels' that correspond with OoTP and HBP, but with a focus on Remus' escapades working for the Order.
