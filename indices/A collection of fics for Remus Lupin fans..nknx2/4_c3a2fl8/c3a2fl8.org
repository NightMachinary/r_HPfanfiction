[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688609/1/A_Little_More_Time][A Little More Time]] (26) by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/74910/Jess_Pallas][Jess Pallas]]. Adult Teddy has a chance to save his parents and bring them through time in a way that is believable and fully canon-compliant ('dead' Remus still sees Harry in the forest), but it has consequences for him with the Ministry. While I don't like the R/T dynamic (she is too bossy and he is too resigned to her), the story itself will keep you on the edge of your seat. It's well-written, and a wonderful look into the future of the Ministry with Kingsley in charge and Hermione and Harry working there.
