First, let's examine the possibility of any sort of armor or material offering enough magical protection to block or negate the effects of a spell as strong as the killing curse.

There are two references to anything that functions like magical armor in Harry Potter.

Fred & George sell clothing & accessories with shield charms attached, but those quite obviously only have the effectiveness of a common shield charm and are useless against more serious curses such as unforgivables.

Dragon hide (and basilisk skin, similarly) is also mentioned as being magically resistant, and is commonly used as the magical world's equivalent to leather. Common work gloves for handling potions ingredients are made out of it, and widespread fashion accessories are also dragon hide. While some amount of magical resistance remains in this material, it is a reasonable assumption that it would only thoroughly protect against minor spells, or else we would have heard of it being used much differently. The word resistance is thrown around, but never immunity, and mere magical resistance is simply insufficient to defend against the killing curse.

If there was some sort of material that exhibited full on magical immunity, like Nth metal or something similar, it would be a candidate for magic-proof armor, but no such thing exists in this world, or we certainly would have seen some hint at it.

So now that we are able to conclude that no armor can negate the magical effects of the killing curse, we have to turn to the questions of "what is armor," "what is clothing," and "what counts as a spell actually hitting you."

We know that spells hitting your clothes fuck you up just fine.

We know that spells hitting inanimate objects completely separate from you obviously can't effect you. Or, wait a second, do we really? Every time we've seen a major curse blocked by a physical object it's been really substantial stuff like statues or big chunks of stone. If there was a piece of paper floating in the are between you and someone casting an AK at you, would that stop the curse in its tracks, or would it tear through the paper and keep on going? Spells seem to go through the water just as easily as they travel through the air so what's so special about solid objects? Well, perhaps even the smallest, lightest solid object could block any curse, but if you're just floating around a few pieces of paper, it would be trivial for your opponent to disperse them all with a little bit of wind or fire and leave you defenseless. The more substantial whatever you're blocking with, the more your opponent has to do to remove it.

And then of course, does "armor" count the same as any other clothing? I would argue that it does. For no other reason than the fact that nobody has been going around wearing heavy armor in magical battles already, and because overall wizards seem to put very little care in to what they're wearing. Even the likes of Dumbledore & Voldemort just wear ordinary robes like anyone else. Certain types of armor or clothing might offer specific physical protections, but when your opponent is capable of casting any type of magic at all, agility would seem to be the best option your clothing can possibly offer.

So overall I would conclude that the best one could wear would do a little, but not a lot, and the AK is something that requires even more than a lot to defend against. /Maybe/ if you wore 100 layers of dragon hide you could tank an AK but the mobility drawbacks would obviously make that strategy useless. There could theoretically be less absurd possibilities, but any additional thing that you attach to yourself is going to add on new vulnerabilities for a clever opponent to exploit.

It seems like Voldemort & Dumbledore really did have the right idea in the Ministry battle. Animating many large statues and conjuring massive & intricate shields. Beyond that, you're best off simply not getting hit.
