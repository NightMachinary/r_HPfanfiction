My guess is that if the curse comes into a certain range of your body, it kills you instantly by attacking your soul. So, its less physical, but more some kind of soul-magic at that moment.

On the other hand, I genuinely wonder what happens if somebody else gets hit by your Killing Curse, instead of your intended target.\\
Isn't the curse only working if your really want to kill your target? And shouldn't it become non-leathal if someone body-blocks the curse for your target?
