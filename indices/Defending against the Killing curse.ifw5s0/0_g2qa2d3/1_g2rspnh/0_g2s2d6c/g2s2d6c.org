  A suit of detachable paper could be used to float up in front of your person, removing it from You and blocking the deadliest of curses.

Well, if I had a detachable slab of granite (or even a thick ream of paper) on my chest that I removed and levitated in front of me, would it block spells? I think so, so why would paper not do the same? Or what if I was standing behind one of those Japanese paper screens? Could that block a curse? I think that in all of these situations, the spell is being blocked by something that is not part of You, so we're good there.

However, we instead have to deal with what spells (particularly ones intended to be used on humans or other living entities) do when they hit inanimate objects. The statue Dumbledore used to block the Killing Curse was destroyed, but the Killing curse leaves no mark on a living target. There may be other examples I can't think of right now, but that should be enough to prove the point. However, I think it is likely that the exact results varies depending on both the spell being used and the material it hits. Perhaps Materials Science is a field in the magical world.

  Going off the equipment slot theory, this also bungles the notion of shields. Physical ones, that is. If I raised a tower shield in front of a killing curse, I couldn't imagine it would would have the same effect as it striking my person/armour. It's the very basis of a substantial inanimate object that can and is used to block. However, theoretically, it should fail according to the Law of You?

Actual physical shields were one of the major gray zones in my theory that I didn't know what to do with. A large tower shield seems like it might be able to block a killing curse, but I'm not sure that a small buckler could.

I think that the animagus method is the most reliable way to identify You, and I think that a shield would transform with the user, which would suggest that they would not be able to block a Killing Curse.

Perhaps the fact that no one in the books ever carries an actual shield could be taken as evidence that they don't work. This doesn't seem like an oversight that could be attributed to the Magical World's lack of logic, as shields would have been common in the times of the founders and Merlin, so their usefulness should have been known then, if any existed. So perhaps there is a reason we only hear about Gryffindor's sword and not his shield. Even Sir Cadogan, an actual knight, did not use a shield, as far as I can tell (I haven't checked the text of the books, but the wiki makes no mention of a shield).

So I think I have convinced myself that shields are in fact part of You, and are thus not useful for blocking spells like the Unforgivables. This may seem counterintuitive at first, but magic is known to not always make sense.
