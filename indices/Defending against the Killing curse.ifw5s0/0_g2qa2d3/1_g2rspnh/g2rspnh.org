An interesting theory, one that seems plausible in the face of this awry conundrum. Even in dnd terms, it would be awkward if a mage cast a touch attack on a knight and it didn't work because 'Aha, t'was my armour you touched'.

But then this raises another potential problem. If the basis of You constitutes as something that is a part of you, and something that is not. A suit of detachable paper could be used to float up in front of your person, removing it from You and blocking the deadliest of curses.

Going off the equipment slot theory, this also bungles the notion of shields. Physical ones, that is. If I raised a tower shield in front of a killing curse, I couldn't imagine it would would have the same effect as it striking my person/armour. It's the very basis of a substantial inanimate object that can and is used to block. However, theoretically, it should fail according to the Law of You?

Either way, brilliant response!
