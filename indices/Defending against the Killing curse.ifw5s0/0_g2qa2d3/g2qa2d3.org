If you held a wand to my head and demanded I come up with a magical theory to explain how this works, I would probably decide to create the Theory of the Magical You.

Basically, for a spell cast on you to affect you, it needs to connect with You. The You is not just your body, but includes whatever could be described as being part of You at that time. Clothes are the obvious example. Not only have we seen the Killing Curse affect someone through their clothes, but almost every spell we've seen hit someone has hit them on a clothed part of their body a still had an effect. So your clothes are definitely part of You.

On the other end of the spectrum, if you were sitting in a car, and someone cast a Killing Curse or Jelly-legs Jinx or something at the car, it wouldn't affect you, because the car is not part of You. (Obviously the spell, depending on what it is, may affect the car itself, and thus indirectly affect you, but that is not the magic itself affecting you, so it doesn't count.)

A set of full-plate armor, while useful against indirect damage, would not, I think, protect you from an Unforgivable, because it's still part of You.

An Iron Man-style suit is ambiguous and requires further testing. Perhaps it depends on if you are more likely to say "I am Iron Man" or "I am in an Iron Man suit." (The interaction between magic and technology is, of course, firmly ignored in this example.)

An easy* way to determine if something is part of your magical You is to perform the animagus transformation. If the object in question disappears as you become an animal and reappears as you turn back, it is part of You. If you transform and find yourself continuing to hold/wear the object in question, it is not currently part of You.

Another easy, if perhaps less reliable, way to determine if something is part of You is to imagine yourself as an RPG character. If the item is equiped in one of your equipment slots, it's part of You. If you are just interacting with it, it is not part of You. If it is in your inventory but not equipped, the situation is ambiguous, and may depend on how your inventory is stored to begin with.

In summary, asking Tony Stark if you can borrow his suits to fight Death Eaters would be awesome, but may not provide the protection you want. But asking the Power Rangers if you can borrow their Megazords (or whoever is in charge in your favorite Mecha anime) to fight Death Eaters has absolutely no downsides.

*Well, easy in concept, if not execution. Asking someone else to transfigure you into an animal and back may also work, if you can find someone whose transfiguration skills you trust. Apparition with the object may also work, if you can distinguish between performing normal and side-along Apparition (assuming there even is a perceptible difference).
