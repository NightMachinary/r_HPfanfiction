Hmmm... good questions.

I think if a witch/wizard was the one throwing/moving the object, it would count (in terms of getting the magical "defence +1").

Otherwise it's a pure physics-based defence, so it works if the object has enough density/heft/momentum/etc to deflect/stop the curse. So the ceiling would work (effectively there's now a wall in the way), but a rock thrown by a muggle would be a million-to-one shot*.
