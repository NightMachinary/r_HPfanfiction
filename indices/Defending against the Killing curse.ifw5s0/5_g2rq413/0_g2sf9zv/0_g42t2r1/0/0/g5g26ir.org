In my defence, HP magic is rather wishy-washy. It's literally convincing the universe do to what you want by waving your hands around the right way. :)

Maybe there's no /known/ magical counter, as it's not something the Unspeakables like the idea testing (it would similarly not apply if the curse wasn't going to hit you in the first place). But I support the concept that the object should be something that /conceptually/ would block a spell (so a sheet of parchment isn't going to do any good either way).
