There's plenty of evidence from other contexts (e.g. the Fidelius Charm, the food exception to Gamp's Law) that the rules of magic in the Potterverse lean heavily on /concepts/.

Some [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gaquik/magical_cores_or_the_limits_of_a_wizard/][great analysis by Taure]] of how magic works notes the importance of factors like /will/, /concentration/, and /understanding/.

As such, I agree with the other posters that indicate armour would be ineffective due to it being a part of "You" (similar to your clothes), but I think your perception of it matters somewhat. A wizard/witch who believes they are "inside" a suit of armour (whether metal, dragon-skin, or something else) would probably have some protection from spells, but probably not enough to stop a Killing Curse.

Conversely, /any/ object that a witch/wizard causes to intercept a spell before it hits them will work* *if they use magic to put it there*, as their intent is to block the spell.

* You probably also have to take into account factors like power-differential between the caster and the defender. For example, Dumbledore could use a feather to block a Killing Curse from Random Death Eater Mook #47, but needs something more substantial (e.g. blocks of masonry, bits of statue) to block one from Voldemort.
