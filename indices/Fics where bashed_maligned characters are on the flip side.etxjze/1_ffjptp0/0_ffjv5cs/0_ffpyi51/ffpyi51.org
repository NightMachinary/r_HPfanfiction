That said, how often /does/ Hermione get bashed for scheming? I know that a fair number of people around here have a problem with that aspect of her character, but I don't know many fics where she's bashed for it. Usually, it's stuff like,

1. authority-worship, book-worship, and generally being Lawful Stupid;
2. siding with Manipulative!Dumbledore over Harry;
3. being overly morally inflexible, haranguing the Gray!Edgy!Protagonist about doing grey, edgy things.
