I was referring in the traditional "side with Dumbledore" (or sometimes Molly) thing, after all, you generally don't generally have 11 year olds be the mastermind of plots.

Both Ron and Hermione's biggest bashing can be played solo (Ron is jealousy, and Hermione's is being inflexible and authority worship). When they are played as part of a more elaborate plot though, they tend to follow both of those patterns.

However, with Ron, following Dumbledore's evil plot for jealous reasons is usually "I was promised fame/fortune/whatever to pretend to be his friend etc", and Hermione is usually "I'm a true believer / I do as the authority says". This makes Ron more miniony somehow (Because he isn't usually portrayed as a conspirator, just a tool), while Hermione is usually displayed as... being a more active part in the plot? Actively taking initiative to see the goals through rather than just doing what is told.
