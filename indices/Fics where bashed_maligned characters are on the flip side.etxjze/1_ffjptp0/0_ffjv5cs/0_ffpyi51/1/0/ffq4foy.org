  I was referring in the traditional "side with Dumbledore" (or sometimes Molly) thing, after all, you generally don't generally have 11 year olds be the mastermind of plots.

That makes sense. However, I think it's an easy mistake with Hermione in particular: she was 13 when she produced and executed a plan to secretly brew a semi-legal potion from stolen ingredients, kidnap and impersonate three of her classmates, sneak into their dorm, and interrogate a fourth one; 15 when she kidnapped and blackmailed a reporter; and 16 when she organised a militia in a school. So, you might want to edit the OP to clarify. :D
