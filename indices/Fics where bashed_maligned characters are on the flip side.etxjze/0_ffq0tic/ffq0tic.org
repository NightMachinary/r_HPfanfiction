Off the top of my head,

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8527691/5/An-Incomplete-Potter-Collection][/An Incomplete Potter Collection/ by Racke, Chapter 5, "Ambitiously Ron"]]: Manipulative!Dumbledore sends Ron to befriend Harry on Hogwarts Express in order to get Harry under his thumb. Ron has other ideas.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4070610/79/Thrilling-Tales-of-the-Downright-Unusual][/Thrilling Tales of the Downright Unusual/ by Clell65619, Chapter 79, "The Obligatory Marriage Law Fic"]]: two bash-subversions for the price of one: Ron is a loyal friend to Harry and Hermione despite being pressured by the whole Wizengamot (including, unfortunately, Dumbledore), and of Harry and Hermione, Hermione is portrayed as the more dangerous one.
