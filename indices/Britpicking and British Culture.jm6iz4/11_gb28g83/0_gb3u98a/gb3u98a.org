I admit, you should take this with a pinch of salt, since I wasn't alive then and only know this second-hand, but nobody seems to be still reading this post and I wanted to make sure you at least had AN answer. (Anyone who knows more, feel free to correct me!)

Britpop was big in an 'outside-the-scene' sense, but not as all consuming in the music world itself. Like, the regular news would report on how Blur and Oasis were releasing an album at the same time and clearly it's a war of the bands and all that, but there was a lot more awareness of variety in the actual music scene itself. Like, the people who bought music magasines and regularly followed band news and went to clubs and bars and concerts regularly would know about more. We had a particularly thriving dance music scene at the time, for example, that grew out of the Madchester lot in the 80s. Manchester was really, really big for music and variety, so there'd be a lot more casual awareness there too, because everything was just swimming in publicity for it.
