British Fashion in the 90s please! How did they dress up? I keep reading all these Fics about sleek well fit suits and dresses etc., Jerseys even! As a football player I recollect those jerseys well enough, it was big baggy t-shirts with collars, and tucked in. But I'm not sure about fashion for teenagers and adults in the 90s in UK.
