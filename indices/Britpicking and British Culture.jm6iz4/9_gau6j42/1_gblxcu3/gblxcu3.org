It depends. If you're talking about teenagers, a lot of grunge influences. Trousers were typically quite baggy, rather than skinny jeans like now. Acid wash denim was definitely in. Tops were typically cut quite high, too. Jumpers were also a big thing. They often had a logo on the front, and we're usually a cotton woven material, rather than a knitted wool jumper.

For office/ work fashion, skirts were short and typically above the knee. They were also quite fitted and worn with a blouse. I've also seen some truly awful outfits that included matching coloured tights and skirt. Shoes often had a square toe, rather than an almond or rounded toe.

Dungarees and pinafore dresses were quite a big thing too, usually worn with a high neck top underneath.

Basically spend a lot of time googling fashion in the right year.

For dressing up, satin was the thing in a big way. Look at Drew Barrymore in the 90s. She was the height of fashion.
