I don't know specifics, but a friend is really into fashion, so I kind of osmosed a few things over the years. :D

I know the 90s was a very weird era for fashion. The whole 'model influence' thing was growing pretty rapidly and the international scenes were starting to meld together more, so a lot more variety was starting to develop.

I know that generally most people in the UK in the early 90s favoured grungy, baggy clothing and the late 90s (post-Kate Moss' 'Heroin Chic' intro into the fashion world) started to become more well-fitting. I'm not sure how that'd vary across the generations or social groups here though, my apologies. If you want ideas on how the rich would dress, I'd check out some of the fashion shows from the era you're trying to write in. The patterns and concepts demonstrated there tend to be what influences the 'high fashion' stuff the most. For regular people, I'd check TV shows made in the era. They'd probably mimic a slightly toned down version of what the 'typical person' might wear.
