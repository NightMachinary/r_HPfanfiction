I've got to admit, I've started finding that one funny. If I ever get a HP fic written, I totally intend someone to make that mistake and have the outcome be... Scottish. Very, very Scottish. :D

For anyone wondering, there's an odd mishmash of terms associated with the UK and each refer to a different thing.

- UK/United Kingdom - The political union of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland (ie. the whole thing, except the Republic of Ireland)
- Great Britain - The name of the big island that holds Scotland, England, and Wales. Before you ask, I have no idea if the 'Great British Bake Off' name is in reference to it being made in Great Britain or if the 'great' is a self-compliment. Either way, tru dat.
- Britain - Sometimes used as a slang synonym for the UK, other times just a shorter way of saying 'Great Britain'. Like all things British, context is important here.
- Scotland - the one at the top with the kilts and Hogwarts. If you ever get a chance to go to the Edinburgh Fringe, do so as it's a lovely time and a gorgeous city.
- England - the one at the bottom with the tea and Ministry.
- Ireland - Technically should be just 'Northern Ireland' when referring to the UK bit (and it'd always be referred to that way officially), but we often shorten it in conversation. The Republic of Ireland is the independent part at the bottom.
- Wales - the one at the side with the Dragon Flag and Torchwood.
