Is it a cliche for British people to be gloomy, or have a cynical world view? I read somewhere one stereotype Brits have regarding Americans is that they're cheerful and positive minded. (I wouldn't say that's the case now but this was ages ago.) Likewise, one stereotype I had about British people (specifically the English) is that they have an "Oh well, what can you do?" sort of attitude. Does that have any basis in fact? Or have I watched too many historical dramas with brooding types?
