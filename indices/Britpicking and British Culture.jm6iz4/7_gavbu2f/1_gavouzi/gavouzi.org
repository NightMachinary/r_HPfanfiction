Stoicism is the national character across all of Britain. Sometimes it gets called ‘the stiff upper lip'. If you want an example, it used to be British Army doctrine that ‘British Officers don't duck' an officer was expected to maintain his cool under fire and always walk upright to be an inspiration to the man. If you show that you are unafraid, then the men are less likely to be afraid. For an officer to duck behind walls would be to show cowardice in fromt of the men.

Stoicism isnt really limited to the ‘stiff upper lip' of the upper classes. Growing up in the lower classes in Scotland, and having a relatively outdoorsy childhood, I could come home with all sorts of cuts and bruises and my mum would be like ‘Ach yer fine, whit ye whinging about?' And so on. Since you get taught that no-nonsense stoicism from an early age, it does end up making you more reserved. The thing is there are certain types of people who are and those who aren't. The stiff upper lip tends to just be a preserve of the upper classes, despite a sort of no-nonsense stoicism appearing in people around Britain.

It should be noted that Class, and the British class system is kind of complex, but be aware that ‘Wealth does not make you upper class' its a lot of things like, how you speak?, where you are from?, what jobs did your parents have? Etc. Upper class is bred, not made. To be upper class is to be born into a ‘wealthy' ‘old money' family, the nobility with large estates, being educated at schools like Eton, Harrow, Gordonstoun etc and then being an Oxbridge (Oxford and Cambridge candidate) and just typically being divorced from reality in some way.
