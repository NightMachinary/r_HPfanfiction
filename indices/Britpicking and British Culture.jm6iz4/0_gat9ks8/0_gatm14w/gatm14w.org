I'm not sure about the 90s specifically, but pillock, tosspot, tosser, wanker, bell-end (maybe a bit anachronistic), bastard, git, twit and berk should work for insults; swear words should not be too different from America, but you might want to throw in bugger (as an exclamation and as 'bugger [that thing]'), bloody (as a description ('the bloody car'), intensifier ('I bloody love...') or 'bloody hell' as an exclamation). 'Buggered' can also mean broken or thoroughly worn out (like 'fucked'). If it is a more racy fic, you might want 'shag' as a fairly coarse word for 'have sex'.
