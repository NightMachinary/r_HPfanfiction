Greetings! Australian here. I use this because this country has quite the reputation for using the word. We are quite close to our old friends in the United Kingdom, so I hope I am not veering off into the deep end. Either way, ‘cunt' is a bit of an extreme thing. It is either a one or a ten on the scale. Some people will laugh it off and slap you on the back, others may get a shocked expression and go deathly white, wobbling on their feet as if they are about to pass out. Do not come to Australia and start calling people cunts because the media has portrayed it as alright. It is not as commonly used as people think it is.

Now, my Nan is from Britain. She is very, very posh and well-spoken. Literally speaks like the Queen is the room and I love her for it. You never whisper the word ‘cunt' in her presence. Do not even think the word. It literally is considered one of the most aggressive and disrespectful swear words. I think it still holds that title. In the 90s and 2000s, I assume so. Again, she is very well-spoken and she never heard the word uttered as an insult before, especially not by children or teenagers.

I honestly cannot see any pure-blood children using the word, nor would I see anyone from a mid-wealth setting using the word. I think it would have to be the lower class and, even then, I cannot see it working. I would simply just go with ‘he swore' or whatever. Even Rowling did it. I think it would pull me out of a story if I saw the word cunt plastered on it.
