Yeah as someone who grew up in Britain in the early 2000s I can tell you cunt was a fairly commonly used word by kids aged 11 and up. Not really that big of a deal amongst friends.

And it is used pretty widely across the class spectrum - I didn't really think people would be that entrenched in the class based thinking on here honestly.
