Op asked for insults, but again fair point it can be used in a casual way but it's uncommon to do so at least in my experience my friends haven't used it in that way (I'll admit I come from what would be described as upper middle class family). I would disagree on it not being misogynistic tho ask any woman older than 30 and they would probably agree and that you wouldn't use it around your mother or grandmother.
