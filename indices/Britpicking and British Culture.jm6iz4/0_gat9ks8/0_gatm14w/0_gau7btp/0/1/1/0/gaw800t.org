There's a difference, dick is the informal word for penis. While it's used as an insult it isn't has harsh as cunt which has more negative connotations towards the female gender and is seen as being more vulgar in comparison to other slang for the female genitalia (pussy, fanny and so on). Prick is more comparable due to it being more emasculatory towards the recipient of the insult, insinuating they have a small penis but doesn't carry the same level of disrespect in my opinion. But you are right you wouldn't use this type of language around pleasant company. I didn't mean to insinuate any of this language is acceptable just that cunt stands a bit higher on the list so to speak.(to me at least)
