That's a really good point to make about insults and swearing in British Culture, actually. There's a lot of context to the words - who you're saying them to and where you're saying them. Saying Cunt to your mother in a library would be a terrible faux pas, but saying Cunt to your mates in the school cafeteria would be tolerated far more often (assuming no teacher heard you, anyway).
