I'm Scottish so I may have some more that may be useful due to hogwarts being set in Scotland. And how prolific we Scots are for our colourful language. But slag is another way of calling a girl a bitch or whore.

Then you have chav or N.E.D which translates to non educated delinquent normally used on a person that exhibits anti social behaviour such as bullying, petty theft, gang violence/activity, vandalism, drug use and minor distribution and generally disturbing the peace. Often characterised in wearing cheep tracksuits or cottons. (Dudley dusrley would be considered a chav or Ned)

You missed cunt which is very disrespectful and is considered worse than fuck also extremely sexist. The word itself describes the female genitalia in a very unpleasant way and is generally used as an insult to someone you particularly hate. It's also commonly paired after with “no wait, a cunt is useful for something” implying that the female genitalia is useful in acts of a sexual nature and that the insulted party is useless or unwanted by anyone. (Seriously nasty thing to say and is only really used by very unpleasant people too insult other seriously nasty people aka Umbridge or Dursley level unpleasant)

There is also the likes of arsewipe or shitstain which are fairly self explanatory along with skidmark which is another word for shit stain.

There's also scrote which is an insult calling a person a scrotum or ball bag, normally used instead of little shit for an annoying person. Also has negative connotations for a person's appearance and insinuates they are dirty/unclean in reference to sexual activity.

Another Scottish insult would be to call someone a tube insinuating they are an idiot. Can be most effectively used between friends or siblings in an exasperated way when one is doing or saying something stupid.

There are many many more but those are some of the most common ones that were used in the 90s chav especially due to tracksuits being popular among young people then.
