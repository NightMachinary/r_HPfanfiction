Spastic was also used quite a lot in Scotland up until recently, for obvious reasons, so a good fit for the 90s I'd argue that the rule of Scottish swearing, is really based on tone and such like. Spastic, Cunt and the like can all be terms of affection amongst your pals, ive even had â€˜You absolute spanner' thrown at me a few times. So swearing can be equal parts actual exclamations, playful insults and real insults
