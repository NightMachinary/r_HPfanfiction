I'm relatively new to fanfictions and have only read a few, but I do find it is the attitudes, more than language, that is more American than British. Here are some from the last dozen I skimmed.

A great deal of pearl-clutching and "sassy" telling-off at men's use of swear words ("Excuse /you/, mister! Don't make come down on there and wash that mouth out with bleach!" -- Lavender to Ron).

Considerable prudery surrounding "rules of dating", interspersed with some slut-shaming. Very 80s Harlequin.

Poor Hermione's old man forever having rather threatening talks with her young men about their intimate relation.

Considerably more liberal use of "sir" and "ma'am".

A very different idea of what sarcasm or a biting retort means.

Absence or misunderstanding of banter.
