Funnily story from me, a brown girl who's lived in Britain her whole life. Because I'm brown I'm influenced mostly by my "home" culture I don't have that "British colloquial" so to speak. I hope that makes sense.

Anyways in HP fics I always read the insult "tosser" a lot- I kind of assumed it was common and I used it a lot in my head. Because of how the word sounds I always just thought it meant layabout or lazy or something.

So the other day, I said to a dude in my class (in a jokey way) "X you tosser!" And then my two friends starting laughing incredulously. "[[/u/browtfiwasboredokai][u/browtfiwasboredokai]] do you even know what that means?!" And they looked so comedicially scandalized at my innocent face. I asked her what it meant and she just said to Google it,which I didn't do until a couple days later.

...a person who masturbates a lot. That's what a tosser means. I called a classmate who I don't even know properly a masturbator!!! I know that it probably meant something different in the 90s but that's what it means now. :///
