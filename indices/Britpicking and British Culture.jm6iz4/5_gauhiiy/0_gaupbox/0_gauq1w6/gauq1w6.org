It actually makes total sense. It's government, so therefore it is confusing, contradictory, and is unaccountably complicated.

As for the fictional PMs predecessor being a man instead of a women, well, the one mentioned in canon is claimed to have tried to throw Cornelius Fudge out of a window. Knowing what I know about Margaret Thatcher (admittedly little, but enough), that sounds like something she'd do (mistaken gender aside).
