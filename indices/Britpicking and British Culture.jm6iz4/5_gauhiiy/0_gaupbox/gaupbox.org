This is a bit of a tricky one because the books don't really seem to line up with existing prime ministers.

John Major was prime minister at the time for most of the books (more on that below). He was a conservative, at the end of over ten years of conservative rule. The prior prime minister (Margaret Thatcher - and if you want a sense of how polarising a figure she was, she was very much the UK's Reagan, for worse or worse) hadn't left the job because of retirement or the other party - she was very much brought down deliberately by party infighting and Major was installed instead. This is surprisingly common in the UK system - people don't elect a prime minister directly, they elect a local member of parliament, and the party with enough to form a government wins. That party's leader becomes prime minister - and it's entirely possible for a party to change their leader in wahtever way that party happens to make that happen. Generally there's some polling of members of that party, but far fewer british people are affiliated with their parties of choice for various reasons I'm not going to get into here, because this comment is already tangent heavy.

My point is that it just doesn't really work if it's John Major. The Prime minister at the start of book six refers to his predecessor being a man, which he wasn't, and there's some general stuff about the timelines of when previous prime ministers/ministers for magic came in that just doesn't quite line up properly. Honestly, I'd suggest having a fictional prime minister anyway if they play any major role in your story - the baggage of real people and real politicians is a /lot/ and I can only imagine it interfering with most plots.

In May 1997, Tony Blair wins a landslide victory and the first Labour government for decades arrives on a message of hope and change. Obviously, this being politics, it doesn't quite pan out that way over the next few years. But this is as everything is going down in the wizarding world with the war, so it may be less relevant, in a lot of ways.

Sorry, this message goes on a lot of tangents, so I hope I've made some kind of sense. Let me know if you have any more questions or if I've done a bad job explaining anything.
