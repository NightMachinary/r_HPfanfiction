John Major. Tory party. Coming off the back of Maggie Thatcher the Milk Snatcher. The number of MPs in the House of Commons has changed over the years but is ~650 and very heavily stacked in England's favour, for good or ill, as a Scotsman I can tell you that thats a heavy point of contention as essentially whatever way England votes pretty much categorically decides which party is elected. One MP gets selected as Speaker of the House of Commons and thats basically the moderator of the debates. MPs vote Aye or No by splitting off into different rooms and being counted as they go. When a party wins the election, the leader of the party goes before the Queen to ask permission to form a government, then selects a cabinet from there. It is customary but not necessarily essential that the Party leader becomes PM. The Leader of the Opposition, usually the second largest party in parliament and election runner up, forms the ‘Shadow Cabinet' and its roll its usually to hold the government to account and almost act like ‘this is what we'd do differently'. MPs that are not part of the government or opposition cabinets or frontbenchers, are known as ‘backbenchers'

When a bill is passed by the Commons it progresses to the House of Lords, where it can be blocked, or assented and then goes on to the Queen for Royal Assent. The lords have 797 unelected seats, consisting of lords spiritual (religious figures) and lords temporal (life and hereditary peers) Life peers served for life and hereditary seats are hereditary. The HoL follows a similar party structure to the commons, Conservative (Tory) Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat, Plaid Cymru etc, although there are a significant proportion of Crossbench or independent Lords.

More info can be found on the parliament website.

It should be noted that the UK doesnt have a written, formal document for a constitution its more that there is an expectation of precedent and sort of good practice which makes ‘constitutional crises' really difficult to resolve, though flouting precedent is highly irregular and usually taken quite seriously, so if you base your stories heavily off parliament dont have characters just ‘shake things up' See Oct 2019 prorogation of parliament. Prorogation is the discontinuation of a parliamentary session, normally invoked by the Queen at elections and stuff but its really at the behest of the PM
