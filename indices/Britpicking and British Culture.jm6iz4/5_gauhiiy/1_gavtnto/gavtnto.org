Tinyporcelainehorses and Dukav both give a pretty good summary of Parliament (basically the governing body of the 'government' - they run and provide governance for all the ministries and departments and such that do all the business of actually doing things). This is a pretty good summary from the UK Government structure themselves. I'm not sure how many of the terms vary elsewhere, so feel free to ask if you need any clarifications. :)
