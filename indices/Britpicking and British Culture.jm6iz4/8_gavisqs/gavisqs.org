I am an American who reads HP fanfic, but doesn't write any. I do write for a couple of other British fandoms: Lewis and Endeavour (and used to write for Doctor Who, and may return someday). Is there a sub Reddit where I can ask questions about vocabulary and daily life? There used to be a Britpicking community on LiveJournal (yes, I know I'm dating myself). Is there anything like that on Reddit?
