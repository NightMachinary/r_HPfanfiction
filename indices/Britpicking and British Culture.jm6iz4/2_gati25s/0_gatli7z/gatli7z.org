I know Britain got very obsessed with football in '96, because that's the year I was born and football people keep making references to it when I mention that.

When you say TV shows, what age range do you mean for? Like, are you asking what Dudley would watch with his mates, or what Vernon and Petunia would watch?

Armed Police have always been the exception here. The initial idea was to have them not be armed so they'd bring up less memories of soldiers being used to keep order and people would be more cooperative - the mindset in policing is almost always 'police by consent' or 'community policing' here, meaning the police force encouraged the cooperation of the public rather than controlled them with force. We had some more arming-up moments in the late 1800s after some police shootings, but even then carrying the guns was voluntary on the part of the officers and the vast majority of police were never armed. Even now, we only have about 6000 gun-trained officers out of somewhere over 120,000 officers total.

Guns were formally retired for regular officers in the 30s, but there were always some kept in stations throughout and after the Second World War (army veterans from the World Wars). Still never a significant thing.

In terms of gun laws tightening, you're probably referring to the Dunblaine Massacre (also in '96), but that was just a handgun ban for civilians. For the police themselves, they got severely restricted after a series of civilian shootings in the 80s, but for the most part we've never been 'gun nuts' like the Americans so the police haven't really needed them (our police sometimes count gun use in 'bullets fired per year'). It's just not in our culture.
