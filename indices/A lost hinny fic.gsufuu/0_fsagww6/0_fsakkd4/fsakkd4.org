Hey this is the same person who posted the above post.I just used my sister's account. Thanks a lot for helping me. I can find it easily now coz i am kinda a regular reader in that site and the author. If u don't mind me asking ,are u the same pottermum from fanfiction. net and siye.co.uk

I just checked your profile and realised u really are 'the' pottermum. Oh my god i love ur fics. I read every single one of them and have been a fan of yours since 2 years. I am so overwhelmed right now. I don't follow u on either of the sites coz i don't have accounts there. I check out ur account everyday, waiting for ur chapters. Please keep writing those amazing fics. This really made my day. Have a good day!!!
