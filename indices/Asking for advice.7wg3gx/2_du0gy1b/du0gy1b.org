The middle question is the hard to answer one because everyone has a different taste. People think my story bashes hermione and nope out. But at the same time, other people love how i treat hermione so far. Thats the thing, no one has the same tastes. There are several people on the internet who will hate what you wrote for some reason. So my tip is, just write. Fuck the tropes. Fuck the political landscape. Figure out why you want to write and do that.

I write fanfiction to stay sane and cuz its fun. I write so that my ideas are out there, and i post it because i want to share. I take pride in my work and want to improve yes, but improving doesnt mean i change my story to cater to the fickle wishes of the world. And honestly, thats the issue with fanfiction. Its for the fan. We consume it because we are fans, but in many senses its not just for us. The author is a fan too. And while yes, i get tired of reading every trope out there, its not fair to say their story is shit just because it utilizes those tropes.

Now if you are building a story, do something new. A concept you habent read before... An idea that you expanded on. Use tropes if you want. But as long as you wrote something interesting, it will be read.

Good luck.
