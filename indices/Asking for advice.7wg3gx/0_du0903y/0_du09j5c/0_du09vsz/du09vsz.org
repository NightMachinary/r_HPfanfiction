It's interesting for some backstory stuff on some characters like McGonagall. I didn't realize that she is half-blood herself and used to be married, for example. I tend to use it for flavor stuff like that. I agree that if you're looking to see what sort of wood Ginny's wand is (yew, BTW), the wiki is fine.
