I don't understand why everyone is so anti-Pottermore here. It's fine and everyone has the right to their opinions and favorite resources, but it seems odd to me. Is it because a lot of it was written after the books? Is it because people want JKR to put out an encyclopedia already? I'm bitter about it because I've never managed to get sorted. Every time I've tried it, it says some BS about my email address already being used or something. Super annoying!

Regarding the wiki, I know I've been called out for recommending it as a resource. I forget who did it, but I was corrected and pointed to the HP Lex. So, y'all just use what you wanna use.
