There are people who dislike /Pottermore/ as Rowling just not wanting to let Harry Potter go already. They think she just keeps adding random, poorly-thought-out nuggets of information to keep the fans happy but it's all running on autopilot.

All this being said, I'm not one of these people. Conceptually, I /like/ Pottermore. What I don't like is that it's very hard to navigate if you're looking for specific information about a specific topic. The Wiki is constantly updated with any new info found on /Pottermore/, and it's actually easy to browse.
