I agree with refreshing yourself on the books, first and foremost. For research bits, HP Lexicon and Pottermore are good resources. For style, get yourself a copy of the Chicago Manual of Style or bookmark the website.

As for common bad things, search this sub for "pet peeves". Therein lies your answer.

Get yourself a good beta and be willing to take criticism.

Happy writing!
