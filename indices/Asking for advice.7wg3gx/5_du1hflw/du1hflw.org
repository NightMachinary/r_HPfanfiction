I think HPLexicon is the best. There's a lot of information on the HP wiki, but it mixes up info from canon and the movies and games and such, and since the movies usually contradict the books, that makes the wiki pretty useless to me.

As for what to avoid: I would say, don't make the characters one dimensional. The book characters (but not the movies) have their strengths and flaws and are well written, complex characters. Very few writers manage to capture that, so you often see only certain aspects of a character. But it comes down to personal taste.
