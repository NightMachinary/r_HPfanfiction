  What are some of the common bad things writers in this fandom do that's simply put bad?
#+end_quote

- Making the Death Eater anything but the utter human waste they are. Their ideology and methods are straight from the history books (Hitler's rise to power) and under their reign, Muggleborns were rounded up and sent to a repurposed Azkaban (Concentration Camp), outright hunted (Einsatzgruppen analogy) and subject to arbitrary commissions organising the entire thing. They are not some misguided kids, they are racially motivated terrorists who stage a coup. And there was always the option to grab your loved ones and get aboard British Airways 15 to Sydney via Singapore before making your way to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulo,_Queensland][Eulo]]. But people chose to stay and join him. Even Malfoy could have taken his mother and fled.

- Unnecessary bashing. Let's say you do not like Ron Weasley and want him out of the trio. Instead of some weird plot where he is dosing Harry&Hermione with love potions because he is working for the +Dark Lord+ Leader of the Light^{^{TM}} Dumbledore, simply make Harry stick up for Hermione at the Yule Ball or not take him back after the first task. Or, even simpler, have him drift away because he is +balls deep+ in love with Lavender and spends his time with her. You do not need to make characters cartoonish evil.

- Tropes. Most are repeated to oblivion and beyond. They might get you popularity at FFN, but the common ones do not make a story good. In most cases, they are simply wish-fulfilment (lots of cash, political power, being able to trash anyone with ease, the hot girl(s), a large manor and so on).

- Harems. Just no. Having a collection of girls is an easy sign to spot bad fics, since the girls are always just trophies.
