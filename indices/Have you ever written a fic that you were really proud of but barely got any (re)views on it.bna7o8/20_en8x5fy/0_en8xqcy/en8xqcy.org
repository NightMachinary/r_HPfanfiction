Most of my fics revolve around Snape. I'm currently writing a very long time-travel fic where Snape goes back in time to find Lily again and take of Harry's place in the upcoming war. (I just posted my 200th chapter).\\
I've also written a lot of short fics about Helga Hufflepuff, Luna Lovegood, Viktor Krum, Nearly-headless Nick and Sirius Black. My favourite thing to do is add real historical happenings or folklore into the story.
