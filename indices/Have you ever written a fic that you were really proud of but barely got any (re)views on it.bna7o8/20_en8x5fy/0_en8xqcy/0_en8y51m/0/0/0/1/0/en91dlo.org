Back in late 2015. I deleted 198 chapters halfway though 2017 when the roasting got too bad. Tumblr was still hot and happening at the time and the HP fandom was bashing each other down so badly that entire blogs were created revolving around just hating certain characters (and fics by extension). Fics with character bashing in it was rather popular in those years, and it's something that I thoroughly despise. Unfortunately for me, hating the Snape/Lily pairing was also hot item, so my fic got reported to the admins over and over again. I decided to upload everything back online in march of this year after growing more of a backbone (working at a prison really helped me with that). Now I just save all the hate comments onto a doc and read them from time to time just for shits and giggles.

Still rather proud of pushing out 400k worth of chapters in the span of a year and a half though. :)
