I think the major spark was just hating Snape. I wasn't the only one who got targeted by groups of troll reviewers. As far as I'm concerned I'm just happy that Tumblr is finally started to burn down to the ground. It really had become a breedingplace of negative bullshit that tore the whole fandom apart. I still don't particularly like the fandom for this exact reason. It's like with all the lack of new HP material any source material has been depleted and analyzed to death. It's why I'm happy to see you're creating your own characters and use Durmstrang as your main base. It's new and refreshing and certainly hasn't been done before. I don't have time to read it right now as it's late at night but I will start reading it in the following week.
