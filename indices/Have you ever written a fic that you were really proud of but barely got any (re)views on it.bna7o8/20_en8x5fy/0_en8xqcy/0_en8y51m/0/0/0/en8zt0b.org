Severus Snape and the Art of War

When I started writing it I didn't expect it would turn out as large as it did. I'm still rather disappointed in the first twenty chapters or so because of that very reason, as I didn't put as much thought and effort into it as I did further into the story. Still, I'm really proud of my accomplishments regarding the story so far.
