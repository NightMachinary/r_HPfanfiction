200 chapters of my life that I will never get back +and I am so, so far from finishing it *sobs*+

I love my story a bit more with each chapter that I post, but somewhere in the back of my mind I can't help but wonder what would've happened if I had chanelled all that time and energy into something that I can actually legally publish and earn some royalties with.
