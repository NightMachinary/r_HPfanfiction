I'm in the process! It's my first attempt at writing anything. I'm not really proud of any aspect of it in particular, I'll never have the skill to convey the story how I want to. The dueling scenes are the closest I've come to satisfied with what I've written, I think.

But, I'm proud of the progress itself; the incremental improvements I believe (hope) I've made so far, as well as having written almost a hundred thousand words. I've gained considerable respect for everyone who's written a full story. This hobby takes more than it gives, at least in my case.

(If any of my ten readers see this and happen to care, know that I'm seven thousand words into the next chapter and anticipate updating soon. Sorry for the wait!)
