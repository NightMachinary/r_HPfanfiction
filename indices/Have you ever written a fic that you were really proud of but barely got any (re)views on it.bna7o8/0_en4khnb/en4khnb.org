”Tales From Durmstrang: Poisoned Bloodlines” is a standalone Potter fic I'm writing that takes a look at the Nordic Wizarding society. It gives an in -depth look at Durmstrang and shows the ways it works but most importantly the ways it doesn't. The characters are extremely flawed people and their actions rarely has a good outcome.
