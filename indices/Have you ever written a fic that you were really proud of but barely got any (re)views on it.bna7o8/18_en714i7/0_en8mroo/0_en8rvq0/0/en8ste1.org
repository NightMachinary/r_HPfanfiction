I hear ya. OCs are difficult to write and blend in. Not to mention getting readers to be interested in them as well. I think it's very courageous that you're writing about Durmstrang as so very little has been revealed about it. (Or perhaps it's easier for you since you can take it anywhere you want it to go).

From time to time I have to remind myself that the whole reason I started writing a long fic to begin with, is because I wanted to read the story that had not been written yet. Comments and praises are fun to receive but in the end I really don't want to depend on any of it.
