The reason I chose Durmstrang was so I could take the usual Potter formula in a new direction. It contains quite dark humor and I strived after making the characters so realistic as possible even if that makes them seem less heroical(or more so maybe).

Also, if you take a look at Durmstrang from how it is described in canon it makes zero sense and I wanted to use that to my advantage in the story as a way of adding more conflict and drama when characters of multiple nationalities and languages collide.
