Well, in terms of comparisons between AO3, where I've received amazing feedback even though I'm a fairly minor writer in the scheme of things, and FFN, where I'm almost a nonentity, the biggest discrepancy shows up in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10370211/1/Elegy-for-a-Goat][Elegy for a Goat]].

That's not really a surprise - it's a slash pairing on FFN, it's Aberforth/Snape, a weird rarepair, and it's a character study that stays within canon's outlines. On AO3, it made a respectable showing; on FFN, it sank like a stone.

Why do I like it? For the Aberforth voice, some of the imagery, and the complexity of the relationships - which include Albus, although he's an offstage presence. But I absolutely understand why it's not most readers' cup of fic.
