I'm super happy to see all those fics being posted and I'm slowly going to start looking through all of them. Here's my short little fic that I'm rather proud of. It's about the escape of Sirius Black as seen through the eyes of a Dementor called 'It'. First time writing from the perspective of a creature rather than a person, and I'm quite proud of it.
