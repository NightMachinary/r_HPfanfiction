I have written an one shot that is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][an interview of Harry for the occasion of Battle's 20th anniversary]], linkffn(12925628). I tried to keep it fully canon compliant, but I also see lots of freedom in developing postwar events. For example, I imagined them expanding DA into something much bigger (JKR is the initial of the interviewer, not JK Rowling):

  HJP: Another major policy or initiative is our DA Volunteer Network. It started back during that Year, when Hogwarts was under Death Eater occupation and DA members started helping each other beyond defense training. During the year after the War, Hogwarts students continued to help and support each other under Hermione, Ginny, and Luna's leadership. It was Luna who then proposed to formally create a self-help, self-support organization, and the DA Volunteer Network was born. I believe you are part of the Network too?

  JKR: Yes, and my life has improved so much more since I joined it, and I made so many new friends. The Knowledge Repository has been particularly helpful in finding all kinds of useful information and spells. And it comes so handy with the MirrorPhone. That's just an utterly brilliant idea! How did Minister Granger come up with something like that?

  HJP: Actually, the concept came from a Muggle invention called the Internet. The Muggles have millions, no, billions of computers connected together in order to share information and knowledge. They are all indexed and can be searched. Hermione had complained for a long time that Hogwarts Library missed a catalog, an index system. So during her last year at Hogwarts, she began this project with Professor Flitwick and a few other students. The idea of using advanced Protean Charm to communicate with the Repository came later. It took her several years to get it right. At first, members were writing commands on parchments, now it's all MirrorPhone. But I personally prefer parchments.
