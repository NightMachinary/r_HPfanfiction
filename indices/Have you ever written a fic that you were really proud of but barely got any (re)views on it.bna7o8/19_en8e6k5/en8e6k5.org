I was really disappointed with the reception on my last two fics. One is a multi-chapter Cursed Child fic with what I believe is an original take on the material, and the other is a one-shot about Sirius's escape from Azkaban. I thought (and still think) they were okay, but they didn't do very well and they've pretty well fallen off the radar now. It did damage my confidence and I don't write fanfiction any more (I do still write original fiction of course)
