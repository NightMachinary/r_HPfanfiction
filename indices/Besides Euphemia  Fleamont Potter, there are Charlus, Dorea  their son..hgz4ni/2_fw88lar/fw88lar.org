I started writing an Dimension travel Harry fic sometime ago (Never published it, Lol). In which, Dorea and Charlus went into hiding, as Blacks and another dark family to whom Dorea was promised were against it. They were killed later along with their son.

And Harry travels to that dimension during marauders time and takes the identity of their son. So, no need to change his last name.

I only wrote around 4-5 chapters and lost interest. Will finish it someday.
