I think it is gradual: books are the primary canon; films, mostly made and prepared before the craziness obviously overcame whatever remainders of the common sense JKR had, are the secondary one and are applied unless they conflict the first one, and then the rest I take with the gradually diminishing seriousness (the Cursed Child is completely bottom of the barrel). But yes, I pick some things, which are nice even from Pottermore and her Twitter (no, not THAT!).

There are even pieces of films which are better than in films: I am sorry for example that [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucS3xMZcrHQ][this scene]] was not in the books like this. However, talking about the cursed Cursed Child, even there are some good bits: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/f67nlv/exploding_snap_from_the_cursed_child/]]
