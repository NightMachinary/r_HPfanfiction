What happened was that in 2006 Rowling drew up a portion of the Black family tree for a charity auction and among the many names on it was a Dorea Black born in 1920 who had married a Charlus Potter and the tree said that they had one son together. The tree also gave Dorea's year of death as 1977. So fans assumed that they must be Harry's grandparents and it became a popular choice in fanfics. In 2015 did Rowling publish a piece on Pottermore about the Potters that named Fleamont and Euphmeia as the grandparents and that had no mention of Charlus or Dorea. And that leaves us with the mess we are in today.
