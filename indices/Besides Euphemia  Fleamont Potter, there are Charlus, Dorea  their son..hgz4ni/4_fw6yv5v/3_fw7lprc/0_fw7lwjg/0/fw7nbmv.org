Given that the tapestry was released and sold before Deathly Hallows was written and doesn't contradict any writing within the books, I'd say the canon status is fairly firm. You might not like it and it's your choice to ignore it, but I think the OP's idea about wanting a canon-compliant (from his point of view) fic about Charlus and Dorea Potter is pretty clear.
