I am writing one where Harry dies in the last battle and is reborn in the past(his previous incarnation in this version) as Charlus and Dorea`s son, Harry Charlus Potter(who had been stillborn in the former timeline) and cousin to James(Fleamont is the older brother). Due to this, he has closer relations with the Blacks, who treat him as a close cousin.
