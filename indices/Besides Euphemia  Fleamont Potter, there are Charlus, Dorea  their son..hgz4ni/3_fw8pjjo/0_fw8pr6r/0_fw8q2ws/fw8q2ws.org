Not yet, probably going to publish the first three chapters in July, just finishing the outlines, but most of the beginning is already planned out, it's just some days I will read it, find something wrong and edit a lot of stuff that requires rewrites to keep consistency, and then re-read to see if I didn't miss anything.
