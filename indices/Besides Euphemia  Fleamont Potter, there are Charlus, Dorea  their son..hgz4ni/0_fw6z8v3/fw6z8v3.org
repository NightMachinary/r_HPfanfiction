I don't recall reading any fic that had Euphemia & Fleamont as Harry's grandparents AND using Charlus, Dorea & their son in the story in any significant way e.g., more than a simple mention in passing.

Until JKR came out at a later date and told folks that Fleamont & Euphemia were James' parents most fanfic authors used Charlus & Dorea as his parents. In fact many fanfic writers today still seem to prefer Charlus & Dorea as Harry's grandparents. I've read & saved ~2000 fics. Out of those only 22 use Fleamont and Euphemia as Harry's Grandparents (there are several I'm not counting where the author mentione Fleamont and Euphemia only to say he is not using them in favor of Charlus and Dorea).

There are 312 fics that use Charlus and Dorea as Harry's grandparents. One fic has Charlus as a brother to Fleamont, and one has him as a first cousin. But both fics only have a simple mention in passing.

I would be interested to see if anyone has come across a fic that uses both Fleamont and Euphemia as well as Charlus and Dorea in full scenes.
