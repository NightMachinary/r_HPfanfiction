*The Power of Love* and its sequel *Heart and Soul*, linkffn(11761312;11251745) are pretty good, if you don't mind its feminist tone and fem slash fics.

I like *Returning to the Start*, linkffn(10687059), a lot. How this Hermione handled a very damaged, time-traveling Harry is very well done.

*Ruthless*, linkffn(10493620), is bloody good, if you don't mind M/F/M pairings. This story is not long, but extremely well written.

*Broken Chains*, linkffn(7718942), is lunar Harmony. I like this fic a lot, and especially enjoy its sex and violence scenes.

*The Sea King*, linkffn(7502511), is a cute Harmony one-shot.

*Notebooks and Letters*, linkffn(3867175), is mostly canon rehash, but things became different towards the end. There is one scene in which Hermione killed a bunch of Death Eaters while naked.
