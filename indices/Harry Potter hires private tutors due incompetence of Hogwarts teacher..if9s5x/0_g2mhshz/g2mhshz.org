linkffn(Man of Iron, Child Of Magic) should have what you need. It's an Avengers crossover in which Stark adopts Harry after the aliens invade (the HP universe is shifted so this is the end of Harry's second year). Stark has just organised the tutors in the latest chapter, and is trying to generally make Harry's life suck less. Updates often.
