best recommendation from me would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11577249/1/Magic-of-the-Force][magic of the force]] they integrate magic and the force very well along with recognizing they are different, which some star wars fics dont do.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9215532/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Shell-of-the-God-King][shell of the god-king]] was fun and different. rather than harry going somewhere the god-king illyria comes to england, using luna's body

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][browncoat, green eyes]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For][i still haven't found what im looking for]] may not fit your balanced approach but are good enough i wanted to recommend them anyway.

lastly i would look at some of the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Avengers-Crossovers/224/9786/?&srt=4&r=10][hp/avengers crossovers]] many of them are very good. i would recommend just going through the list and reading any that strike your fancy for now.
