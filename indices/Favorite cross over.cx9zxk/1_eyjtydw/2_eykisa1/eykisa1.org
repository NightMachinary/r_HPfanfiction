Headcanon: HP zombies aren't the slow flesh bags from the Walking Dead. HP zombies are more intelligent than inferi, faster, stronger and just as resistant to most spells. The reason why inferi are preferred is that the zombification victim has to be alive during the creation process, while inferi can be made much easier by collecting dead bodies after battle.
