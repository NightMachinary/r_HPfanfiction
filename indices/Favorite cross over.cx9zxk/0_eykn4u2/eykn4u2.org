Absolute favorite is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4183715/1/Awaken-Sleeper][Awaken Sleeper]] By Water Mage. It's a HP/Dresden Files crossover where Potter's the son of two low level practitioners (iirc) who was in a come for several years and dreamt the events of the HP books. It fairly accurately captures Butcher's style, but with Potter as the main character instead of Dresden.

Next favorite is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283/1/The-Black-Prince][The Black Prince]] by Cxjenious. HP/ASOIAF, where Harry is born as Harry Baratheon, second son of Robert Baratheon (Stag) and Cersei (Lion). Unfortunately very abandoned, as the summary says, but the premise was the very best way to get HP into Westeros that I've seen.

Last is a real guilty pleasure of mine in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8750155/1/The-Girl-who-Imprinted][The Girl who Imprinted]] by CCRevival. When I read the twilight series a decade ago, the Leah Clearwater was easily my favorite character. Twilight Fanfiction in general is fucking breathtaking in how bad most of it is, and this isn't exactly great either, but it's basically the only Leah fic above 50k words that doesn't read like a middle school girl wrote it.
