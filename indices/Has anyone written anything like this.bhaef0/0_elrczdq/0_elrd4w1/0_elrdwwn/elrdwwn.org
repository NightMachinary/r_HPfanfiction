The closest I've seen to something like this is linkffn(Elsewhere but Not Elsewhen), where canon Harry is sent into another dimension where his parents are alive and already have two siblings, but:

- There's no BWL/GWL. Well, there sort of is, but the world-wide celebrity isn't there.
- There's already a Harry Potter in that dimension
- It doesn't really go anywhere plot-wise, it's mainly just a feel-good fic
- It's abandoned.

I'm really hoping someone else comes up with an actual plot-driven version of this.
