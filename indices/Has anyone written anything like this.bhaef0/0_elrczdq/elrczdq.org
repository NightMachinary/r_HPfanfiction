This is a really great premise. Canon Harry dies for real at the end of DH, finds himself reborn into the Potter family, still alive, with a sibling (ideally put him into the body at age 10 or 11, so that you don't have to go through the whole "hur dur, how do I baby" shtick that so many reincarnation fics do). It seems like a perfect reward, right? He gets to live the life he should have, because he sacrificed himself, and he's not so old that it'd be weird to start over again.

But then the whole "your brother/sister is the BWL/GWL" thing gets dropped on him and he has to decide how to handle it. Does he interfere, since he knows how things will go (or thinks so)? Does he just try and live a normal life, since he knows he (in his timeline) managed without a sibling? Does he decide he needs to handle everything except the sacrifice? Does he try and avoid the sacrifice all together? Lots of different ways you could take the premise.
