A but late but:

check for spelling mistakes, *angrly * Lotter * grumled

The sentences feel kind of short and abrupt, so try and expand on your ideas. yknow, show don't tell.

/She glared with such venom the girl convulsed/

maybe you mean that she shrunk backwards or something? convulsed means that she threw a fit, like is squirming around on the floor

Other than that, the story is pretty good and is really interesting. great job!
