In my opinion, it probably works with the person's innate awareness of their age. So, say, if you had a character who for some reason got adopted by people who did not know their age and thought the kid a year older than in reality, and if the kid did not know either and thus got raised in belief that he or she really is older, it would result in them being able to cross the line (Dumbledore's one, with 17 as the cut-off age) at 16 because they'd have the unbreakable belief, that innate awareness, that “yeah, they're really 17” even if it happened to not be true.
