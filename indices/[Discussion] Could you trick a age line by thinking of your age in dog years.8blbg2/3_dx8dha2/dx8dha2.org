I mean, it probably just depends overall, but it doesn't make much sense to me that such a spell would be so easily tricked unless it were designed and cast by a complete amateur.

If that's not the case, maybe you could make the argument that it'd work if they were /currently/ a dog. Or /maybe/ an untransformed animagus, or a werewolf. But that feels a bit of a stretch.
