One possibility is that - given that it's referred to as though everyone knows what an Age Line is - it's actually pretty simple magic and not that hard to circumvent, since it's childproofing magic, used to keep children from getting into the biscuit tin or drowning in the garden pond, and as such is simple enough for frazzled parents/nannies to set and maintain. So it probably has all kinds of weaknesses that don't matter because the worst it has to deal with is the circumvention efforts of 10-year-olds. It's less effective, but still useable, to keep 14-year-olds away from the drinks cabinet.

Dumbledore, who doesn't have children of his own, thinks it's adequate security, and that the kids who are smart enough to bypass it are smart enough not to enter.
