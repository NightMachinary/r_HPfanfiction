I challenge all your assumptions: that the Age line could be set to any age, that it uses the person's mind to detect it or that it can be tricked at all.

I'd say the age line used by Dumbledore was easy enough to set, since it depended on the person being an adult (17 or older). Basically, it's just a Trace detector.

That said, I would think that spells in general use star positions to determine date and time, since they can't be 'forged'. Detecting when a person was born might be the trickiest part.
