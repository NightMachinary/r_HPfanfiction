Hah, I would totally read a marauder era oneshot with Sirius trying to trick the age line into thinking he's old enough by crossing it in dog form. I bet hilarity would ensue. The name that comes out of the goblet is... PADFOOT! Sirius gets chosen but the caveat is that he has to compete in dog form to keep his secret and abide by the "rules" of the goblet. All of Hogwarts (save 3 giggling in a corner) are left wondering why the Hogwarts champion is a giant black dog.
