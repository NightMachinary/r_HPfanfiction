The large, black dog trotted into the arena, a stick clutched in its mouth.

"Awwww," cooed Lily, up in the stands. "He wants to play fetch with the dragon-"

A bright fuschia spell flew from the wand, striking the Dragon in the eye. It reared back, and roared, but the only sound that came out was that of a sheep.

'/Baaaaaaaaaa?/'

The dog barked and shot another spell into the beast's open mouth. It began coughing violently, spewing massive slugs all over the arena.

The dog quickly ran into the nest and conjured rope, which it tied around the golden egg. It grabbed the other end of the rope and dragged it out of the increasingly slug-infested arena.

Lily blinked. "Oh. That works too."

*===[YULE BALL]===*

James stared disbelievingly at the shaggy black dog in the tuxedo. "Padfoot, tell me you didn't?"

The dog nodded. James glanced at the girl in question, then looked back.

"And... she said /yes/?"

The dog barked smugly.

"/Damn/, that girl has got to be /kinky/."

James could tell that Sirius would /never/ shut up about the time he bagged a Veela in his dog form.

*===[SECOND TASK]===*

Lily was wondering why James, Remus, and Peter broke into hysterics when they saw her banner. It said '/Go Padfoot/', there was nothing comical about supporting her school champion, was there?

When the horn blared, the dog swallowed a mass of rubbery plant matter, before turning into some sort of dog-dolphin hybrid. It gave a chattering sort of bark before diving into the lake.

"Well," said Potter after about 15 minutes. "This is boring."

"Oh, dear Merlin," muttered Lily. Alice looked at her questioningly.

"Potter is bored."

Alice paled dramatically. "Merlin save us-"

She was interruped by the roar of a... motorcycle? A horse-sized, black shape soared from the water, and began to /fly/ back to the platform. The... /Padfoot/ was /Driving it?/.

The motorcycle skidded to a stop on the platform, and the dog leapt off. It began barking furiously at the judges table.

"Now, now, Padfoot," said Headmaster Dumbledore. "It was spelled to resist the water. It'll be fine."

*===[THIRD TASK]===*

It was interesting, mused Lily, how one could easily tell what path their Champion was taking through the maze. This was not due to some sort of foresight on the parts of the Tournament Officials, but because there was a clear path of oddly colored flames and conjured birds impaled on the hedges.

There was a distant screech, and a bright pink Acromantula soared in a perfect arc over the maze.

James put another tick mark on the massive blackboard he'd brought out.

"Hold on, James," said Remus. "Did you put that one under '/Color Changing/' or '/Banishing Charm/'?"

James cursed. "I knew we should have figured out how to make a 45-way Venn Diagram!"

The distinctive roar of a Sphinx echoed across the maze. "BEGONE, YOU PERVERTED DOG!"

There was the sound of glass breaking, then silence.

James scrawled a note in a corner of the board. "Bonus points for creative application of the Defenestration Curse."
