But since Harry is not an actual actor with any practice whatsoever, believes heavily in improvisation (with reason, no directors has appeared to berate him for not following the script) and is just plainly terrible at memorizing his lines (frequently misremembering bits of dialogue, stealing other characters' lines and even using lines that are for scenes much further in the script with knowledge he should /not/ have) plus he deciding to go totally spoiled diva-queen actor on the order (treating Snape like his personal slave for one) the entire experience becomes so stressful and hellish for the manipulators that they just throw their hands skyward and give up on all their plans.
