I just finished reading two really good post battle fics, and was thinking about posting a thread like this, so thanks!

The two fics are connected and are Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione respectively.

linkffn(9787334) *Faintest, Slimmest, Wildest, Chance* is about Harry and Ginny starting up their relationship again in the midst of the Weasleys grieving for Fred and the beginning of the Death Eater trials.

linkffn(11807757) *In Love and War* is about Hermione and Ron going to Australia to bring back her parents, and has Percy's POV of the Weasleys in their grief and him dealing with how much he screwed up in the war.

linkao3(15687453) *Proof* is unrelated to the previous two, and it's about Harry recovering from the battle and having to deal with politics when he just wants to bake a loaf of bread.

Edit- Forgot one!

linkffn(9840649) *In the Year of Weasley Scarves* is about Molly's grief after the Battle and how Fleur helps.
