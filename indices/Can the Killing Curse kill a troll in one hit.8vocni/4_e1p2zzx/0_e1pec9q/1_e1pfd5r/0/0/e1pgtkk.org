Tough to say- it's a question of magical power and intent to destroy. Plus, /some/ magical creatures like Lethifolds and Dementors are already all but confirmed to be immune to the Killing Curse, surely, so perhaps more "ethereal" dangerous creatures are immune, while "physical" creatures like giants, trolls, spiders, etc aren't. But canon regarding nundus seems questionable.
