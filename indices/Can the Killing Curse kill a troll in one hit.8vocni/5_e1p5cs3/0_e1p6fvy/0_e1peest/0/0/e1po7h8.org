Well, okay I was as assuming from OP's wording to "throw something big enough in the way" they meant creating something big with magic. Somewhat unlikely the average wizard is going to be carrying around a ten foot thick shield of lead or something. :) At the very least anything you could reasonably put in the way in time is going to blow up in front of you. Also, being unblockable doesn't mean it flies down a path forever!
