Anyone can make mistakes. Nobody's perfect and all that. Plenty of people are one way in one regard and another way in some other situation. A lot of times people who've been viewed as strong and honest pillars of the community will be revealed to have done terrible things behind closed doors.

I'm like you though - the fic has to make it work. A good fic can massage a clunky trope into something good too. :)
