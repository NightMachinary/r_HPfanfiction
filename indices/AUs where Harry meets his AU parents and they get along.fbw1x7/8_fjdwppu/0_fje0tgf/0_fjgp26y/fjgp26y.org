I agree with that, it's just that in many fics the trope is thrown in to almost be edgy or with bashing of all sorts of people.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, for example, made a good case for Harry actually being poor at parenting. The play and the fanfic version, anyway. The script is <i>interesting</i>.
