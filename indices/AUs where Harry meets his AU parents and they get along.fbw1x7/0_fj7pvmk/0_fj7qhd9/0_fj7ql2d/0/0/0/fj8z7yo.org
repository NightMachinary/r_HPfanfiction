This is what I can remember.

Harry wakes up in a graveyard, he had full post hogwarts auror gear on with his money from the bank. I know his family kinda hates harry because the harry from the AU world was a dick and killed himself.

-Harry has 2 sisters, one young one who likes him and another older one who doesn't trust him

-Sirius is married and has a girl thats younger than harry and she crushes on him hard. The parents inc. remus spend time trying to get them to hook up or kiss or whatever idk.

-I know harry tells his mother that he is not HER harry at some point and shes basically ok with it.

-A bit part of the book beginning is just harry before the summer acting different and his family trying to figure out who he is. I know he tries to impress them by cooking for them. I think he ends up spending a lot of time with his mother and im not sure james really likes him. This MAY or MAY NOT be the time travel story where eventuly near the end when voldermort comes back james sides with him at some ministry ball and harry protects the family against them all and harry gets it with his mother. I don't know so many stories run through my head at once hard to keep track.
