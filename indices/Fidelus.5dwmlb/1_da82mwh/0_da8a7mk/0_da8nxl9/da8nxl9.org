I do not think the idea you posted is a good one to post as a reply to what I wrote, to be honest. There is this part of my comment:

#+begin_quote
  Likewise, if you put everyone under the Fidelius charm in a chain, could that possibly make the thing stop working due to it being an attempt at escaping the loophole required for the charm to work?
#+end_quote

With that, your idea feels like just random rambling of someone who did not read what they are replying to.
