Maybe they could have bought 2 houses side by side, had siruis act as the secret keeper for house 1 where the potters lived and James act as the secret keeper for house 2 where Sirius lived. That way, as long as both families are in their own houses, Voldemort can't get at either of them. And James trusted Sirius not to tell, so this would only serve to protect Sirius from voldemort.
