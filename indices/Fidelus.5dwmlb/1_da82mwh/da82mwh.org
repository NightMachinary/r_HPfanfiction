To be honest, it is unknown what the exact mechanics of the Fidelius charm are, so we can but guess. On one hand, there is nothing that would negate this possibility that we know of in canon; but on the other hand it is possible that, due to the charm being a “loyalty” charm (as bizarre as that may sound for some), certain actions might negate the protections it provides.

Because thinking about it, the charm the charm works by entrusting the secret giver's secret to the secret keeper, and it ensures that the secret cannot be forced out of the secret keeper for as long as the secret keeper remains loyal (which is why torture and such do not work). Does that mean that the charm would not work properly if they chose to stash Peter away, possibly telling magic that they do not actually /trust/ him? We do not know, it is an area purely for speculation, but I would not be quick to discard that possibility. Likewise, if you put /everyone/ under the Fidelius charm in a chain, could that possibly make the thing stop working due to it being an attempt at escaping the loophole required for the charm to work? There is nothing that says it has to happen, but again there is nothing that says it could not happen, so we can but guess.
