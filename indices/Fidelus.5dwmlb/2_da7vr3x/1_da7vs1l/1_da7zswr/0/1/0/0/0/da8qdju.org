Actually, he could get “anything”. By the time of the seventh book, we know they just moved there and they might very well have only thought it temporary until they can get their own place (remember, magic cares about the intent). Then the actual war took place and at the end of it all, after the battle of Hogwarts, they'd decided that they do not want to move if they can help it because they'd gotten used to the place or something. That might have broken the Fidelius after the war, but we never see it so if that happened we would not know about it.
