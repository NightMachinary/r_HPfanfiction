Or, more simply, the Potters could be their own Secret Keepers.

If I wanted to keep this charm as in canon and close the loophole, I'd say that the charm is weakened when the Secret Keeper stays in an area protected by any Fidelius Charm, and it's broken entirely after some amount of time. Several hours of meetings is just fine; living there for days on end breaks it.

For a mystical approach, I'd say the charm requires an element of vulnerability. For a technical approach, well, I'm not sure how I could justify the charm in the first place.
