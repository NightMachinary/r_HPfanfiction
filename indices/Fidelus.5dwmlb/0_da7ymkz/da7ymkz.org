That wouldn't have helped, because that Fidelius wasn't hiding the fact of the existence of the house in Godric's Hollow, it was hiding the fact that /the Potters lived there/. I think Flitwick says in PoA something like "You-Know-Who could have pressed his nose to the window of their living room and not know they were there". Goes to show how clever HP magic can be.
