Have you read linkffn(Grow Young With Me)? I recommend ignoring the summary, which doesn't give an accurate impression of the fic, and just trying out chapter 1 to see whether you like Abby.

The overview I gave someone recently was:

Harry is widowed and raising his three children alone, devoted to them but really hurting. A quirky waitress (with her own issues under the surface) takes on the self-assigned job of drawing him out of his funk, and they slowly fall for each other. But even if she can win over his children, even if he can let himself love again after losing Ginny, there's still a side of his life that she's not supposed to know about. And the more she sees his home and his in-laws, the harder it is to keep a lid on exactly what he does for a living, how he can regularly drop his children off with their grandparents on the other side of the country, and why he has genuine /cauldrons/ in his cupboards...
