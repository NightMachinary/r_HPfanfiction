I think AntaresTheEighthPleiade did a series (left unfinished halfway through book 5) featuring Dumbledore as an extremely powerful main antagonist. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142024/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sorting-Hat-s-Gift]] is the first one in the series, though I haven't read it for a long, long time.
