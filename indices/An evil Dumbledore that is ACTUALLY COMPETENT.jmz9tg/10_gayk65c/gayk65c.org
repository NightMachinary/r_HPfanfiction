I will always always always recommend linkao3(24288577). Dumbledore doesn't appear, but it's about Harry struggling to come to terms with the absolute fuckery going on in canon. Canon Dumbledore raised a child soldier to be so obedient he would kill himself without a second thought. Regardless of how utilitarian his argument, that is evil.
