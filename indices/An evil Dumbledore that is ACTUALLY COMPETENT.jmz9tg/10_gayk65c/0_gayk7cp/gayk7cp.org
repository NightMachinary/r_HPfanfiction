  What better for Dumbledore than a child with no sense of self-worth?What better than a child willing to throw his life away for any to show him kindness?What better for Dumbledore than a child who knew no love, burdened with a world of lives he'd value above his own?What better for Dumbledore than a child who lived only to die?After all, the only difference between a victim and a martyr was how far they were willing to go, and by the time Harry had walked to his death for the final time, he'd had nothing.
