  “Blood of the friend, forcibly taken, you will resurrect your ally.”\\
  Voldemort is resurrected. It doesn't go exactly like in the books. This is what happens when I read a bunch of 'good Voldemort, evil Dumbledore' stories, and then try to imagine what it would actually be like for Severus Snape in such a universe during the thirteen years spent alone at Dumbledore's side. Here's a hint: Voldemort is not easily getting his spy out of Dumbledore's clutches. And saving Harry Potter may be a bit of a trial as well.
