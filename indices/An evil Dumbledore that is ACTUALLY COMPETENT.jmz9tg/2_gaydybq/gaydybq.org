Nightmares of Futures Past depicts him as fairly competent and not evil, but inclined to think that he knows best without reference to other people's opinions, which naturally puts him in conflict with a Harry who has future knowledge and is therefore walking his own path. Incomplete, updating about once every three years. FFN deleted it for bogus reasons, but you can get a PDF or eBook from [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1]]

For a somewhat more evil Dumbledore, there's the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303265/1/Wait-What][first chapter]] of "Wait, What?", which is basically a collection of one-shots.
