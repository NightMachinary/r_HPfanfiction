"So, what do you guys think about fanon Draco and how do you guys think he should be portrayed?" In whatever way the author chooses to portray him seeing as if you wanted to read canon malfoy then pick up the damn books read them again otherwise accept fanfiction stories are not beholden to canon nor is there any way in which characters ought to behave just what the author of the story wants to write.
