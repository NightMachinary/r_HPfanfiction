I think the author of the Seventh Horcrux said it best:

#+begin_quote
  There's this really cool OC that pops up in a lot of HP fics. He's suave, snarky, handsome, a bit of a git, but super good-looking. For some reason, people keep calling him Draco Malfoy.

  In canon, Draco is none of those things. He's whiny, spoiled, lacks willpower, rushes into dumb plans with a brashness that completely defies Slytherin claims of cunning, and fails at literally everything he tries. Sure, there's some hints of an angsty redemption arc, but he never does all that much. At the end, we get a vague impression that he's okay now for an ill-defined reason...a lot like Snape, actually.

  The way I see it, there are three ways to deal with Draco in fanfics:

  1) Just swap him out for cool-guy OC up there.

  2) Make him a total git. This is probably closer to canon than the previous option, but it strays into bashing way too easily.

  3) My preferred method: Try to keep Draco as close to canon as possible, then give him some vague redemption primarily in the background. Do not take this redemption, or Draco in general, seriously.

Personally, I prefer either 1 or 3. Either make him someone worth reading about, accusations of OOC aside (or better yet, give a compelling reason why would canon!Draco change his ways and become more sympathetic), or just mostly ignore him.
