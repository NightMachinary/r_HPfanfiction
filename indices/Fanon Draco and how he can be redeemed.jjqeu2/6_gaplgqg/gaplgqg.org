Oddly, I think the most accurate fanon depictions are often found in Drarry slash, since it uses their strong chemistry. They were weirdly obsessed with each other in canon, and it's only a small shift to make them gay.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13452914/1/Loose-Cannon][Loose Cannon]] (my fic, postwar, not slash) has a Draco redemption arc, but it takes a LONG time, and Draco doesn't even appear in the story until chapter 71. But he definitely resembles canon Draco at the start: spoilt, envious of Harry, and bad-tempered.

Both characters are straight in my fic, but they still have very strong chemistry, albeit non-romantic. It's often antagonistic, particularly from Draco's side, but it's a good outlet for both of them, since they were both traumatized by the war. And the story is largely a comedy, so it's fun having them snipe at each other.
