Now that would've been an Epilogue. Just a full blown 'after the war' montage of Draco learning not to be a wanker, Harry getting up in his career, all the couples hitting milestones, Dennis taking pictures with Colin's camera, Luna dancing about in a field with thestrals and Crumple-Horned Snorkacks like she's the Pyro from Team Fortress, etc.

You know, all that good stuff we really wanted to see. :)
