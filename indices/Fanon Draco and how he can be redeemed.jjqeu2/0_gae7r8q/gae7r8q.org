I agree that fanon Draco is a shell of his canon self, but I think this analysis here is a little too on the sympathetic side.

  He knew that what he was doing was wrong and was killing someone

I don't think this is wholly accurate. Or maybe it's the implication that Draco cared that what he was doing was wrong that bothers me.

It's probably the latter.

Draco's issue wasn't the wrongness of his actions it was that he was failing.

But the big word missing here is coward. The only time I saw him not giving Harry up at Malfoy Manor as a positive was the 1st time I read it. He didn't do it because it right. He did it because he was scared (to pick a side), which is emphasized by his behavior with the Death Eater before Ron punches him in the face.

And that's why my biggest issue, outside of Potter kids' names, is the respectful head nod between Harry and Draco.

I like a redeemed Draco, but I've never seen one where he had to work for it. I also don't like a Draco who is magically stupid/incapable.
