There's more than a couple dozen 'TED Talks' type things out there about Neo-Nazis and KKK members and Cultists and such getting out of their various hate-organisations and lifestyles.

It's not unheard of for someone of a Draco-ish level of initiation into hate groups to come back from that, though the methods vary strongly. I'd say just do your research into that, then pick what best balances a fit for your story and Draco's character.
