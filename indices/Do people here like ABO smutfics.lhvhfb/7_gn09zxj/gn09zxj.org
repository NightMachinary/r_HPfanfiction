I think I have to work on my tags and summary more to make sure people KNOW more of what they're getting. I also started my fic out with the whole submissive omega concept- which some people don't like on principle- but I indicated I'd change that sub dynamic later on in the story. For some people the shift from submissive omega won't happen fast enough despite me asking for patience in my author's notes. So let's hope my tags/summary will help reduce any future confusion. I can address it again in the notes in my next chapter, but I don't want to give up many future plot elements. I'll have to find a way to say it nicely too...
