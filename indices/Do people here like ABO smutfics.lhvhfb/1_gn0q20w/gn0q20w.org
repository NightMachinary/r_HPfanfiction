Honestly, a lot of fics under ABO give off misogynistic vibes. They tend call them the ‘genders' so it's not even subtle, and the alphas all have traditionally masculine traits and the omegas all have traditionally feminine traits, except it's iN tHeIr biOloGy so they must /want/ to stay at home barefoot and pregnant and be submissive all the time. And instead of periods they have a week long ‘heat' (where sexual consent is very dodgy in these fics). Omegas are literally exactly how men want women to be.
