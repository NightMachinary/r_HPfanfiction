I've written a few myself, some longer and more plot based, others shorter and more smut focused, and I haven't gotten any complaints about either.

It may just be that those people were expecting something different and were disappointed.

I used to hate abo fics myself though. I still don't like the ones where the omega loses their sense of self when they're claimed. So I don't write those and that may be why I haven't gotten complaints. Still a lot of people like those and you can't please everyone. I wouldn't worry about it.
