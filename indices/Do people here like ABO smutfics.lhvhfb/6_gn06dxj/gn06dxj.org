Quite frankly I hate everything about them. From their predictable plot points to the dumbness or their very essence, a/b/o fics are, in my eyes, some of the worst AUs one could possibly make.

My hatred over those has worsened with time, because at first it was just alphas and betas; dumb, but I could see and understand a bit how things would work (I've seens many stories where the weak, genetically inferior character shows to be better than most of the "naturally better" characters). I didn't like it, but I could see the appeal.

And suddenly it shifted and people created the omegas, who are even weaker than betas, are described as ugly, less intelligent... all in all, cannon fodder, trash, human wastes. But somehow you want to convince me that the peak of humanity, those fabled alphas, can be bothered to deal with such clearly inferior beings in a way that's remotely sympathetic?

And yeah, middle age bullshit some nobles ran off with farmers, or things, but farmers/nobles dynamic is far from alpha/omega dynamic. They're more like, well, the original stories between alphas and betas. You know, back when this AU wasn't absolute dogshit and had a tinsy tiny bit of substance.
