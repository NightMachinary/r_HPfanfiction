If they are long enough (like at least 5000 words) and well narrated I'll read it. By "not too rushed" I meant that George is going through something that requires a lot of time to heal, so the story needs to be spread over a long period of time to feel realistic. That doesn't mean that it has to be long or very detailed, but we need to feel that he is going through a process I guess? (Sorry for bad English and explanation ahaha)
