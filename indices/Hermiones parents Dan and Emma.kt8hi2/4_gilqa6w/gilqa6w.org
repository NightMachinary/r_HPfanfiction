I'm low key fond of Dan and Emma, particularly when I delve back into FanFiction after long periods of abstaining, it's an immediate ‚Äúah, yes, I'm back.‚Äù It does quite quickly get me rolling my eyes, but in an amused kind of way. I'm one of those people who love fanon, though; I almost wrote my undergrad thesis on fanfiction/fanon and how communities can continue developing static creative works, evolving new terminology and motifs. In many ways fanfiction is the most (if not only) democratic art form, and damn I fucking love all it's weird little signifiers like Dan and Emma.
