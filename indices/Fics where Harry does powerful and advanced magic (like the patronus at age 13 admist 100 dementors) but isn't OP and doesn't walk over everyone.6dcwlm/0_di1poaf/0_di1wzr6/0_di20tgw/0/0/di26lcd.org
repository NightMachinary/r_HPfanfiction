I think you are over simplifying the Unforgivables. The whole point to them is that you have to want the effects, and believe them. Imperio requires the caster to want to enslave, dominate and control the mind of the victim. The Cruciatus requires you to want to hurt someone, and enjoy their pain and suffering, so much so that you would do it even without the efficiency of the magic. The Avada Kedavra requires you to want to kill someone, that you truely believe that someone deserves to die, and that you are going to kill them. It can't be out of self-defense, or righteous anger, because those are not the right mindsets. You have to understand that you are permanently depriving someone of their life. I would honestly expect only morally bankrupt people, or psychopaths to be capable of the curse.

I honestly think you are falling into the same trap as Harry at the end of the fifth book, assuming that all that is required is that you want it, when in reality, it requires that you actually be willing to do it in cold blood.
