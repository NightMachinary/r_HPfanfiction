I really don't believe Harry "mastered" the summoning charm. He spent a few weeks working on it, if even that. To say he mastered it is kinda silly. And I wouldn't call the summoning charm an advanced and powerful magic.

Neither are the unforgivables. Harry uses /Imperio/ right the first time, I think it's safe to say it's not a hard spell to get right. /Crucio/ just requires you to really mean to cause pain. /Avada Kedavra/ requires you to really want that person's death. I wouldn't call any of them advanced by any means.
