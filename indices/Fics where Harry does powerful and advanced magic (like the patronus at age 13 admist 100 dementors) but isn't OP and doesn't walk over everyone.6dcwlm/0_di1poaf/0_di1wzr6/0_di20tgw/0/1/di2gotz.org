Hell, even if he did, then he "mastered" what? The Patronus, the disarming charm, the summoning spell and that's it? Even if doing so took him months, what did he do otherwise, you can only play wizards chess with Ron so often :( especially if you are always losing (mastering so few spells implies a low tolerance for frustration, so Harry wouldn't play Ron that often!)

Hell, Bart Simpson is a fucking overachiever compared to Harry (and it's not like Voldemort was after him every hour of every day for years...hell, especially if he had been, then he should have tried to prepare more for an encounter (the Patronus doesn't work on Dark Lords, neither does a disarmer (Priori Incantatem is a damned cop-out IMHO!) or a summoner, so in essence Harry is defensless without plot-armor (Priori Incantatem effect)...nice going, Potter! See you in the next life! Hey, maybe you can challeng Voldemort to Wizards Chess? :( )

ps: I like neither Snape nor Draco Malfoy, but they sometimes are (sadly!) right about Harry, he often rests on his laurels (Snape!) and if the universe were fair (and he didn't have plot-armor!) then the Dark Lord would end him easily and be done with it (Draco)

I really prefer a normal hero's journey over success through being a meek underachiever who won't even stand up for himself in most cases (I'd have complained to McGonagall/Dumbledore and even the Board of Gouvernors about Snape, because what that guy does is NOT teaching!)
