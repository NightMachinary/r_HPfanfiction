Yeah, it's something that always bothered me. Supposedly, not many adults can even cast a patronus and Harry chases away 100 dementors at the age of 13. But then it seems like Rowling decided to make Harry be incredibly average. I mean, if I was him, if I spend a god damn decade in a cupboard, I'd be ecstatic over magic. I'd be learning anything I could. And don't even get me started on Voldemorts return. You'd think he'd try a bit harder in 5th year. ESPECIALLY in 6th year. Albus tells Harry that he needs to be the one to kill Voldemort and Harry doesn't give a fuck.
