I totally agree - I mean I could understand it if Harry is weak at say Transfiguration (because he doesn't really care for the subject - at least until he learns about animagi and that his father was an animagus, IMHO Harry should have gone at it with a vengeance to learn enough to be able to become an animagus (as a link to his father and later on: Sirius and Remus!)), but Harry is also not all that great at charms and saying that he's better in defense than his year mates is saying NOTHING (especially when his most used spell in book seven is still a fucking disarming charm, how he ever thought he could fight Voldemort with THAT (!) is beyond me! Even if he might manage to disarm the Dark Lord, then Voldemort would either use wandless magic (which is part of canon if I remember correctly - there's even cultures that still teach that to kids, which is IMHO great...over-reliance on wands is kind of stupid!) or sick his DEs on Harry (so in the end Harry would be just as dead!))

Harry is IMHO almost completely lacking any sense of wounder (which should make people work hard to be able to do it themselves one day, I mean plenty of students in RL these days are fascinated by physics, maths etc. and study hard to go into those fields and magic IMHO would have much more of a draw, because in the very first fucking charms lesson you learn to freaking tell gravity to fuck off!), kind of makes me sad for him!
