Not really, I asked this a while ago. JKR alludes to nonverbal spells, animagus, super pranking, secret passage ways, awesome transfiguration, original spell creation, discoveries of shortcuts (hbp) in potions etc. and yet Harry is like...meh I don't really care to overachieve.

I've wanted to write a fic where he and Neville get sorted into hufflepuff and become determined to work hard.

I think the general consensus is they are literally seventeen when they are done, who is fully developed at 17? But my argument is why would JKR allude to all these awesome things and then have Harry explore NONE of it. /rant
