That would be great, I'd read it - especially since a Slytherin Harry would not totally agree with Dumbledore all the time (IMHO a mentor/student relationship is greater if mentor and student aren't on the same page all the time!) because his very house would expose him to different ideas and ideals than what Dumbledore believes in!

Sadly most Slytherin Harry fanfictions have Dumbledore either forsake Harry (as in ignoring him like in book 5, at least until he does something like save the stone in year 1) or try to control him (which Harry of course fights!)
