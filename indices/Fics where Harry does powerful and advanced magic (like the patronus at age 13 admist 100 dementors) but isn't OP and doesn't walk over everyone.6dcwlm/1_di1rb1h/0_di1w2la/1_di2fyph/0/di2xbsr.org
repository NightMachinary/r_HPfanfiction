Not too sure about the lack of trust, in fact, Harry would likely trust Dumbledore *more* than in canon, because that will be his only friend. I imagine that Dumbledore will, however, force Harry to get friends in a way, by either directly creating collisions with him and other students, or he will make it a mission of sorts.
