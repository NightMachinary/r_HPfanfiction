Just because he and or Neville are Hufflepuffs, does not mean they will automatically start working hard, because it's "in their nature". I mean, Cho wasn't a genius at Magic (partly why she joined the DA) just because she was a Ravenclaw.

I think that a Harry who is ritually bullied by his house, hexed in the halls by members of his house, and is verbally lambasted by both members of his house and teachers, would be more likely to attempt to rise above them and show them up by being the prodigy we all want, and there is only house that fits this descriptor, Slytherin. If you want a Powerful Protagonist, you have to make him alone to do it, it's almost a rule of thumb in all literature. And who will an alone, friendless prodigy, attract most of all? +Oldmen!+ Dumbledore. This could be a good stepping stone for a Mentor!Dumbledore fic.
