It seems like half your issue with the Augurey is that Harry and Ginny aren't together and willing to tell each other everything after a brief relationship. Mind you, I have my own character pairing preferences, but that story's main issue was the actual kidnapping, the Ginny stuff had no reason to be other than it was (whatever the pairing decision eventually was, it didn't matter), given the actual length of the relationship. I would like to read stories that give the premise a different go, however, so I'll keep an eye out.

I don't think Voldemort's body being capable of reproduction stretches believability any further than the creation of the body itself though. ðŸ¤”
