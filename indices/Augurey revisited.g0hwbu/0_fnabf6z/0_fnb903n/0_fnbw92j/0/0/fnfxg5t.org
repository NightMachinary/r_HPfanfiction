I think you have missed the point I made explicit in my final sentence. I'm starting to think it's purposeful, reinforcing my initial statement: Half your issue or more seems to be the pairing itself, and absurd suggestions (to the extent of linking an acknowledged example of the fandom pairing wars at a bad time) and yourself showing a similar tendency of generalizing a pairing without an ounce of self awareness. Like, what does this have to do with anything. Matrona has one big issue and it's less the pairing execution and more how the main schtick was done.

If what you're interested in is a pairing discussion where one engages in opinion, be direct about that in the OP. I've little to no interest in it myself, especially when it regards characters who have little substance in canon for me to care about them. Ok, Harry arrested Ginny for hexing people at a Quidditch match. It's literally the distillation of the little we actually get about Ginny in the series. The scenario is mildly interesting, but half the characters involved don't interest me.
