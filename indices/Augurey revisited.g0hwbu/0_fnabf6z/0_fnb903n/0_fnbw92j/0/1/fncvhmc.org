  February 2000 Newly Qualified (in record time) Auror Harry Potter remains obsessed with “The List.” The ten people still wanted for their part in the Battle of Hogwarts. Their capture is essential. It will bring closure to the events of the past few years. Harry has set himself a target. He wants to see “The Last Death Eater” and the other nine captured before the second anniversary of the battle. His attempts to meet his target will bring heartbreak, danger, pain, and a lifechanging injury for one former DA member.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)
