1. When I say that I like Hinny stories (and no, I am not 100% selective about them, there are many other stories worthy of reading with all other ships, including Harmony), it is not to say that I defend for a second what JKR wrote (or rather not wrote) in the books. Did you for a second believe that JKR is capable writing anything romantic? No, she is not, she is complete rubbish in romantic scenes, or better she doesn't write them. I wrote about it [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][here]]. There is only one romantic scene in whole heptalogy and that's the complete disaster of a date between Harry and Cho in Hogsmeade. There is just nothing else. Etc., I wrote it in that blogpost.
2. I have my constant struggle with the essay [[https://angua9.livejournal.com/204545.html][“What's So Funny 'Bout Peace, Love, and Understanding?” by angua9]]. After the first reading I just rejected it as over-the-top partisan gibberish. It was written during the worst parts of the Shipping Wars and it shows, and the picture of Harmonians is just grotesque. However, if you tone it down (like, 90% down), I found to my shock that some of his conclusions actually held true even against the evidence. Take linkffn(3867175) and linkffn(11916243), and I specifically am not picking some teeange-written trash, both of these are good stories, well written, I would say they are the best what I found in Harmonian stories. However, take a look at the story about the romantic relationship between Harry and Hermione. Well, actually there is no story, because there is no development. There are no conflicts between them, because they are just perfect together, did I say how perfect they are, oh, they are so perfect ... [me falls down snoring] ... the romantic part, the part they cared about a lot, so it is not an omission, is just absolutely horribly written. And before you say that shipping stories are such, let me present two examples from the Hinny world: writings by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] specifically for example linkao3(1857084) and linkao3(601124). Can you pick some differences between Harry and Ginny relationship in these stories and those two mentioned above (or almost any other Harmony story)? I am just rereading the scene in the “Hunters” where Auror Potter is arresting his love of life, Ginny, completely drunk and hexing fans of the other team. Do you think there is some story behind this scene? Did I mention that reading such stories is much more fun?
3. If you say that other shipping partisans write even bigger crap than somebody else, it doesn't make me much warm and fluffy inside. Of course, Drarry and Snarry stories are crap, they cannot be otherwise, because whole premise is very suspicious (yes, there is probably that one Drarry story somewhere, but I still have to find it).
