Literally all these examples you're giving are the usual problems in fanfiction. This is not remotely more common in HHr than any other pairing or type of story in general (well, any other with a substantial amount of stories anyway). Draco x Hermione? Harry and Ron will be bashed. Hinny? Ginny will be portrayed as Harry's perfect partner. These story flaws come with the territory.

And in the case of the Ginny example, I don't really see the point here. The way that relationship played out in canon (post HBP) was beyond silly, no less than a bog standard, true love from high school sillyness (and in this case, based on a relationship that was what, a month old?) It wasn't written well, so I don't see the need to defend poorly written HHr any more than I expect those who like Hinny to defend the canon version or other poorly written versions of that ship

Really, the point of my post is I don't really see what a pairing critique really adds here. It can and does go every which way.
