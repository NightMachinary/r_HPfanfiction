That is absolutely not true. I can easily imagine accepting the Harmony ship, and I have read many Harmony stories and I have enjoyed them. And yes, there are some problems which happen [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/review-of-escape-and-mr-and-mrs-percy-weasley.html][too often there]], but usually, the problems are not that severe. I give to Harmonians that true love should begin with friendship, or at least there is no true love without friendship. However, most of Harmony stories I have read suffer from at least three problems:

1. Excessive bashing, which is just immature and usually follows a poor or missing plot

2. The horrible separation between Harry and Ginny. I am not saying they must be together, and I understand that most high-school loves fall apart, but most of them are just poorly written.

3. Completely crazily perfect and so perfect, and even more perfect, Harry and Hermione. Even in otherwise rather good Harmony stories (e.g., linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities)), they are both so flawless and so perfect, that I want to tear my eyes out of my head because it is so hard to survive their perfectness. Did I mention that they are perfect?
