Oh, right, so I have misunderstood your initial comment. You are not trying to defend Harmony, but that couple in the relationship who knew each other for six years, were officially dating for a year, saved each others lives couple of times, all that in the middle of war, where relationships tend to grow faster, so for that pair it should be OK to keep information from each other. Is that your point?
