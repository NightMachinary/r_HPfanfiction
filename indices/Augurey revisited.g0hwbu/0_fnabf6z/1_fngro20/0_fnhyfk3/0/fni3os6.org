One thing I am constantly reminded about is how little we have in the books. There are all those comments “and then two months nothing serious happened”, JKR skipped crazily long time even in the Spring 1998 when they were on the run hunting Horcruxes. You can (and it did happen) fill in long romantic stories in those missing areas in books. They were, what two years, on one Quidditch team and you think they had no meaningful interaction? Interesting. And yes, JKR sucks in writing romantic stories, no question about that.

And no, you are right, in my original review, I haven't criticized Harmony per se (only that most Harmony stories I know about suck to some extent), but my points were that the secrecy was completely unnecessary (really, even if he knew Ginny two months, and I still hold he knew her longer, what would she could do? Trying to revive Tom Riddle using his daughter? Informing her friends among Death Eaters? Really? Exactly her who had very personal history with Tom Riddle?) and that the kidnapping was both unnecessary and criminal. And yes, I think the only purpose of both of these mistakes for the author was to set-up Harmony as soon as possible, but Harmony itself was not the biggest problem per se.
