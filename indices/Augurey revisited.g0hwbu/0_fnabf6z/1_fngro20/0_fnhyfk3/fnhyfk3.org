They weren't officially dating for a year, they began dating at, like, the end of April. And more than that, their first noteworthy interaction occurred in 5th year (she was virtually non-existent in 3rd and 4th years, and 2nd year she was fairly.generic). My point, really, is that I don't see what criticizing the pairing itself does. Everyone has such preferences, and any declaration that some pairing (that has more than a tiny amount of stories) between the standard group of HP characters, has some issue more than the others is both false and seems to detract from the otherwise correct point about La Matrona: that story's kidnapping scenario doesn't make that much sense.
