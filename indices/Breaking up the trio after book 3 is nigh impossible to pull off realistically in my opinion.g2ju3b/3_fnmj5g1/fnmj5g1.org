Its extremely easy to separate harry from ron in book 4. And book 7, for that matter.

Likewise it would be easy to do so for both ron and hermione at the beginning of book 5. Hey I know let's completely ignore our supposed best friend immediately after he was traumatized by seeing another friend be murdered right before his eyes, with the man who murdered his parents and has repeatedly tried to murder him regaining a body immediately afterwards. That sounds like a good idea, right? It must be, because Dumbledore said so!
