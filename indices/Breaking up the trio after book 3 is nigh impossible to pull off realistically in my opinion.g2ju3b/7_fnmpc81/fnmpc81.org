I can see the trio breaking up relatively easy, but think Harry would always remain friends with both. Harry doesn't have it in him to hold a grudge. He even asked Voldemort to think and try for remorse, essentially giving him one last chance after all the shit he had done.

So I don't think a breaking up of the trio would end in the trio hating eachother. But he could have easily made other friends during 4th and 6th year.
