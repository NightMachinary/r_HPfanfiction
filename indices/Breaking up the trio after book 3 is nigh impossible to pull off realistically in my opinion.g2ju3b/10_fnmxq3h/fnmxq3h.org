For it's easy to see them broken up post third book. As people have mentioned Ron was jealous about Harry entering the tournament. If Harry branches out to new friends then you can have him grow away from Ron even if Ron apologies. If you want to when Ron and Harry argue and Harry brings up why he(Harry) had to be the one who saved Ginny? He could mention how come any of the Wesley brothers noticed something was wrong? I believe the twins thought she was only home sick. You basically make the initial argument stronger. Now would be the time to expand his friend circle both inside Gryffindor and out. Initially Hufflepuff is out do the supporting Cedric but after warning him Hufflepuff students could start to be friendly with him. Let's say Cedric and Cho become friends with him if in this story they dated before Yule ball. Maybe make friends with his years Hufflepuff students.(potentially changes Arthur for Amelia) if you're following cannon for the dementor attack. Seeing Harry spread out his friends would Ron feel marginalized by Harry? Instead of being Harry's best friend he's just another friend. Is it cannon for Ron feeling marginalized by being a sixth son and not seemingly as driven as any of his brothers or a girl like his sister? Ifcso would that change his choice of how to apologize and if he would? Have Ron's jealousy get the better of him.

For Hermione during the spat between Ron and Harry would she know how to handle it? Would she see helping the one as the betrayal of the other? She may think it'll blow over and just keeping her head down. Her not supporting either side could lead to both sides being angry at her. How will things look if it took Ron longer to apologize? Just have Hermione overthink it and delay making a choice tell it's to late. Who actually would Hermione side with and would she be fine not going back to the way things were?

That's just trying to stay in cannon. Since it's a fanfic you could have someone mention that Harry's can't was a life or rich. Basically you though they only left you a trust vault? Hermione wouldn't have known and the Weasley family and Sirius could have assumed Dumbledore told him.(Dumbledore could just wanted Harry save at the Dursleys and not wanting the Dursleys able to take Harry's money to moustache twirling evil) Have someone in the new friend group about the first meeting with the Wesley's. Have Harry question if it was the Weasleys being the Weasley family or a setup. Have them question why nothing happened publicly about the first 3 years except for the convenient thing about Snape lying to the minister as Dumbledore would have known what happened when they where at school. Basically have Dumbledore playing things to close to his chest backfire. It's a good story point good Dumbledore or bad.(might be interesting if it's all just Dumbledore not being able to get things through the political system)
