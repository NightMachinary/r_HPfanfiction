I mostly agree that having the friendship break up post book 3 is difficult to realistically portray in fiction, though it is doable.

To me, the deeper line in the sand is post book 5. To have Harry shun his friends after they sacrifice life and limb to help him rescue Sirius against adults with superior skills, and in the process both become seriously injured, is just not realistic. I've read several stories that try this, and unless they go full Weasley bashing, Harry comes off like a whiny edge lord.

As a side note, it always amuses me the people that latch onto what Ron did in GoF as some Judas-like act. It was a 14 year old kid jealous of his buddy, who lashed out for a short time. Not saying he was in the right, but come on man, I'm still young enough to remember high school, and the amount of terrible decisions kids at that age make, with hormones pumping through their body and with brains not fully developed, is truly mind blowing.
