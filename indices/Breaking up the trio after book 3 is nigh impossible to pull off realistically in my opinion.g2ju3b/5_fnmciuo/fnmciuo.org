I agree with you. The trio has been through a lot of life and death situations together, and it seems unreasonable for Harry especially to give up on their friendships.

People who disagree with this I feel have assigned fanon feelings to the canon actions of characters over time.

Ron is a good person and a good friend, and every time he makes a big mistake (Goblet of Fire, Deathly Hallows) there are extenuating circumstances and more importantly, *he immediately regrets his actions*. In the case of Goblet of Fire, he's too jealous and stubborn to make up, but still indirectly helps Harry. In Deathly Hallows, he was in a high stress situation while wearing a piece of Voldemort, and a minute after taking it off would have come back if not for the Snatchers.

Hermione's two big things that make people on this sub make her out to be “the worst” are her actions in book three and book six. Book six can generally be excluded from these kind of discussions as nearly every character in the book acts OOC or just plain stupid. For the sake of argument, her jealousy and annoyance with the HBP's potion textbook stems not from Harry doing better than her - just look at how she treats him doing better in DADA, she doesn't care that he does better there. She's annoyed because Harry is getting better marks and pretending that it's because he's good at potions, rather than because he's got the HBP's notes. She views it as dishonest, and instead of working to understand the theory of /why/ potions work, he's just piggybacking off the HBP's work. Did she overreact? Sure. But she's not a bad person over it.

Book three is a lot more complicated, in that she kept making choices that would affect her friends without taking their views and feelings into account. She let Crookshanks wander the common room - like it is implied that all other pets did - even when he kept going after Wormtail. This was a thoughtless thing to do and out of character for her, and I feel was only done to facilitate Wormtail faking his own death (again). The Firebolt fiasco had fault on both sides: on the one hand, Hermione absolutely should have at the very least told Harry that she was going to tell McGonagall about it. On the other hand, Ron and Harry were absolute twats about Hermione /literally trying to make sure he doesn't get cursed/. At that point they thought Sirius was trying to kill Harry and had successfully broken into the castle at least once.

I kind of got of track, but anyway if the divergent point for your fic is fourth year, it doesn't make sense for Harry to willingly say “well fuck you, first and best friends I've ever had”. You'd have to make Ron and Hermione less involved in Harry's adventures much earlier or it just seems silly and/or OOC.
