  For god's sake, Crookshanks is a cat!

I didn't get this before I was on Reddit either, but it does make sense. It's just the fact that the movies hate Ron that makes it confusing. Yeah, they were a rat and a cat, and if Crookshanks was a normal cat and Scabbers was a normal rat, he probably would have eaten him. Hermione's fault was not the eating bit, it was the fact that she refused to apologise. If someone came with their dog and ate my cat, which sure, I didn't like that much and then refused to apologise, I would be pissed. Like what the fuck! It's happened, but you can't even take responsibility for it! That's the part that was bad. And then JKR made it so RON went crawling back to Hermione when the Buckbeak appeal was happening. That just conteracts the whole point! Stop me before I go on a rant about her writing...
