I've never even suspected that Hermione was blamed (by readers) for a cat/rat accident until I got on Reddit. For god's sake, Crookshanks is a cat! A predator! If Ron was so worried, it was him who should have put Scabbers into a cage or used some spells to protect him. Coming from someone who had two cats and a rat. That's how animals work - you put a fish in a tank, hamster/mouse/rat/parrot in a cage to keep them from harm, not monitor your cat/dog/ferret every minute of a day. It's clear that all familiars roam Hogwarts freely. Plus the fact that cats are actually allowed as pets and rats aren't. Was Hermione insensitive about Scabbers' â€˜death'? Yes, she was. Was she in any way guilty in it? No.

But agree that with Firebolt issue they were all faulty. And agree that HBP made everyone so unpleasant and unlikeable, that it's better to exclude it from discussions like this.
