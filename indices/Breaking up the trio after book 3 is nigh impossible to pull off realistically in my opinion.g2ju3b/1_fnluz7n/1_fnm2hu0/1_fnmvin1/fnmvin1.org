Not cut ties, but it would be easy to damage their relationship without changing much. Say, Ron apologizes after the first task. However. Perhaps there were a few periods when Petunia was nicer to little Harry, only to become mean again. So now, intellectually Harry knows Ron's his friend - he almost got adopted in his family. He knows that that Ron regrets what he did. Nevertheless, Harry could very well have this irrational fear that Ron will shun him again the next time something comes up - just like Petunia's niceness didn't last. He would constantly be waiting for the other shoe to drop and break his friendship again. This fear could eventually become too much even for a Gryfindoor, and Harry could distance himself from Ron to alleviate it. Probably they would still be friends, but not best mates anymore.
