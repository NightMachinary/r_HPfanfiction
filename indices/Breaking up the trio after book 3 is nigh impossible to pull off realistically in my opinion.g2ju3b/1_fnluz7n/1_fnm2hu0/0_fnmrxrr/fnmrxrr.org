  Ron has offered Harry a place in his family

And his mother could be an easy way to stop that dead in the tracks with her canon actions. Especially considering that she told Harry that she was worried about him to the point where she considered getting him away from the Dursleys (not checking up on him, removing him). And after that, she does nothing more than send some token food rather than inform the authorities about the blatant child abuse taking place under her nose. It would be very easy to have that destroy the relationship between Harry and the Weasleys if you would depict the effects the Dursleys had on him more realistically. Giving false hope to an abused child is a quick way to be burned.

Not to mention her utterly braindead attitude towards Harry's involvement with the Order at the Start of OotP. Other than Dumbledore, Harry has to be the one who has faced Voldemort the most out of everyone alive. He just went through a gladiatorial tournament which ended in the murder of an acquaintance. And she, with no combat experience under her belt (she was not in the Order the first time around), goes around with her condescending, reality-denying attitude and starts to insult Harry's last bit of family.
