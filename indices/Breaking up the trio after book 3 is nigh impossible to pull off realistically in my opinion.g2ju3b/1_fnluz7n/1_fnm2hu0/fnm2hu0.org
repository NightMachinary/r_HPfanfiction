I wouldn't quite call it animosity. I feel like that is too harsh of a word, but he was certainly upset. And I completely disagree that it would be easy to cut ties. Ron has offered Harry a place in his family, as well as put his life on the line for Harry on several occasions. For Harry to cut ties, especially as as easily as you are implying, just feels sterile and lacks any real emotion.
