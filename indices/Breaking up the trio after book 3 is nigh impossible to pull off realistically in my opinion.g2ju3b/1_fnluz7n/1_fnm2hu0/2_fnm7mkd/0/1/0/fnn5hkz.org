Yeah, well, see it from Harry's perspective, the guy who constantly called himself your best mate just outright abandoned you over some competition he wouldn't have no place in anyway, called you a liar and attention seeking all the while you suspect yet /again/ someone is trying to do you in. Oh and this ignoring part is not over a few days, but weeks, and then you discover the task of this oh-so-desirable tournament is to fight /Dragons/ and get this, this, this "best mate" knew about it before you and didn't tell you.

It would be very OK for Harry to just tell him to fuck off for a few weeks
