I seem to remember a very convoluted conversation about how Ron received a letter from Charlie about dragons and it reached Harry through a very messy gossip grapevine, I may be only in the movies since it has been years since I've read the GoF

I much prefer the Harry/Fleur versions. To a point canon may annoy me.
