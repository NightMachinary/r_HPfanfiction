I think it says more of how Ron perceived himself rather than Harry. I imagine it's hard to be a poor kid with lots of successful older brothers, and feeling like you can never live up to expectations. His best friend is famous and rich, and then suddenly he has another chance to claim the glory and recognition that Ron so craves. It must have hurt Ron, to think that he had been excluded from the planning, when they had previously had their adventures together. And let's not forget that Harry was daydreaming about winning the tournament. I think the whole Harry hates all attention thing is pretty overblown.

Either way: If emotions were completely rational, Ron would have listened to Harry. But he was 14, hurt, humiliated, and angry. I personally find him quite compelling, because he's not perfect.

(He did try to apologise, but Harry told him to forget about it, and then they went back to being best mates.)
