True: "Right, I've called this meeting of the Order of the Phoenix to explain everything I know. Voldemort has Horcruxes, Harry might be one but we won't know for certain when he's in his new home with the Tonks family, and we're going to hunt the Horcruxes down. Also we're discontinuing Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts and starting a new class that does the same thing but isn't cursed, I've called upon some Aurors to teach for a few years."
