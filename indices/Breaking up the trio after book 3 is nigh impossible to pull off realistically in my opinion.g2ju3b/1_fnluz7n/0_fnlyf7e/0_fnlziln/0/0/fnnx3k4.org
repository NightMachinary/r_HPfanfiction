Tell me about it. I don't know if it's just because I enjoy fics, but I always find "because that's how it was written" to be a boring answer. I prefer to look at a world from within, where actions happen because the /character/ did something, not because the /author/ did something.

I simply find Watsonian explanations both A) are more interesting, and B) lead to more interesting fics.
