And the author's talking about Book 3, but Harry had no problem pretending that Hermione didn't exist for weeks because of the Firebolt in POA.

Honestly, I never understood how Harry could instantly forgive Ron in GOF after the way he lost his shit over the Firebolt. Even in Deathly Hallows, he was like "Oh, don't worry about leaving us to fend for ourselves in the middle of a war, it's okay mate"

Another point against the author too, you "can't break up the trio" but Ron had no problems going "Fuck this shit, I'm out" in the middle of the Hunt.

And can we talk about the way Hermione treated Harry and Ron in Year 6? She was absolutely ghastly. I swear Half-Blood Prince could be considered Hermione-Bashing.
