Disagree.

Exactly because of what they went through they became close, as such they haven't had to improve themselves as people, they've grown through age but not much else. What I mean by this is Hermione never stops being the unlikeable, insufferable know-it-all from the first book. Harry and Ron just accept that after the troll. Through the books there are plenty of times Hermione is a horrid person but she's their friend so it doesn't matter. Old tensions/issues haven't gone away they're just less important. A good author could easily play to that and separate off Hermione especially after third year. They aren't really forced to face the consequences of their actions and say wow I'm a bit of a dick, best work on that.

Ron is the normal person in the trio. Harry is a hero/icon/whatever you want to call him. Hermione is very clever and intense, Ron is just a boy who looks out for his friend and doesn't really know what he wants from life. If you play up to Harry the hero, have him accept the mantle of the boy-who-lived. In the books he largely rejects what it means to others but you could easily see him not wanting to disappoint them and as shit gets more serious so does he. The more Harry moves away from being a person and more towards an idea, the less space for Ron in his life. In a lot of ways Ron keeps Harry sane and human. There is scope for Harry to try to be better than that, he must be, he's the boy-who-lived, people need him to be better.
