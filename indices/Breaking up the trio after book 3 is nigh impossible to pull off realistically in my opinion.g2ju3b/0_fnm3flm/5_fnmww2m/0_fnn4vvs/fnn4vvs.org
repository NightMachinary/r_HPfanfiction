Ah, the 5th year Harry who is being lambasted by the press, who can't count on a single authority in his life to protect him from the government official /torturing/ him in detention AND who had to deal with guilt and nightmares with only loneliness to help him(because Dumbledore was being a wuss and was afraid of Voldemort hearing of how passive they were being in fighting him).

Realistically speaking I wouldn't be surprised if Harry just snapped and noped out of the country with Sirius.
