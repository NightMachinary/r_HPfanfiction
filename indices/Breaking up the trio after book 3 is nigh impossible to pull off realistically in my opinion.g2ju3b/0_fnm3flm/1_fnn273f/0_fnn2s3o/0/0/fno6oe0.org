  it just seems skipped over that Ron indirectly placed Hermione in mortal danger in first year

Ok Time to defend Ron's character.

In this scene, Ron made an insensible, though true, comment to Harry : " /It's no wonder no one can stand her, she's a nightmare, honestly/ ". And Hermione happened to hear this comment, which made her cry all day in the bathroom.Seriously, school start in September 1st and this scene happened on October 31, Hermione knew that she had no friend and probably heard comment like this quite a lot (expecially considering how annoying she could be, like commenting on Ron's attempts and his pronunciation even though he didn't ask to be helped and didn't want to).I also want to point that Harry's only comment when Hermione passed them was "/I think she heard you/". He didn't try to defend Hermione because he agred with Ron.If Ron is responsible for "putting Hermione's into danger", then so are all the kids who said the same comments, the teacher who didn't look after her when she was missing, oh and Voldemort for letting a troll loose in the school.

  because if Harry didn't insist they had to help while just wanted to get authority
#+end_quote

. . . here's the scene :

/Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm."I've just thought -- Hermione.""What about her?""She doesn't know about the troll."Ron bit his lip."Oh, all right," he snapped. "But Percy'd better not see us."/

So ok you can give one cookie point to Harry (or the scenario) for thinking about Hermione. But Ron didn't need any convincing once he understood what Harry said, and especially didn't want to go to authorities. It's probably also important to point that either Harry or Ron going alone would have probably ended up with 2 dead students so yeah they *both* saved Hermione.

​

Finally, I will just say that all the heroes had falling out at one moment or another (both Ron and Harry were crossed with Hermione in PoA and while the case of Harry could be argued since the broom was sent by Sirius Black, Ron was 100% justified in his anger and "the Ran was an Animagus" does not justify how Hermione acted with Scabbers), Harry and Ron always had to pay for their mistakes (saying they are sorry and everything) while Hermione just cry a little and it's also Harry and Ron who have to say they are sorry.And for the "duo", not only do I think about at least 5 instances where Harry would have died if not for Ron, but in GoF, Harry does say that hanging out with Hermione is a little boring since it mean library, library and . . . library.

And man do I wish people mentionned more Ron's good moment to analyse his character, like following spiders with Harry in the Forbidden Forest until a den of Acromantulas even though his worst fear, or standing with a broken leg in front of a thought Death Eater saying he would have to kill him first to hurt Harry.
