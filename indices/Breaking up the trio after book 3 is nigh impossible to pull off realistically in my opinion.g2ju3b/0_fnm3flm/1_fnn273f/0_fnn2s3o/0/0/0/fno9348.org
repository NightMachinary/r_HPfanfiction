Here's the thing though: even if everything you said is true (which I don't think it is, but I won't argue about it) Ron's moments were mediocre at best before book 4, but he had no good moments after book 3. He didnt grow, he just got eternally stuck as a jealous petty lazy asshole who caused more issues than helped and gets handed things on a silver platter.
