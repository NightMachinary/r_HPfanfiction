In my opinion, Harry and Hermione were better as a duo, rather than having the trio. If you remember, in fourth year she canonically continued to help him with the tasks. Throughout the series she is much more of a friend then Ron was many times over. Now I'm not praising her for being perfect- I know she had some obvious character flaws. However, it just seems skipped over that Ron indirectly placed Hermione in mortal danger in first year, because if Harry didn't insist they had to help while just wanted to get authority, its very possible she could've died before help arrived. This is, in my opinion, extremely pivotal because both Rowling and the characters treat it as an accident, that Ron and Harry saved her. However, is it really the pair saving her? Or was it just Harry's insistence that saved Hermione, which was indirectly caused by Ron's insensitivity? This is why I think perhaps Harry and Hermione would've been better with someone else, or just a duo. Also coincidentally, after reading Blindness by AngelaStarCat, I need more Harry/ Hermione. Recommendations very much appreciated.
