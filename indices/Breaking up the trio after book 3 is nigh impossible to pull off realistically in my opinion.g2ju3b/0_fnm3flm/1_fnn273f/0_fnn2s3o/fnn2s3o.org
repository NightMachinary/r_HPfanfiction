I don't think Ron was emotionally stunted, that was just his personality, he could socialize, he just didn't care to. Yes, he wasn't a social butterfly, but he had no problems fitting in.

Harry was clueless on how to make friends, and Hermione was almost as bad. You can see that many of Harry's relationships are because of other people's connections.

IIRC Hermione only marginally talked with the other girls in the school, she didn't have any other close friends.
