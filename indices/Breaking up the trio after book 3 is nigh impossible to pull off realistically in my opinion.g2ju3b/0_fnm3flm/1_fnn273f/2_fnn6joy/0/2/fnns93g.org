  The hilarious thing: JKR said Harry can't have become an Obscurial because he didn't know he had magic.

  But he knew he was doing things and/or causing them to happen. That should be enough.

Why on earth would that be enough (if you actually understand what an Obscurial is)? Harry's magic was never /suppressed/, and definitely not of his own volition.

  Unless what happened to Adriana Dumbledore was a continuous thing, her experience would be a cakewalk. "Oh no, the muggles bullied and attacked me ONCE! Woe is me!"
#+end_quote

It is very heavily implied that Ariana was sexually assaulted by the boys that attacked her.

But sure, "woe is me".
