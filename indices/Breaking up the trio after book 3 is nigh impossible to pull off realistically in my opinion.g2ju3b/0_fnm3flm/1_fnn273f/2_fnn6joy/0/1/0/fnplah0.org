It was stated "boys" which ranges from her age to teenagers. Would a group of teenagers do that to a six/seven year old? Singular person, maybe. But a group? Way back then, finding a group willing to do that would be almost impossible to find outside of cities. I'm not saying that's not what JKR wrote, but I'm looking at it realistically. This was what, 1892? Yeah, population density alone makes it highly unlikely.

I always chalked Daddy Dumbledore attacking them out of a form of racism/rage. Now that Obscurials are a thing, that could be the reason too.

Edit: After some googling, I could be wrong. The statistics are for cities though, so I don't know. But I do know in those fringe villages people would be hanged for stuff like that. The "group" part sticks out to me.
