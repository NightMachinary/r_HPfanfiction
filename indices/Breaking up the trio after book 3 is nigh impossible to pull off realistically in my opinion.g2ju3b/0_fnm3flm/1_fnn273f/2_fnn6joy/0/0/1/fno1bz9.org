I don't quite know what an "Obscurial" is, as I don't like anything in the Harry Potter universe outside the main books, but I think [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5866937/1/Control][Control by Anonymous58]] kinda fits the "coexisting with the power within" thing you're talking about. I know you didn't ask for a recommendation, just letting ya know...
