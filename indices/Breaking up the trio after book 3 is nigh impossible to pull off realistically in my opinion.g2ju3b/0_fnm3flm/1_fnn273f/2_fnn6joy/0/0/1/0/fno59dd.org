Yeah, a lot of it isn't that great, but I want to talk about this thing and explain what I mean in more detail. Feel free to just ignore me.

Also, thanks for the rec, much appreaciated.

The Obscurial, and by extension the Obscurus, were introduced in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

Wiki link [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Obscurial][here]].

An Obscurial is a wizard that actively represses their magic, usually because their alienated or hated because of their magic. When Newt Scamander explains it he mentions the Witch Trials.

  "/Before wizards went underground, when we were still being hunted by muggles, young wizards and witches sometimes tried to suppress their magic to avoid persecution. So instead of learning to harness or to control their powers, they developed what was called an Obscurus./"

The [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Obscurus][Obscurus]] itself is what I'm interested in, at least in this discussion.

  ...an Obscurus is created when the child in question consciously attempts to repress their magical abilities or were forced to do so through physical or psychological abuse. This energy can manifest itself as a separate entity that can erupt in violent, destructive fury.

A word that comes up a few times in these posts is "Parasitic". This, combined with the line "can manifest itself as a separate entity" leads my mind to create a fic wherein Harry, when he attempts to be "Normal" and suppress his "Freakishness", creates an Obscurus. The Obscurus, in turn, is a totally separate entity that can grant Harry considerable power ("Destructive Fury"), but he has to learn to co-exist with the thing to do that.
