See: This is why I like Obscurial!Harry. It not only makes sense, I find the Obscurial as a concept to be really interesting.

I had in mind a fic where Harry sort of learns to coexist the Obscurus. Would probably end up as a sort of Ghost Rider/Venom thing, where he has this /other/ inside him that can grant him power... for a price.
