The hilarious thing: JKR said Harry can't have become an Obscurial because he didn't know he had magic.

But he knew he was doing things and/or causing them to happen. That should be enough.

Seriously, the way the Durselys treated him? Unless what happened to Adriana Dumbledore was a continuous thing, her experience would be a cakewalk. "Oh no, the muggles bullied and attacked me ONCE! Woe is me!"

Meanwhile, Harry is continuously hunted down and beat up, starved, shoved in a cupboard, punished whenever the stuff happens and called a freak.

There's no way Europe would have survived.

Seriously though, this is why you don't carelessly add crap onto a completed story. Big arsed plot holes like this appear.
