Yeah. In that case, [[/u/Nyanmaru_San][u/Nyanmaru_San]] saying that Ariana's experience was a cakewalk is... quite stupid.

Fandom plays up Harry's abuse. Yes, he was abused. He was locked up in a cupboard, withheld meals, and was hit constantly by Dudley. It's horrible. The Dursleys should have faced punishment.

However, he was never raped, and was never beaten to the point of nearly dying.

My point is to not compare abuse.
