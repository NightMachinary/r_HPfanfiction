The Golden Trio were all emotionally stunted. Harry, for his upbringing. Hermione, for how she was treated in school. Ron? Uhhhhhh.... Being the last male child of a poor family? Wow, that sounds infinitely more petty now that I'm typing it out.

Hell, Harry wasn't emotionally stunted /enough/. Seriously, between being shoved under stairs, the harry hunting, emotional abuse, and being worked like a slave? He should be an Obscurial /at the least/, and.... Is there such a thing as an ascended Obscurial?
