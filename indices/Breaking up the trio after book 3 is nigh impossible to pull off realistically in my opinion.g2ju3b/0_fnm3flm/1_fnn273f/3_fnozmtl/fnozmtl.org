  Ron? Uhhhhhh.... Being the last male child of a poor family? Wow, that sounds infinitely more petty now that I'm typing it out.

From what we understand about the Weasleys is that they were poor in a way that /the kids knew and understood they were poor./ A lot of times, people that grow up in poverty don't really realize that they are until years later and retrospect. The Weasley children all knew /and understood/ how poor they were. [[https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2013/10/scars-childhood-poverty-found-adult-brain-scans][This is incredibly damaging and leaves lifelong scars on people]], and Ron is basically the end of the line of a very poor family. Rowling wrote class divides quite clearly into the books, and Ron is a manifestation of the incredible damage that poverty can do to a person.
