Not to mention that Harry doesn't even bother explaining to Ron his suspicions of someone trying to kill him (which Ron would have believed, given that he's been through thick and thin with Harry). Not to mention that Harry himself said how he would have done it "if it had been me". Not to mention that when Ron recounts that back to Harry, instead of explaining clearly what transpired after, Harry calls him stupid.
