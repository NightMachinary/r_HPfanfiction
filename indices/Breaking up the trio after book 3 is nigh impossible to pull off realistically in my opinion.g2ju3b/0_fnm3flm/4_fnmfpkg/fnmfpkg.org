  And lastly, if anyone looks callous in that trio, it's not Harry, I don't think I would have blamed him for cutting off things with Ron in 4th year after the boy practically turned on him over a school version of death game. Hermione butting over everything, many times disregarding other's opinions and then getting mad because Harry was doing better than her is not good too.

From a fanfic perspective, if the trio breaks up, it's /usually/ due to Harry being an asshole.

That's not the only way to do it, but the shortcut most people take makes Harry /definitely/ the callous one, either through overreacting or through making a caricature of the others.

I can definitely see one where the friendship ends, but it is not exactly easy to do in a way that feels good & natural after book 3. The easiest point to change it would obviously be book 1, before they even really start being friends.
