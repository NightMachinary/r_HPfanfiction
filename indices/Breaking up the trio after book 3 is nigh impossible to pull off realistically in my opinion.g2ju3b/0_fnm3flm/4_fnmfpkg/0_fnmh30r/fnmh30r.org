It depends on the portrayal of the trio, what I see mostly is Harry getting fed up with Ron ignoring and shunning him and branching out, finding other friends, sometimes friends that don't mix well with Ron, it ends up with Harry not feeling the need to reconnecting(since he was the injured party) and when/if Ron comes back they end up not being as close. I find that realistic given the situation.

> That's not the only way to do it, but the shortcut most people take makes Harry /definitely/ the callous one, either through overreacting or through making a caricature of the others.

We must be reading different fics, for me it's either Harry just finding friends he ends up being closer to while Ron ignores him, or Ron and/or Hermione doing something especially bad and Harry just cutting relations.

I don't see how people put that much stock about their friendship, it only stayed that way because Harry and Hermione where incapable of branching out due to having poor social skills and because Ron wasn't that able to form strong connections to anyone else.

> I can definitely see one where the friendship ends, but it is not exactly easy to do in a way that feels good & natural after book 3. The easiest point to change it would obviously be book 1, before they even really start being friends.

I don't see a friendship end feeling good, it could actually be quite sad.

I agree the easiest point being before it began, since they met purely by circumstance(unless you are in one of those AU where Dumbledore calculated everything so the Weasleys would meet Harry and Ron was directed towards him, where everything could be ruined if Draco wasn't a little asshole by 11 and actually befriended Harry properly making Ron the asshole in Harry's eyes)

As a side note, I find it quite funny the work Rowling put in the first book to absolutely prejudice Harry against Slytherin. Without any of it, it's reasonable to assume canon Harry would have chosen Slytherin merely by the Hat's suggestion.
