I always found very funny that the best strategies Draco could come up with were so Gryffindorish. Even in HBP his plans are laughably stupid and he can barely make do without extreme help, only succeeding because the other party let him.

I actually agree when in stories the other Slytherins make fun of him and only give him the time of the day because of his father, I would imagine if say, an heir of the Blacks was there he would have very little power.
