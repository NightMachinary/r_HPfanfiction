That's the thing, in canon we don't even have proper lines for other Slytherins, Draco and Co. are the most prominent, but I sincerely doubt everyone that goes there is evil, even JKR says so.

Look at the people we have in Slytherin in canon, yes, Voldemort and Lucius, but also Slughorn and /Merlin./ We know some of their parents are DEs, but not all of them.

There's a difference between helping attack the school and noping out of there before what's looking to be a very one sided battle.

In fact, I would expect many of the more cunning and ambitious to just nope out of the UK before the war actually starts.
