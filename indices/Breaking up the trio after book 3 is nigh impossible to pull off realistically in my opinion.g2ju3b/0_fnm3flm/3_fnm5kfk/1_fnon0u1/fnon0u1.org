  You don't have to be perfect to be categorized as a good friend. If you help save my godfather from certain death (Hermione in book 3 and Ron + Hermione in book 5) or stand between me and a serial killer on a broken leg (Ron in book 3), their less than stellar moments are easily forgivable.

You clearly are a more forgiving friend than I am. Treason in a time of crisis and desertion are grounds for an intermediate court martial in my book.
