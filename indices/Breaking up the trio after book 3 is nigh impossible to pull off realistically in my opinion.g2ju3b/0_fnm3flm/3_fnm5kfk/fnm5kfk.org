  On 4th year we /canonically/ have Ron shunning and ignoring Harry and not believing him despite repeated evidence that he doesn't care for fame, doesn't need money and had no opportunity to enter himself.

Even then, we know how much Harry missed Ron. And we know that to some degree Ron felt the same, as we went down to check on Harry when he was out of bed.

  And then /canonically/ it gets worse, to the point many think Rowling went a bit OOC with her characters, we have Hermione being envious in 6th year, Ron abandoning them in DH and many minor occurrences were they both are less than stellar friends, I also fail to remember a time when it was /Harry/ who shunned or abandoned any of them in the books.

You don't have to be perfect to be categorized as a good friend. If you help save my godfather from certain death (Hermione in book 3 and Ron + Hermione in book 5) or stand between me and a serial killer on a broken leg (Ron in book 3), their less than stellar moments are easily forgivable.

  And lastly, if anyone looks callous in that trio, it's not Harry, I don't think I would have blamed him for cutting off things with Ron in 4th year after the boy practically turned on him over a school version of death game. Hermione butting over everything, many times disregarding other's opinions and then getting mad because Harry was doing better than her is not good too.

We will just have to agree to disagree here, because that seems very callous to me. Ron and Hermione have helped Harry in immeasurable ways, so for him to cut them off in the ways you are suggesting lacks any real human emotion.
