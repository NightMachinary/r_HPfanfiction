For all you're saying, you've twisted the argument from "Harry's callous if he lets a friendship go" to "the friendships are special because he stuck with them anyways". They're not even close to being the same thing. I'm not going to get into a debate about the value of their friendships and how "special" they are. That's all opinion and I'm more than happy to let you have yours. But Harry giving up friends who abandon him first, or friends who abuse the friendship, is not callous. That was your argument when this started and it's just plain wrong. You might not like it, as is your right, but don't let that cloud your objective judgement.

And if your problem is the characters being warped into something different than the cannon, blame the author for deviating too much or the fiction for not being something you enjoy. But don't use that as an excuse to make a blanket statement about a character that is responding to the different situations in a given fic.

And again for Hermione, past action doesn't automatically make up for future abuse or mistreatment. You're letting your opinion about how special the friendship is, your reliance on cannon material, as well as your beholden argument (that you acknowledged was wrong for Ron, but then went and used for Hermione anyways), to justify it. Mistreatment is mistreatment. That's just a fact, and that mistreatment makes it's completely fair to compare her actions in some fics to the Dursleys. From there, you yourself acknowledge people aren't obligated to forgive abuse because of passed action, which means it's up to Harry whether or not he forgives her and it doesn't necessarily mean he's being callous if he let's the friendship die.

Edit: And I will clarify that you're right at times. A lot of fics make harry callous for abandoning his friends over something minor. But using those examples to judge him every time it happens is no bueno. Every fic has to be looked at individually and taken as it is, not just what you want it to be because of cannon. That's the entire point of fanfiction after all, taking a great story and adding your own twists to make something new. Like what you want, but don't assume the fic or what's in it is bad just because it's not what you prefer.
