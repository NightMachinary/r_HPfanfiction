Harry missing Ron in cannon isn't a basis for saying it would be callous to let go of the friendship. If anything it's a byproduct of his lack of friends and the interactions that come with them. It was his isolation coming to the forefront. And even though Ron missed Harry, that's not justification for his previous actions. Sure Harry forgave him, but he was in no way obligated to.

And if you're gonna use past action as justification, everyone has to be held to the same standard. Harry saved Ginny in the chamber and was the reason Arthur survived being attack by Nagini. Yet Ron still left in fourth year and during the horcrux hunt. Why does Harry have to be beholden for help in the past when Ron so obviously isn't?

Hermione is a trickier subject, but you're also glossing over the fact that in the fanfics you're talking about, it's not just her actions in the cannon. Authors use them as a base, sure, but they also radicalize her character and make her a control freak and a terrible friend in her own right. Friendships have breaking points and people shouldn't blindly put up with abuse or poor treatment because it wasn't there before or because they put up with it in the past. Thinking in that direction, you could say Harry would be callous not to accept the Dursleys in his life, which obviously isn't true.
