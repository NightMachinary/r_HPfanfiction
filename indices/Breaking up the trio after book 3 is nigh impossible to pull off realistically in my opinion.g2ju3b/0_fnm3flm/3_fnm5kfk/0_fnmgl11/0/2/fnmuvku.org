So? Past actions aren't erased just because someone feels bad about what they did. It happened. And while there are external factors for every decision, they don't automatically justify forgiveness. In fourth year Ron is a prat because of his own insecurities. That's not Harry's fault, but he is the one those frustrations get taken out on. In the horcrux hunt, Ron instantly felt bad, and he may have been pushed by the horcrux into leaving, but he still left. That was his choice, even despite the influences. Hermione didn't leave. Harry had to keep going. And they were dealing with the same problems Ron was. Can it be forgiven? Sure it can. But does it need to be forgiven, or is Harry in the wrong if he choses not to forgive him? Absolutely not.
