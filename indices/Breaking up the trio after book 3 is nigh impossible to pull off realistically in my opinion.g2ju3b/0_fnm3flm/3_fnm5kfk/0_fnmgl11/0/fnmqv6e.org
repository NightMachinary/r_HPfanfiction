  Yet Ron still left in fourth year and during the horcrux hunt. Why does Harry have to be beholden for help in the past when Ron so obviously isn't?
#+end_quote

Ron and Harry had a falling out, almost every teenager has falling out with their friends over something stupid that they get over eventually. And don't forget that Ron was dealing with massive insecurity issues due to being the youngest boy with several successful older brothers, and he was best friends to a celebrity. They had a little argument, they were both too stubborn to try and work it through, it was only after almost seeing Harry die that Ron realised what a prat he was being and made the first move to fix their friendship.

And the Horcrux hunt, the Horcrux literally is described as bringing all your negative emotions and feelings to the surface. Ron was under the influence of dark magic that amplified the frustration he was feeling and brought out latent feeling of jealousy and insecurity that he had most likely worked through. And don't forget, Ron says that immediately after he left and was away from the Horcruxes influences he wanted to return immediately, the only reason he couldn't was that he immediately ran into Snatchers, and by the time he got away and tried to return, Harry and Hermione had already moved on.
