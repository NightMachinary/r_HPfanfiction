For months? It was just three weeks. Ron never called him a liar. Ofcourse he didn't supported Harry but he also didn't participate in Harry's abuse either. They just stopped talking with each other. And you are making it sound like that Ron and Harry friendship is all about Harry. That's it's Ron who should understand what Harry is feeling and not the other way around. Harry has a free pass because he is dealing with too much.
