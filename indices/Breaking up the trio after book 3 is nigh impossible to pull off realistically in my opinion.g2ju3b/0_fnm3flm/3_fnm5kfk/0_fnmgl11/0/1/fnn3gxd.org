  Ron and Harry had a falling out, almost every teenager has falling out with their friends
#+end_quote

Look, there's being mad with your friend for a week and not speaking to them, and then there's calling them a liar and abandoning them in an extremely caustic environment while they have to prepare for a competition where they could die.

And that's after they risked their lives to save your sister, after three years of seeing them be dragged in dangerous situations and hearing and seeing how they hate fame, after all that you have the gall of accusing them of lying and then leaving them to dry for months while preparing for a life threatening situation.

That's not a schoolyard falling out.
