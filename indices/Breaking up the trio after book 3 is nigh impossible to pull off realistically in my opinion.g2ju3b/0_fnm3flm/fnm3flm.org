I respectfully disagree, it's exactly AFTER the three first books that it becomes far easier to pull it off. /Especially/ the fourth book, there's a reason many fics use that as a starting point.

In the first three years, apart from the whole fiasco with the Heir of Slytherin, their friendship wasn't really challenged other than through external pressure(they both knew it wasn't Harry).

On 4th year we /canonically/ have Ron shunning and ignoring Harry and not believing him despite repeated evidence that he doesn't care for fame, doesn't need money and had no opportunity to enter himself.

Yes, people overplay Ron being jealous, disrespectful and petty, but canonically there's a basis for that.

And then /canonically/ it gets worse, to the point many think Rowling went a bit OOC with her characters, we have Hermione being envious in 6th year, Ron abandoning them in DH and many minor occurrences were they both are less than stellar friends, I also fail to remember a time when it was /Harry/ who shunned or abandoned any of them in the books.

Honestly, emotionally speaking, yes, they were friends, but the dynamics were always weird, with Harry being the mediator between the other two, and the only reason he did not expand was that he was emotionally stunted and didn't know how. Had he made an effort, he could probably get more than a few true friends, some of which wouldn't give a rat's ass about the limitations imposed in 5th year, and perhaps would have explained stuff better for Harry.

And lastly, if anyone looks callous in that trio, it's not Harry, I don't think I would have blamed him for cutting off things with Ron in 4th year after the boy practically turned on him over a school version of death game. Hermione butting over everything, many times disregarding other's opinions and then getting mad because Harry was doing better than her is not good too.

So no, the "Golden Trio" is /far,far/ from being unbreakable, /especially/ after third year.

That's why I like Slytherin!Harry story, it opens up opportunities canon simply doesn't have.
