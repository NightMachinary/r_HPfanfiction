I've seen some examples people mentioned so I'll avoid those but they're also just teenagers. A complete break may be hard but I don't think it's impossible to see some distancing that comes close to breaking apart. I think Rowling does well not letting age do that in the books but I think their age could do that in a fanfic if written right.
