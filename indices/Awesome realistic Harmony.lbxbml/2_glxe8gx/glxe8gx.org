More adventure than romance, but very well in the feel of the original books: [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]]

Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire, Where Hermione outsmarts herself and ends up taking Harry's place in the tournament.

I particularly like how the fic deals with Ron: It doesn't really demonize him, Hermione just was much less forgiving and there was some serious damage to their relationship, but Harry and Ron still stayed friends and Hermione and Ron tolerated each other by the end.
