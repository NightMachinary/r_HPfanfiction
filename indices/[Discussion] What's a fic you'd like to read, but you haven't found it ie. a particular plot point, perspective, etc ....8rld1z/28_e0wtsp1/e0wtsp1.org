I want a finished story (can't emphasis that enough) that has Harry travel to a parallel dimension where the good side isn't doing well at all so they have to resort to more guerrilla tactics to gain the upper hand. It can also be based in Hogwarts but I would hope that the story just uses the school as a building block and not a constant the set piece.

An added bonus would be if Harry ended up getting with an alternate version of Bellatrix, Sirius's daughter, or a well executed OC.

Some things I don't want to see are: angsty Harry, entire chapters dedicated to people sobing as Harry tells his life story, a poorly executed gimic that makes Harry OP.

On a side note, I also really want to see more female voldemort stories. Ideally ones that aren't just good vs evil as well.
