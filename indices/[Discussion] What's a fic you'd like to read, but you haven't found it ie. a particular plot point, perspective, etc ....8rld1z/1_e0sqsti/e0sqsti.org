A fanfiction that shows us the adventures of the Order of the Phoenix and just how utterly awesome they are, with all the adventures and missions they go on. Could be a big gigantic duel against Voldemort and his Death Eaters or just their daily life as a spy or how they manage to balance their work with the Order's.

I feel like they're all very underappreciated and they just have so much potential as characters. I mean you can get very creative with them. Why did Voldemort kill Dorcas Meadowes personally? Was she just as old as Flamel without her secret uncovered? Was she just that much of a threat? Or was she the longest lasting spy before Snape and she was found out? Or was it kind of a symbolism for the Order because she was just such a ball of sunshine and hope and he wanted to demolish that for them? There are a lot more of them to work with but they're very underrated and underused. Which I think is a shame, since I found them very interesting.
