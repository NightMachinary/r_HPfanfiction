I think Dumbledore was a lousy military and political leader. Even though he could match Voldemort spell for spell and his order members were individually good fighters, Voldemort trounced them when it came to military strategies and tactics.

Later during the cease-fire, Dumbledore got again outmaneuvered by Lucius Malfoy politically, who managed to sway over the Minister and establish significant amount of Voldemort sympathizers in the Ministry.
