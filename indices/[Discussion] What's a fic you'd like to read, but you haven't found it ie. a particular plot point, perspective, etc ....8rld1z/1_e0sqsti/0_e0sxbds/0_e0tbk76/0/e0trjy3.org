It's a canon rehash set in a non magical sci-fi AU, but with significant divergence after Year 6.

Major canon stations still exist, but details often greatly differ.

Hogwarts is an elite spy school. The Weasleys become the Wellesleys, Purebloods become the European aristocracy, and Riddle's goals become the aristocratic totalitarian rule and overthrow of the British democracy.

This changed setting significantly affects the Trio's character development, as they have been trained from very early on to become cunning and ruthless intelligence operatives. Harry, in author's own words, is an extremely dangerous young man.
