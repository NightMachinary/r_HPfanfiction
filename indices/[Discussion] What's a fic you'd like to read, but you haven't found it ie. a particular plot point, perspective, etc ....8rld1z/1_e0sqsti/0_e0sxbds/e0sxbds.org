This has to be AU though. Canon Dumbledore and Order got their asses thoroughly kicked by Voldemort, losing like 40% of their people, while hardly putting any notable Death Eaters permanently out of business (only Rosier and Wilkes came to mind).

Dumbledore and Order were far more effective and deadlier in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], but Death Eaters and their Ministry sympathizers vastly outnumbered them. Unfortunately, this fic carries the stigma of being set in a non-magical AU. If you can get past that, you will find it a great read.
