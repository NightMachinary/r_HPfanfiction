I have yet to find a story where Harry, Ron and Hermione (and preferably with Neville, Luna and Ginny as well) go on a world adventure defeating dark wizards, I have always felt that would be pretty cool.

I have also been on the lookout for any political focused stories that has Harry and Hermione working their way up the ministry.

Additionally, stories that flesh out side characters more-such as Dean, Cho, Marietta, Seamus, Colin and so on.
