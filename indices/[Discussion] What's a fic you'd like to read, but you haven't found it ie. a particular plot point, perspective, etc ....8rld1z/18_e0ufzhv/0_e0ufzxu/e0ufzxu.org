  Post OotP - Sirius is cleared and finally gets to give Harry the home he had always wanted. But, the war is escalating outside and the Order of the Phoenix needs to rise to the challenge of defeating Voldemort and his Death Eaters once and for all. They just might have to make bigger sacrifices than they had imagined. No slash/bashings. Canon pairings. Semi canon-compliant.
