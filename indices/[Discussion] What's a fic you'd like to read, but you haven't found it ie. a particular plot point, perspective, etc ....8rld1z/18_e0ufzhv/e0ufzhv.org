I was very disappointed that there wasn't a good story that shows Sirius living after the 5th book without resorting to magical veils, lordships and time-travel. So I set out to write my own. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12866177/1/Dysfunctional]]) Very much in tune with canon as Sirius joins the Order as a more active member; along with a lot of godfather-godson bonding. If there is any other fic you know of similar to this, let me know!
