I would like to read a fanfic about Dudley being magic too and that makes him get closer to Harry and they become like friendly supportive cousins and it goes through the seven years with them and it is like cousins against the world kind of thing! :)

Also I would love to read a fanfic that is a self insert except the self insert is NOT a good hearted person who wants to help save the world, but will instead either be a chaotic neutral with their own agenda, or would go over and help Voldemort's side and then all the Order characters would be confused about why a "good guy character" just suddenly switched sides. :) I mean imagine a sadistic, selfish self-insert Dumbledore or Sirius switching sides randomly! And in this story I could imagine them using their self insert knowledge of all the books as leverage to secure a high position with Voldemort. Like, pass themself off as a seer or something. Voldemort would not want to waste someone with invaluable omniscient knowledge like that.

I'd also love to see the OPPOSITE: a self-insert who's a good person who ends up in the body of Voldemort or one his Death Eaters, and then she jumps ship and goes to the Order and tells them she wants to switch sides or just stop fighting, and then maybe you'd get a "bad guy" fighting for the good guys scenario?
