Yeah, but I always kind of felt like there was more to the story. We know how he destroyed it and that there was a curse on it that Snape was able to contain for a bit etc, but that's about it.

Remember how the scene with the locket played out, with an apparition or whatever of Riddle appearing and taunting Ron? I always wondered how the interaction with the ring went with Dumbledore.

Edit: plus, in a crossover fanfic it could definitely be different!
