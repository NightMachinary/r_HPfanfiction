Trying to distinguish this from just listing out plot bunnies by speaking about more general ideas, not specific fic plans.

*No war series*

A series where there were no horcruxes and Voldemort died for good in 1981, though he still transfers some of his powers to Harry.

The focus of the series would be more lighthearted, more in the tradition of the boarding school genre, but still with an annual adventure/mystery. It would all be about exploring Hogwarts and the mysteries contiained within it.

*Historical stories*

I'd be interested to read about wizards in interesting historical periods. In particular:

- The era of colonial empires and wizards' involvement, or lack thereof, in it. British India would be especially interesting.

- Ancient Rome, which of course pre-dates the statute of secrecy. Two words: wizard gladiators.

*Sci-fi*

"Wizards in space" with a twist. What most people do with this idea is position the achievement of space colonisation/exploration and heavy industrialisation as unambiguously good, with the enlightened space-going Muggles outstripping the parochial wizards.

I would like to see a more reflective/contemplative type of wizarding sci-fi, where magic still holds it own against technology (the wizards are still comfortably hidden, for example). Not because magic has developed to gain a sci-fi character of its own, but simply because the fundamental supernatural nature of magic means that technology, based on natural forces, is unable to overcome or subvert it.

In this story, the expansionist, resource-consuming Muggle civilisation would be contrasted with the more ecological wizarding one. Ironically, even though Muggles' power derives from mastery of nature, the possession of unnatural powers means that wizards are able to live an existence much more in tune with nature than Muggles. The story would explore the unseen clash of civilisations, as wizards seek to preserve Earth (while maintaining secrecy) as Muggles increasingly view it as an expendable resource to launch a space-faring civilisation.

It wouldn't be a whitewash, however. The above makes it sound like the intention is to portray technology as unambiguously bad, and that is not the intention. Wizards are judging Muggles from a position of privilege: thanks to magic, they can enjoy all the comforts of a high quality of life without having to damage the natural world, and as a community with a small, stable population they do not have overcrowding concerns. Muggles do not have that luxury. In many ways, the damage the Muggles do to the environment is the wizards' own fault for failing to share the fruits of magic with the Muggles. So the story would also be about the pros and cons of the statute of secrecy, an issue which the wizarding world has considered taboo since Grindelwald.
