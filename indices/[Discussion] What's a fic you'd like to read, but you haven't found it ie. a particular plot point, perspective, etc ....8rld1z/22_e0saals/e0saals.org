I really like fics focusing on the Weasley family,most importantly Bill and Charlie.

Like bill and Charlie coming home for holiday, or when they decide to move abroad and fics when Molly realizes her son's have grown up ex. bill and Charlie come home drunk or with girls or discuss their relationships etc. Preferably at a time before war or fleur. Hope u get what I'm aminig at and I'd appreciate suggestions.
