Dumbledore and Grindlewald mentor Harry together.

In this idea, I suggest having Harry be imprisoned for the murder of Cedric. Dumbledore frees Grindlewald in exchange for helping him break Harry out of Azkaban before Voldemort does. Together they flee throughout Europe, the ministries of europe and voldemort chasing them.

You would need someone who can create a world of deep magic, unique magical cultures and write amazing Dumbledore and Grindlewald.
