Any fic that significantly diverges from canon, especially as a result of butterfly effects of small changes. For example, if Quirrell AK'd Hagrid outside of Gringotts and seized the Stone and brought Voldemort back in book 1, with all the massive changes that would result from that. Or a time travel fic where the MC's changes have major effects. Or a radically different re-imagining of the series, like linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) or linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom)

*Edit: Also, any fic that has a wizard abusing his power to dominate or conquer the muggle world, for example if he gets thrown into an AU where he's the only wizard, or in a crossover setting where HP powers stomp.*
