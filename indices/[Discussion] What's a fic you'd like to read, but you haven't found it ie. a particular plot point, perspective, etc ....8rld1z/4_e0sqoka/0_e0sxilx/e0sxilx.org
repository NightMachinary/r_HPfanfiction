[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is such an extreme AU in which a more brave and cunning Lucius Malfoy managed to kick out Dumbledore from Britain after the Halloween event of 1981. However, Dumbledore would have his revenge 20 years later. This is my favorite Ron/Hermione romance.
