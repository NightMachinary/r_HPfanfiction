-The Deluminator, which I've yet to see as much as mentioned in fanfictions much less made central to one. Being able to overhear what people are saying about you is incredibly powerful, especially to someone as important as Dumbledore.

-Slytherin!Percy - I've only found a very few, and I'd love a longer/deeper exploration of his character development along a different direction.

-An interesting exploration of Merfolk and their society/customs.

-A balanced Star Wars crossover, where neither world is inherently insanely overpowered over the other. (Darth Marrs' stuff is the closest I've seen, but it's not quite what I'm after.)
