  An AU set after or around 6th year where Hermione ends up spying for the Order of the Phoenix by somehow infiltrating the Death Eaters. Could be that she's secretly a pureblood, that she takes on someone else's identity, or otherwise convinces Voldemort to let her join. It'd be great to see something that focused both on the dark/gritty nature of spying and also the impact would have on Hermione and Snape's relationship.

I think I've read (the beginning) of a fic like that, but she infiltrated the death eaters through copious amounts of demeaning sex scenes with them. I gave it a 2/10 and left after the second chapter.
