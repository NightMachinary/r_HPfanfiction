Hermione being Bellatrix's daughter would be interesting. Though, the mark is a bit too cliche-I think either Bellatrix works it out by tracking her down. Or one of the Order lets it slip.

I reckon that Bellatrix falls for a muggle as well-its anti-canon but it would be interesting, rather than her husband.
