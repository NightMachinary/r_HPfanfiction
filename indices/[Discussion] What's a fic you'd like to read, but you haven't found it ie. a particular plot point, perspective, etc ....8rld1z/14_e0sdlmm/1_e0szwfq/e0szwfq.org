  1. An AU set after or around 6th year where Hermione ends up spying for the Order of the Phoenix by somehow infiltrating the Death Eaters. Could be that she's secretly a pureblood, that she takes on someone else's identity, or otherwise convinces Voldemort to let her join. It'd be great to see something that focused both on the dark/gritty nature of spying and also the impact would have on Hermione and Snape's relationship.

A scenario could be based on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/3mw3b4/hermione_and_bellatrix_as_a_teenager/][this premise]]:

The Order raided Bellatrixâ€˜s home a few weeks after she gave birth to a daughter, whom she treasured above everything else. She and her husband weren't at home that night however, and the Order didn't have the heart to kill an innocent child. So they burnt down the house, took away the child, and eventually found a muggle woman looking somewhat similar to the young Bellatrix. With some magic, the Grangers were happy to become a family of three.

Bellatrix, on the other hand, completely lost it, and began her descent into bloodlust, madness, and sadism. Whereas she was a tough and lethal, but a disciplined warrior who abstained from torture before, she now completely gave herself into the dark arts and Voldemort's cause. Later, she learnt that the leader of the Order during that raid was one Frank Longbottom.

Much of the story went as in canon, until the Battle of DoM. Here, Bellatrix chased down and subdued Hermione. She then stripped Hermione naked and was about to humiliate/torture her, but saw the very mark she had placed on her daughter all these years ago. She recovered much of her sanity immediately and had a emotional talk with Hermione. Bellatrix would take no further actions in the battle, and Sirius survived as a result.

Bellatrix's good mood and changed behaviors were soon noticed by Voldemort, and she explained that Potter's best friend was her daughter and their cause would be greatly helped if she could bring her over. Voldemort then asked Draco what he thought of Hermione. Draco answered that Hermione significantly bested him throughout the years and he didn't think a Mudblood could have done it. Now he was actually happy and relieved that he was beaten by his very own cousin. Voldemort then gave Bellatrix and Draco the task of turning Hermione.

Hermione struggled a long time with this revelation. She was deeply worried that Bellatrix might attack her adoptive parents at any time, so she persuaded them to take a vacation to outside of the country. There, she modified their memories and sent them off to Australia. Soon after returning home, Bellatrix indeed showed up to kill the Grangers. Although she didn't accomplish that, she was nevertheless impressed by Hermione's ruthlessness and ability to cast complex charms at such young age. A longer talk ensued...
