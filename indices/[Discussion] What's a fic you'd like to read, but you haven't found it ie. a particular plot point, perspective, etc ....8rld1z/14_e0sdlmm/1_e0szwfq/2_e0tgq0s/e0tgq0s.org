I've considered writing something with a similar premise to this, but currently am a bit swamped with stuff to write! Anyway, my premise was as follows:

The tale begins in October of 1981. Bellatrix and Rodolphus have two children: Cassiopeia, who is two, and Leo, who is six months old. On one of the nights that the Lestranges are out on Voldemort's business, their house is raided by a team of Aurors led by Frank Longbottom. Leo dies, and Cassiopeia escapes by a miraculous feat of accidental magic. Bellatrix comes home and swears revenge on Frank Longbottom and his family for killing her son. She knows that she'll likely be killed or captured, so she takes Cassiopeia and apparates to Spinner's End. She begs Snape to take care of her daughter, and he protests mightily until she points out that she doesn't trust him, but she trusts him more than some of the other Death Eaters. Besides, Snape is the only one who has enough skill with mind magic to perform a highly sophisticated Obliviate spell so that Bellatrix will believe her daughter also died in the attack.

Bellatrix, Rodolphus, and Rabastan go off to attack the Longbottoms, and end up captured and sent to Azkaban. Shortly after, the Dark Lord vanishes. Snape is left a child who very obviously is the daughter of Bellatrix and Rodolphus, and not wanting to risk being sent to Azkaban himself, Snape uses a Polyjuice potion derivative on the girl after finding a Muggle woman who has similar looks to Bellatrix. Snape's potion changes fewer features than actual Polyjuice, and as a result it lasts much longer. Snape does some quick mental manipulation of the Muggle woman and her husband, and leaves Cassiopeia with them. The couple, who couldn't have children themselves, are delighted with their daughter, and name her Hermione.

To keep his work secret, Snape revises the Potions curriculum to remove any ancestry potions. This works well until Dumbledore hires Slughorn, who doesn't know Snape's secret. Ancestry potions get put back on the curriculum, since they are very fiddly and good for NEWT students to brew. Hermione ends up brewing one in class, and is shocked by the revelations it provides. This leads to a conversation with Dumbledore and Snape, and they conspire a way to turn Hermione Granger into Cassiopeia Lestrange and thereby give them another spy in Voldemort's ranks....
