For me, I've always wanted to read:

1. An AU set after or around 6th year where Hermione ends up spying for the Order of the Phoenix by somehow infiltrating the Death Eaters. Could be that she's secretly a pureblood, that she takes on someone else's identity, or otherwise convinces Voldemort to let her join. It'd be great to see something that focused both on the dark/gritty nature of spying and also the impact would have on Hermione and Snape's relationship.

2. In a similar vein, I'd love to see a muggle spy AU, similar to [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] but with more of Kingsmen/secret agent vibe
