I've read a few Voldemort/Harry body swap fics, though they pick up in fifth year instead of at the battle of Hogwarts.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10490069/1/Of-Kings-Of-Pawns-and-Of-Men][Of Kings, Of Pawns, and Of Men]] - 12 chapters, in progress. In my opinion, has some very well written character interaction. linkffn(10490069)

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5118649/1/Becoming][Becoming]] - 26 chapters, dead. Has an interesting(?) take on Dark magic addiction as Harry struggles to keep his cover while leading the Death Eaters. The story is marred by some squicky slash in my opinion. linkffn(5118649)
