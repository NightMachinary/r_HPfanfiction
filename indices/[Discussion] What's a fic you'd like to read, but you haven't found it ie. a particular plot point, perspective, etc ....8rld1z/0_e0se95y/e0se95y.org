Harry and Voldemort kill each other simultaneously, resulting in Voldemort's permanent death and a slightly different kings cross station - harry chooses to go back, but due to circumstances (the way they both died, or the shared blood thing) ends up revived in Voldemort's body instead of his own.

Cue harry dealing with the existential bullshit of witnessing his own corpse while being trapped in Voldemort's body as everyone around him is screaming. Clearly this leads to how he becomes a weird hermit gardener/anonymous author out in the countryside that never goes into town and the resulting disaster shenanigans. He'd bet his life this was tom riddle's secret ultimate final revenge plan.
