Seriously, Pureblood supremacist and a muggle is such an obvious, fun and angsty idea, I truly don't understand why nobody wrote that yet. I know of some fics where that happens in the background but it's usually with a character who is already in the process of letting these ideas go, not at the start of the journey.
