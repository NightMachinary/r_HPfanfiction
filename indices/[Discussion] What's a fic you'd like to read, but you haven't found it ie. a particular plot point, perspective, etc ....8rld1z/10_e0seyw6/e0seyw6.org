I came here "looking for", but did not receive answers to the following topics:

LF fics in which one of our beloved/hated pureblood supremacists falls deeply and completely in love with a muggle. All eras welcome, OCs welcome.

LF Grindeldore fics in which Fawkes is actually Gellert Grindelwald as an animagus, pure smut welcome, emotions welcome, everything is welcome.

[Request] LF stories in which (old) Dumbledore seeks out Grindelwald's help and the Dumbledore-Grindelwald-power-duo is reactivated.

--------------

Other things I would love to read, that are (almost) impossible to find:

Dobby being Draco's real dad. Boom boom elven powers awakening like whoa.

A story that explores, like really really explores Peeves.

A story about a relationship between Teddy Lupin and Delphini Riddle. They could bond perfectly about being hella angry at their parents or even hating them, because they did no care about them enough to even try to stay the fuck alive. Seriously most criminally ignored potential pairing ever, if you see Cursed Child as canon, which I usually do not, but those two could be AWESOME together.

A believeable Tom Riddle/Luna Lovegood (currently trying my own hand on that one).

Oh, and a genderswap where every single character is gender swapped. Just everyone. Would be interesting.

OH, and a story that makes Peter Pettigrew the real hero to end all heros, not even grey, but the best of the best from the start, I have no idea how that would work, but I would be interested in reading it.
