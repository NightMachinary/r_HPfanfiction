1 a Crossover where Uber godlike Harry decides he must leave his universe to live his life and sets out to do so, when arriving he is in the body of his 5 year old self with all the Power and ability of a normal if above average 5 year old wizard. Harry then has to grow up and then finds himself in his new normal boring life embroiled in the storyline of the other world and thus must get stronger. Basically alter the focus from knowing spells to be strong enough to cast the spells without killing himself

2 Harry crosses over to a Vampire fiction story but it isn't a slash pairing

3 Harry is part Anodite and one of the few Masculine Anodites in the universe, he is one of several on Earth, only one in Hogwarts and England. Harry then must learn his powers and gets involved with some insanity either as a Superhero or the Plumbers or something cool
