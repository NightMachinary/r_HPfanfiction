- Something where magic is not a natural phenomenon. Either superatural or due to another race giving the power.

- Really, really old magic. The story of the first wands, the first magical murder, Magical aztecs against the Spaniards; stuff like that.

- The far future. What's the status of the magical words centuries after the epilogue? Is the SoS still a thing? Did the first magico-mundane war happen? How do wizards deal with hyper-aware muggles. Do wizards go to Mars? To places where no muggles will ever go? Will they become an ancestral race in a new planet?
