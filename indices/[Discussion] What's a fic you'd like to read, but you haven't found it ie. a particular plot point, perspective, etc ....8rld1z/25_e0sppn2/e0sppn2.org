Probably not this sub's cuppa, but I've been looking for a Ron/Hermione/Draco romance story for a looooong time. One where they're all in love with eachother, perhaps set in a book 6 where Malfoy is still beholden to the Dark Lord--- lots of interesting dynamics there, I think!

I'd also be interested in an episodic work in the style of Friends/HIMYM/Seinfeld/The Office, documenting what it's like to be a professor at Hogwarts, and their friendships and so forth.
