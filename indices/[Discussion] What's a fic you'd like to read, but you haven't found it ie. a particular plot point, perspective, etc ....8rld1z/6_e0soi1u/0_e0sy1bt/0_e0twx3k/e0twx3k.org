Prophecy wasn't made until 1980, so that's out.

Someone would have to reveal that information, which only harry would know, so it's kind of a moot point anyway. One plausible way though would be Snape, who finds Voldemort and begs his aid in exchange for his eternal servitude.

Imagine harry attacks in Hogwarts or hogsmeade and Snape risks his life to try and protect Lily, creating a significant canon divergence.
