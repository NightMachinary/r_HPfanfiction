Regarding #4, I've read some fics where Harry & Ginny's feelings grew organically out of them both having experienced a connection to Tom Riddle's soul, though they didn't realize it. In some cases it was just a bonding experience (shared trauma from the same psycho) or Riddle's soul subtly infected their personalities so they see a bit of themselves in each other. In other fics, their feelings grew from the life debt in 2nd year.

Either of these explanations would fit logically with events in the books. Do you consider those options to be massive divergences from canon?
