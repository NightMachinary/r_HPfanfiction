I have so many ideas:

1. MoD!Harry, after being cursed to be ageless and remain eternally alive when he inadvertently united the Hallows, is sick of his inhuman life and wants it all to end. However, he cannot die. As a last ditch effort, he creates a plan: travel back in time. Not to his childhood, but too the 1970s. What's his endgame? Kill James and Lily as 5th year students. In other words, Harry is the terminator traveling back in time to prevent his own birth and end his own cursed life.
2. 4th/5th/6th/7th year Harry, realizing he needs to get his shit together, discovers a way to use his invisibility cloak (or whatever) to travel between parallel dimensions. He wants to become strong enough to protect his friends and loved ones, and live up to his parents sacrifice. The catch? This is a crossover fic of Harry Potter...and Harry Potter fanfiction. An ultimate meta-crossover where Harry travels to the worlds of other popular fanfics to learn new skills/powers/magics/knowledge from alternate versions of himself. Picture canon!Harry meeting Harry from A Black Comedy, and somehow they get wrapped up in trying to break into a purebloods house while Harry learns how to use the magic arms (spoiler). THINK of the possibilities here!
3. Talented Hufflepuff!Harry. The draw is that, Harry, who always wanted to appear normal and blend in, would hide his talent and ability as he grew, so it was a shock when the TWT rolled around and he could hold his own in the contest.
4. A believable re-do of canon (or parts) where the reasoning for Harry's infatuation with Ginny is made clearer. None of that BS about a chest monster and random love potion scents. I feel like this is something that would be really obvious for a lot of people, but most of the time their is a significant or even massive change in canon to do this which is not what I mean.
