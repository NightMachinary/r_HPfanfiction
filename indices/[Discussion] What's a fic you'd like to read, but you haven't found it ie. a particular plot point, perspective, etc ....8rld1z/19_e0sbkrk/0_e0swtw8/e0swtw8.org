  1. A good Harry/Ginny fic that has Ginny as a badass (her 5th-year characterisation) while also including a supportive Hermione without pairing her with Ron or any (former) Death Eater. And no goddamn happy Weasley family.

I have this idea that all Weasleys except Ginny died in the Final Battle. Completely disillusioned and disappointed with the postwar Ministry, Harry left Magical Britain with her and Hermione. Teddy and Andromeda also joined them. Twenty years later, they would return to cleanse Magical Britain once and for all.
