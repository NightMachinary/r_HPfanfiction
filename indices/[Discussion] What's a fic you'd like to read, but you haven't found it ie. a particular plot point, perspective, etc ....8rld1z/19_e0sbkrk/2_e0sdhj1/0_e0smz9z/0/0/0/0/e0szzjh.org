Oh, it can definitely be done.

It just might take a bit more thought than “I don't like Ron, so he's gone now”. If we remove a character, especially a key one like any of the trio, then we have to think about what that means for whoever is left. For example, if we ditch Ron...he's saved Harry's life in DH, when there was no one else around to do it. So how do we avoid killing Harry in that bit?
