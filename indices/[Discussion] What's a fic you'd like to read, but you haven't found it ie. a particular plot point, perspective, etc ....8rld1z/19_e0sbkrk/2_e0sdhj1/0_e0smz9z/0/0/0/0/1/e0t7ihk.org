Oh yeah, of course! If you remove Ron the story would be completely different. I think the story would be much darker without the Weasley family, for one thing.

Yeah there are definitely obstacles but I think, critically (and I probably should have said this before), in a fanfic without Ron I wouldn't expect it to follow the narrative to such an extent that individual scenes would be an issue ... so much would have to change if you removed him that I'm not sure it would be possible, and I think the whole point (in my mind) of removing Ron is seeing how it moulds the story into something different.
