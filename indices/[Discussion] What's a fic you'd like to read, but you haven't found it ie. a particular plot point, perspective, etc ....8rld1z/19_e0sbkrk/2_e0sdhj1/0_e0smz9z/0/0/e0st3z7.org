Even in a fanfic, the trio each have strengths which cover for other people's weaknesses. Hermione is a genius, but gets flustered easily and unable to think straight under pressure, which is where Ron shines.

If you remove one of the trio, you'll have to come up with a way to cover for the weaknesses that removing your chosen person leaves exposed.
