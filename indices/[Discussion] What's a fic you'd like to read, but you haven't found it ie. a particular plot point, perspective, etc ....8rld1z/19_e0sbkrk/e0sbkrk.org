1. A good Harry/Ginny fic that has Ginny as a badass (her 5th-year characterisation) while also including a supportive Hermione without pairing her with Ron or any (former) Death Eater. And no goddamn happy Weasley family. Bash them to hell and back for all I care, that trope is so boring it could be utilised for euthanasia.

2. A Harry/Hermione story where they get together without overthinking the whole thing, declarations of undying love or grand acts straight out of a romance movie. Would it be too much to ask for one fic where on a random Tuesday, Harry or Hermione have the urge to kiss the other, act on it and then just see where things go instead of already planning the wedding before their first date?

3. More stories like "Blue Magic", where someone from another universe, preferably Mass Effect but baggers can't be choosers, stumbles across Harry and raises him. Not the average Sirius/Snape/Lupin raise Harry fic, but more like a blue, monogendered alien with the ability to flay people with their minds despite being outstandingly kind raising Harry on Mars. Or Seven of Nine being thrown through time and space and finding herself oddly attached to the small child left on the doormat.

4. Crossovers where someone is dropped in the HP universe and fucks Voldemort hard enough to get the recording uploaded to Pornhub. Imagine the Master Chief jumping out of the Veil during the DoM battle, Vader bringing the Executor to bear on Malfoy Manor or Shepard, Garrus and Wrex turing the Battle of Hogwarts into a turkey shoot.

5. Harry/Demelza Robins or /Katie Bell
