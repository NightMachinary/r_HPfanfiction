  the only similarity between them seems to be that Abby and Kitty are both muggles.

It's true there are plenty of differences but there are a few more similarities to consider: both muggle OFC are a 'down on their luck' sort with no supportive family, both have aspire to be artists (music for Abby, drawing for Kitty), Harry is "running away" in both stories (figuratively in GYWM, he is avoiding the pain of his past), Harry must weigh the consequences of revealing magic in both and lastly I imagine GYWM will end with the OFC finding success in her musical endeavors.
