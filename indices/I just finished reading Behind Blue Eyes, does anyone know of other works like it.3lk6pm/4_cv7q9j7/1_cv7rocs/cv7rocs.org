The muggle/magical pairing isn't the thing I'm looking for, thank you for the recommendation though.

I'm actually looking for fics with characters with similar situations to the one Kitty is in; whether they're magical or not is unimportant.

You should definitely read Behind Blue Eyes though, it's excellent.
