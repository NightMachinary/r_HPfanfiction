One of the very first fics I read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4260581/1/Lessons-Learned][Lessons Learned]] was first-person. I wouldn't consider it one of my favourites (nor is it particularly high quality), but I did enjoy it.

There is also [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory2.php?chapterid=301596&i=1][Delicate]] and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory2.php?chapterid=448372&i=1][Off the Rails]] both of which are entirely romance fics (and certainly not for everyone).
