Someone already mentioned Seventh Horcrux, and that's about the only first person Harry Potter fic I've found that is tolerable. Because it was originally in third person limited, I don't believe that the series lends itself well to first person.

My personal favorite first-person fanfic would be a Dresden Files one. The writer manages a passable imitation of Butcher's style, and I found it rather good.
