I'm fairly sure 'The Changeling' is not first-person but rather third-person limited (compared to third-person omniscient). Limited third-person can be implemented in a very similar way to first person (and is essentially the same as the original text) . First person however uses pronouns such as I and we rather than: he/she and they.
