This isn't me recommending my fic but asking for feedback. I always hated 1st person too, so my partner set me the challenge of writing a one shot in 1st person. I borrowed from the diary of Adrian mile by Sue townsend and wrote linkffn(The Secret Diary of Hugo Granger-Weasley)

It made me feel a bit better about 1st person but I'm still not sure I'd use it for a full length fic.
