I think the most well known is linkffn(3384712) (The Lie I've lived). Personally I can't stand it but I know its popular. Earlier in the what's new thread I linked linkffn(12446118) so I suppose I ought to again but it isn't in the same league as the first. My favourite by far is linkffn(4068153) (wastelands of time.)
