I can read pretty much any AU -- Voldemort wins, no Voldemort, non-magic, different era, different parents, different upbringing, etc.

What I can't stand is extreme changes to characters' appearances and/or names. Most characters in most fics all already basically OCs but changing their looks and names is going one step too far for me. It breaks the immersion way too much. I can read a story where Harry's a Snape's son or Hermione is Bellatrix's daughter. But as soon as Harry turns in a brown-eyed redhead, Ron in a grey-eyed brunette and Hermione in blue-eyed blonde that are now referred to as Hadrian, Ronaldo and Hermosia, I quit.

And even though I would read a muggle AU, I would drop a story where magic works in some way that was directly stated (or implied) as being impossible in canon.
