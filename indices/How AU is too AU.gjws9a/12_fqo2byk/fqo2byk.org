Yeah I read almost exclusively AU. It's what got me into fanfic.

I don't read fanfic for the execution, I read it for the creativity and whimsy, which is hard to do in a canon rehash.

That said there's a bit of a line - I'll rarely read time-travel stories or anything just ridiculously out there.
