Actually, more fanfic stories I've read more I prefer the Hinny ones. They are a way more fun, because they deal with flawed characters as we all are. Harmony (or Haphne) stories, where everybody is so perfect make me vomit. The biggest relational crisis in linkffn(Notebooks and Letters by chem prof)? IIRC, the only crisis of their relationship was when Harry didn't run fast away enough when jumped by naked (?) Cho Chang. He was willing to break engagement over it. Really?

In [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833][Meaning of One by sovran]] we have Ginny blowing up faces of *both* her mother and Professor Dumbledore by the overpowered Bat-Bogey Hex half-a-year through their relationship. A way more fun. In linkao3(Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19) the beloved wife just dies, truly and really (in Notebooks and Letters in similar situation, the author was not able to let the person go).
