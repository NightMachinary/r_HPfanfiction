Now I prefer to avoid pretty much any canon compliant fics eg harry/ginny and Hermione/Ron because I could not see those ships happening. Now that's not to say I never read fics with those ships but they are few and far between.

So I prefer AU Fics. The question becomes does the fic require massive changes in how the characters interact or will lots of tiny changes get the character to where they need to go. While I don't mind the massive change I actually prefer lots of smaller changes (of course just like whether someone likes a fic or not there's a lot of variance in whether a change is "small").

As long as there is a decent tie to either the wizarding world or at least some of the Hogwarts characters I'm ok with the AU. But if it's just Harry by himself and completely away from the wizarding world then I'm not as interested.

For example, one story that is as close to that latter AU line as I would tolerate to go is Harry Potter x Anita Blake crossover. Hard Won Homes by Luna_sss. The trio Harry and Hermione/Ron leave the Wizarding world after Voldemort's defeat and end up in America in St. Louis. They start interacting with the different weres due to Harry's "saving people thing". Eventually, different ties start appearing eg the redhaired norse vampire Damien is related to Ron. And others show up like Andi and Teddy, Neville/Luna etc. This is set in the time frame just after Blue Moon but before Obsidian Butterfly (Anita Blake trying to "gain" control of her life).

Hopefully the link will work or it may bounce if you don't have an AO3 account (which I just asked for since I never needed one to access things before). Which means I really hope the story isn't gone.
