I mostly only read canon compliant stories - post war, missing moments, alternate POVs, what different characters were up to, that worth of thing. Every now and then I will dip into an AU fic usually a point of divergence, and will enjoy a couple of chapters around that point, but I dont think ever have gripped me enough to make me complete or avidly follow the fic.

I have a lot of respect and admiration for AU writers, it's not at all a problem I have with AU as a concept (indeed, I defend it rather vigorously on the main sub when people bash fanfic), I'm just particularly invested in the canon characters as a matter of preference. People have told me for years that eventually I'll drift towards AU but it hasn't happened yet.
