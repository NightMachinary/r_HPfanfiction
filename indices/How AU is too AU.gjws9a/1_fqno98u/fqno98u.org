I think bigger problem is OOC characters than changes in the plot line. I remember (but I cannot recall the name) story, where Harry time travels to the alternative universe where all Marauders & Lily live and teach at Hogwarts, and I was very much disturbed with constant thought “why these people have names of people from the books when they have nothing to do with those people in the books?”. I dimly remember Snape and Sirius being the best buddies constantly cracking jokes and both in wildly coloured robes. If you want to have canonical characters, make them at least partially canonically behaving. Or you can make a story how they turned from their canonical ways to something else. If you want to write in HP universe but with different characters just use different names. I think that's the main beauty of Marauders-era and post-war (or next-generation) stories: author can have their own characters.

TL;DR: AU where Voldemort wins? Do you want to make Dumbledore the Dark Lord of the Prophecy (please, no lazy bashing)? Bring it on! AU where Snape wears pink robes and is happy drunk pranking everybody? why?
