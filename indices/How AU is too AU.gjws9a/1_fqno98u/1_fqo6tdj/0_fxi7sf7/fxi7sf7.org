Well, if Sirius for some reason decided to not rebel so soon at his parents and ended up in Slytherin like Regulus, it could change everything: no Marauders, so maybe Snape wasn't bullied so much and he got Sirius as friend 'cause he wouldn't take on a fellow Slytherin and they would have got a common enemy, it kept him away from other Slytherins like McNair etc., obv he never fought with Lily and he never grow up bitter but on the contrary he was more relaxed.
