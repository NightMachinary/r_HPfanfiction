I truly don't know if there is a line for me ðŸ˜‚ I actually don't mind stories where everything is unrecognizable, when even the characters are pretty OOC & the setting is different. Sometimes I am looking for the familiarity of canon, but sometimes I'm just interested in the story, even if it's so AU, it's almost not a fanfic bc there's almost no canon influence.
