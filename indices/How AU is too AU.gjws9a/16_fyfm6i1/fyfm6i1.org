For me, when the entire story is filled with OCs, with just a mention, like maybe Harry being on a chocolate frog card once- if I do not recognize any of the characters save for one mention of Harry, that is it for me. I also don't like OOC characters, unless I can trace the change in character back to a moment or to a plausible butterfly effect. For example, in the Pureblood Pretense, a female Harry and her devotion to potions are possible, due to an immersion in the magical world since birth- and Lily was also very good at potions most likely, due to working with Snape. I would also say that this could have led to the Pureblood Pretense's Harry, because her father didn't exactly approve of her admiration of Snape, and having to sneak out to brew them, learning to be cunning. Harry also seems like someone, IN CANON, who to me would throw themselves into something if they found it fascinating for some reason. So I'm just gonna stop here- pretty much not OOC unless I can find a divergence point and plausible butterfly effect, and canon characters have to at least be secondary characters for some strange reason, even if I don't know anything about them.
