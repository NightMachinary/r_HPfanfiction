I don't think I've ever really had an issue with AU. More often than not, it's something specific that causes me to quit reading a fanfic, like gratuitous violence, especially against people who've done nothing to deserve it.

I remember one fanfic(so far it's only one chapter) that just randomly has a bunch of kids beating up Luna on the Hogwarts Express for no apparent reason, among other things

Other concepts I find abhorrent can make me quit too, even if I was otherwise enjoying the story beforehand.

I remember one fanfic made me rage quit over them writing that magic punished women for infidelity. Not husbands using magic(which would still be bad), but magic itself. I was just that disgusted).

I don't mind other schools so much, as long as the Hogwarts roots are acknowledged. I mean, after being put into death-defying situations every year he attended Hogwarts, maybe Harry just wants a normal year of schooling without dark lords, abusive teachers, and staff letting students get away with murder.
