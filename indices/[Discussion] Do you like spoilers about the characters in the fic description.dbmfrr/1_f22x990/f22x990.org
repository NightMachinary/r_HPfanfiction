I like plot-relevant pairings to be labeled in the summary, thanks. I hate it when I read a fic and suddenly it's Snape/Harry out of nowhere, untagged because the author didn't want to "ruin the twist".

Thanks, Swung By Serafim linkao3(9821300). I will never rec this fic as a "must read" in this sub for that reason, even if the writing and worldbuilding is well done. Not only is the Surprise Snarry a thing, their relationship is just plain awkwardly written (as expected for a teenage boy and his high school headmaster) and ruins the whole ending sequence.
