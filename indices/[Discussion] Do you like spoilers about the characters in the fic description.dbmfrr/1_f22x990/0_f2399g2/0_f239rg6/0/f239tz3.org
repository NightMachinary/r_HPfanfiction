Yeah that right there is what made me delete the fic and get angry at myself for wasting time on it, and the author for fucking up such a good start and good concept.

I literally didn't read any page that had her name on past the third page of her dialogue, and after realising she wasn't just going to be a side character and I couldn't cherrypick the pages without her, that was it. So I never saw or realised she was a Mugglewank character.

Thank Merlin for small mercies.
