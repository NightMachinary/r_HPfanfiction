If you read the Fanficbot summary, it markets the fic as a "For want of a nail" canon divergence, not a romance. I read it, expecting a canon divergence AU fic.

What the fic actually turned into, by the end, was Snarry-flavored mugglewank. The summary was misleading and that left a bad taste in my mouth that would not have been there had I gone into the fic knowing what it was about.
