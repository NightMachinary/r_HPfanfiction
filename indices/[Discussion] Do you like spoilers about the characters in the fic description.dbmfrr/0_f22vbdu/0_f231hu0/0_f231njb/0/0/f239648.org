Well, you could fairly easily do so as long as you firmly establish that it's an AU.

Trying to argue that you're staying in canon while making Dumbledore actively malicious (rather than just overly secretive and sometimes incompetent or prone to overlooking important elements of a problem - see Dumbledore flying to the Ministry in Book 1 rather than Flooing, Apparating, using Fawkes or Portkeying) is very difficult because in the end, for all his flaws, he died without complaint and did so to put plans into motion that ended up working as intended and saving everyone.

That's such a fundamentally opposed action to a villainous motivation that unless you totally abandon it and unapologetically write an AU fic, you're just going to look dumb.
