Being 'polite' to a goblin shouldn't mean a thing. Every Slytherin would know to be polite to them if it brought them significant benefits like those in so many fics. Goblins wouldn't care for nice words - from what I understand, all their peace treaties with wizards were broken before the ink on them dried. 'Actions speak louder than words' would be their prime motto.

I think the goblins could be impressed only if you offer them a deal that greatly benefits them without needing to. I don't remember the fic, but in it Sirius destroys the cup inside of the Lestrange vault (which he can only inspect as head of family, but not remove any belongings) and alerts the guards unwittingly. Instead of trying to squirm his way out, he's upfront about the whole issue and offers to surrender all goblin-made artefacts from his vaults in order to smooth things over.

Since it isn't exactly a deal made because of desperation (he had failsafes in place), but because Sirius doesn't really care for the Black fortune and feels it's fair for goblins to own these things, he actually achieves a working cooperation.
