Yes that is the Perfectly Normal series. I love the characterization of the goblins, they enjoy being rude and treat everything like a business negotiation. Harry becomes quite adept at haggling with the goblins over prices and such. It's a Slytherin Harry in Gryffindor if you're into that sort of thing, still updating too which is nice.
