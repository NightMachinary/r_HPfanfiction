I remember that fic, don't know what's its name, where being a "friend of goblins" was actually a joke between goblins, in which they categorised ignorant muggleborns so they could rip them off and make them pay an absurd amount of cash for anything and everything.

You became a friend of goblins by being polite to them, and the only way to have fair prices was to insult them, belittle them as much as possible, and haggle or outright deny paying them.
