I know exactly what fanfic this is, because it's one of those indy!Harry fics where he ends up getting with Fleur Delacour (which is the only reason I read it). But in it, the Sorting Hat (who is Harry's ally and mentor because reasons) tells Hermione that bit of information after she goes off on a tangent about house-elves.
