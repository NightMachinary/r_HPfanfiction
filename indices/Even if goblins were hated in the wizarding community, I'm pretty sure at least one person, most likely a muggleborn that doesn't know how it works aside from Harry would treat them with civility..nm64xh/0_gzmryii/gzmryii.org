I feel that the best way that you could spin this is that:

- Harry Potter, as the Boy-Who-Lived/Chosen One/Lord Potter depending on what is happening in the story, has or potentially will have significant influence in the magical world.
- His attempt to be polite to them suggests that he might be amenable to building an amicable relationship with them in the long run, which would give them influence in the wizarding world by proxy
- The actual resources they put into this are minimal, so they lose little by trying
- The possibility of Voldemort setting his eyes on them if he wins is large enough that they would prefer him to lose, but officially breaking neutrality would harm their professional reputation long term, this allows them to interfere deniably
- Often these are indy!Harry stories with Dumbledore bashing, and it gives the goblins a free way to taking shots at Dumbledore and they are being petty
- The above means that they have no reason to piss him off or sabotage him even if he was a raging bigot. A valuable client can still be important to keep even if they are an arsehole.
- Harry is a young boy who doesn't understand any of the above and assumes they are only reacting to his actions.

There is also the possible fun subversion that the goblins really are all human-hating baby-eating savages which the wizarding world only managed to subdue through great effort and bloodshed and stripped away as much power as they could so they wouldn't have to genocide the whole lot of them. The goblins finally break free by duping this ignorant wizarding hero into restoring their ability to wage war, and as thanks he shall be given pride of place as the slave of the Great Goblin King to watch first hand the fall of wizarding Britain and the rise of a new Goblin Empire.
