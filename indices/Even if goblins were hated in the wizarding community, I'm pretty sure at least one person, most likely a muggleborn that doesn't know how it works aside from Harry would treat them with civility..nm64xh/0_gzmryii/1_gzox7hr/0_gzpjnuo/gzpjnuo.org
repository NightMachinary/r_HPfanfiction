I think I've read two where Harry Potter I can think of off the top of my head where he came to be in charge of the Goblins, either directly or by proxy, both by Mjimeyg. Namely /Ah, Screw It/, where he conquers them, and /Potter's Protector/, where Xander conquers them in a rather amusingly absurd fashion.

An aside, on Goblins and their kings, I remember more than one fanfic taking David Bowie's character from the /The Labyrinth/ and making him the canon ruler of the Goblins.

One of them actually had him moonlighting as David Bowie for fun, and ALSO friends with Sirius Black, did the same thing as Stubby Boardman
