I imagine a lot of muggleborns are polite and/or intimidated on first meeting them. The question is then first impressions (they tend not to be friendly themselves) + History of Magic constantly talking about rebellions... so I could see a lot of them being more "let's just get this done and over with and get out of here" by the summer between 1st and 2nd years (there may be exceptions, but I could easily see that being a trend).
