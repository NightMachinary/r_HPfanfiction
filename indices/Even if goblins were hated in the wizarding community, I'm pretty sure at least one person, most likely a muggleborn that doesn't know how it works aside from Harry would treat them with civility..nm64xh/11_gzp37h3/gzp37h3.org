Most normal muggleborns might try, but are immediately offput by how racist and angry Goblins are toward Wizards. It's really easy to hate them back instead of trying to understand them, especially when trying to understand them just gets you derided and made fun of by the people you are trying to get to know.

It takes someone especially abused to think the Goblins are being nice to him.
