Well Drik Cresswell (muggleborn) from the Goblins Liaison Office seems to be well-liked by them. And so is Bill. And also Ted and Dean seem to get well along with the two goblins although that could be a result of circumstances too.

Probably the idea that they are nasty vile creatures is a result of the many revolts and wizards and goblins generally see each other with contempt. However once you work with them and get to know them on an individual basis you become less judgmental.
