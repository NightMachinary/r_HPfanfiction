Are you talking about this trope where the Goblins of Gringott all bend backward for Harry just because he remembered one of them and was polite (usually by saying a sentance like "May your gold and the blood of your enemies flow")?

I'm not a fan of this trope (which fall into the "Power trip" fantasy), but one of my main problem with it is that, just as you said, other people are probably polite to Goblin, and we even have Canon examples:

- Hermione was polite toward Griphook after the escape of Malfoy Manor, and it didn't do her any good when he betrayed them.
- When Bill was warning Harry of Griphook, I would also consider him as "civil". He basically said "I know Goblin because I work with them, and no matter what you are planning don't fuck with them because it's a BIG no no in their culture".

Anyways, my point is that there are people civil toward Goblin in Canon, and I doubt the Goblin are even less scornful for that, let alone treating them as "friend". Wizards may be partly responsible for the "difficult" relations between the 2 groups, but Goblins are also far from innocent in this.
