Everyone else already commented on why politeness by itself really shouldn't change anything, so I'll bring up my own point about this. The issue is that people take racial tensions and context for those tensions from our world and transplant them into one that is utterly removed from that context. In our world we are all humans, all the same species, and we are and the top of the food chain by such a wide margin that deaths to other species are treated as tragedies.

In HP world however, humans barely if at all at the top of the food chain. There are dozens of species that hunt and kill humans, many who hunt /exclusively/ humans like dementors, boggarts, ect. Humanity has literally compromised to feeding them the souls of criminals to keep them contained since they cannot be killed. There have been multiple entire /wars/ between species, where it was literally everyone of us vs everyone of them. There are territory lines /IN THE MIDDLE OF COUNTRIES/ where you are under the jurisdiction of species that eat and murder humans. Goblins are the most visible of these examples. Rather than transplanting our worlds "oh no the poor oppressed goblins" we need to take it in the context of the HP universe where wizards live significantly longer and several have living memory of when the entire species was at war. That would definitely breed some hard core racism, and unlike our world racism which is stupid and pointless, HP world's racism might well be rational and justified.
