When I visited Harry Potter World pre-virus, I was armed with fanon knowledge on how to respectfully interact with the animated goblins. My excitement turned to severe disappointment when I realized the bank teller in the Currency Exchange area didn't interact with anyone. At all.

I'd remembered a blog said it was that specific "goblin" that talked back to people, similar to the person behind Shrek's Donkey at Universal Studios.

This was unrelated to the statement title, but I thought I'd share my experience, anyway. Guess I really am just a filthy muggle.
