I don't know where this trope of "Harry being polite to a goblin and the goblins blessing him with powerful magic" comes from. It's stupid and makes little sense.

We have a very limited knowledge of the goblins in the canon but I like to view them as more akin to "corporate guys or corporations" who would use every advantage and every dirty trick in the book if it meant that they could make a little more profit. The kind of people who don't care about being polite, only making money. The kind of people who will exploit even the slightest bit of opening given to them.
