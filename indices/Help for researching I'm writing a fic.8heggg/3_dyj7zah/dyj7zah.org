I'd love to see some Harry/Ron fics. I think I tried looking for some years ago and just couldn't find any.

I haven't really read canon!Ron for a while so I don't know if I can accurately answer what kind of humour he has. I do think it would be nice if we don't get a gay-dilemma coming out type of story. There are much more interesting conflicts out there than people being prejudiced. (Of course characters can be prejudiced, but I'd rather not see that as the central storyline.)

Idk if any of this helps but good luck writing!
