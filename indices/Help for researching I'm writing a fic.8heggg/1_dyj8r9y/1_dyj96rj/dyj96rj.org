  I'd read it. A relevant trope I'm tired of would be the "Ginny potioned Harry", so don't use that as a reason for Harry and Ron not hooking up before in your story!

It's a boring cliche, but at least that would be one of the very few plausible reasons that Harry never had a gay thought during all of his teenage years. I don't know why it's such a big problem if it's just used as a premise for the story and isn't the actual story.
