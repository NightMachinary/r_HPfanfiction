I'd read it. A relevant trope I'm tired of would be the "Ginny potioned Harry", so don't use that as a reason for Harry and Ron not hooking up before in your story!

Ron tends to do situational humor. A pet peeve of mine on this would be the relationship cause it to tear them apart from apart from all their friends. Hermione and Neville at least should be pretty understanding to them.
