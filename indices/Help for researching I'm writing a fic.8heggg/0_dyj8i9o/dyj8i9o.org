  But I was wondering, would you guys read that pairing? I have a feeling a lot of people do not like Ron.
#+end_quote

No. I don't read slash and i don't like Ron. (But to be fair, Harry/Ron is one of the better slash pairings, it can't be denied that Harry is super into the guy, platonically)

#+begin_quote
  Also, what about Ron did you find interesting from the books?
#+end_quote

His background is interesting... being overshadowed by his brothers and having really shallow dreams of standing out on his own. Sadly nothing ever came of that, besides whining and complaining.

#+begin_quote
  What type of humor do you think Ron has? (again this is just to see how people saw him and to compare it to how I'm writing him)
#+end_quote

Situational humor, commenting on events happening around him and other characters in a unique way.

#+begin_quote
  Pet peeves about representation of homosexual relationships on fanfics?
#+end_quote

Suddenly everyone is gay! It seems like you want to keep everything canon except for the epilogue? There's really no indication that either Ron or Harry are even a little bit gay.
