Thank you so much for your feedback! And sorry, I just signed up on reddit, so I am still not really sure how the formatting works.

Yeah I agree with you, about â€˜suddenly everyone is gay' think on fanfics just because it fits the plot. But, I am going to use my personal discoveries about my sexuality and going to do more research to explain Ron's sudden attraction/ crush/ longing for Harry, so hopefully, it won't read too much like that. Thank you again :)
