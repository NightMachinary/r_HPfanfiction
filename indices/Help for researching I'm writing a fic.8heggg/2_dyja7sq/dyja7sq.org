Personally I wouldn't read it. That being said, something that I like about Ron is his growth, at the start he wished to be the best of all his brothers but never worked for it, then he was jealous of his best friend. When he came back in DH it was after he accepted exactly who he was, the side kick, its why I could see his relationship with Hermione working. He grew up and understood that his friends were ahead of him in a lot of aspects but you know what, that's okay.

Another thing that Ron has that helps him in an interesting family, all of his brothers are fleshed out characters with interesting backgrounds and varying strengths. Whatever way the plot goes he has people he can turn to for help. He has a supportive and close family.

Something that annoyed me about slash fics is the need a lot of them have is to turn everyone homosexual. It got ridiculous, that and the fics lacked any subtlety. A person's sexuality and what they and their partner(s) get up to in their own time is their own private business, we really don't need to have them bring it up and everyone confront them on so the author creates a podium to sprout their views from, its the same issue I have with the majority of fics that try to be political. Its not even that I have to disagree with their views, its just obnoxious and derails any fic. Obnoxious behaviour for me kills fics faster than poor spelling and grammar. I can forgive small mistakes for a good story. Just make sure its a story not a manifesto.
