Well, I will take that as a compliment! This is my first long fanfic, plus the post-War Draco one, and I think in the future I will make sure to have the /entire/ thing written before I start to post just so that people don't get too impatient for updates. I've got a plot outline, so moving forward/not getting stuck should not be a problem.

A lot of people are finding Scorpius's situation sad, but I am afraid I think it is realistic. :-(
