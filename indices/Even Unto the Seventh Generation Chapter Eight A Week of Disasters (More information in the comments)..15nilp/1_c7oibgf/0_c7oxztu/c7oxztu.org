Thank you for the feedback. I am trying my best to get the "british" flavor, and have a beta from the UK who is trying to point out flubs, but I always appreciate any additional brit-picking. I will try to adopt it in the future, and also to correct previous chapters as possible.

There are a lot of characters, I know. Before I started writing, I made a handbook of all forty first years, with bios and pictures, as well as older students and teachers. Hopefully, they'll become clearer in time. I wanted to leave the door open for sequels, if this particular story goes well.

I will keep in mind that, for the time being, I need to focus more closely on a smaller circle of characters.
