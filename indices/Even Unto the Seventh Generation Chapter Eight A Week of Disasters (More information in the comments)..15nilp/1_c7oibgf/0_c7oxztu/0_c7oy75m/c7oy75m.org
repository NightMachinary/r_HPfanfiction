LOL I have the same problem, too! My stories (set in my own imaginary country, no magic unfortunately) need some pruning as to which characters are important for the story at hand and which ones aren't necessary. I try to keep in mind that someone might have a cool story (and I have background on each one), but they don't really fit with /this/ story. That person can stay the random shy girl in class or whatever, then maybe later I'll write a story on them.

Definitely let us know when you have more! I'm really curious as to what happens next. :)
