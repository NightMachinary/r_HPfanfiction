I do that a little with characters, but they are basically the same. For example, I read the books after the movie and I saw Hermione as Emma Watson. When I read fanfiction she's a little bit shorter, slightly tanner and with bushier hair. Draco Malfoy in books likes like Tom, but fanfic Draco is taller and has sexier hair.

I also have a bit of a problem ageing them as they go along. I forget that their actually growing up and HBP Hermione ends up looking like PS Hermione. It's actually a bit annoying.
