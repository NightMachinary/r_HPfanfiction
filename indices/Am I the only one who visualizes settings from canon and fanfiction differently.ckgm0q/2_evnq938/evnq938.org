The arrangement of tables in the Great Hall always bothered me. Not sure if it's canon or fanon, but I always pictured the tables, from left to right facing the head table: Slytherin, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Gryffindor. In the movies (or, at least, several of them), Gryffindor and Slytherin are in the middle - Draco sits close enough to Harry to taunt him, rather than having to walk across the great hall to do it.

It's the tiniest damn detail, but it really grinds my gears.
