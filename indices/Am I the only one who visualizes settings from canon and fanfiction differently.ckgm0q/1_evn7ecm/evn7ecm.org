Sometimes I like to imagine the younger characters like they're being played by noticeably old actors that look nothing like the characters are supposed to, like some 90s/early 2000s movie or show.

I'm watching Smallville right now, and Old ass Tom Welling was supposed to be like 15 during the start of the show when he was like fucking 25. He also played it like a bumbling, shy nerd even though he looked like Chad Thundercock from the start. So that's how I've been imagining characters recently, Harry and Ron are big and manly at the age of 11, Hermione is straight out of a modelling agency, etc.
