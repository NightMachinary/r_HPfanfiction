Writing style influences how I view things.

Everything from Starfox5 is kind of washed out colorwise, Hermione's taller than she usually is in my head, regardless of how he actually describes their clothes I kind of have everyone in suits (unless it's specifically scenes where they're in camo, I can keep that straight)

I read Sword of Gryffindor, which is smut, but I imagine everyone as kind of chibi versions of themselves, so the sex is purely funny and not titillating at all.

People interpret Luna really differently from each other, and her eyes change in size in proportion to how loony she is. She's basically a lemur in some fics.
