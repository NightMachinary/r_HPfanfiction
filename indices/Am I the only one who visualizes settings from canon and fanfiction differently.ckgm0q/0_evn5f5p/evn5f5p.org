I tend to picture Harry much skinnier, being curly haired but not the overly messy hair that he's described with, and the stereotypical “aristocratic face featured” Harry. Dark!Harry is a guilty pleasure of mine, and that's how he's described in literally every single one. So I have to adjust my picture of him for every fic I read that's closer to cannon. I also tend to minimize the appearance of his scar for some reason. If it's funny or a crack-fic, my brain gives Harry the messiest fucking hair you can ever imagine.
