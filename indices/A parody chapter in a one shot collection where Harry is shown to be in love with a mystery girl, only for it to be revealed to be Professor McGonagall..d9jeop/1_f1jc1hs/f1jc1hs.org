Reminds me of an idea I had of Hermione or Lily doing something romantic with an unknown boy, leaving the person she's shipped with to the reader. Too bad the obvious prospects for both of them are too different for it to be feasible to leave it ambiguous without leaving one of the choices OOC (Hermione's probably working best).
