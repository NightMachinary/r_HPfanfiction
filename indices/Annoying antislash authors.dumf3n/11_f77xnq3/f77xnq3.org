"No slash" is a good tag to filter out because it's really unnecessary since you can tag your fics with "M/F", "M/M", "F/F", etc. It's mostly the sign of a writer that isn't using the tools Ao3 has already built in. It also most likely correlates with an author that has more than a few unnecessary tags, thus cluttering up their comic with 'tagspam'. Said authors should be avoided, as the intersection between "authors that write well" and "authors that tagspam" is very, very small.
