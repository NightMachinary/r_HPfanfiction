This was a ride. And I lol'd at "el ubermench supreme," so thanks.

I don't read fics that say "no slash." Not because that's all I read, but because it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I'm bisexual, and those words just... really rub me the wrong way. I'll read ANY pairing provided it's got a interesting plot (don't really care about smut), but that phrase makes me hit the back button instantly.

Overreacting? Maybe. Do I care? Not a lick.
