Yeah, I agree that smut should be labeled as such fairly clearly - having it in a story is an important element to know upfront, I'd say. At least if it's going to be anything more than a simple cut to black/implication, or if it's the focus of the plot.

On the matter of slash, I wonder how much of it is from people who think that slash = same-sex smut. Personally I know that's what I always assumed - and I'd react differently to a fic labelled "Harry/Draco slash" than "Harry/Draco romance".

I will disagree about this section:

  I cant even remember a story where a male character dated one girl, then broke up in an amicable fashion, then dated someone else. It's all TRUE LOVE, or the author skips the trouble and just goes straight to that godawful harem trope. No subtlety or ambiguity.

It's not easy to build up a romance believably. It's even harder to do so twice in the same story - if it's included, I think it has to be written (from the author's side) as fairly easy to see that it's not the final pairing. For instance if the pairing is Harry/Hermione, having him date Ginny earlier is not going to be a problem - but if you build /that/ one up to be 'true love' or an amazing relationship for 10 chapters, it'll run into a brick wall when you try to switch it over to the 'real' pairing. It's a tough one to do.
