Yeah, not sure what OP is smoking, but it is almost impossible to write more than one good relationship in a fic. Which, funnily enough, is the same reason why harem fics feel shallow. If you want to develop a relationship, that takes words. If you want more than one done well, you will need a lot of words and end up bogging down the other story elements. It doesn't even matter if the relationships are sequential or simultaneous.
