I dont really see what this has to do with antislash. There is plenty of good non-slash romance stories, just as there is a lot of slash stories that take it to the same ridiculously dumb extreme. I've seen (or been unpleasently surprised by) slash fics that didn't have a single straight character in the entire wizarding world.

The problem isn't "antislash" authors, the problem is shit authors in general. Specifically shit authors with no impulse control.
