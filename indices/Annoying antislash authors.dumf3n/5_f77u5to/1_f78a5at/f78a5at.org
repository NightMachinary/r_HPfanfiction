True. I usually look at fics with descriptions such as Noslash mean "this fic has porn but dont worry its not homo" generally speaking the only time I think no slash advertisment is when the 'pairing' in tags are platonic but was tagged together. Like parent and sibling relationship or God forbid an actual X raises Y fic which does not have a weird wife husbandry. (it was popular for a while and those fics still clutter the net)
