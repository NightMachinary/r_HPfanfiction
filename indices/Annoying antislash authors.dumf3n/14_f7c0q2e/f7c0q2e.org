  I cant even remember a story where a male character dated one girl, then broke up in an amicable fashion, then dated someone else

While this isn't unrealistic, and common in real life, if you start building up a relationship as "the one" but don't actually intend to ship those 2 people in the end, you're inevitably going to leave some people unsatisfied who stop reading the fic once the first relationship dies. I'm probably one of them, with a few exceptions (which mostly just boil down to personal ship preferences). It's not bad writing, but it might explain why this is very rare. That, and it's hard to write well in first place.

One thing I've been tempted to look for is a fic that builds up an early after-school marriage (for example, Ron/Hermione) but over time, they realize that they simply aren't compatible in the long term -- too much fights, too many things they disagree on, etc. Ultimately, they divorce, without any hard feelings. However, I doubt I'd finish reading the story if I did find a fic like this, because I'm a sucker for HEA and have never taken shipping failures well in fics.
