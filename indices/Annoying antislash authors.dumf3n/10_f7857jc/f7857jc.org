So, we can just use whatever post titles we want in this subreddit, even if it's unrelated to the topic?Using homophobia to click-bait people into reading your post is shameful. You should feel bad.

This has nothing to do with "anti-slash authors," and everything to do with you not wanting to read smut.\\
That's a fine opinion, but don't try to disguise it and hide behind standing up for slash-fiction.
