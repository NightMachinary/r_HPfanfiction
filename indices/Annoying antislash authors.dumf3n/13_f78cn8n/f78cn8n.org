The thing is that it's very difficult to write a friendly break up because many things which break a relationship are obvious from an outside perspective. So either the relationship will not convince the reader, or the breakup will feel like an asspull. It is not easy to sell one relationship in a convincing fashion, nevermind two or three. It'sbbasically the same issue as with harems, only that the relationships are not simultaneous. You still need to make two, three or even more relationships impactful, and then you need to break them up without demonising anyone. And if you do it, it will take a lot of words. So the other plot elements will be bogged down.
