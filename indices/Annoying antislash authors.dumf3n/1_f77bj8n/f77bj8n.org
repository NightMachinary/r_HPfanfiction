YEs! I feel like a lot of people put these stories up that try to have a serious plot interspersed by smut (like, 50/50 balance), and I just... why. It feels like if you logged onto pornhub and the video had a random part in the middle where they discussed politics. Like seriously. If I want to read porn, imma read porn. If I want to read plot, I don't want to stop the story every time the author gets horny.

If a character--especially a love interest--exists solely as a fucktoy, they don't belong in the story. Strong female character doesn't mean girl who punches things, it means girl who makes choices relevant to the plot and has her own story going on.
