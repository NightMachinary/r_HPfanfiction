Damn that's annoying. This [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13425603/2/Eat-Your-Heart-Out-Robin-Hood][fic]] was rec recently (Eat Your Heart Out Robin Hood) and it began well but suddenly there was almost a whole chapter dedicated to sex. You want the plot to go on but no you have to put smut. And if it was only like, a little part of the chapter... but no it's the majority of it.
