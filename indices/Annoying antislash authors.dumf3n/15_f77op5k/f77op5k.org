Yeah, I know what you mean. So many people just disregard slash but there are so many good stories out there and even some where the pairing isn't even the main focus. Personally I've come to only use Ao3 nowadays to read fics because of the tags. You can just search for the things you want but you can also just filter the fics out with the tags you don't want to have. So you can filter all the porn what plot stories out if you are not in the mood for that and you get all the romance storys you want. You have to get to know the tags a little to know which most of the authors use but then you really can search for what you want. Like slow burn, getting together or soulmate Au's or whatever you are into
