I guess there is just a certain appeal to this whole enemies to lovers trope or that an "evil" character is redeemable but sometimes it's just more fun to write/read about a dark character. But it's not only slashfics that do that but there are also Bellatrix/Harry fics or similar ships. It all depends on the personal taste of the reader then. I was mostly referring to the people who avoid slash simply because it is slash. (Not that this doesn't work just as well the other way round where people avoid het!fics)
