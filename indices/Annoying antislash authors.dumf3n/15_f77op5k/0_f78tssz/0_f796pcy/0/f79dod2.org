In the HP fandom, there is not much difference because you basically either have Harry's honorary family or Death Eaters. And to be perfectly honest, I am not interested in reading about either of them. Just like I don't want to read any fic which tried to paint Lupin in a better picture than his canon actions do (so no Wolfstar for me either).

And I don't get the "enemies to lovers" thing either. I admit a certain fondness to a Bellatrix arc where she becomes an anti-hero, but I haven't found any decent fic with such a premise because, apparently unlike the Bellatrix writer circle, I would prefer to avoid the issues of her killing Sirius and torturing Hermione. But the Bellamione fans I talked to all love the tension which comes from that torture, something I really can't understand.
