  So many people just disregard slash but there are so many good stories out there and even some where the pairing isn't even the main focus.

I honestly don't care how good a fic is going to be otherwise, if the author considers the usual suspects (Snape, Malfoy, Voldemort) shipable with Harry, I know that I will not be enjoying that fic. Because we have a fundamentally different read on the characters in the HP universe. If someone wrote a decent Harry/male Muggleborn (other than Dean), I might give it a shot.

But I can't comprehend why anyone would inflict the terrorists who worked towards his parents' (Voldemort, Snape) or friends' (Snape, Malfoy) murder upon Harry. What did Harry do wrong to deserve such a fate?
