It could be done, but 95% of the WBL stories have the Potters are some monstrous figures and a lot of fanfic has Albus as some evil figure out to ruin people's lives on purpose or there are even the occasional fics with Snape, who I strongly dislike, as a pedo which seems like bashing.

TLDR: I think most readers can tell the difference between criticism of characters that are written in non-canon ways, and bashing.
