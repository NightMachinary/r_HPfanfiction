Yep, the "unfairness" is just a matter of opinion. You brought up a good example with Umbridge, who is definitely bashed and it's impossible to tell whether that's unfair or not (since everything we see from her is ridiculously negative).

When I read a Ron bashing fic I can recognize that it is bashing without considering the portrayal to be unfair.
