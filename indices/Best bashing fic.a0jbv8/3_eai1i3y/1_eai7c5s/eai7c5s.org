To me, bashing is when a character is reduced to negative flaws to the extent that they don't act like a real human being. So, just for example, Umbridge in the original books is a "bashed" character because she's made up entirely of negative traits with not a single instance of her not being horrible and unlikeable to the people around her.

I agree with you that bashing is a flaw in the writing in fanfiction. But I can tolerate bashing if other parts of the fic are exemplary.
