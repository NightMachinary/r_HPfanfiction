Honestly, I kinda disagree. This is one of my absolute favorite fics, mainly because of how it has a Dumbledore who royally fucks with Harry, but isn't really evil, just ruthlessly committed to winning the war. It's a realistic portrayal of the "Manipulative old goat" trope, that doesn't have mustache-twirling scenes of internal thought processes where he reveals how much he loves to abuse children, or something. Seriously, it's one of the only good "manipulative Dumbledore" fics I've seen which sticks to canon plot (up until 4th year at least).
