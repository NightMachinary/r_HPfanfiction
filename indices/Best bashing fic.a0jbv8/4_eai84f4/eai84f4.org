Your mileage will probably vary on any recomendations. Readers are often willing to overlook bashing if they like the ship or plot in the fic, but those same fics might be example of bad bashing in your view if you don't share the same tastes.

For example, I enjoy [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] even though it has some really blatant Dumbledore and Ron bashing. To me, the plot and the world building about wizarding culture and secrets of the first war are good enough to make up for the flaws. But the same fic probably is terrible for people who dislike AUs in which the Death Eaters aren't evil.
