I like the idea of Ron/Harry/Hermione ending up in a 3 way open relationship. Lot's of room for drama as they work things out or face judgement and comedy as people misunderstand things.

Also, you can eventually transition the story away from the relationship and leave it as a background element while you amp up the challenges they face, have them grow to overcome them.

All in all, a lot of potential and a real shame that I can't seem to find any stories that explore the concept in an interesting way.
