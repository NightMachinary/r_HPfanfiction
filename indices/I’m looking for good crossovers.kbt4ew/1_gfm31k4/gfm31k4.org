I've actually been writing one for the last several months-I still have a long way to go but basically, Harry calls out and Draco's name during an attempt at sex, Ron shits on a wizard at an award ceremony and Hermione gets drunk in anger at her boyfriend and accidentally punches George while screaming â€˜I wish you were dead. They decided to leave the country and go to Forks were they utterly fail at being inconspicuous in front of vampires and blow up multiple things, Harry wants to dick down all the wolves and Hermione develops an obsession with high school Mac and cheese. It's basically soft crack and still has a long way to go :(
