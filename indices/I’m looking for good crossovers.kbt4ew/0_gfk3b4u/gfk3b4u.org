Another Life, Another Love, Another---oh, whatever AverageFish

Summary:

On her first day in Forks, Izzy Swan walks into Carlisle's office asking him to be her shrink. On her second day at school, Edward realises she smells of lightning---and that she's crazy, because no, no he does not have an identical twin called Cedric. Watch events unfold for two people who have better things to do---but fall in love anyway.

A humorous odd love story that vaguely follows (parodies) canon, from the perspective of Carlisle Cullen. Mild swearing. Very little angst. Edward being creepy. Surprisingly healthy relationships. Teenagers. A gay/trans relationship.

Oh, and MOD!Harry, in a rebirth cycle, as a girl (Not Fem!Harry). While Izzy is a trans character it's not central to this fic. There's no angst, either.
