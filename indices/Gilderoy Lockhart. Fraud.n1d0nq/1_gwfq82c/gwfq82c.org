Gilderoy Lockart is the cover identity assumed by any Unspeakable sent on the field. Some of Lockart stories seem to happen at the same because they really did, with 2 different agents. After the "CoS incident", Gilderoy Lockart vanished from his room in St Mungos, and resurfaced one week later driving a Nundu off a village in Congo, all of his injuries having magically disappeared.

During this time, in the bowels of the DoM, one man is tirelessly working, rewriting every field report into publishable books. Currently, the sales of "Gilderoy Lockart adventures" make up for more than half the DoM fundings.
