I discovered fanfiction while waiting for HBP to come out, and as such my first forays into fanfictions were fan written alternatives to the future books. The one that I loved and honestly keep rereading is Harry Potter and The Book of Morgana Le Fey and its sequal Harry Potter and the Final Reckoning.

I also think the relationships were done well
