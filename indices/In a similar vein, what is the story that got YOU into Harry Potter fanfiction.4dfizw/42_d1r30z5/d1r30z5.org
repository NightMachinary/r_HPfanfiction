Hah, which story got me into fanfiction? Deathly Hallows! More specifically its epilogue.

There were many things I didn't like about that book, but the epilogue really turned me bitter. I didn't even have a problem with a teenage romance between Ron and Hermione (dysfunctional relationships are pretty common there), but the idea that they would live happilty in a marriage and have children really disgusts me on a fundamental level. The idea of Harry marrying his fangirl-stalker wasn't much better (at least they have some things in common though).

Almost to until the last page of canon I expected some kind of tragic twist where these relationships would blow up because they are so fundamentally wrong. I couldn't believe that this was JKR's idea of "all is well".

So I got interested in fanfiction in order to find fixes to some of the more glaring issues I had with DH (Horcruxes, camping trips, epilogue).
