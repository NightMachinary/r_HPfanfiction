I think the first fanfic I read was called Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix because it was just after the title of the 5th book had been announced. Don't have a link to it or anything though.

I do for the 2nd one however, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/288212/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Psychic-Serpent][The Psychic Serpent Trilogy]]. Barely remember any of the story but given it's age, I imagine it is choc full of cliches.
