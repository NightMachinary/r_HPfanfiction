Believe it or not... none. Before HBP came out, I tried writing a fanfiction of my own version of Book 6. (Even before the title for the book was released). I didn't know what I was writing was called fanfiction, or that there was a load of it out there. This was before I was internet-savvy. I was writing my own fanfiction before I discovered fanfiction!
