I would say *Backward With Purpose* and *Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince*, linkffn(5677867).

I started out reading canon pairings exclusively, but later found that great majority of H/G stories tends to focus on postwar fluffs with lousy plots. Nowadays I generally look for stories with intelligent, ruthless protagonists and antagonists.
