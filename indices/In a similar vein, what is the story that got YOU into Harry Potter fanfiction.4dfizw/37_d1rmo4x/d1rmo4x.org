The God of the Lost, by Gravidy. This is one of the older D/Hr fics, originally posted on ffnet, and Gravidy has since... disappeared. Once you get past minor grammatical errors, she is an extremely talented writer with truly spellbinding worldbuilding and horrific imagery... Her fics have no match. Unlike some of my other fanfic reading material, I still enjoy her work as much as my mid-teenage self did.
