I have no idea, actually. I don't even know when I started reading fanfiction. Or why I suddenly became obsessed with it.

I assume it has been the Draco trilogy (though I only read the first book, I think), because I've stumbled upon it somewhere. No clue.

Afterwards I know I've read a lot of Sirius fanfics. A lot a lot a lot a lot. It was really obsessive. I would spend a few weeks/months reading fanfic, then stop for a few months, then read again obsessively, then stop again... I guess at one point fanfic kinda becomes boring, especially if you read similar pairings/worlds and such. Also, reading a very good fanfiction and then suddenly facing an abyss of awful fanfics was also a pretty good way to stop reading any.
