It was this really long fanfic called Lily and James The Prequel by KirbeeDesirae. I loved it so much but I think the author took it down when it became AU. This was early 2000s.

It was also known as 'The Goy Story' for this line that I'll never forget :

'we're having a girl! ' 'a girl!' 'and a boy' 'we're having a goy?'

Good times on ff.net.
