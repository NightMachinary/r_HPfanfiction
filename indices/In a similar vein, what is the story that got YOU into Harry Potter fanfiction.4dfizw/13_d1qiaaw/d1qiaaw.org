I can't remember the title anymore, but it was the most trope-y draco hermione fic, though at the time, I hadn't even heard of tropes yet. - leather-pants!draco who wants to escape from his family - head boy & head girl - Ron is a jerk who tries to molest/rape her (/shakes head at younger self/)

Hopefully my taste has improved since then, :/

I do remember some of the stuff I read during that time period (2003-ish?) that were much better. One is: [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/melissa_d/WAHP.html][We'll Always Have Paris by Melissa D]]
