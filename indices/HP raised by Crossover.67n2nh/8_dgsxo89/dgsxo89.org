I quite like The Snow Queen - linkffn(8724634)

A female harry raised in the hunger games universe, specifically to fight in the games themselves for all that entails. It's a massive shame it's unfinished and likely abandoned (updated in 2013).

I don't know much of the hunger games universe itself, so it might run roughshod over that, but it certainly dragged me in. I also love the backstory of Hermione, though that clearly deviates somewhat from canon (though pretty much any crossover story would)
