linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) and the rest of the series. I think it's on the 4th book now and still ongoing. I'm not sure if it fits perfectly because Lily and James are flawed and not one sided characters, but they seem to love Harry even if they aren't perfect. Also, it's a Marauders live AU with really amazing wordbuilding, and Sirius has a kid the same age as Harry.
