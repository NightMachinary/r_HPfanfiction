So does the Everyone Lives title mean that nobody dies in the series? Or just that a bunch of the people who got killed off in the first war are still alive? I read the first chapter thinking it'd be a kind of crackfic where nobody dies at all, but then Pettigrew bites the dust in the opening chapter exposition.
