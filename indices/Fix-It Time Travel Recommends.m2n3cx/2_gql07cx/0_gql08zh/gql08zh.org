  Wizarding world was sick and it all came back to the Hogwarts, every small mistake made there made the world more sick. This time Harry was not going to just put on the Band-Aid, this time he was going in and was going to remove the rot from the root for once and all, as the Headmaster Potter of the Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry!
