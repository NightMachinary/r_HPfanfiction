no I was ambiguous, I have planed a very long story with Hogwarts being the first part.

- First Harry, will fix Hogwarts and introduce the inventing spirit in the students. He will encourage inventions as the year end projects and group projects. He will create funds so that this kids are financed and then help them later to introduce it to the world later.

- right now, Hogwarts is the producing mindless service workers who plan on being a healer or auror or minter (all which are service based jobs)

- Harry plans to introduce and bring about the inventers, entrepreneurs, thinkers, artists, writers, poets, musicians...

- He plans to bring out the Wizarding world from the middle ages by bringing about the changes... not the muggle inventions just copied pasted .... There will be no simple wizarding TV or Mobile Or INTERNET and Harry will not simply find a way to make magic work with electricity.

Last two wars has stagnated the society and politics and death and fear had ruined the society.

I have a question, *Why dint Hogwarts produce a single Wandmaker in all those years? When Ollivender disappeared people had no one who could make wands for them?* That's the kind of change that's needed

So it will be small and slow changes that will bring about the change from the inside without like simply enforcing the muggle inventions

Harry will bring lot of capital in the market, he is going to turbo charge the economy.

I am planning to make this fic reach 500k Words...but that is the ultimate goal I am hoping to achieve if all goes well.
