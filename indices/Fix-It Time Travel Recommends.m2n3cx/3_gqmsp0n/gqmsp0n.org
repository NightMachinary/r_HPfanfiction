I'll recommend *enigmaticblue*'s two-fic series, [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1692316][*The Many Lives of Sirius Black*]]. In the first fic, My Sun Sets to Rise Again, Sirius is given a second chance to live after he falls through the veil, and has to choose which turning point in his past he wants to go back to after previewing how things could play out. The second, There Is No Man, However Wise, is after he makes his choice. Both are great!
