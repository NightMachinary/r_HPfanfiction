Are you following the linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) series? It has some similarities in its start, with Sirius escaping when Harry is eight and retrieving him. No time travel, though, and they go to ground in Grimmauld Place under Fidelius, rather than France.

Book two onwards has Harry at Hogwarts, broadly following canon, but with many things going differently as a result of the divergence.
