You could read just book 1, if you like. At that point it becomes an alternate version of the canon years with Sirius present. All of the stuff about Sirius' escape and the manhunt and reaching out to Remus and so forth and trying to clear his name is all in book 1.

I quite like the series for making everyone just people. No prodigies, no fixing everything with a hand-wave, just Harry getting a flawed but caring parental figure. (He does eventually become an Animagus, but that's only to be expected. And it's not a fast process.)
