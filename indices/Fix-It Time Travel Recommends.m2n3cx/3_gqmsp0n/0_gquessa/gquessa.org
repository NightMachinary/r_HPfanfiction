I quite like how the author shows Sirius thinking things through. He may have strong feelings about Snape, or Peter, or Dumbledore, but he doesn't just blindly oppose anyone, he weighs everything in the balance, tries to understand others' points of view even if he doesn't agree or respect them, and ends up acting pretty much as a Gryffindor anyway, but with a cooler head.
