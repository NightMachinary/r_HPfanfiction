I believe it relies on reports from other users and how effectively the site admin acts on those reports, I don't know. If you are confident that your story doesn't break the rules, then you probably don't have anything to worry about, but you should always keep a backup in case (says the person whose own backup is a very old draft). There are so many stories there that openly flout the rules and have been there for years, that I rather doubt they act very often. But it's best not to take anything for granted, and there are users who seem to make it their sole purpose in life to look for things to report.

Edit; if it's the 'Wither' story, I can see nothing whatsoever in that to worry about. I think you've picked up one of the self-appointed vigilantes. Ignore them.
