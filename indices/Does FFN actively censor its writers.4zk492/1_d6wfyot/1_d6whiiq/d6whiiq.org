For reference, FFN specifically says NOT to post smut or anything explicitly sexual on the site. People do it anyway of course, but FFN has in the past done site-wide mass deletions of stories that broke the guideline. I personally try to not toe the line, but there are also plenty of stories that have explicit sex and manage to stay under the radar of the mods.

The M rating does not really count for much; if you look through [[https://www.fanfiction.net/guidelines/][the guidelines]] it says that M is for; Fiction M can contain adult language, themes and suggestions. Detailed descriptions of physical interaction of sexual or violent nature is considered Fiction MA.

However, the site does not allow a story to be flagged as MA, which means you cannot accurately mark a story containing explicit sex or dark themes, meaning you technically should not post it, as you cannot follow the sites guidelines and terms of service when doing so. This means FFN does have the right to rip your story down if they find it. They don't do it often, but it does happen.

Basically the risk of it happening is small, but it is there, and it's up to you if you think its negligible enough to not worry about. Maybe backup the story somewhere else or post a less explicit version to FFN and the full version elsewhere.
