A lot of people like FFN over AO3, but [[/u/wordhammer]] is correct. AO3 is definitely where you want to be at if you're writing anything risque. I went into it in depth a while back with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4wim1c/readers_which_do_you_prefer_ffnet_or_ao3/d67eyar?st=isarlewn&sh=81d13833][this comment]] for why I chose AO3 over FFN for my smutty short stories.
