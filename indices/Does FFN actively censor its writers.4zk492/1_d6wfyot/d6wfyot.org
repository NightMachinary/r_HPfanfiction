A few days ago, I posted a one shot that contained a lot of dark themes and two minimally descriptive sexual scenes.

A few hours after posting it, I got a PM from a reader saying that the story might be deleted by the FFN mods if they ever came across it, despite me rating the story as M and writing warnings in the Summary.

I've heard of stories being deleted from the Harry Potter fandom by the mods before, and I'm really wondering, as of 2016, does FFN actually censor its authors and delete their stories?
