They do have rules against MA material, but realistically you probably don't have to worry about it. The people that run the site obviously don't give that much of a shit. Unless a bunch of users report you, you'll be fine. Though, I would definitely suggest keeping a coy yourself or posting to a different site as well. Better safe than sorry.
