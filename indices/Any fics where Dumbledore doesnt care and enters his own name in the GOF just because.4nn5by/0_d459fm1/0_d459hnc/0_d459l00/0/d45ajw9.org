Easy, Dumbledore won every award he could as a student, but he never had a chance to do the Triwizard Tournament, as it was discontinued over hundred years before he started school. So now the Tournament has been reintroduced, he sees his chance.

It would probably be a crackfic anyway, so both old Dumbledore doing the tournament or Dumbledore using polyjuice to impersonate a student would be possible.
