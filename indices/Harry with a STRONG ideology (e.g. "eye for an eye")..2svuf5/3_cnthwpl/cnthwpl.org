Very much along those lines is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093738/1/Brutal-Harry][Brutal Harry by LordsFire]] and the sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8532802/1/Hero-Harry][Hero Harry]]. Harry lives by a very strong moral code developed from suffering abuse at home and at school, and sees Voldemort, Dumbledore, Draco, and the Ministry of Magic as basically equivalent to the bullies he faced in school as a child and is determined to protect others. I actually didn't like whole sections of this, but it was an interesting concept and has some really good parts.
