My top 20 is badly in need of an edit, as I've read a couple fics, such as this one (/Forging the Sword/ ++++++) since I wrote it that definitely deserve a spot.

In fact, just tonight I was toying around with the idea of expanding it (probably taking it off my profile and putting into an open Google Docs) into categories - one-shots, Canon Flavor, time/dimension travel, romance, etc.
