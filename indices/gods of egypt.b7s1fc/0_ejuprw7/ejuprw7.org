I'm not entirely sure what you're going for here, but nobody has answered so I figured I'd give what little I could. The Valley of King's Massacre is a fic about Harry who is a curse breaker in Egypt. In it he encounters what the muggle's believe are the Egyptian gods, but they are not to focal point. The only other fics that come to mind are crossovers with Stargate. I've never read(watched?) stargate so I don't understand all the details, but I have stumbled into some crossovers and even with out the background knowledge they were understandable and enjoyable. From what I understand there are ascended beings ruling planets/galaxies and portals on planets that can be used for travel to any other portal. Those beings are the Egyptian gods and their leader is Ra.
