  Nearly every evening since just before Harry turned fifteen, he has gone to sleep and woken up basked in the glow of Voldemort's hearth. Dumbledore had theorized it was another element of their bond growing stronger; an unintended side effect of Voldemort taking Harry's blood in the graveyard. Harry theorizes that the piece of Voldemort's soul in his forehead likes to make Harry's life as difficult as possible. orHarry and Voldemort have reached a stalemate, but continue to argue anyway.

  Harry Potter is finally 17. Free to leave the Dursleys behind and start a new life as an independent wizard (if staying at Ron´s until he gets that apartment in London can be called independence, anyway), he does what any young man in possession of a good fortune would: he third-wheels and goes to a museum. It´s not really a bad plan. The Malfoys had announced they had made a big donation to the newly opened "Myths and Prophecies: Lord Voldemort´s secret collection": The Boy With The Green Eyes collection. All of it.
