I always imagined it being diary!Tom I know a lot of people imagine it being his parents or death or whatever but that never seems to fit right as the Harry who does early hasn't accepted it like canon DH Harry had Tom being there would be such a good mirror to Harry who probably wants to move on once realizes what is happening and see his parents where as Tom wants to go back due to fearing what lies beyond As for everyone's reactions I think the only one that matters is dumbledores who I imagine has to make adjustments to his plans but I see everything else going the same way fudge burying his head in the sand people thinking Harry is a liar and so on. Cedric would be disregarded as being addled like the trio were in third year The only major difference I can see is no Cho romance in fifth year
