Does anyone actually know what net neutrality is?

As I understand it, the internet's a bit like a post office; you write a letter to someone overseas, give it to your local post office, they hire the airline to transport your letter overseas to give it to a foreign post office who go and deliver it. And then your pen-pal writes back and the whole thing happens in reverse.

With the internets, you send a website request to your ISP who forwards it to a higher-tier provider who gets it across to a different ISP who sends your packet the last leg to your target website, which sends back the details you're after.

And the thing with net neutrality is, metaphorically, the post office is supposed to treat all letters equally and see that they get delivered in a timely manner, regardless of where they come from and where they go.

But some post offices want to, instead, be able to take payments (read; bribes) to reroute their delivery truck routes to pass so-and-so company's doorstep before anyone else's, and maybe 'forget' to go down X Street of People Who Haven't Paid Bribes now and then.
