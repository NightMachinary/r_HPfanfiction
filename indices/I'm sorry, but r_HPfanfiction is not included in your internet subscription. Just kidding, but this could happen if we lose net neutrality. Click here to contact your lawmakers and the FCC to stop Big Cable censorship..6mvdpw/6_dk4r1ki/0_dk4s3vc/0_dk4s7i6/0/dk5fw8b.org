I live in a pretty decently sized city, in the middle of an urban area. We have only one provider--the city contracted with Cox to provide all internet services in the downtown area. The only other option is satellite, which is profoundly impractical if not downright impossible for those of us in high-rise apartments.

Having ISP options in the US is a true sign you're in the wealthy suburbs.
