I think net neutrality is better and should be required, but this specifcally is extremely unlikely to happen imo. What's likely is them prioritizing some traffic over others which would slow down services that don't pay them as much, which would disadvantage smaller and new services. Only including access to some sites would be a terrible idea, I don't see any ISP doing that. And FF uses such little bandwith that it being deprioritized wouldn't even be noticable.
