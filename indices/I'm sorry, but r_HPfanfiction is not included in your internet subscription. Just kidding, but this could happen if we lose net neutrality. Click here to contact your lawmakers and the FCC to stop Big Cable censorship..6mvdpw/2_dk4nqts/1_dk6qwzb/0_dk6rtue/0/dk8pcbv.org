Sadly I see no alternative! And I am not only talking about the US of A alone (I am not an American myself), but all western nations - we are kind of in the same boat on this and all of us need to fight in our respective countries...I'd love to do this without violence and lynch mobs etc. but sadly the rich people and the politicians don't seem to want that, they should have learned their lesson by now (especially in Germany, I mean we had 3 major changes in government over the past century (from the Kaiser to democracy (which crashed and burned, partly because of reparations and hyperinflation etc.), to a dictatorship (which started a war we of course lost, which is a good thing - even if the Allies and the Russians turned Germany into an "all you can steal" after the war...we should fucking get royalties for everything stolen, but still I'd take being robbed over growing up under nazi-management/government!) back to democracy (ok: And another dictatorship in east Germany, the former German Democratic (what a fucking lie!) Republic)...still, the rich never learned that money doesn't give them the right to abuse the poor, to take their rights (voting doesn't do much IMHO, we just select who gets to take the corporate paycheck for the next few years!) etc....maybe a revolution now and then really is needed?)
