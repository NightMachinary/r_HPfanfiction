This has nothing to do with Fanfiction but Stephen King, to me, adds great description that adds a ton of weight to his stories (currently re-reading "It" right now before it's cinema release). On the other hand, Jonathan Franzan is also an author who adds a lot of description (especially with his book "Freedom") yet I felt the story never went anywhere with it. It kind of sputtered into near-boredom and instead of ending with a Bang! it ended with a mere whimper.
