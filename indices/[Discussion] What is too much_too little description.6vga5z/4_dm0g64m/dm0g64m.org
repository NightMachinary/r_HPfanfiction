I think in general if description actually adds to the tone or feeling of a scene, and isn't just description for the sake of description, it's good. Initially describing Hogwarts by impressing its how incredible and magical it seems, sure, a paragraph on a feast, maybe not.

Also, it's not the large scale, Tolkienesque paragraphs of description I think you're talking about, but caution's needed using adjectives/adverbs. There's another fandom that has the problem of a particular character always having a 'vulpine smile', which gets obnoxious. At the same time, cracking open a thesaurus in order to get new descriptions for each bit of dialogue is equally annoying. Sometimes it's just not needed.
