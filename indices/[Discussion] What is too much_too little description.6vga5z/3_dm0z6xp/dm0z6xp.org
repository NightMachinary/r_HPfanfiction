To be fair, its not just about too much or too little. Its also heavily about WHEN or WHERE within a story it is provided. You can get a hell of a lot of detail into a story but it does not have to be in one big chunk, but can be snuck in in little bits, or one can create something like a prologue which deals heavily with laying out the world.

So realistically I think its less about quantity or lack thereof, and more about quality and how its inserted.
