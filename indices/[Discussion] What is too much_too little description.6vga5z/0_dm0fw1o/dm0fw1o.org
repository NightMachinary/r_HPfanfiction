It depends.

Perhaps a better question might be, what is the purpose of description in fiction? Description adds weight and importance to things in addition to giving us a better idea of what things look like. Things worth describing are things that add to the story. The corridors between Charms and Transfiguration don't matter, they're corridors. The first moment you see Hogwarts, that's important. Some places are like people and they need introductions. You don't introduce everybody but when you introduces someone of weight and importance you describe them.

An example might be, in Harry's second year he overheads some people talking about him being the heir of Slytherin. What is the important bit? The boys or Harry's reaction to their statement. Every bit of description of the boys from the moment Harry overhears them distracts from the reaction. I don't care what some random child looks like, who is friends are, what his dad's job is, what I want to know is if Harry is going to throw a fit or keep his head down. They're not characters those boys they're stimulus. Now on the other hand, your protagonist is walking towards the final confrontation with the antagonist. You want to add weight and importance to this. You want to reinforce what you've built, remind us he's alone and outgunned. I want tension built as he walks towards something that matters. I want to feel every step he takes, I want to know if there is pathetic fallacy, I want to know if its creepy or if the sun is rising giving them hope. I want to feel invested in something that matters. Heavy description here slows down the story but it adds importance, that pause acts like the pause at the top of a roller-coaster.

Therefore good writing should strike a balance. Unnecessary description bloats the word count which is something that can matter to amateurs but what it really does is slow down the story and adds weight to things that don't matter. The benefits are that things can be slipped in easily. Foreshadowing and references can be slipped into the middle of description without the flow of the story being broken.
