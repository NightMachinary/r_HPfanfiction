Thats actually the one that I'm reading! Im enjoying the way the author subverts his tropes, tho I am finding that there are a ton of verbal exposition dumps, and it's a little bit rushed to read, as well as some clumsy foreshadowing. But its a decent read - 5/10 for written skills as a writer and 8/10 for ideas and usage of plot devices and tropes and such.
