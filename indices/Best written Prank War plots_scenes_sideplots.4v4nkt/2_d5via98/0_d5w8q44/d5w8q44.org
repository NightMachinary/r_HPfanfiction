Currently reading Harry Potter and Prince of Slytherin, another fic recommended here. But I've read several in the past with excellent pranks, usually featuring fred/george as minor side characters.

The debt of time also had some excellent pranks in it, a well written fic with hermione granger going back in time to marauders time, one of my favorite fics of all time tbh.
