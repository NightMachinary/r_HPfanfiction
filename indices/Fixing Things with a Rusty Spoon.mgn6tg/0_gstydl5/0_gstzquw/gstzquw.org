You wouldn't want such a strong break in the power. Like maybe you can, but after the hour Voldemort is still back in his body (with the memories of dying) and Sirius is still dead.

The point is you'd want the MC to struggle to find a way to use the power to change things.

​

Sure, these powers might be a bit OP to use in the timeline, but with the MC being unable to communicate/interfere directly, it is hard for him to get it right.

I mean clearly causing a giant unicorn slipper to appear is a weak power, but Ron thinks he can use it effectively. He is going to cause it to trigger on his younger self every time he has a bout of jealously. He can help his younger self mature early, and then he can help Harry on his quest.

​

Now if only his younger self wasn't so stubborn.
