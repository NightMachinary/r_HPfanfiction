linkffn(Deepest Reflections by Kurinoone)

This is part 3 of a trilogy, so you'll have to read the other two, The Darkness Within and... something else I can't remember the sequels name lol. TDW is a fully fleshed out series with additional one shot series and spin offs that is fairly well written, with any writing issues overshadowed by the solid and interesting plot.
