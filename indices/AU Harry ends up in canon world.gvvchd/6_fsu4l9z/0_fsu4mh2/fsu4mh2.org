#+begin_quote
  It's usually canon characters who visit alternative universes, but this is different. Devlin is transported away from the Final Battle in his world into the Canon Timeline into Albus Potter's 1st year. Of course, it doesn't help matters that Devlin looks like a Riddle or that he and Harry Potter are equally war-trained and ready to draw their wands. This is 3rd in a series!
