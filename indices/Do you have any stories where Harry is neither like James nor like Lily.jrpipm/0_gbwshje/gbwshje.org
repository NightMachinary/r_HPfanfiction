So you basically describing the book and movies.

1.His best subject is DADA, something neither his parents are mentioned being good at. 2. He is a seeker not a chaser like his father. 3. He literally only has 2 (could maybe include Neville as well) friends he hangs out with up until halfway throught the 5th book. Again its unclear if Lilly was popular considering she was best friends with Snape. 4. He is the definition of socially awkward being either hated by his entire school most years or seen as a celebrity figure the rest of the time.
