That was mainly the point. Doing a challenge, need to read a popular fic. This one was on a list linked in the sidebar and already on my To Read list, but there's only so much I'm willing to force myself through for the sake of a challenge. If it was less than 100k I might've pushed through, but I'll just find something else.
