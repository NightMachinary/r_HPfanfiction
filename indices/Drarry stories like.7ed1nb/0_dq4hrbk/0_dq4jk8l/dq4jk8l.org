I agree that OP could ask on [[/r/HPSlashFic]]. They'd probably get more recs there.

However, there's a problem with you saying slash isn't allowed in this subreddit. What you said could be interpreted as saying all the queers and faghags can go and take themselves elsewhere. I suggest you take another look at the many posts in this sub. You'll see that recs for slash and femslash aren't that uncommon. What's more is there are no rules stating that slash and femslash aren't allowed.
