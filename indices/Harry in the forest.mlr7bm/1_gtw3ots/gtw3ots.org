I believe you're looking for linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them). It has a sequel, but I can't remember if it was ever finished. Their was also the story where Harry stole the sorting hat and went to live in a forest. I believe its Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbone, but my memory is pretty shaky.
