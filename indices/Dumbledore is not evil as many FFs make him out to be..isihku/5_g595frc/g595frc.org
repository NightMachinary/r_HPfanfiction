"Evil" is a very different word then "child endangerment and abandonment". For me, I don't see Evil as a 1:1 meaning of what taking Dumbledore to ask should consist of. It's just a symptom of the bigger problems with trying to define his actions throughout the series.

As many would argue, the books are only supposed to represent Harry's POV for better or for worse. And that's the issue. A lot of adults started this series as Harry's age and now we're closer to the Marauder's, and so it's easier for an adult to have Concerns with how the children we're treated in this series.

Leaving an infant, asleep or not, on a doorstep in the middle of the night with a letter is the definition of criminal. The man starts the Philospher's Stone already with one foot in prison. That's the appeal behind this archetype of Albus Dumbledore, however. Sometimes that "supposed evil" is just a revision in intent with none of his base choices too heavily altered, and the realization is absolutely poignant. He didn't intend the amount of harm he caused, but it's still there.
