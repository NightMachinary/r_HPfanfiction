I mean, him not being around wouldn't stop them from just dropping Harry off in Belgium and not ever coming back. That would be pretty strongly 'declining to keep him'.

And well, yeah. Everything Dumbledore does could be explained as Machiavellian Villainy, Misguided Good-Intentions, Him Not Being As Smart and Infallible as His Mythology States, or Actual Good Ideas Done Out Of Necessity. That's what makes him so appealing, IMO. That ambiguity. It's what makes him the character that most interests me, anyway. :)
