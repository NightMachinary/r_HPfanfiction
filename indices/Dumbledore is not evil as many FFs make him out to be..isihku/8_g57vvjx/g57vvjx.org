Dumbledore is not evil. In fact he wants to rid the world of Voldemort for good and already has another Dark Lord under his belt. He doesn't care about Harry - not at first anyways - more than for a tool that needs to be used for this task. He protects him to the best of his ability from Voldemort and his followers so that he stays safe until he is ready to die.
