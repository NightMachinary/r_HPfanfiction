He may not know about the horcrux in his scar, but he may have sensed the dark magic in his scar. The point I am trying to make is that people make a lot of assumptions when trying to paint Dumbledore evil. If we make different assumptions, some of his actions can be seen as necessary.

This makes his charector a lot more morally ambiguous than outright evil.
