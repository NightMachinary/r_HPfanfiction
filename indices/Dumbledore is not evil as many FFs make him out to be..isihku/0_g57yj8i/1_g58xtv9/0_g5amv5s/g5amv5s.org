The problem is that it's easier to assume he did not know, and that he left Harry to be severely mistreated by his relatives without any real supervision. Mrs. Figg was useless.

And we never see ANY indication whatever protection left in the house was ever needed, Wizards saw Harry on the street sometimes, and he wasn't protected outside of it, someone could just have him followed to school/market/other side of the street and kidnapped/hurt him.

The no-touch protection was against Voldemort specifically and wasn't powered by him staying in the House.

And there's NO evidence that staying in the house shielded him from the Horcrux, since when he leaves nothing changes it, if anything Lily's protection was the one shielding him.

Dumbledore KNEW what the Dursley's were like, and yeah, JK wanted to go for the classic mistreated-orphan-is-saved-by-magic plot.

But inside the story it just paints Dumbledore as neglectful.

And if there was more logic, Harry would be very different from canon, not nearly as well adjusted or well-intentioned, the most magical thing about him is that he was still a good person with 0 good influences on him.

If anything Dumbledore would find out his great plan of leaving a child in an abusive home created Tom Riddle 2.0, but now he's famous, has a good standing with society, and has zero interests in working for the good of anyone that's not himself or those closest to him.

Canon Dumbledore is morally ambiguous, he can be seen either as neglectful, or out of touch, can be even seen as a utilitarian, and this is more an effect of how JK planned the plot and then went from Children's Book to Young Adults. And still left some stuff.
