I think a lot of these problems come from the fact that the series goes from whimsical children's books to darker YA books.

Because of that, we have things like Hagrid giving Dudley a pig tail, which fits book 1 perfectly, but when you look at that from the gritty, more realistic worldbuilding of later books, it looks like bullying.

In the same way, the way the Dursleys treat Harry would fit a Roald Dahl story perfectly, but when we are further along in the series, and Hermione is worrying about the way elfs are treated, we have to ask, Ok, and what about Harry? Why on Earth is everyone fine with sending him with the Dursleys yet again to be mistreated?

It's the fact that these two different styles live in the same series that we have this problem.
