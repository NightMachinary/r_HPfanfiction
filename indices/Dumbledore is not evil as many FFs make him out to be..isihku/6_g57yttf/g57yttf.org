If Dumbledore cannot keep a child out of a cupboard, he does not deserve any respect. Hell, if coercion isn't valid just bribe the Dursleys and have then give an unbreakable vow in return (so that they cannot come up with new ways to demand money). Although it should not be necessary to bribe someone not to keep a family member in inhumane conditions.

Also, Dumbledore is a person of authority. It is his responsibility to make sure that Harry is safe, especially since him being at the Dursleys is Dumbledore's doing.

Also, if Dumbledore would be even remotely competent, why does it repeatedly take 2/3 teenagers to save the day? Doylist explanations cannot be used to explain in-universe behaviour in a satisfying way. If Dumbledore can't be there for plot reasons, fine. But then Harry and co should lose any respect they had, because otherwise the story lacks internal consistency.
