I can go either way on evil manipulative Dumbledore. What upsets me the most about these fics is that Dumbledore never changes his plans to adapt to new information or events. He sets up the plan for Harry to sacrifice himself so Dumbledore can kill Tom, and then that's the plan. No change, no deviation, no improvement, no improvisation. For an all powerful master manipulator, these writers just can't write that. It's beyond them. This is, IMHO, why fics with good Dumbledore are almost always superior to evil Dumbledore.
