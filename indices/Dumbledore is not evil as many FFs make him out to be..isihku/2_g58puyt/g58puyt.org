We know from book 5 that Dumbledore knew he was condemning Harry to "ten dark and difficult years", and that Mrs. Figg (who reported to Dumbledore) deliberately made sure that Harry didn't enjoy it when she babysat because she expected the Dursleys would find a different babysitter if Harry wasn't made sufficiently miserable. Dumbledore /knew/ that the Dursley household was a cruel place and left Harry there.

Given what we know for certain that Dumbledore knew about the Dursleys and about the prophecy, his actions and inactions regarding Harry don't make sense as being benevolent. He left Harry somewhere he knew he was miserable and mistreated for ten years, and kept sending him back there. Knowing that there'd be an inevitable confrontation between Harry and Voldemort in which one had to die, he didn't do anything to prepare Harry to actually win such a fight. To my mind, the explanation that lines up best with the available facts both before and at Hogwarts is that Harry was being groomed as a martyr.
