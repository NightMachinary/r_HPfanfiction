"It's over, old man!" Harry ejaculated smugly. "I've seen through your lies, and I won't be your little pawn willing to die so you can take all the credit for defeating Tommy boy."

"So let me get this straight," the manipulative old coot sighed. "You believe that I am a secret dark lord, that I've been manipulating your life since before you were born, and that I intend to have you killed for my personal gain.

Harry's wand leapt out of its charmed, invisible wand holster in response, but he had only a moment to remember that the codger was, in fact, a very powerful wizard before everything went black.
