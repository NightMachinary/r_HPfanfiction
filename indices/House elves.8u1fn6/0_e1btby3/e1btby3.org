Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): this fic has some of my favorite uses of house-elves as characters, though it does not really start until 2nd year summer. I won't spoil it, but it takes the house-elves are overpowered trope to its logical conclusion.
