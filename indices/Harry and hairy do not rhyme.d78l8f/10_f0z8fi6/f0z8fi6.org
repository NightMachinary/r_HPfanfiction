Fun fact, these are not homophones in all US dialects. In Long Island and some other east coast places people pronounce them differently, the same way Merry, Marry and Mary are pronounced differently there (meh-ry, mah-ry like a in apple, and mare-y). That said, even growing up with the different pronunciation this doesn't bother me and I disagree that they're radically different sounds. It's not like we're talking about rhyming "Harry" and "Johnny" here.
