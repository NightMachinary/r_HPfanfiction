I can't remember the last time I read a fanfiction where someone rhymed those two words. I've read a shitload of fanfiction so I'm not comfortable saying I've /never/ seen it, but at the very least it's been a long time.

Maybe you guys read different things. I pretty much entirely stay away from crack or humor fics. Maybe that's it?
