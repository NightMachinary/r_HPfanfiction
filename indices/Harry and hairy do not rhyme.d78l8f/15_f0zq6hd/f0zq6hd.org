In official English the difference in pronunciation is quite slight, it's very difficult for any non native RP speaker to spot. One is a diphthong and the other is a longer vowel. In casual speech they are almost indistinguishable, although easily noticed in refined speech.

But they can be noticed by a practiced ear. It's similar to the difference between man and men, but Harry/Hairy is a bit different, since it's very similar and sometimes quite difficult to spot.

Consider Harry/Hairy and Cart/Cat. On the surface the difference is exactly the same, a diphthong vs a long vowel, but nobody would ever consider a cart as a rhyme or a homophone for cat. Whereas Harry/Hairy is not out of the realm of possibility, especially for Americans and foreigners who learned RP.
