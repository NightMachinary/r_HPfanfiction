In English at least, a perfect rhyme requires that:

1. The final stressed syllable in both words have the same vowel and same consonant coda, or lack there-of.

2. All unstressed syllables following the final stressed syllable must be identical.

So "Australia" and "Amelia" don't rhyme even though the last two syllables are the same or both words, because those syllables are unstressed and thus don't count. The last stressed syllables, i.e. the "STRAY" in "o-STRAY-lee-uh" and the "ME" in "uh-ME-li-uh" would need to have the same vowel for these words to rhyme.

Same thing with "Harry" and "hairy": the "-y" syllable is unstressed, thus it doesn't count towards the rhyme. The first, and only stressed, syllable in both words must have the same vowel and coda for the rhyme to be perfect. In American English, the first syllable is the same for both words, hence they rhyme. In British English, the first syllables are different, hence they do not.
