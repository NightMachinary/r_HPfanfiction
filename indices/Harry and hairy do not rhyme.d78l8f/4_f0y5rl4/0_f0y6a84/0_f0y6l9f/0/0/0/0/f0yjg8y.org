I don't agree.

Harry's hair is the defining part as part of the narration. Other characters that are part of the world probably won't give it a second look. It's just hair. I mean, in non-romanticised canon, Harry's a pretty average kid with messy hair and green eyes, who's a bit on the scrawny side. That's really all we've got -- not counting his scar, that many people are absurdly fascinated with. In that sense, scarhead makes a lot more sense than this feeble, forced wordplay.

I'd agree that children might make the joke -- maybe. Children make terrible jokes all the time. Still, I'd agree with OP that it feels forced. Not only are the vowels not the same in BE, but the stress and length of the first syllable is different, too.

Mind, I'm not an expert, but it really is a terrible joke. Yes, children might make terrible, crude jokes, but does an author have to bore us with petty inanities just because children might do them? I don't think so. I mean, just because kids might pick their nose, sniffle constantly, or talk about ponies for hours, doesn't mean we have to put that in writing, does it?
