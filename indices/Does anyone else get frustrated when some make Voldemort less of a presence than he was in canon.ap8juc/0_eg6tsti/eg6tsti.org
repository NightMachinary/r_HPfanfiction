Posted this in another thread, but it's relevant.

Good Tom Riddles are so hard to find in fanfic.

Sturgeon's Law is in full force there. 95% of Riddlefics have psychotic maniac Voldemort (though to be fair, that is canon!Voldy, which is also a boring, one-note EVULZ character) or, on the other side, a smirking, palette-swapped fanon alternate of Draco Malfoy.

Hardly any fics show what how brilliant he's supposed to be... Even canon made him look like a complete dumbass.

However, holding the Idiot Ball and acting like a dumbass /is/ part of Voldemort's characterization, based on how he acts in canon. But in canon, he has enough magical feats and inventions to suggest he's not a drooling dunderhead. In many fanfics --- and shipping fanfics are the greatest offender of this --- rarely have enough magic to make up for the Idiot Balls, so the characters feel even stupider than normal to me.

In fanfiction, characters become their fanon representations, with dumb jokey Sirius, Ron who can't talk without spilling food out of his mouth, Potion Queen Ginny, or Luna the nympho seer chick. In fanfiction, when authors want to make the villain a believable threat, fanon Tom Riddle/Voldemort becomes a character with Informed Intelligence. And if there's anything worse than intentional bashing, it's accidental bashing --- where what should be a clever and talented character has as much presence as a flobberworm.
