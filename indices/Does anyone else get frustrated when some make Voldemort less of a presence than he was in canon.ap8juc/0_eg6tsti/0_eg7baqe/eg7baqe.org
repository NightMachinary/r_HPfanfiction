I remember a Harry time travel fic where Voldemort's tactics changed shortly after Harry's return and Harry couldn't explain it. It made Voldemort more dangerous and Harry's future knowledge wasn't as useful as he had thought it would be.

Harry himself was the reason that Voldemort changed. Voldemort saw Harry's skill rise inexplicably fast in a such a short time that he had come to the conclusion that Harry had absorbed the horcrux and gained Voldemort's knowledge. So Voldemort adapted himself under that assumption. He learned new things, changed how he operated under the assumption that he would have to defeat someone who was effectively his past self.
