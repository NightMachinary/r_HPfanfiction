I have actually been surprised by the amount of good Tom Riddle and Voldemort fanfiction out there. While reading the books and watching the movies I have considered Tom Riddle/Voldemort to be a boring and mostly forgettable villain.

Lately though I have felt my opinion of him really changing for the better because of fanfiction. A lot of my favorite fics happen to feature him as a major character and really made me enjoy reading about him. He is evil, but also quite clever, cunning, manipulative and interesting to read about.

Some examples of where I liked him are linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom), linkffn(Harry potter and the accidental Horcrux), linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus), linkffn(Rectifier by Niger Aquila) and linkao3(Diablerie by oceanbreeze7).
