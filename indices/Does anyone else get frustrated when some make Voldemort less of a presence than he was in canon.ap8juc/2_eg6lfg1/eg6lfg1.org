Honestly, I get where you are coming from, but other than the final battle and killing Lily/James, Voldemort isn't really dangerous in canon. Harry escapes the Graveyard after a few seconds of torture and a mock duel, Umbridge is the one who runs the magical genocide and tortures Harry more often, Bellatrix is the one who tortures Hermione and kills Sirius, Malfoy is the one who leads the Death Eaters into Hogwarts and the "power of love" repeatedly defeats Voldemort.

Don't get me wrong, the silly names for Voldemort are stupid and most people wouldn't say his name, but he is not the worst "roadblock" of the series. Harry could have killed him with ease in his camp and figured out what to do with the Horcruxes. Hell, the whole Battle of Hogwarts in canon is just a slugfest of incompetence on both sides. Umbridge and Bellatrix Lestrange cause more danger for the protagonists than Voldemort does.
