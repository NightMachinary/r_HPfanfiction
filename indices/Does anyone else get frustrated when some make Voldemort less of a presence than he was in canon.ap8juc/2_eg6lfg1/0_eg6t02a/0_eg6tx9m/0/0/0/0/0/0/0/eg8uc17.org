You're giving Hermione and Molly far too much credit.

Hermione shies away from killing two random Death Eaters in Tottenham Court Road. She tries using a blasting curse on the snake rather than something more lethal. She runs away from Yaxley even though they outnumber him 3-1.

Molly, well, the only reason she wins that duel is because of the nerf (BL is unable to put away three teenagers). When you're so enraged that you're practically frothing at the mouth (like Molly is during that fight), you're not in any position to walk straight, let alone fight and dodge.

Even disregarding that, she only used the Killing Curse once, and only because Fred died. Under different circumstances, she'd not be able to do it.
