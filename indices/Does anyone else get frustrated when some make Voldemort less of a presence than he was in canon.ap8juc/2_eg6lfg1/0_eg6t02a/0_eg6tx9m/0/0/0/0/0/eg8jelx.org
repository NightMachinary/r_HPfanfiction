The wraith form is shown to be intangible, and can escape pretty easily.

When he gets away and recovers enough of his strength, all he has to do is possess a witch or wizard, repeat the ritual they perform in the graveyard, this time with literally anyone who can be called his enemy - and just kill the victim at the end instead of trying to make it a spectacle.

Once he recovers his body, it's only a matter of time before he has followers again - Voldemort can easily gain legions of followers just from the Imperius curse. If all goes according to plan, all he needs to do is to kill HP and others who know of his horcruxes when they go about their normal lives and make those deaths look like accidents.

Voldemort had to be continuously nerfed throughout the series just so HP and the rest could stand a chance at all. A more realistic approach would have them get massacred.

This is kind of hard to do when one side does not believe in killing.
