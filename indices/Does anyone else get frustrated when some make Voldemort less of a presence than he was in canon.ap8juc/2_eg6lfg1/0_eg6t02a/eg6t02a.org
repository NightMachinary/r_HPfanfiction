  Harry could have killed him with ease in his camp and figured out what to do with the Horcruxes.

That's just patently untrue. Voldemort was one of the most powerful wizards in Britain at the time. Albus Dumbledore was the only one that was able to match up to him in a confrontation, and by the end of OoTP that felt like it wasn't true. Amelia Bones and Emmeline Vance were considered two accomplished witches and he killed them as well. The idea of killing Voldemort in his "camp" is ridiculous.

Voldemort isn't conventionally human. The Horcruxes essentially anchor his soul to the living realm and his body is a sort of magical construct. So a bomb could blow his ass to smithereens (not even going into the nature of magic and how it matches up with muggle weaponry) - but his soul would be anchored to the living. Even if you eliminated all of his horcruxes, his soul would still stick around. Like Hermione was talking about in DH, killing Voldemort is about killing the soul, not killing the body.

You can't find Voldemort's camp. I'm going to assume that we're both referring to Malfoy Manor which is just as protected as Grimmauld Place. It's unplottable (for sure) as well as covered in a wide set of protections. Like Grimmauld, the only way to get in would be at the invitation of someone else. Now, it's even further possible that this invitation would have to be genuine and not coerced. Magic is funny like that.
