Lord Voldemort was never implied to be a psycho terrorist. He was a dictator, in some sense. Calling him a psycho terrorist just seems so lazy, uninformed, and seems less impactful over all. It is just a less creative version of ‘Moldyshorts'.

The issue with both Tom Riddle /and/ Lord Voldemort is that he suffered due to the author being unable to write a genuine antagonist. Voldemort /had/ to be incompetent so that Harry Potter, the saviour, would win. Tom Riddle was a genius, an implied powerful wizard, and a deceptively charming young man. All of this vanished when Harry Potter came into the scene with his, I do not know, +100 Plot Armour modifier.

First of all, people did fear saying Hitler's name, but that was due to different reasoning than what made everyone afraid to say ‘Voldemort'. You go say Hitler to someone who fought against his forces in World War II or someone who had someone killed by his orders. Adolf Hitler, to this day, still has people who worship him, fear him, and respect him. Genghis Khan, and I assume you mean Ceaser, were a different breed and were before any of our times. It is, arguably, ancient history. Hitler, Mao, and Stalin are all different cases.

I assume if the Taboo Curse was used in the second Wizarding War, I assume it was also used in the first. However, it may not have and people may have feared saying his name because it showed disrespect. If we go by canon, Lord Voldemort had almost won before he was defeated by Harry Potter. That is grounds enough to avoid angering someone who had no qualms about slaughtering an entire family with no remorse.

You do not have to do it, correct. It is /your/ story that you are writing and no one has any grounds to tell you how to write. On the flip side, you have no grounds to tell anyone else how to write.
