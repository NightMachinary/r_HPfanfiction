I don't change his threat level as a psycho terrorist, but I do always change that stupid "You Know Who" stuff because it's just stupid and silly. I mean in real life there's Hilter, Genghis Khan, and that Caser guy, all people who were like a thousand times worse than anything Tom Riddle did, but nobody ever freaks out about saying all of THEIR names. We NEED to say them, to remember them, so we can learn from them.

Not to mention nobody ever was terrified of saying Grindelwald, so why randomly does Voldemort just get that effect on the world?

It's just stupid and makes no sense. So I never do it.
