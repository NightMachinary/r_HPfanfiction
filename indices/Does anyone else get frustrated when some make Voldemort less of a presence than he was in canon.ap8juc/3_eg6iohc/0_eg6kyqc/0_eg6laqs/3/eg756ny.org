First of all, this post is insanely disrespectful and you should feel ashamed. How disgusting. How dare you speak to someone like that because you are having a mental breakdown and seemed to forget that varying opinions exist? The worst thing is that your name is familiar and I am almost positive you made a new account or left the subreddit because of people bullying you. Now you are doing it to other members? I have no respect for you at all. Any sympathy I had for you has long vanished.

You used assumptions and half-baked ideas as your â€˜canon'. J.K never stated /why/ Voldemort was feared. We can only assume, which is why most people lean towards the Taboo Curse or the fact that he slaughtered entire generations of families and people are afraid to invoke his wrath.
