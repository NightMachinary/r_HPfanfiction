That same user defended Hellstrike (the person being bullied) in the past against bullying from other people.

  I've reported your post for targeted harassment against Hellstrike. You're supposed to be some big name here, some community pillar, so act like it. Don't act like a bully. Or is that the real point of you? You think you're so big and cool, with everyone knowing about you and looking to you in this community, that you think you can do whatever you want? Treat people however you want? No. You can't.

  You lay off Hellstrike.

And back on topic, the Taboo curse was never mentioned pre-DH, so we don't know if Voldemort used it back in the first war. However, we shouldn't it put it past the Death Eaters to torture or gruesomely murder people (and their families) if they publicly insulted Voldemort, or even talked about him disrespectfully. That would be enough to make people afraid to mention Voldemort by name, Taboo or not.
