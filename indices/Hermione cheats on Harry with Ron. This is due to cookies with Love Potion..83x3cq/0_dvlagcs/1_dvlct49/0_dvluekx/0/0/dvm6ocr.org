It was basically the underlying view of the fic seemed to be "Your girlfriend you were about to propose to lost her virginity involuntarily (rape) thus it is OK to dump her.". Or to put it more harshly: The main person wronged by the rape was the boyfriend/girlfriend of the victim.

And I wouldn't even of had a problem with it if it was a single characters view or if it was portrayed as morally questionable or whatever. It isn't even that this fic is an argument that this is the right thing to do, it is merely accepted as background that this is how the world works.

I was really really really not ok with that.

I have more details in my resonse to [[/u/AutumnSouls]]
