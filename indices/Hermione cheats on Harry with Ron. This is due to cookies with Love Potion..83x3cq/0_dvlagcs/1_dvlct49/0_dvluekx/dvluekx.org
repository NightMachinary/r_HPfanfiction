I don't think I've ever rage-quit a fic like I just did this one. I have pretty think skin and usually tolerate the troll fics and seriously bad stuff long enough to get bored or laugh at it or stop for other reasons, but this one made me want to print out the fic so I could burn it.

I mean damn, people really think thinking like the characters in this fic is ok?
