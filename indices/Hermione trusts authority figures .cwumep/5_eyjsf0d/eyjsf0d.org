Does anyone else think this could be a function of her middle class upbringing? Her parents were both educated professionals and had time to indulge their only child. Perhaps snagging I discussions about the news, politics, labor, money. Her parents were authority figures, but by all accounts were beneficent parents (and mostly absentee due to boarding school). Maybe she was just raised to ask questions and receive answers. She seems pretty typical gen X to me.
