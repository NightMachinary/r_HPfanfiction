I think this is because it's a bit problematic when you include a character who is a lot like you and this is what Rowling did. To me it feels a bit like she didn't want Hermione to change because at least I personally think that it's difficult to admit a character who is like you actually needs to develop. But if you get others to exclaim over her willingness to break rules in nearly every book, you can sort of pretend it's development. I don't believe she has changed all that much throughout the books. She is the same know it all and rule breaker she was in the first book. And if the narrative states that,'oh even Hermione is ready to break rules', you sort of get the feeling it must be really bad.
