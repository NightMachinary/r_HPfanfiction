Hermione's trust in authority figures is very overrated by fandom. Who does she blindly trust after the first book? Lockhart in the second? But this was an obvious crush, not belief that adults know better.

She trusts Dumbledore, but not any more than Ron or Harry (who has more personal reasons to distrust him, but doesn't).

Hermione believes that rules are there for a reason, and follows those she considers rational and useful. These rules throughout the books are mostly about work ethics: do you homework, prepare for the exams, don't cheat with a strange potions textbook. That's pretty much the extent of it. She has no problem defying authority and breaking the rules if she thinks she's in the right.
