I think one way to square this (other than noting that most people exhibit a certain degree of internal inconsistency in their thoughts/actions) is to say that /because/ Hermione takes positions of authority quite seriously, she feels justified in taking drastic actions if she feels an authority figure is using their power inappropriately.

Look at her reaction to Umbridge:

#+begin_quote
  “/How/ can Dumbledore have let this happen?” Hermione cried suddenly, making Harry and Ron jump; Crookshanks leapt off her, looking affronted. She pounded the arms of her chair in fury, so that bits of stuffing leaked out of the holes. “How can he let that terrible woman teach us? And in our O.W.L. year too!” (OotP, Chapter 13)

It goes past just disliking or even hating Umbridge; she's righteously outraged that such an awful person has been allowed to hold such an important position.

It's a similar story when she set Snape on fire. She believed (wrongly, though understandably) that Snape had tried to kill one of his students; at that point his being a teacher goes from being in his favor to counting against him:

  “Rubbish,” said Hagrid again. “Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do nothin' of the sort.”

  “So why did he just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione.

  The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.

  “I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them! You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw him!” (PS, Chapter 11)

With the Polyjuice Potion, there's no specific authority figure she's against, but I think the subtext here is that she (as a Muggleborn student) doesn't feel that the staff is doing enough to protect the student body, and therefore breaking the rules is acceptable in pursuit of accomplishing that goal herself:

#+begin_quote
  “Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine,” she said. There were bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual. “/I/ don't want to break rules, you know. /I/ think threatening Muggle-borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion. But if you don't want to find out if it's Malfoy, I'll go straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back in ---” (CoS, Chapter 10)

Hermione fundamentally believes in, if not /the/ system, at least the idea of /a/ system. Allowing a corrupt or incompetent authority figure to continue unhindered is a greater threat to the goal of a beneficial system than breaking rules to hinder them, as far as Hermione is concerned.
