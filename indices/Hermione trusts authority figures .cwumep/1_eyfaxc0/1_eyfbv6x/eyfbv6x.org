Oh yes for sure she has no issues being the one to break the rules and seems to know it. But usually theres a level of suprise like wow we wouldnt expect you of all people to be rebelious. Its not always blatant but it to me is seems like the later books want you to think its suprising or development that shes rebelling. Like she got less uptight about the rules. Except this was something that was already covered in the first book.
