Another reason for everyone to be so surprised might be that Hermione comstantly admonishes others for breaking rules and so they sort of expect her to be against this. She actually had to believe Snape was trying to kill Harry to be ready to set him on fire. She thought Malfoy was petrifying students and so thought it was worse than brewing up a difficult potion. So I assume for Harry and Ron it seems incredible she breaks rules because she seems to have a serious reason for this. Of course in the fifth book they shouldn't be all that surprised because it's not the first time she only needs a good enough reason to disregard the authority.
