I mean even that would be so bad on its own. But instead it seems every book she learns that not all authority figures are trusted and how important it can be to break the rules and does do just that without much hessitation. And yet both she and Ron and Harry and the narrative act like that chatacter growth never happened by the next book. And once again its oh wow Hermione is breaking the rules.
