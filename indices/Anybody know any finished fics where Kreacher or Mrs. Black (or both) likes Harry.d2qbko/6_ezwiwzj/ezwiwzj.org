Fem!Harry with massively exaggerated Dursley abuse (the first chapter) which leaves Harry mute. The first few chapters are bad due to that (mute character = no dialouge), but it gets a lot better once people start to learn sign language. Cracky as hell, but so is your premise. A good subversion of many tropes (WBWL, everyone hating Harry, IndyHarry, surprise sibling, OPHarry)
