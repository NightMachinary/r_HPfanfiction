It gets a lot better in fourth year with a proper reconciliation. No romance, mind you, but they get back to being best friends.

Which is one of the reasons I love this fic. It manages to spin the entire thing in a decent arc with a nice payoff and subvert a few tropes along the way. Which raises the question why a crackfic is the only one which manages this, but that's a different debate.
