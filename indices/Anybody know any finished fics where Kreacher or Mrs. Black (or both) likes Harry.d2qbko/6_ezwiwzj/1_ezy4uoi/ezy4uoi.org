This story is crushing if you like H/Hr...

The beginning seems like an adorable start to a relationship (in fact the cutest setup for Fem!Harry/Hermione that I have ever seen!), but Evil!Manip!Dumbledore decides Cassandra shouldn't have friends, decides to scare Hermione off, and successfully does it...

E!M!Dumbles should DEFINITELY NOT WIN at something like that!

It makes the sudden get together with Susan soon after feel wrong. It makes it very apparent the story was (by the author's own admission) written backwards from a triwizard where Susan was the girlfriend and Hermione was on the outs. (to be honest I don't know how the H/Hr friendship was at the start of the tri, I gave up before that.)

Then there's the boggart scene... Cassandra's worst fear is snapping and killing her friends, but when the bodys the boggart became are mentioned Hermione is not one of them, even though she was her first friend... That was when I stopped reading it...
