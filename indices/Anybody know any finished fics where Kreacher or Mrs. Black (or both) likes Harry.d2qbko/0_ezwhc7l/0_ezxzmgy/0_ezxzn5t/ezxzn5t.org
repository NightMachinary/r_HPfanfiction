#+begin_quote
  Kreacher is alone, his mistress is dead, his favorite Master is dead, the other has been locked away, so what's a house elf to do?In one reality, it's wallow in misery and failure.In this one, it's find the young godson of the locked away ungrateful master and try to raise him the house elf version of the pure blood way.It goes better and worse than he planned.
