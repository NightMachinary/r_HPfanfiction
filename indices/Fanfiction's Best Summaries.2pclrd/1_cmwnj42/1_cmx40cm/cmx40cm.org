We're approaching summaries with two different goals, then. You're trying to weed out what you don't like, and I'm actively trying to find new things that I do like. I haven't had your (from what it sounds like from reading some of your other posts) massive, immersive experience reading the length and breadth of fanfiction, which probably has a lot to do with my approach.

I don't think there's such thing as an inherently bad trope, only bad writers. And that, above and beyond anything else, is what I'm looking for - authorial voice. A storyteller. If a summary can hint that the author knows what they're doing, I'll give it a try. Of course I do have certain "filters" I'm more inclined to (a lot of them match up with yours below), but for me they're very soft rules.

Take /Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them/. The premise of that story really doesn't appeal to my internal filters. However, that author can flat-out /write/. I guess in the end, I'm looking to discover authors, not stories. If Inverarity published something with a summary that made it seem like it was going to be an inheritance/marriage law fic, I'd read the hell out of it. Because it's Inverarity, and the authorial voice is off the charts.

So, with /that/ in mind, I'm looking for a summary that provides some hint of that gravitas. I care less about what a story has to say than how it's going to say it.

Totally respect your way of looking at it, though. I suspect I'm in the minority.

Oh, and re: Applied Cultural Anthropology - don't the phrases "Harry never really had the drive" and "other Muggle-raised Gryffindor", compared with the giant picture of Hermione next to the summary, kind of give you a solid hint who's going to be the main character?
