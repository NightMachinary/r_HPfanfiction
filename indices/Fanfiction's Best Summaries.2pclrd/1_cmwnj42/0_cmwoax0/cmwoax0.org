To expand in a more substantive way, when I'm skimming a summary this is the check list my mind is going through:

1.  Are there any spelling, punctuation or grammatical errors? (If yes, discard)

2.  Harry centric? (If no, discard)

3.  Slash? (If yes, discard)

4.  At least 3000 words/chapter? (If no, discard)

5.  Polygamous relationships? (If yes, discard)

6.  If the summary features any of the words in Appendix A: Independent Harry, discard.

7.  If the summary features any of the words in Appendix B: Shipping, discard.

8.  If the summary features any of the words in Appendix C: Bad Magic, discard.

9.  Does the central plot only work with OOC characters? (If yes, discard)

10. Will Harry have greater agency than canon-Harry? (If no, discard)

11. Is there a plot? (If no, discard)

Any summary that can convey all this information to me in fewer than three sentences is a good summary. Essentially, summaries are my way of screening out the bad, not finding something good. Once I've screened out the stuff I know I dislike, I'll give the fic a try.
