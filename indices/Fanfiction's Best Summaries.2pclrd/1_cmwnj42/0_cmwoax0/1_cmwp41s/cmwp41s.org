Okay... I think our filters have a lot in common... but I must admit to not seeing the reasoning behind discarding if Summary.contains("Neville")

Specifically I don't think the summary mentioning Neville necessarily equates to a bad Indy!Harry fic. I mean... Neville is in other fic genres isn't he?
