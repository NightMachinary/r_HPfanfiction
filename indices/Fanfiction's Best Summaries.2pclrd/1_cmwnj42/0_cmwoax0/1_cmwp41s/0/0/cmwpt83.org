Okay, true. Ron and Hermione draw a fair amount of flak for things I'm not sure should be held against young children, some of my favorite fics do write Ron off in the manner implied above. I think this has more to do with my current interest in alternative sorting fics than any personal vendetta against Ron. Harry sorting into Slytherin does murder any potential friendships between Harry and Ron rather efficiently, at least during the early game. Discovering they both think Malfoy is a douche-canoe can always come later.

Edit: Completely forgot to make my actual point: I'm not convinced that Neville's (or Luna's) presence ought to be used to rule out a fic. Their existence in badfics doesn't mean they can't be present in good ones. Luna done right can be hysterical. Neville done right...

Also, I realize that I'm accusing you of using boolean if/then statements and processing like a computer AI rather than like a person... but its funnier to think of it that way for me.
