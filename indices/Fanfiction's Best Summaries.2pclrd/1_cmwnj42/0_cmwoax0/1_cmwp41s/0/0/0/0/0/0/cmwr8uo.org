Truth. The worst he can be accused of is basic negligence of his duties as a Headmaster in the sense that the stone shouldn't have been in the school to begin with. He had 'valid' overriding concerns/reasons given the implications of having Voldemort still be alive and needing to confirm that... but as a parent, school governor, student, etc its a perfectly legitimate complaint to levy against him that you don't want the man in charge of your children's safety to have /any/ higher concerns.

Edit: is negligence technically the right violation here? child endangerment maybe? not sure.

Also, it could be argued that he'd only be guilty due to the nature of the 'protections' since its mostly the whole 'having fluffy' in the school where a quarter of the student body is known for recklessness that would be cited. devil's snare is taught in first year herbology apparently, so its not terribly dangerous, and you'd /obviously/ play chess as the king.
