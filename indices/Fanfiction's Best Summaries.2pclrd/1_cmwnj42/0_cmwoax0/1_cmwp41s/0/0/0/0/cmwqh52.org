A fair point. I get suckered into the oddball indy!harry fic now and again on the notion that they aren't /wrong/ based on what Harry learns early on in canon... Dumbledore really is doing some very strange things and setting him up for something... but then the execution makes me imitate Picard and I have to nope out after page 1. People seem to struggle with the concept of a Dumbledore who isn't either always right, or always wrong. Landing in the middle where Dumbledore is still intelligent, but someone who you can have a legitimate disagreement with... is elusive.
