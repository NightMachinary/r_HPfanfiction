I always feel that people forget, re: early canon, that Dumbledore never forced Harry to do anything. Dumbledore didn't dump Harry in the Philosopher's Stone labyrinth, he didn't make Harry go after Ginny Weasley. Harry chose to do these things of his own free will. He could have stayed in his dorms both times, like any other kid would have.

Sure, Dumbledore allows Harry to see certain things like the Mirror of Erised. In doing so Dumbledore is doing the exact opposite of what people accuse him of: he is giving Harry options, but letting Harry make the final decision.

The manipulative Dumbledore camp is massively inconsistent on this matter. They accuse Dumbledore of negligence because he didn't protect Harry like a child, while simultaneously accusing him of manipulation because he didn't treat Harry enough like an adult.

This is what happens when you write fics based on a feeling of self-righteous teen rebellion, I guess.
