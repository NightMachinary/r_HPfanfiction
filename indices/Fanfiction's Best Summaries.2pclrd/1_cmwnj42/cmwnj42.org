I disagree with you as to the purpose of a summary. I don't think that it's there to seem compelling in and of itself. It's the fic's *content* which draws you in, not the summary. The summary merely informs the reader what that content is. If the fic content aligns with my preferences, I'll open the story. If it doesn't, I won't. And, crucially, if I can't tell from the summary if the fic aligns with said preferences, I won't open it.

This is because the vast majority of fics do not align. It's safe to assume that I'm going to dislike a fic unless it falls into my niche, and I think most readers do the same: there are very few people out there who like all, or even most, sub-genres of fanfic. We all have our pet likes and dislikes.

So a summary that leaves me without a good idea of what the fic is will be a failure of a summary, because I'm not going to open the story. It can be as artistic as you like, but if it's too vague I'm just going to skip right past it.

With that in mind, the purpose of a summary is to inform prospective readers, in as concise a way as possible, what the content of the fic is. A summary that's too in love with itself or trying too hard to be pretty will fail in this task, because flowery language and information density are diametrically opposed.

Incidentally, I also disagree on the topic of the summary of Applied Cultural Anthropology. If fact, the summary is one of the reasons why I quit the fic in disgust in the first chapter, because at no point does it tell you that this is Hermione-centric. The default assumption is that a fic will be Harry-centric; if you're going to do something different you have to tell readers.
