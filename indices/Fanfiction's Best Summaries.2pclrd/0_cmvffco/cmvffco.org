I can see why you dislike tags, but I think concerning fanfics they're a good idea. There are just so many fanfics out there, that adding tags really helps with the search if you're looking for a specific type of story (like many readers do) like dark!Harry, or Slytherin!Harry or whatever.

When I search ffnet and want to see if there's a new timetravel story, I'll use ctrl+F to look for the keyword "time travel" and connected keywords like "time", "sent back" etc. If they aren't mentioned in the summary I'm not likely to find the story without the tag as I'm not often in the mood to wade through hundreds of bad summaries just to find one good story. I don't think that the tags are a substitute for a good summary though. I'll look for keywords/tags first and then read the summary to decide if I want to take a look at the story.

I think when it comes to fanfics many readers have very specific preferences, some don't want to read mentor!Snape, some don't like dark!Harry, slash or certain pairings, and tags helpful there. Of course this gives away parts of the story, but with so many fanfics available, I think it's necessary. Personally I especially appreciate tags that state character bashing, I can't stand it and really don't want to waste any time reading stories like that.
