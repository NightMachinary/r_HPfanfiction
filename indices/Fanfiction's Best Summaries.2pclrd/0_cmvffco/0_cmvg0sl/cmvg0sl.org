I do see the benefit of tags, and I don't think people who use them are bad or stupid or wrong, it's just not what I'm personally a fan of. When I look for story recs - on here, DLP, or the TVTropes rec page, I don't mind if tags are involved in the recommendation, because, like you said, sometimes you're in the mood for something specific.

For the times when I'm looking for something nonspecific, when I'm just looking to be intrigued and caught up in a good story, I want that literary-type summary that's well crafted and hooks me in on its own merits, not the merits of this very specific fanfiction nomenclature.
