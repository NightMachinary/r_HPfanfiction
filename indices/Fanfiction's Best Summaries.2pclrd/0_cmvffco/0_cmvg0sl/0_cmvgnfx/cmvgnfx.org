yeah, I get that too, but for me often it's just too time consuming to read through all the summaries in search of a good one. So tags help me reduce the number of stories I go through but I'll probably pass up on a few good stories that way. Hopefully I find those in the recommendations on other sites.

I don't really like it when pairing are tagged in the summary. I think it adds something to the story if I'm in the dark for a while and can try to guess solely on basis of the writing who will end up with whom. Of course with so many readers disliking specific pairings or looking for stories with specific pairings it makes sense to reveal it in the summary or an A/N.
