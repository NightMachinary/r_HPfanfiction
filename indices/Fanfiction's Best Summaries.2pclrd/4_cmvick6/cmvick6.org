  He remembered being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a creature borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold, dead things. He is only the 2nd son of the King, a spare, but that changes when things rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming... but magic is might.

I don't know...this seems really generic and clich√©d.

Also, it should be "better" not "rather". An odd thesaurus mistake. Rather indicates personal preference in choice, an extent or a quantity, or a person's agreement, not a preferred overall result in a generic sense.

  "...when things *that he'd[or some]* rather *were* left in the dark..."
#+end_quote

also works. /Someone/ has to "rather" something. So no points there for pure English composition chops.

But anyway, where's the actual hook? Where's the story going? Why should I care? Is this some transplanted characters soulbond fic with GoT overtones and Daphne as a /literal/ queen of ice, or something truer to either setting? Will we see Ron in Westeros fighting for the throne? Petyr Baelish in Hogwarts, teaching DADA to Harry?

Holy shit. Wait a sec. I'd read the *fuck* out of that last one. Someone needs to write that.

But I digress.

It seems more like this is a personal preference for the crossover setting than a truly qualitative analysis of the content of that specific summary. The other two are good, great even, but I'm not sure I agree with /why/ you put them forward, especially as this example totally lacks those aspects.

This summary says almost nothing about what the story is /actually about/, really. I want to know more, sort of, but maybe not enough to click on that link. It's bordering on purple prose, really. Which I guess is as genre appropriate for GoT as a gala ball out of nowhere is in Harry Potter. Doesn't make it good writing, though.

I'd rather have something actually useful, like (again, I assume without clicking):

  He remembered being Harry Potter. The 2nd son of the King dreams of it, along with other cold, dead things. Winter is coming... but magic is might. Crossover, set in <book period>. AU Westeros, OCs, no Hogwarts character crossovers. Good!Misunderstood!Aerys. Wizard!Tommen. +Major character death.+
#+end_quote

I guess that last part is assumed.

Compare this one to your other examples and see how it totally misses obvious action and setting information. "Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition" doesn't actually say anything we didn't already know. It would be like saying, "Hogwarts is again full of magic and wonder".

We know. That's what Hogwarts /is/.
