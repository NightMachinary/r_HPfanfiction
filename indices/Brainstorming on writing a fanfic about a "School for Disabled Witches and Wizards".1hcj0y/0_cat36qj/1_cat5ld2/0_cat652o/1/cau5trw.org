They already did "magic addiction" in Buffy the Vampire Slayer when Willow kept going to this dark magic crack house or whatever and turned evil because she liked feeling the power. That whole story arc was pretty lame IMO because it did not develop her character, did not even explore the ethical or moral implications of having a good character turn evil. It was just a special-effects laden picture of addiction that ended up being too derivative of real life.
