The thing is, I see magic as a means of achieving an end. Being addicted to magic in and of itself is just meaningless to me, you could replace it with any other addictive substance and have basically the same story. If Willow had gotten addicted to actually DOING something with her black magic, that would have been different. For example, if she used it to hurt people, or commit crimes, then it would be a truly dark story instead of just one with a bunch of special effects.

I believe the farthest she ever went to get another high was to bring Dawn with her into the house where she got high. It was not extremely clear what was at stake.
