Yeah, addiction story lines always seem a bit forced. I put this down to the person being the junky playing the role how /they/ think a junky would act, instead of what junkies actually are like in real life.

Add magic to that and your gonna end up with a whole lot of meh. I assume in the case of Willow they were trying to make (dark) magic feel really good to use, plus the power trip, and that this was the addictive element of magic. It that way Willow sort of #/slipped/ into addiction, which was why it never got too heavy. Full on heroin junkie Willow would have been interesting but waaay to tragic for one of/the fav'd characters of the show.
