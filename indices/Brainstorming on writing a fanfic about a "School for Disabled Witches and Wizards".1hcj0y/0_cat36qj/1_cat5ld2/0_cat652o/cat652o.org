That's a very large spectrum, and I would be wary of physical impairments as we've seen that wizards can enchant prosthetic and even recreate bones and limbs, they even cured the common cold.

In that sort of vein, I've always sort of seen wizards as largely above the physical plane of us muggles due to magic. For example, there is greater (human) race and gender equality because if you have access to magic the precursor to the original cause of inequality (strength and power) is removed, particularly if you stick to cannon magic principals.

What I would find interesting and I think would be more of an issue for the wizarding world is magical forms of impairment, and the effects neurological diversity on magic e.g. how high-functioning autistic wizards use/learn magic, dyslexic magic or even magical dyspraxia. You've also got things like magic addiction, ocd spell casting etc.

I have a bit of experience in fields of disability being dyslexic, a disability studies academic and working in special schools, so if you would like a co-writer if you like? I could help you explore some of the issues that being magical impaired might have. You'd have to stand my spelling and grammar of course ;)
