Ok, well, if you want to write about a marginalized character, you have the central conflict right there, and also the beginnings of a plot.

Here are places where you can introduce conflict (and thus develop the plot):

- Main character has difficulty getting accepted to Hogwarts because of discrimination, and almost doesn't get in. Maybe include a scene where a school official talks down to her because he doesn't think a student with her disability "would be able to keep up" with Hogwarts classes.

- Main character has trouble making friends. Maybe she is blind and the other students look right through her because they don't know how to interact with a blind person.

- Main character might have issues with the floating staircases in light of the fact that he/she uses a wheelchair.

- If you're going off of the regular student experience in the HP books, you may as well add more depth and intrigue to a preexisting villain. For example, maybe in your fanfic, it turns out that Salazar Slytherin had a disability, but was good at hiding it to protect his reputation and his image (sort of like FDR). And then your disabled protagonist learns more about him and realizes that she has more insight into that villain's motivation and thought process than most people, because they share that disability.
