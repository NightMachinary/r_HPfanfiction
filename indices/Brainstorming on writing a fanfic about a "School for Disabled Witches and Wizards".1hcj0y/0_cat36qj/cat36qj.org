You need a plot before you can decided anything else. For example, what are you classing as the impairments these disabled wizards have, cognitive? physical? magical? remember they are wizards a lot of the impairments we would consider debilitating may mean nothing to some. Moreover, how are these wizards going to be treated? I cant imagine it would be at all well considering both the time period and the wizard treatment of those they consider lesser.

For accommodation I'd look at the old English institutions and then magic them up somehow. I thought 'plausible' question was pretty funny , these are wizards anything is possible.
