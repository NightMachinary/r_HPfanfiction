The idea of a "school for disabled witches and wizards" raises a lot of questions. In the real world, or muggle world, you do have schools for the blind, communities of the deaf, and special-needs classrooms - all examples of times when students with disabilities are separated from other students. But that separation in and of itself (separation between "normal" students and "disabled" students all lumped together) is kind of problematic, because many people who are blind or have a physical disability or something like dyslexia would actually be better off integrated into mainstream society, where they could progress at a faster pace, and get more preparation for the real world, than in a special needs class that might have to go very slowly to accommodate those with mental disabilities.

So in light of what I said above, I would actually prefer reading a story set at Hogwarts that features some disabled protagonists (with some supplementary assistants, guide animals, and extra classes) than I would a story set in a completely segregated school.

Other brainstorming ideas:

- we are assuming that magic cannot cure these disabilities, otherwise they would not be disabled. And we already know magic can completely heal broken bones. If magic can cure anything else, that eliminates disabilities in that area.

- A paraplegic or quadriplegic wizard might be interested in out-of-body experiences, where the consciousness can be cast out during sleep to spy on people and things

- People with disabilities might be able to do certain things that would be more difficult for students without disabilities. One thing I have heard blind people say is that when your sense of vision decreases, your other senses increase over time. So a blind person usually has enhanced senses of smell and hearing (possibly even using echolocation) and enhanced sensitivity in the fingertips if they use Braille. You could run with that idea by creating a magic specialization that is easier for people with enhanced hearing or touch. Some kind of magic that is cast through music, perhaps. Or you could say that in an Ancient Runes class, blind people are at an advantage to become expert in the field because they are not distracted by what the runes look like, and can be more in tune with the magical properties of each one.
