Magically forced to do it somehow, a third party in the war tries to recruit him (Gray Jedi? Snoke?) and succeeds. Maybe he could meet an alternative, bitter Ahsoka who wants to destroy the Sith but also wants revenge against the Jedi? Could be a setup for a pairing. Maybe he meets the Jedi and realises how corrupt they are. If you want a Beta, I'd be willing to help, although I appreciate that this is obviously at an early stage.
