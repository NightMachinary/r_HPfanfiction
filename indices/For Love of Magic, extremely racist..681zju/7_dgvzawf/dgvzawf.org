Since when are Muslims and Christians RACES? It may be anti-religious (which IMHO is pretty good, this world is supporting religions too much as it is by handing the religious advantages (certain countries even say that all atheists are terrorists and lock them up!) and privileges (in Germany students are forced into religous studies classes and if they don't want to attend, then they have to take ethics class which is always at very inconvenient times (almost never at the same time the other students have religous studies!), not to mention that religious studies class is more than biased in favor of Christianity!) - despite them causing some of the biggest problems of our times: Terrorism and wars! Without religions there would be no Muslim terrorists!), but:

IT IS NOT RACIST!

ps: Blacks, Caucausians, Asians etc. - those are races! (or rather - IMHO: Sub-Races, because all of them are HUMAN!)
