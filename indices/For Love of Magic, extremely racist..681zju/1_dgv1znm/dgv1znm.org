I haven't really read much of that story just for the reason that the smut and rune magic completely threw off the pacing and general feel of the entire fic for me. In regards to the chapter you linked i don't think it's racist but rather the author seems to be forcing his religious views on the reader and using Harry as a mouthpiece.

It's actually rather cringeworthy to read but it's their fic and they can do what they want.
