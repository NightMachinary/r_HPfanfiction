The story just states a characters opinion on religion, keeping in mind that the story is set in a fictional world where a completely different set of rules apply. The author could be-planning on having harry be right. Your complaint is stupid and invalid. For all we know in the next chapter harry could find out that the all the monotheistic religions were wrong but the polytheistic ones were partially correct. you have to keep context in mind.
