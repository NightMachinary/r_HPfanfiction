I thought that term Drarry is used only for slash fics, and people usually just say Harry and Draco friendship, but I might be wrong. Most stories I know are Harry in Slytherin fics: linkffn(8666085), linkffn(6518287), linkffn(9622538), linkffn(3446796), linkffn(12022253) and Out of the Night by Raining Ink
