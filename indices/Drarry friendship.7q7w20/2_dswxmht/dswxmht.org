I enjoyed The Redemption Series by FarenMaddox. I read them out of order, and it really does make a difference! [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3662420/1/Save-Me][Save Me]] is the first one, followed by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3701756/1/Brothers-and-Sons][Brothers and Sons]], and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3801134/1/A-Foreign-Language][A Foreign Language]]. Three shorter fics finish off the series: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3934136/1/A-Few-of-Our-Favorite-Things][A Few of Our Favorite Things]], followed by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3975880/1/I-Am-Gryffindor-s-Daughter][I Am Gryffindor's Daughter]] and finally [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4020080/1/Until-the-End][Until the End]].

I loved the series. The exploration of relationships and what family really means was both heartwrenching and heartwarming at different times, and the storylines really drew me in.
