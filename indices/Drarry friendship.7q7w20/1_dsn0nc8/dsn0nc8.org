  It was all because of that stupid diary Draco had found when he went his mother to visit 12 Grimmauld Place. If he hadn't started reading it then he wouldn't know about this Padfoot and he definitely wouldn't be questioning everything he had been taught since he was old enough to listen. He definitely wouldn't be standing outside of Harry Potter's house. That damn diary.
