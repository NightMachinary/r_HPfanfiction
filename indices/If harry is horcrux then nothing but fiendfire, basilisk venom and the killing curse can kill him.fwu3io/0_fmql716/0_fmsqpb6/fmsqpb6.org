Exactly.

  “Yes,” said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails, “because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them. From all that I've read, what Harry did to Riddle's diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.”

(DOH, chapter 6)

Dark wizards *have to make* [additional] *enchantments* on them. Which makes for my one of my plots: perhaps what Harry had in his head was true Horcrux (or perhaps not), but certainly Voldemort had no opportunity to make these additional enchantments when he was semi-dead after hitting Harry with the Killing Curse. So, perhaps, this was the only Horcrux which could be removed from its vessel without its destruction?
