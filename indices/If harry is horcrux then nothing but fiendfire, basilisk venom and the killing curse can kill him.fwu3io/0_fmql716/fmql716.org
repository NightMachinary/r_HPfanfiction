This is a misconception; the protections which make Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes impervious to all but Fiendfyre and Basilisk Venom (and there is no confirmation that even the Killing Curse would work on one of the "object" Horcruxes) are essentially separate enchantments, even if there's some textual evidence that they're added to the objects as part of the Horcrux ritual.

What I mean is that becoming almost invulnerable isn't an automatic effect of being the vessel of a soul-shard, it's a different magical effect. So Harry Potter, as an accidental Horcrux, probably /isn't/ invulnerable; Voldemort's broken soul-shard happened to attach itself to him, turning him into what is /functionally/ a Horcrux, but no ritual was performed.
