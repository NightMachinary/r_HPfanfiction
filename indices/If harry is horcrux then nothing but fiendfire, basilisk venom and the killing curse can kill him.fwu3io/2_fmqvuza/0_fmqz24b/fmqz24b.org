I could be mistaken but just touching the philosopher's stone wouldn't do anything. You can use the philosopher's stone to make the Elixir of Life. It's the Elixir of Life that rejuvenates you and extends your life. Also from canon you need to periodically drink the Elixir of Life to continue living. So it isn't a one shot and you're immortal.
