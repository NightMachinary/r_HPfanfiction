Another of note is Deadwoodpecker's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With Purpose: Always and Always]] (and sequel). It has a few moments of fluff, but has plenty of drama and angst. Excellent writing all around, one of the gems of the fandom. Post-Hogwarts, time-travel.

At the risk of posting a self-rec, my (Perspicacity's) story [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]] may fit your parameters as a non-fluffy, "more realistic" Harry/Ginny novelette with a dark/horror theme. As a warning, the story is told in third person, present tense, which puts some people off.
