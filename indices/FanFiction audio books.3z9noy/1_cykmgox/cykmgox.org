If you haven't run across it yet, let me point you toward [[http://www.audiofic.jinjurly.com/][The Audiofic Archive]], a project that originated on LiveJournal and has grown since then into an entire subculture of amateur podfic readers and listeners.

Based on the history of that community, I'd emphasize that you /always/ need to ask permission of the authors - and don't expect everyone to agree. Lots of fic writers cringe at the idea of their work being read aloud and recorded in a way that's outside their control, especially by people with no prior experience and often very little skill.

And under no circumstances should you go into this expecting payback. People do this for love, not for money. Don't even expect comments - podfics probably get the lowest rate of return of any fanworks out there, and many, many fans dislike them and plug their ears in secondhand embarrassment.

I don't want to discourage you, because it can actually be a blast to dip into the whole recording process and interpretation of a fic. Some people get very creative with music and sound effects and emotional inflection. But you're not the first to come up with this idea, and fandom hasn't been 100% welcoming to it.

I've recorded a couple of podfics myself, and it was incredibly time-consuming and very hard to produce something I'd consider a tribute to the original story, not an insult. Also, you might want to check your voice quality on playback, because sometimes speech patterns, vocal timbre, and other qualities make recorded voices unpleasant to listen to - too monotone or sing-songy or nasal or whatever.

In other words, do this for fun and for yourself, not because you hope for back pats from the community. Many people /do/ like listening to podfics, and (although opinions on this differ) it /is/ a creative outlet, the sort that fandom exists to inspire.
