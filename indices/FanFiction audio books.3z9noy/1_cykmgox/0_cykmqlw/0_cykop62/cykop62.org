Um, I wasn't talking about the quality of the fic. The issues fandom has with recorded fic usually lie with the absence of any talent for acting or interpretation on the podficcer's part. You'll get rated on the quality of your performance, basically, wholly apart from the merits of the fic, which exists separately from any audio version of it.

So the fic may be "the highest quality" by your standards, but how you read it is the basis on which the podfic will be judged. If you're a crappy reader, it won't matter how good the story is.
