As a slash writer and reader, I am absolutely fine with this particular person staying far, far away from my favorite fics. Their whole approach to even the /possibility/ of recording other people's work is weirdly entitled, and the attitude of "I will, of course, accept only the best" and "I'll be doing fandom such a big favor that they should consider paying me for it" isn't exactly the spirit in which I'd expect great results.

Especially when other fans have been doing this for years without turning it into a superiority contest or expecting remuneration.
