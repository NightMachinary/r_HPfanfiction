I don't actually think you're being homophobic, dude, you're being a bit melodramatic. It was just awkward phrasing, and like other posters I was just a bit confused about you going on about 'best quality'. I do think if you're not doing this for money you need to stop defending the concept though. If that's not the motivating factor, then surely it doesn't matter what others think either way.

Best of luck with your project, I hope you have fun with it.
