What bandwagon? You do realize the whole IP protection/infringement/legality/uneasy truce between original authors and derivative works issue has been a topic of discussion in fandom for years now? If not, welcome to the imbroglio.

Yeah, I doubt JKR or WB would even be aware of your existence (that's not an insult, btw), so you, personally, would be safe. And JKR is on record as tolerating fanfic. But the border between fair use and fanworks-for-profit is contentious and unclear and potentially bad news for fandom if creators get nervous about content trespass.

I don't think anyone here was pretending to talk for all of fandom or even for this subreddit. We all shoot off our mouths (or keyboards) on our own behalf.

My ... crowd? I don't have a crowd here. I stop in occasionally, and I doubt most of the regulars recognize my name when I pop up.

Gender equality? Oh, come on.

  One of the best fics I want to read, and what got me thinmjng about this was Emperor, by Marqis Black. I must have read it 4 times by now.

Okay, now /this/ makes sense to me. If you'd just said this, I wouldn't have been so skeptical. Because all that "best" stuff just comes across as boasting. Seriously, nobody sits down and announces, "I think I'll spend a bunch of my time recording some truly awful fanfic" - unless it's for laughs, I guess. But saying "here's this fic I hope to make an audio version of because it's bloody fantastic" - well, that might have perked up a few ears and stirred up interest and support.

  The community does, contrary to your opinion, agree on what is best
#+end_quote

This community? Yeah, could be. Regarding certain fics, perhaps, although the favorites threads can be a mixed bag. All of fandom? Eh, I doubt it. Frankly, I couldn't get past 2K words of Emperor myself. I had no idea who this character was but it clearly wasn't Harry, the daughter's character didn't grab me, and so on and so forth. Not that it was bad, but it wasn't my cuppa, and it would never make a "best of" list for me.

But that has no bearing on /your/ pleasure in it or your opinion of it. The only reason I'd think twice about saying "Do it" is because the fic is really bloody huge. It took me two weeks to get a half-decent mp3 of an 8,000-word fic, and Emperor is over 600,000 words long. Good lord. That would be quite a tribute.
