  Gender equality? Oh come on.

That's what I said. Read what you and others in that thread wrote, and the perfectly reasonable comments you downvoted. Gender equality was the best phrase I could think of when confronted with "why won't he do my slash?!" crap.

As for Emperor, the first chapter was a flash-forward, after all said and done. Of course it wouldn't be canon Harry Potter (not that it was to begin with). How could it be?

And while it may not be your cup of tea, it is undeniable that Emperor is a /good/ story, even a great story. I cetainly think so, regardless of the AU. Perhaos because of the AU. And, if you gave it a chance past the first chapter, you might agree with me.

The novelty is in seeing a Harry Potter that isn't cannon, and in fact is far removed from anything I've seen so far. The grandiose plans and humble begginings, the vivid combat scenes and life-like characters are what makes the story.

My point is, you might not be a fan, but one can't deny that this is indeed one of the best fics out there. Mind you, this isn't as high praise as you might think given the general gutter-trash nature of FanFiction in general.

Seems like every prepubescent girl and boy wants to write their Draco/Harry or Snape/Draco. /shivers/
