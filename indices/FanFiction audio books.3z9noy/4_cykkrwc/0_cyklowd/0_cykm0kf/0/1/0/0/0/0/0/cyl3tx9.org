I'm not particularly interested in a Harry Potter so detached from canon. And no, I don't have to agree it's a great fic. It doesn't appeal to me, and while I don't entirely rule out the possibility of giving it another try, I'm not going to praise or condemn it on another reader's say-so.

  Gender equality was the best phrase I could think of when confronted with "why won't he do my slash?!" crap.

  Seems like every prepubescent girl and boy wants to write their Draco/Harry or Snape/Draco. shivers

I see. So much for trying to have a conversation with you. At this point, you're just trolling. And while I didn't think you were homophobic before, merely tactless, you seem determined to change my mind.
