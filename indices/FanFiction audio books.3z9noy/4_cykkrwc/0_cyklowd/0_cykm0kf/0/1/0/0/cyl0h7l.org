Yes, I scoff at their points, because idiocy deserves to be ridiculed. Something that Reddit as a whole overwhelmingly agrees with me.

Ironically, it's the slash/IP crowd that went on a downvote brigade. Whatever.

As for me wanting to only cover the best, of course it's my bloody opinion on what that is. I am sure you would want to devote your time to only those fics you thought were exceptionally good, e.g. the best. I don't see where you have a problem here. Nobody, including me, wants to hear someone read a 300 word shoddily-written love poem about Harry x Dobby.

As for talking about money, I didn't say a word about it. It was not me who brought this up. Do not tell me that if you were in my position and someone A) accused you of having ulterior financial motives (ludicrous, given the medium) and B) pretended like they talk for all of fanfictiom and are a legal authority.... Don't tell me you would ignore it. Because it is bullshit.

I don't see what your point is, and it seems to me you are simply jumping on the bandwagon here. In fact, half the comments have been derailed by your needlessly "concerned" crowd now, for the sake of being contrarian and under the guise of Fanfiction's greater interests, or gender equality, or some such rubbish.

Edit- as for my motivation, it certainly isn't fueled by a desire to get a couple bucks in donations. I have a job, you know, and I would be better served working overtime. One of the best fics I want to read, and what got me thinmjng about this was Emperor, by Marqis Black. I must have read it 4 times by now. That is the sort of story I consider to be the best.

The community does, contrary to your opinion, agree on what is best- or at the very least what makes up a great story. Vital elements such as good prose, a genuine dialogue, a rich plot, and adequate length are qualities admired by everyone.
