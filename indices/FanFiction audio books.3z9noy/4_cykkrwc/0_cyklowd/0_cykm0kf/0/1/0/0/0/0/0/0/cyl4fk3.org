Yes, you actually do have to admit it. You might not like the purpose a building serves, but if it is designed well and and better-looking than 99.9% of the slums around it, then yes, you do bloody have to admit it.

Scroll down through the "new" category in ff.net and read some of the stories there. It's sad.

Do I need to link you to a couple of examples of the god-awful writing inwas talking about? It won't be hard. Ff.net is packed with that garbage.

If it makes you feel any better, crappy Harr/Ginny or whatever goddamn pairing you pick can be awful as well. Yet you can't deny that there is an obscene amount of terrible slash which is terrible, moreso than any other category.

Way to pull out the homophobe card. Again.

Just when I thought we were having a civil discussion, you regressed to petty name calling.

I'm done here. Happy New years.
