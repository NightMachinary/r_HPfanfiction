I didn't say you were a homophobe, dude. I said I was glad you were staying away from fics I love, because your attitude doesn't convince me you'd do a good job of podficcing them. The fact that you don't like slash is a relief in these circumstances.

I don't have a problem with your reading preferences, not that my opinion means anything because obviously I have no idea what your preferences are, and that's fine. Re: "superiority contests," I'm not talking about slash, I'm talking about "only the best," because I've never run across a podficcer who uses that criterion.

At this point, I can't quite figure out why you want to record fics, because you haven't said a single thing about how much you love various works or authors, or about showing your appreciation through the act of podficcing. Which is the motivation I'm used to seeing.

Who gets to decide what "the best" is, anyway? How do you judge that? If you want to get embroiled in that can of worms, go for it. It just seems weird for an amateur narrator who hasn't given any proof of skill in the recording arena to talk about only "the best" writing being worth your attention. You're a hobbyist in a community of hobbyists, talking to people with a whole spectrum of tastes. Why not just say, "There are a bunch of great fics I'm itching to record so people will have a chance to hear them." Even in a relatively homogeneous community such as this, assuming we all agree on the "best" fics is ludicrous.

If it's not for money, then stop talking about taking money. You're not going to get much anyway, and you already know that. But you're scoffing at the points about IP and copyright violations that other people are making, and that really does make you sound self-centered.
