What?

I thought about doing this as a side hobby. How in the world is me wanting to only read the best stories a superiority contest, and what is wrong with me choosing what I read in my free time? I don't have a problem with your preference. But your preference isn't universal, and I don't see why you have trouble understanding that.

"He doesn't want to do slash? He must be a homophobe!"

Please, grow up.

And where in the world did I say I expected remuneration? I never said that, nor do I expect it.

For the last bloody time;

THIS. IS. NOT. FOR. MONEY. People aren't itching to get into the lucrative market of FanFiction audio books for the fucking money.
