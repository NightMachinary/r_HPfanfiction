I think a couple people here, including you, are misinterpreting my motivations for this as monetary.

I only mentioned in response that I would accept donations if, for some reason, someone wanted to do such a thing for me.

It was actually quite amusing to see the guy that brought it up miss the point so beautifully, and it is this: if I wanted to make money, there are far, far better alternatives than this. Furthermore, some here don't know the difference between a donation, and payment for services. I have to admit I chuckled when it was said that me accepting donations would have lawyers hounding me, and FanFiction brought down.

Anyway, this isn't for money, and frankly after recording myself reading and listening I'm not sure I've got the voice for it. I'm not high pitched or anything, but it's definitely not the Morgan Freeman-esque voice that people would love to listen to.
