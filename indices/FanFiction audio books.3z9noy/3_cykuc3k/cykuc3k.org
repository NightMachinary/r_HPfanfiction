Well, getting monetary return on your time will be almost impossible. Youtube will be impossible for you, since most good authors will hate you for profiting from their work and put copyright infringement notes up for everything you upload. Most great authors reside in the DLP forum and if you have ever seen the hate for less wrong over there, then you can be absolutely sure that they will band together and do whatever they can to stop you from using their fics. If you want to make some pocket money, do other youtube stuff instead. I've heard prank videos are all the rave right now.
