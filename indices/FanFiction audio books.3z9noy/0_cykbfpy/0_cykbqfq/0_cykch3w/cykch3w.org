I object vehemently to any money making, patreon and donations included. Not only is the secondary market of dubious legality--even though JKR has given implicit permission, the other IP owners could take authors to court--but now you want to get paid for tertiary works? That's a good way to get the whole thing shut down permanently.

Not only would you be gaining revenue for use of JKR's primary work, something which is illegal according to Copyright Law, but you'd also be doing the same off the fanfiction author's work, which is also illegal. I highly doubt any authors are going to be willing to allow you to use their works for money, especially not those who have published original works, such as Jim Bernheimer and Joe Ducie.

Even if you're just covering investment in better equipment and not your time, it's still generating revenue off their works. That is against the law, the tacit agreements between JKR and fanfic authors, and every bit of common sense and decency. If you want to make audiobooks for money, go get a job doing that for original works.

edit: I really hope [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3z3h9w/make_money_off_of_fanficiton_writing/][this]] isn't you. Either way, I'm sick and tired of people trying their best to ruin this amazing thing we've had for the last 17 years.
