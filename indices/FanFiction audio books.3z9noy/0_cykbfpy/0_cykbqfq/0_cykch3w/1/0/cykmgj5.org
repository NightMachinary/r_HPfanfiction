Their net worth means absolutely nothing. What matters is the law, and several copyright cases (and similar patent cases for that matter) have been decided by what essentially comes down to "defend it or lose it". If they don't defend their rights as copyright holders, then they could potentially lose that copyright.

Again, what we have now is an uneasy truce. With Harry Potter IP coming back into mainstream media with the new movie, there's a chance they could again go through looking for things they don't like and shutting them down. They have enough time and money to come up with a precedent setting lawsuit against patreon/donation funded works that edge or outright violate the law.

I'm not concerned with how much you might have to shell out for a lawyer, I'm concerned that they might take it so far as to revoke their permission to publish fanfiction, and that they might win in court over it.

And agree to disagree? No, you and that other guy and several others are coming into our hobby and doing your best to fuck it up for us. I've already lost a significant portion of my ability to play around with quadcopters this year due to ignorant assholes breaking very clear laws, I really don't want to lose another hobby. You want to enjoy your time here, you do it our way or you get the fuck out.
