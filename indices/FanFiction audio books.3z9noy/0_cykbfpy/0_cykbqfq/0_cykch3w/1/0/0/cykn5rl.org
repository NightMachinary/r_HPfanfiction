There's no law against donations. Furthermore, nothing will happen to you or anyone else. You completely missed everything I wrote.

As for being in this community, wanting to 'come in and fuck this up for you', please. I've been part of this community for the better part of a decade. Get off of your high horse- you have no ground to stand on with your arguments, and you can't claim to speak for everyone here.

Honestly, it is like a child who discovered the existence of lawyers, and now sees lawsuits and violations everywhere.

The law, let me remind you, exists for our protection. That is the only purpose government and law serves. Please tell me who I am harming by accepting donations- NOT CONTINGENT ON CONTENT. Even if there was a law against donations.... Which there isn't, then this is well within the spirit of the law.

And regardless, it would be my problem of there were legal repercussions, which I greatly doubt. No one is going to spend thousands of dollars and hours of time filing and going through with a lawsuit against someone online accepting donations from the couple dozen people who read, listen, and enjoy. The most I would get is a cease and desist order.

In short, this is none of your business. As the English would say, you can bloody sod off.

Edit- and the idea that Rowling's and Warner's copyright would be in danger, or that they would feel threatened by my 100 person audience and the $5 I might get for hours of work is laughable. Do you even realize what you are saying?
