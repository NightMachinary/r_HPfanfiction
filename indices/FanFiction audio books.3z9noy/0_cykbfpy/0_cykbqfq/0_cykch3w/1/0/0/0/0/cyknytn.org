When the hell did I say that I would *expect* donations, much less explicitly or specifically for audio books of FanFiction? All I said was I am not against having an open-donation policy sometime in the future- and anything I get would go straight to making more quality content. This just shows that you didn't actually read anything of what I said, but skimmed to the end to get your bit in.

I already addressed your ridiculous points about IP and lawyers. All it shows is that you have all the legal knowledge of a child.

Telling me to fuck off? Please. How about I tell you to fuck off, as I already did? Perhaps you didn't understand what "sod off" means.

It means fuck off.

Regardless, I'm done wasting time on you.
