You literally said multiple times that you'd expect donations based on producing audio books of fanfiction. That's clearly contingent on content. That's clearly harming HP IP. "Profit" is misleading, which is why I use the term "revenue". it doesn't matter if you're operating at a loss, you're receiving money and that's what important.

The tone I speak in and the way I tell you to fuck off might not be how everyone would tell you such, but ask anyone here and they'll tell you they wouldn't want you profiting from this either, nor do they want lawyers pawing around even if it only means so much as a C&D.
