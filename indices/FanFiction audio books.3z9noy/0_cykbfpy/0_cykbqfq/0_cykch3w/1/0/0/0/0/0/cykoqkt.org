Your insistence that law doesn't matter is proving you a child much more than me, but go ahead, keep calling names. I've been directly involved in two lawsuits and indirectly involved in a third due to copyright infringement, so no, I don't have any idea about the law or intellectual property. I'm just bullshitting to annoy you because I have nothing better to do with my day.

For someone who has been around so long, you seem to not recall the large number of times WB threatened lawsuits against fansites and derivative works, and how they very nearly took Norm Lippert to court and did take hplex to court. But yeah go ahead and shit all over the agreements that were made.
