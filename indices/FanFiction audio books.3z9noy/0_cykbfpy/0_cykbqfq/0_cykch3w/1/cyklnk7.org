I have to beg to differ there, then. If I was to set up something like a patreon, it would be on a donation-basis only. Not only do I doubt I would get any money at all, but anything I would get would go straight to resources to make it better for the fans, which is what they would donate for.

I get what you are saying, and it's ridiculous to see people on patreon who have it set up as "100 for every 3k chapter" or some such rubbish.

Perhaps I wasn't clear, but no content would be exclusive or made for the express purpose of profiting from. FanFiction is already niche enough, and this would be a niche of a niche.

This just isn't a feasible way to make money, regardless of how you look at it. If I wanted to make quick bucks, I wouldn't set up a system where I spend hours recording and writing for /maybe/ a couple bucks (literally) down the road. I work as a freelancer in several feilds- trust me, there are better things I could be doing for the money.

That being out of the way, I very much doubt that I am hurting anyone if I actually do manage to make someone's day enough for them to donate. Rowling is filthy rich, and companies like Warner are huge. I am not selling their work- nor would I be making a derivative of their work for money. I am not hurting anyone's profit margins by having an open donation policy for this very niche section.

I suppose we can agree to disagree.

edit- and yeah, that isn't me.
