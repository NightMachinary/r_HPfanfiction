Just: ditto. And to the OP - don't f*ck up the fandom for us pretty please and don't get yourself in trouble with the law. Many people do have audiobook versions of their fanfics - for free only though without any kind of voluntary payments involved whatsoever. The only way I could see you make money is making your own website, getting something like google adsense and distributing your audiofiles for free there - might be a grey area. But dont take my word for it - better not do anything stupid. Cheers!
