One thing I know for sure is that "I'm still here" isn't abandoned, they(its a duo, ish) just take a while to write the chapters, and they update all of their stories roughly the same time, and they're usually massive. There's a pretty similar story, if you wanna scratch that itch, called From Ruin by GraeFoxx, both on Ao3 and FFN. It diverges quickly, but pretty much the same premise.

I also know that HP and the BWL from Santi has more chapters that weren't published on FFN, and they are on DLP forums, though uneditted. Never read them myself, because I don't know how to navigate in that forum.

Everything else I only know its abandoned, and no idea if someone adopted. Sorry.
