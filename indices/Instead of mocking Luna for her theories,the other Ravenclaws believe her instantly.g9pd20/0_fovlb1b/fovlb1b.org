I would read that. It could spiral, driving all the other houses mad as they keep searching more and more insistently for all the creatures.

Voldemort, hearing about the seriousness the other Ravenclaws treat it as, immediately changes his plans.

The conspiracy about aurors trying to bring down the ministry leads to him ordering his death eaters to make massive donations to the DMLE - After all, they'd need to become strong enough to defeat the minister's army of Heliopaths. Then he could come in after both sides had exhausted themselves for easy conquest!

Perhaps he hires the Goblin nation to find Luna's creatures - surely some of them could be used in his war, and as the Minister devours their race in pies (so that's why he's overweight!) they should obviously be willing. And why wouldn't they take gold to search for something that might not exist? They get paid either way.
