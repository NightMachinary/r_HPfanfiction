Huh? Wouldn't that be misandrist if you believe there to be no good male authors?

Anyhow...

One of my favorite authors is male: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2918348/Stanrick]]

So is LeadVonE I believe: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6791440/LeadVonE]]

I'm pretty sure nonjon is male too: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649528/nonjon]]

... and so is Bobmin: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/777540/Bobmin356]]

Another consistently decent to good male author: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1634726/LeQuin]]

I'd be surprised if Clell identifies as female: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1298529/Clell65619]]

... same goes for sprinter1988: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2936579/sprinter1988]]

Conclusion: There's plenty of great male authors.
