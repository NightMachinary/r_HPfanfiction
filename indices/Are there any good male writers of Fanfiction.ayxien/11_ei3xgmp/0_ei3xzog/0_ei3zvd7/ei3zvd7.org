I haven't quite finished it, I gave it a rest after a particularly irritating a/n, but going back to it it seems like a typical super!Harry thing with a haram. I guess it's sort of creepy that he starts screwing everyone when he's like 12, and the thing with the teacher. I'm mostly glad it's not McGonagall. Other than that, which parts did you find outlandish?
