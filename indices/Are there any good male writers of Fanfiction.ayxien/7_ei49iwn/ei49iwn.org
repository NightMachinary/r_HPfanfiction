I believe that Silently Watches is male, and his world-building is generally exquisite, and his characterization not far behind. The Black Queen series, while an unbelievably dark world, is a masterpiece. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4036441/Silently-Watches][Silently Watches]]

The other truly impressive male writer that comes to mind is Ebenbild, as yet another world-builder. His /magnum opus/ I think has to be Basilisk-born. linkffn(Basilisk-born by Ebenbild) While the story has some grammar issues I believe can simply be written off as English not being his first language, the world he constructs within the story is even more complex than that of the Black Queen series, with a more complete history behind it. The way he links so many things together is incredibly impressive.
