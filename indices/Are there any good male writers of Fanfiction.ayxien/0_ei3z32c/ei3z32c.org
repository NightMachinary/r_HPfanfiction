Unless an author mentions it in an author note, how/why would you even know?

I think the author of my favorite fic (like grains of sand in the hourglass) mentioned he was male. Or that he had a wife (which doesn't necessarily mean anything). Or something in one of his author notes. I think. Again, it doesn't really matter :P
