You can try these male authors:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/][Starfox5]] always writes strong female lead characters. He likes Hermione so much that he often engages in arguments related to her with other sub members.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/116880/][Lord Silvere]] is very good with female characterizations, such as Bellatrix in “Delenda Est”, Ginny in “Para Bellum”, and Susan Bones in “Final Protocol”.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1227033/][Marquis Black]] is the author of “Emperor”. I'm very impressed with his knowledge in history, politics, strategies, and wars.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/][Northumbrian]] is the author of “Strangers at Drakeshaugh”. His massive postwar Series is very worth reading, and often recommended here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/943028/][BajaB]] wrote “Harry the Hufflepuff” and “Dark Marauder”. You should give them a try.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1229909/][holdmybeer]] has only one fic, but an excellent and very often recommended one: “The Sum of Their Parts”. He put his writing on hold for the time being because his wife gave birth a few months ago.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2139446/][arturus]] is a very good crossover author. There is no misogyny whatsoever in his fics, and “Gods Among Us” is one of the rare gems that feature original plots in other universes.
