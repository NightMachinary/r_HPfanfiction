Good is subject to opinion but here's a list of my personal favorites. I'm just going to start listing off the top of my head. I could be wrong on a couple of these but I read so much fanfic it's hard to keep track. Keep in mind that I know for a fact some of these authors are no longer active and in a few cases are actually sadly deceased.

Chilord, MSgtSilverDollar, temporalknight, bobmin, nonjon, jacobapples, whitesquirrel, oldcrow, lomonaaeren or however it's spelled, darthmarrs, neale, knifehand, roff, dunuelos, selector, dz2, tlyxor1, sinyk, senawario, zaxaramas, tiro, robst, vonpelt, racke, erbkaiser, nigelcat1, ruskbyte, slimah, brennus, kevin1984, lordcartwright, jbern, nothingpretentious, theblackhand724. There are undoubtedly more but I'm too tired to bother completely trawling through my archive of stuff for them.
