There are dozens more but most of those aren't really realistic, regarding in Harry's powerlevel, the world, or their relationship.

If you want more romance, the best of the bunch (from my recs, there are a few really good that has been suggested in this thread already) is The Legacy, because of how real and likely it seems. Also, great fucking writing and world.
