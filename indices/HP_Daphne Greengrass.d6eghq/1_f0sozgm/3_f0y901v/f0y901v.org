Good Days and Bad Days - pretty representative of the quality of fics lately, in my opinion. Not bad, but definitely needs a lot of help. Dialogue is goofy, characters are just mindlessly following the author's direction to fit the story (rather than feeling like they're actually people. Etc.

I feel like the author is trying a bit too hard to be 'realistic' as well, rather than write an original story, it feels like they're trying to write something to fill a gap.

I gave up on it in the 2nd or 3rd chapter I think.
