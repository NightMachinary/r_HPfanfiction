Not gonna lie, despite it's prevalence Harry/Daphne stories, by and large, aren't good.

Imo, some of the better ones are Linkffn(surroundings) Linkffn(contractual invalidation) Linkffn(a game of style and brutality)

Might also try Linkffn(a champion's new hope) Linkffn(to be loved) Linkffn(to be queen)
