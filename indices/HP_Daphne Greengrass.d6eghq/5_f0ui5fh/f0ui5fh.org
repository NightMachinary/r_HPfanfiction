There were 2 Harry x Daphne stories that I remember that the relationship did develop over time.\\
I'll have to go through my reading history to find others that might fit your critera.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12484195/1/Saviour-of-Magic]])\\
Very long story, AU from the start. Starts when Harry is around 7 years old. Ravenclaw Harry.\\
The Harry x Daphane relationship spans over many many years so it should be a more realistic relationship as they get to know each other and progress further into their relationship.

The story has 2 major arcs, first 1 arc from Chapter 1 to Chapter 40.\\
The 2nd story arc from also in Chapter 40 to the last Chapter 59 (60th is just an Author's Note).\\
Rated M for mostly Language and Violence. 391,000 Words / 59 Chapters (not counting the AN Chap 60).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12155794/1/Honour-Thy-Blood]])\\
This one takes place starting in the graveyard after the 3rd in Harry's 4th year.\\
The Harry x Daphane relationship does build up over time here too (although less time than the above story).\\
Rated M for Language and Violence. 307,000 Words / 20 Chapters (21st chapter is another AN).

Both stories might have characters a lilttle AU (especially the first story).\\
There will be a few new OC's for each story.

Edit: Accidentally linked the 1st story to chapter 59 instead of Chapter 1. I just fixed it.
