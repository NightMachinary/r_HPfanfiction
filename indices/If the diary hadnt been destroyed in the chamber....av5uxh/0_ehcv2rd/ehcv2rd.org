Ginny never survived. The destruction of the Diary merely forced the soul fragment into Ginny. The Ginny we see in the Books is the resulting merger of the Diary Tom and the original Ginny. She (he?) has the memories and powers of both, and this secret might be the reason why canon Ginny suddenly becomes so awesome.

Later, her (his?) skills are very much responsible for their lucky escape from the DoM; her airtight magical contract is the key to DA's safety during Year 7; and her killing of large number of Death Eaters during the Final Battle prevents a collapse of the defenders. During her duel with Bellatrix, she holds back a little too much and is almost hit by a killing curse. But alas, Molly takes over and finishes the job just fine.

After the war, she continues to use (guide) the Trio to advance her cause, while playing the role of a popular athlete herself. From time to time though, she needs to kill and torture some pesky enemies just for stress relief. Twenty years later, the Trio does indeed make it to the top, and she can happily rule behind the scene. Both Tom and Ginny should be proud of her achievements.
