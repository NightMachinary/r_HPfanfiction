Oddly enough, almost all of the fics in which the Diary gets a body have him team up with Harry rather than try to kill him.

The plots typically go a couple different ways:

- The Diary intuitively understands that There Can Be Only One™ Voldemort, so he tries to hide from the main soul with the knowledge that attempting to fight for dominance would be futile.

- The Diary fails to realize that There Can Be Only One™ Voldemort, so he helps the main soul to resurrect. He soon learns, to his chagrin, that the main soul is a massive berk who wants to stick his horcrux back in a safe (disembodied) place where it belongs. Inevitably the horcrux rebels and coerces/persuades Harry to help him take down the main soul.

- The Diary tries to take over where the main soul left off, but he soon wises up to the fact that at 16 years of age he lacks the requisite power boost from obscure magical lore and the leverage to keep his evil minions in line. He eventually forms an uneasy alliance of necessity with the main soul to achieve their common goals.

- Through a freak accident the Diary winds up stuck in Ginny's body. Horror and/or comedy ensues.
