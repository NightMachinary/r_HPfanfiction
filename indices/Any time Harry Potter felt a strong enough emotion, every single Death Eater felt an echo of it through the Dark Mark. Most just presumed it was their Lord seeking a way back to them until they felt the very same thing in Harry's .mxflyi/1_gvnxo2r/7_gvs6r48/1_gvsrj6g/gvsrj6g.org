Right but that's more sex-based-ritual-excorsing-Horcrux like in “Banking on Her” by RobSt linkffn(7392700) not that much torturing-Voldemort-through-sexual-pleasure, which is what I was after. Actually, thinking about it this torture (without stepping to the level of eliminating Horcrux) happens in “Reign O'er Me” by cts linksiye(3555), where I think even “torturing Voldemort” or something like that is an euphemism for Harry snogging with Ginny (by the way, a great story even without this element).
