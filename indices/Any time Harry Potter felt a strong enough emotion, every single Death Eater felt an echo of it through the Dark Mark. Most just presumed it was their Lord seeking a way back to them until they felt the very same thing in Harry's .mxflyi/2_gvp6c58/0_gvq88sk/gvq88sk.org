I was actually thinking a slow buildup that starts during Harry's pre-Hogwarts years, where over time he learns to internalize all his anger at the Dursleys, only for said anger to be relayed to all the Death Eaters via scarcrux fuckery. Then whenever anyone with a Dark Mark has an encounter with Harry that pisses him off, they'd know it instantly from the stabbing pain in their arm.
