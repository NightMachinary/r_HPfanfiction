Hmm. Is she straight? Usually she's paired with Fred or George, sometimes I've seen her paired with Neville or Ron. In a very infamous fic she was paired with Cedric, but it made no difference to the story. Most fanfic writers decide to make her gay and pair her with Ginny, and occasionally Hermione.

Are you planning a time-travel fic? I've also seen her with Remus (not my thing but it's an option), Grindelwald, and basically anyone you'd like
