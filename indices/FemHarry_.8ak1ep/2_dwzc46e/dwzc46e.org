Are you planning on keeping her otherwise the same, so (barely) raised by Dursleys, Girl-Who-Lived, sorted in Gryffindor?\\
If her character would be close to the canon Harry, you're pretty much limited to Gryffindor only as Harry is not shown to associate with the other Houses at all.

Or wait for fourth year and make her the girl Krum takes to the ball.

If you're going to change things about her character other than the plumbing, you have more possibilities but make sure you're not going to just make her an OC in Harry's place.
