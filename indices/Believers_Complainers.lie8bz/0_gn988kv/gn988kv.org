I don't know the answer but I hope someone else can tell both of us, because I'm curious too! Also I'm not sure which list reddit has me as a part of.

What I have noticed is that other subreddits use a two sets of number format as well, but with different options, so the mods must be able to personalise it. On [[/r/britishproblems][r/britishproblems]] for example, they have numbers for either Cold cups of tea or Broken biscuits, which is just as confusing!
