My vote is for any non blank character. Luna, Tonks, Cho, Pansy, Bellatrix, Narcissa... While blank slate pairs can be good to fill the blanks in an otherwise shipless adventure fic, I think a story where a pairing is central works better when the audience at least already has an idea of the personality behind the love interest. Otherwise I feel like you'll end up making up a lot of details.
