You could go with Parvati. They both are in the same house and went to the Yule Ball together, so there is some past interaction. She is often depicted in fanon as an airhead, but she did join the DA and fight in the Battle of Hogwarts. Since she seems talented at Divination, she can help Harry come to terms with the prophecy. This may make her more knowledgeable about rituals and such.

I think the relationship dynamic would be quite different, and it would definitely have to be a slowburn.
