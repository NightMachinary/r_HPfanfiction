Lavender - Make her moderately more serious, she wants to be a reporter hence her gossiping ways, what better way to cultivate contacts than as kids at Hogwarts. She still gives out stupid nicknames but their more for private time kinda like Mollywobbles than the Won-Won/Lav-Lav Incidents. Harry still being Harry desires love and Lavender is willing to grant that unconditionally it seems, Both characters in Canon love Hard even if Lav's is kinda childish.

Su Li - We Know little of her but rather than giving her some grand over arching backstory, she could just be the daughter of some low level diplomat. Where she fits she is much like Harry she is assumed to be intelligent due to being in Ravenclaw and being the child of someone with little power in a dark time would push her to desire more power thus her helping Harry along, a relationship springing up out of close quarters is almost expected.
