I listen to Stephen Fry's audiobook alot, and his voice for Susan is just terrible. She had a lisp and sounded like she has some sort of mouth disorder. Granted, she's mostly just an extra on the books and I think that's how Fry treated her character. I had to shift my view of her abit when I got into ff (like you said, red haired, stacked)
