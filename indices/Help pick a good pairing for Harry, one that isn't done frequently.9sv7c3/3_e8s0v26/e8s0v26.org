Susan Bones:

- She's mostly a blank slate, meaning you can do whatever you like with her character wise.

- The few canon facts about her provide more reasons than other blank slates for her to be interacting with Harry: her membership of the DA, her Aunt being senior in the Ministry, her uncle Edgar and his family being killed by Voldemort.

- While she's frequently featured in harem fics, there are very few Harry/Susan fics so you would still be breaking largely new ground.

- Most readers of fanfic will already have a strong image of her in their minds as she has been fairly uniformly depicted in the fandom (red hair, stacked).
