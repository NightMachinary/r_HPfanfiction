How about Harry/Fleur? (To few of those out there IMHO!)

To spice it up:

She is the one interested in Harry (and Harry is clueless at first, especially since he hasn't dated before etc.) :)

Why would she be interested you ask? She seems to like men who live dangerously (Bill is a cursebreaker and making mistakes in that line of work is probably pretty dangerous, not to mention that tombs might contain more than wards, mummies and treasure (Guardian creatures/enchanted statues (like that Terracotta Army!) etc.)) and Harry is the target of Voldemort and he killed a freaking basilisk and he warded of tons of dementors!
