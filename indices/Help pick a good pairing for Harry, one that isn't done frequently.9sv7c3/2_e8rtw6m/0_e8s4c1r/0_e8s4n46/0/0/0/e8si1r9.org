I try to avoid overpowered characters as much as possible (with the exception of Dumbledore and Voldemort), even if that means reviewers who complain that Harry is not pulling Hollywood worthy stunts all the time (in a different story). To me that makes the characters more relatable than Lord Black BigDickington Potter with his haren.
