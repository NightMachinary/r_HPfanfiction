Tracey Davis or Astoria Greengrass perhaps? I always see Pansy or Daphne for Slytherin girls. Lisa Turpin for Ravenclaw? Hannah Abbot from Hufflepuff? Alicia Spinnet or Katie Bell?

I'm partial to Harry/Luna myself personally. Maybe a somewhat more jaded and wiser Luna?

If you want something more unusual. Maybe Professor Sinistra or Vector? Make them on the younger side for a professor and set it a few years after DH?

Maybe Tonks? She's only six years older than Harry and since you're going AU you can keep her alive.
