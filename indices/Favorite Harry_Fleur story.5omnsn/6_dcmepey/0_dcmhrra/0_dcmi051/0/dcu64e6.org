So rather than depend on James and gain strength from him she goes off and found comfort with Remus instead. Highly unlikely when Remus isn't always present when he has to go and cozy up and spy on the other werewolves. I think it was poor writing on jbern's part as an attempt to have drama on the story. Plus what son wants to know, and in Harry's case, see and remember his mother cheating on his dad. That is really fucked up.
