The Weasley Twins situation was written as a throwback to James' own school time and how a harmless bit of fun can quickly escalate into something worse. The twins look up to the Marauders so it isn't that farfetched that they fall into the same issues.. But yes, it was the weakest point of the story.

I actually liked the Remus/Lilly part. It showed that their relationship wasn't perfect after they got together, canon and a lot of fics act as if they never had any issues after James grew up and they got together. But they were in a war, they were young and their entire lives were thrown off the rails because they had to go into hiding.

Their dreams were suddenly out of reach, their son was seemingly destined to fight against the Dark Lord and their friends were dieing around them.

Really, it's surprising something like this didn't happen. I at least suspect there were some major fights while they were hiding.
