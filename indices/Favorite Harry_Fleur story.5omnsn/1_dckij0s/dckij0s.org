Linkffn(What you leave behind) is probably my favorite one and it doesn't even pair them before the writer went on hiatus.

I like it because they orbit each other, but Harry is too young to understand his interest. Fleur also has proper characterization. Her snobbery is played off Harry's snark/sarcasm to great effect.

Linkffn(I'm Still Here) also seems to be heading in a H/F or H/multi and is /also/ on hiatus. Fleur's interest in Harry is justified in the narrative, rather than your typical soulbond nonsense.

Linkffn(Letters) takes time to develop a connection between Harry and Fleur before any romance occurs. I didn't finish it however. Still it avoids the soulbond that pollutes the pairing.

Linkffn(For Love Of Magic) has a Harry/multi thing going on but Fleur is a large part of it. Here she takes a turn at the 'Succubus' trope but the story holds itself together well enough.

[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/10191925/1][(How Fleur Delacour Seduced me]] is one of the better, smuttier ones, with good, if slightly OOC characterization.

Apart from that it's basically riddled with Greater Good Dumbledore, Harems, Soulbonds and Dark!Harry (read: Asshole!Harry).
