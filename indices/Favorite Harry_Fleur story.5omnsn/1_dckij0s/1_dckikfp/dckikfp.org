  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  Ruby wakes up in a forest with nothing but foggy memories and a letter on a scroll. As she begins to remember the world, she tries to piece together what happened to her, how the world has changed, and most importantly, who Weiss Schnee is and what she used to mean to Ruby; with nothing to guide her but letters from a missing heiress.
