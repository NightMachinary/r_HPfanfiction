You keep mentioning soul bonds as a negative thing, but it doesn't have to be. The idea of Veela latching on/bonding to someone /could/ be written very well and lead to some very tense and interesting relationships and plotlines.

It's just that no one has ever fucking gotten it right yet. I don't know how it's so hard to get that if you make a soul bond relationship perfect from the start, it takes all romantic tension out of the story.

Making the "soul bond" an involuntary one (or at least a situation forced by circumstance) is such a better idea. There's so much fucking potential.

If I wasn't an awful writer, I'd take a crack at it myself.
