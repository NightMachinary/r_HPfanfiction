[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11651647/1/Across-The-Time][Across The Time]] by izwan. /Summary: An opportunity comes along that will enable him to make the change and once again reunited with the woman he truly loved. But circumstances have its own plan. A sacrifice would have to be made that will make or break everything he work so hard for. This is the story. Attention:Time Travel. Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter and everything associated with it./

This is a time travel story of Harry finding himself in the past after passing away in his sleep. What I love about this is that Harry actually ended up marrying Fleur prior to him being transported in the past. And now Harry is conflicted if he should go after Fleur or not because of complications. One is that Bill is still alive in this timeline (Fleur married Bill first but he died in the war) Two is he's conflicted if it's fair for him to after the younger version of Fleur when he's in love with her older version. And three is that the method of his time travel might cut his time short once he completed a certain mission. The Flashbacks is really the Gold in the story as we get glimpse of their time together.
