  An opportunity comes along that will enable him to make the change and once again reunited with the woman he truly loved. But circumstances have its own plan. A sacrifice would have to be made that will make or break everything he work so hard for. This is the story. Attention:Time Travel. Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter and everything associated with it.
