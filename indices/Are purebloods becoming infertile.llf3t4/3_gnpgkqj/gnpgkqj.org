This naturally presupposes that fertility (and for that matter, genetics as a whole) works the same for wizards as it does for Muggles. Additionally, it assumes squibs are one outcome of inbreeding.

I am not sure this is the case.

The most we get on inbreeding is the Gaunts in HBP:

#+begin_quote
  “Marvolo, his son, Morfin, and his daughter, Merope, were the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Marvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor and poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son, and rather more than his daughter.”
#+end_quote

This is interesting and has to be read carefully. What it *doesn't* say is that "instability and violence" is a result of inbreeding. What it /does/ say is that the Gaunts /always/ had a tendency for "instability and violence", and because they married within their own family, they refined that trait.

This, by the way, is one of the reason historically for rulers obsessed with bloodlines (e.g., Ancient Egyptian Pharaohs) to marry in the family, they thought it would preserve and refine its traits. Now I have no idea why you wanted to preserve instability and violence, but that's the Gaunts for you. The point here is, with magic, that apparently works very well, and that's not even accounting for magical heritable traits like speaking Parseltongue.

And of course, notably absent in that quote is also any reference to Merope's lack of talent. And this makes sense: Far more than inbreeding, the #1 predictor of whether you produce a Muggle or a wizard offspring is whether you yourself are a Muggle or a wizard. Wizards and witches produce wizards and witches, Muggles produce Muggles (100% true, in fact, if you subscribe to "all Muggleborns descend from Squibs").

That their numbers will dwindle if they all have only one child is obvious, but there's no evidence to link that to inbreeding. Not least, because we see lots non-pureblood single children (Tonks, Lupin, Snape etc.). If we treat the Weasleys as an exception, you could make a better case for witches not being able carry many children (perhaps it's very taxing on the mother's magic?), or wizards and witches just being less fertile in toto.

.

So what we have is A) no clear indication that inbreeding has effects on the quality and the number of offspring, and B) a clear indication that it can be used to refine heritable traits. Given all that, I'm not surprised purebloods would marry cousins.

Tbh, with those odds, if I were a pureblood, /I/ would certainly look for a partner with a nice long magical family history, and also look at whatever nice heritable traits they have. It just seems to make a ton of sense?
