You are probably right about the inbreeding not being the cause of the families having so few children. But I find it very odd that so many families would have so few children, especially considering it would lead to depopulation of the wizarding race over the generations. It might be exactly what you said, and having children is taxing on a witch's magic. Considering Molly Weasley is able to go toe to toe with a witch like Bellatrix after decades of raising children rather than dueling and fighting, she must have strong enough magic to allow her to carry so many children with risking her health.
