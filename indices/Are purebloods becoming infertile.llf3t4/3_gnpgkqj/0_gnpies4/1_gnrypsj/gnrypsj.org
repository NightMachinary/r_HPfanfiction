We also know that Molly has a very... "motherly" figure. What if a lot of the standards of feminine beauty among the Pureblood aristocracy include narrow hips and low body fat? The former would make childbirth more difficult (especially if there's no magical equivalent to a C-section) while the latter would reduce fertility.

EDIT: Alternatively, there's the explanation given by "Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood" - the old families have their own secret/proprietary spells, and the Weasley magics are largely based around fertility.
