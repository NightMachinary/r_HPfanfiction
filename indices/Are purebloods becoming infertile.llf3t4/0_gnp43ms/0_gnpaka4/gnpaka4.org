  The only family of the sacred 28 specifically said to have one child is Malfoy

There's also:

- The Longbottoms, but they also didn't really have a chance to have more kids, whether they were willing and able to have more or not.

- The Crouches only had one kid.

- The previous generation of Lestranges had two kids, but the generation we see had between zero and one kids, depending on how/if Delphini counts. But it's also possible that they were planning to have kids once they won the war.

- While the previous generation of Blacks did have five kids in two families, none of those kids had more than one child of their own, and at least two had no children. But again, extenuating circumstances were involved.

Basically, I think that the low birthrate is probably mostly a side effect of the war that was going on.
