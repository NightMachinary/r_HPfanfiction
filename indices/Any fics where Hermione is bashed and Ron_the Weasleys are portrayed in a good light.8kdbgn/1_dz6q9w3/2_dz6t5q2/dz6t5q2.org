I don't know if loyalty is the right word. I'm not sure what is but to me her actions in the third book aren't loyal, well intentioned yes, but not loyal. Her going behind Harry's back to the teachers about the firebolt was motivated by her concern, it was for a good reason and Harry wasn't listening to her but I think her actions could be seen as a personal betrayal. She sticks with Harry through anything, she does all she can to help him (outside of the odd bit character assassination in the 6th book) but I don't know if loyalty is what I'd call that. Dedication maybe? Concern?
