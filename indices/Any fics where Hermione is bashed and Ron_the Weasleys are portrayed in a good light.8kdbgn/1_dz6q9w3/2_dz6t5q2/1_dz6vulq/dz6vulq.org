You wouldn't follow someone through hell and back because you are simply concerned. Neither would (platonic) love fit here, given that love alone won't stop you from abandoning others (see Lupin).

Dedication, well, maybe. But isn't dedication just another form of loyalty?

Also, the firebolt business had them aged 13 and 14, so not really the best time for mature decisions. And really, the whole mess was a lose lose situation. It is obvious that Harry is dismissive of her arguments/theory so trying to tell him beforehand would not have changed much. I mean, he barely got used to the concept of Christmas presents and now Hermione asks him to give away the best one he ever received (the cloak doesn't count as gift). That would not end well either way.
