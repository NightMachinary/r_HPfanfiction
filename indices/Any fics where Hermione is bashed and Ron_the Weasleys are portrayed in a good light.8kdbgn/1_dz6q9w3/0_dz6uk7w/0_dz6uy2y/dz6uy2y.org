She was at the headquarters of a paramilitary organisation, which is not the best place to throw a fit against authority. Given the amount of "adult" oversight from +chief hypocrite No 1+ Molly Weasley, mail screening is a realistic conclusion. And no one else wrote Harry either, following Dumbledore's orders as well. Not Sirius, not Ron, no other Weasley...

I did not claim that she was attractive, although it is said that she cleans up nicely and is not hideous either.
