Treating Hermione like a goddess is bashing her. The one defining character trait of Hermione was her undying loyalty to Harry, to the point where she set teachers aflame, led Umbridge in a Centaur gang rape and punched Malfoy for being a little shit. Past book one, she broke almost every rule and countless laws for Harry. Taking that away and leaving her an attractive, goody two shoes lexicon or submissive sex on legs is just as bad as taking Ron's positive qualities away.
