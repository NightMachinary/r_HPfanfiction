Hermione is rarely written as genius (or even a character on her own and not just a plot device) and more often than not what the average joe thinks intelligent people are like (much like The Big Bang Theory and their depiction of intelligence and science).

And twisting one of the best characters in the series into onedimensional arm candy while completely disregarding most of what makes her character (loyalty, hard work for her knowledge, a willingness to cross lines to get things done) is just as twisting one into an exaggeration of his weaknesses. The difference is that with Ron the author outright says what he thinks about it while in the other they merely imply things, like that Hermione is a price to be won or a damsel in distress for the Hero to rescue.
