how to describe....... from my memory the basic premise is that lily and james have twins when the secondary twin is named bwl harry is neglected and abused only surviving because of a house elf, when he is 7 (i think) he is kicked out the house and disowned and sent to a orphanage then he is once again abused there for being a freak and runs away and ends up in diagon where bellatrix finds him. he is then adopted, blood adopted, snape becomes his godfather and he befriends draco.

cant remember much more with clarity but i think you get the gist i hope.
