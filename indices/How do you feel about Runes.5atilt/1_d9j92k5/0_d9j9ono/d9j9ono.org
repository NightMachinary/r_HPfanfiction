This. I like this.

Seriously, I kinda think of runes as an /old ass/ magical programming language. Like C. Or maybe even Assembly. You could probably make a glowstick that lights up if charged fairly easily, but anything that requires complicated conditions is going to fucking tedious. And maybe a tedious amount of precision is required.
