The fic for the love of magic (as far as I remember) actually deals with this, Harry enhancing himself with runes, finding out that it doesn't all work like he expected (minor spoiler as en example, he uses the rune for endurance/power/virility going for higher resistance but... ends up kickstarting his puberty in a big way at 12 , lusting uncontrollably after women of all walks of life and experiencing bouts of overwhelming rage)...

I quite liked that!
