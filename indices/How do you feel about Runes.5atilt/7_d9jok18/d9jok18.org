I'm incorporating runes into my fic in a fairly unique way -- at least in Harry Potter fanfiction wise.

If you've played the MMORPG game called RuneScape, then a lot of this will make sense, as that's where I'm pulling some things from.

Firstly, you must go out into the wild and find a mine that you can than carve small square pieces of rock from. The rock has never lost any of its former size, nor has it crumbled. It is essentially pure magic. As the rock is pure magic, you must obtain the pieces by hand and not by spell.

Once you have your piece of rock, you must then enchant it with various things. Once you've enchanted it, you have a few minutes to draw your symbol on, which will make the piece of rock into a rune. A flame for fire, a tornado symbol for air, a water drop for water, a rock for earth, and a brain for mind. There are more symbols, complex and easier, but they have long been lost.

After your symbol has been completed on your rune, you must then repeat the process another three times creating additional runes. The more runes you add, the more powerful the spell. You can combine two â€˜fire runes' into one, saving carry space.

Basically, the process takes 4 -- 6 hours to create one rune and you need 3 -- 4 runes to cast a spell as a fire spell requires 2 fire, 1 air, and 1 mind.

In the current times, most wizards are impatient and hardly anyone takes the class, bar for 5 or 6 people. Most of those people are simply curious and drop it. You can't actually go out and start making runes until you're fifth, sixth, and seventh year at Hogwarts. Year 3 and 4 are purely theory.
