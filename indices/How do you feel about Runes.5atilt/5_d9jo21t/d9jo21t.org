I'm doing it as runes being prohibitively slow and inefficient for almost every daily task. Even if you take the time to learn how to use written language as a magical tool, it's so much more involved than just using a wand. There's only two real reasons to learn it. First, it's so obscure that you could very easily catch somebody off-guard. Second, you can automate spells with it that otherwise would require a caster. Doing a complex transfiguration with parallel spells, for instance. Nothing even a highly successful wizard really needs to do.

As for the class itself, it really is mostly just learning the runic alphabets and studying old magic which used written language, not necessarily learning to do it for yourself. Ancient Runes is basically History of Magic, but focused on an actual stage of magical development in history, not the events in the magical world. The full name is actually /Ancient Runes and Pre-wand Magic/ (itself a misnomer since wands did exist), but it just ends up shortened to Ancient Runes.

Part of the reason for doing it this way is that, if the class really is just about a dead languages, why does it exist at all? Just to be a parallel to Latin in the muggle world? Could they possibly have enough students to justify it? If it's culturally relevant enough to study, why doesn't it appear anywhere but one in-universe book?
