That would be an interesting story, a rune-savant Harry, able to comprehend Runes excellently. He does all the cliches, testing into 4th year, blowing everyone out of the park with his knowledge. But, in the end it's just a dead language. In the war against Voldemort he is unable to kill Voldemort.

Maybe at that point they flee Britain, and spend time scouring ancient ruins and old tombs, Harry only really has his one true skill, reading runes. Maybe he can find old secrets, or rituals that resolve the plot.

I don't know, it just sounds fun to have a 'Smart/Rune Harry' who wins by research.
