Well there is a rune-savant Harry Story [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11898648/1/]] I think it is pretty good warning it is Harry/multi, powerful Harry, abused Harry (starvation mostly) and sorry for spoiler on mobile not dead Lily. Oh and Manipulative Dumbledore although the way he gets dealt with is new the Flamels bind his magic and put him in a muggle nursing home.
