Agreed with this except for the useless part. Like you say, I imagine it as like Latin in the Muggle world, i.e. something that allows you to read old texts. But I imagine being able to read old texts as more useful in the wizarding world than the Muggle one.

Also, since we know that Tales of Beedle the Bard was written in runes in the 1400s, runes continued to be used by wizards long after Muggles had abandoned them. So it isn't even really old texts.
