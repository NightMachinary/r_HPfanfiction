I don't agree about preferring them to be a dead language, but I agree that they shouldn't be an /Level of Badass/ or three in a can. I also agree that Harry would never give a fuck about runes. He spent far too long having intellectual pursuits discouraged growing up and hanging out with Ron. His strength is in direct evocation and dueling. Adding something analytical like runes doesn't fit him. Now, I find lazy-ass, unintellectual Harry a disappointing character to read about, but that doesn't make the portrayal an inaccurate one.

This discussion is preparation for a Jumpchain SI that's being forced through a series of jumps by a Random Omnipotent Being. Already an analytical person, and very much of a mind to build things rather than just shoot on the fly and hope for the best. Given that, and the sorts of runic magic I'm discussing elsewhere in the comments, what do you think?
