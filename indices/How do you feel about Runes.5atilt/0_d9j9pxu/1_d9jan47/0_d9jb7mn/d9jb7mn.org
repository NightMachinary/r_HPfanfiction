I agree lazy Harry is disappointing but I prefer a driven Harry who works on defence or charms or something rather than saying "Oh, I should have picked runes and arithmancy. Maybe if I study over the summer and ask Hermione for the notes then I can test into it in 4th year. Aren't I clever." You know the fics I mean.

No idea about your fic. I don't ever read SI fics.
