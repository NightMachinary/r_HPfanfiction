i always liked the idea of runes being used to make things simpler, but not actually add anything. like notations for spell maintenance. perhaps having a spell you can place on runes that turn red in the presence of certain spells, so you know if something goes wrong with the magic you placed on the object or place. or spells that can work like switches for other bits of magic. in warding you can use rune marks to help identify where the edge of the protection spells should be. since lots of magic is usually invisible, but the whole lot'd work without it. in fact, you could just use english, or drawings of bunnies. i always preferred the idea of beating the bounds for protection spells. even in cannon the black house seems to have been protected by sirius dad himself, so chances are that strong protections are more about repeatedly casting spells over a place than complicated maths puzzels. i think it's cannon that two people casting those spells in the same place makes it stronger. or, else the order could just get a nice house and cast those spells again. with 20 odd people it shouldn't take much time, but it'd not be as powerful as black spending decades doing it in the one place.. and, cursbreaking is more about setting up shields so you don't get cursed to death while spelling the counter charms down.

in my head cannon writing magic books in common english is probably a modern cultural change. so even books 50 years old are possibly written in superior magical languages. they use to do that with the bibles right? only in latin because god-magic! i always like parselscript in fics because fuck everyone else, stay away from my secret magicz; right up until super-harry translates the lot. bugger.
