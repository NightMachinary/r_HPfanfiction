My understanding here is that HP magic heavily builds on the "magic of language". In a nutshell: A pig-latin incantation works because it sounds mystical and old and therefore resonates like that in the wizards brain. /Stupefy!/ works while /Stun!/ doesn't, even though there isn't much difference between the words. I even went so far once in a short fic that I said that by giving meaning to a spell by social stigma or by making it sacrosanct, a society makes the spell even more potent. I used the Unforgivables and the Patronus to showcase this. By making the Unforgivables unforgivable, you create a myth and legend around them which makes them even more dangerous. Expecto Patronum is hailed as this ultimate magic against fear itself. By the belief alone that the Patronus can shield you against fear, a society boosts the spells potency itself. From another angle, creating a spell is much less about wand movements and the like - they're important too since they're rituals and rituals make people belief in things - but the most important factor in spell creation is believing in it. Which is why I'd argue that people like Luna Lovegood could be masters of spell creation and magic itself by their nature alone, while people like Hermione Granger, for example, need a ritual to believe in the potency of magic, like in this case, reading about it in a book.

But anyway, Ancient Runes, I think, are magically powerful due to their extremely Old&Ancient^{^{TM}} nature. People think they're powerful, therefore they are and a repeated learning of Runes solidifies that sentiment of Proto-Germanic, Egyptian, Sumerian and Etruscan being especially powerful. Its the same with an alphabet that is perceived magically potent as it is with a spell. You can't get a spell by inscribing something with the modern italic alphabet and arabic numerals. But you can get magic by using Futhark and cuneiform.
