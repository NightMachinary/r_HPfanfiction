I've seen them used in rituals, as an amplifier, as a way to send a message, as a way to cast a spell, as a summoning technique. I think people over think Runes and their purpose, mostly because they're looking for that niche that gives their story /more/. But its not necessarily the best idea, or the best case for things. In the books it mentions Ancient Runes as a requirement for Curse Breaking IIRC? So, maybe its used more like a language and not lie how anyone else says. Its basically for Bill when he's in a tomb, a message that says " Hey don't step here idjit." Or, it works as both a message and an effect like the first domino in a chain of dominoes.
