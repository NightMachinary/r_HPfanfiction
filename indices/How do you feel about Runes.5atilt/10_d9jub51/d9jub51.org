At this point, I prefer for them to just be an old language. That's not to say their can't be power in an old language, but I think the idea of Harry being some sort of Runemaster and being superawesome because of that is pretty much a nonsense idea. I get why the idea of incantations being spoken magic while runes being written magic is popular, but I've never really seen it done well, so I prefer people to just leave the idea alone.
