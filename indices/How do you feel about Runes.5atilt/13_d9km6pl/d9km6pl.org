In my writing, Runes plus Arithmancy is 95% of enchanting. (The rest is metallurgy, spellwork, astronomy, that kind of thing.) Wards are just quick and dirty enchantments. Some spells have similar effects to some wards, so terminology has slipped away from rigid, concrete absolutes.

You can enchant with runes alone. This tends to be inefficient compared to using runes with arithmancy. The amount of effort you need to put into them, how long they'll last, how effective they are, how hard they are to defeat, that all depends on the precision that arithmancy can provide.

You can't enchant with arithmancy alone. You can use it to analyze spells and construct new ones.

But doing either is a lot of work, which is why people memorize tons of spells instead of inventing them on the fly or sketching runes for what they need.
