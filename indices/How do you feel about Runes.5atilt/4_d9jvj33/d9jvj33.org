I treat Runes in a similar fashion as Potions in the sense that while Runes is a dead language, I prefer them to be usable for certain types magic. Granted, not just ANY magic of course but very specific magic. Runes would never be used in duels but they would only be used for one of two things: to fortify a person, to fortify an object, or to fortify a location.

What this means is what Runes would be used in order to imbue certain effects onto objects or places. It would not be used for anything that a wand or Potions could replicate but the magic that it is used for is situational. Therefore the average wizard may never use Runes to their full potential since Runes are just a bonus and are not mandatory. It would take at least thousands of Runes drawn out in a very specific format (e.g. like programming) in order to make use of their magic properties, and even then, the vast majority of Rune magic would be stuff that spells/Potions do easier (e.g. Rune-made Muggle-Repelling enchantments on a house versus the far easier Muggle-Repelling Charm). The Rune magic which isn't outclassed by Spells/Potions would be capable of things Spells/Potions aren't capable of, that would not common knowledge (i.e. similar to the knowledge of Horcruxes pre-HBP), and with effects that would be considered Dark Magic.

In that sense, Runes is like a programming language. The average person may never need to learn how to program since everything is done for them. It can also be seen as the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower][Magikarp Power]] trope of magic in that Runes would be nothing more than a dead language for like 99.9% or wizards and with trash-tier magical abiliteis. However that 0.1% of wizards who are skilled enough at magic in general (i.e. Dumbledore) would be able to use them to their full potential, which is also like [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome][this trope]] and also [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter][this one too]]. Similarly with rituals, Voldemort's rebirth is what rituals at their full potential would be capable of and thus would be far outside the reach of the average wizards. Any rituals that regular wizards know of would simply not be worth using.

Runes in a sense are like rituals. They are old, out-dated methods which are outclassed by both spells and Potions in almost all situations. Perhaps in like 1500 B.C when many good spells and Potions weren't invented till later, Runes would be more powerful than both then but as time went on, Runes just became redundant.

Speaking of rituals, I see Runes in the same light. Wizards don't do rituals or chants, they use spells and Potions. However the most powerful of rituals would vastly outclass anything one can do with spells or Potions. In fact, Voldemort's rebirth is the perfect example of this. I think that those style of rituals are what rituals would be used for in the hands of a skilled wizard, that for every supremely powerful ritual, there are 1000 ritual that can be done better by spells/Potions Perhaps Runes were once used to place enchantments on buildings (i.e. Muggle-Repelling Charms) but they were made redundant since spells and Potions outclassed them by being far easier to use with a better effect. So for every supremely powerful Rune-created enchantment, there are thousands of ones that are useless or made redundant by spells/Potions.

*TL;DR: Runes were made redundant by spells and Potions. 99.999% of Rune-related magic are either too worthless to ever use, was outclassed by a spell/Potion that is easier to use. That 0.001% of Runes that are still useful in recent years are the types of magic that aren't taught at Hogwarts (or perhaps anywhere for that matter), and/or are far too difficult to perform, and/or are considered Dark Magic on the lines of the ritual used to revive Voldemort at the end of GoF.*
