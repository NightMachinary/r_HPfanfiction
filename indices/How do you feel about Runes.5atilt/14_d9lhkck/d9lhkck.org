I think many people feel that Hogwarts (for being touted as the premier school for magic) has too many useless subjects and I agree. So the subjects that we don't really see 'on screen' in the book are used as substitutes for stuff that is actually helpful. We see 6 years of of education and there doesn't seem to be anything in there that would be useful for being a Curse Breaker (and I don't see how knowing a dead language would entirely fill that gap)... so either Bill Weasly learned everything that's actually required for his job at Gringotts or there has to be more to Hogwarts.

There's too few AU fics that make Hogwarts competent... subjects like Herbology, Astronomy, Divination or even History of Magic could be awesome, but they seem borderline useless in canon.
