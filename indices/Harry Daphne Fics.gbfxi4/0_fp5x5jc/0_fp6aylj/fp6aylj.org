In a gist it's a 4th year fic, in which Harry meets Daphne near the lake(because he was pissed off with everything, his name came out of goblet, ron and Hermione bailed on him). There encounter was not very friendly as the ice queen was not friendly, but as the story continues Harry falls for her but she doesn't give him a chance (every time she yells at her or just doesn't shows interest).. So yeah I was just looking for a fic where Daphne doesn't give a crap about Harry but Harry tries hard to win her friendship and she doesn't shows interest, but as the story she continues she starts noticing him nad then they become friends and ultimately she also falls for her..... something like that...
