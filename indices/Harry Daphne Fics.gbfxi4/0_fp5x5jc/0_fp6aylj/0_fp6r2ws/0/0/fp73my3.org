Just wanted to double check - because sometimes, people have just one aspect they're really looking for (eg, just the coldness towards Harry and not limited to Hogwarts).

I haven't read any that specifically match up with those constraints (or that stuck in my mind as good) - however, maybe take a look through the long lists of fics here:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dq95en/harrydaphne_compilation/]]

It's the most comprehensive list of HarryxDaphne fics I could find on the subreddit. If you scroll down in the comments, each of the fics gets a call from the ffnbot, so you can read the various descriptions.
