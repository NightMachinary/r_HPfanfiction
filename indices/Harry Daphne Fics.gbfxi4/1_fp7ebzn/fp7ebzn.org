“A Most Peculiar Girl“ is similar. Sadly, it is just a oneshot linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13356003/1/A-Most-Peculiar-Girl]])

Then maybe these stories by James Spookie: linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8678295/1/Things-We-Do-For-Love]]) linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5598642/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Betrothal-Contract]])

Not exactly like that, but still a great oneshot with a cold Daphne in the beginning: linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8230512/1/A-Very-Good-Reason]])
