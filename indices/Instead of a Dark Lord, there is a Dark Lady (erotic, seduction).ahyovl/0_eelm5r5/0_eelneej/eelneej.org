It makes sense depending on your idea of Voldemort. Voldemort definitely used his good looks to his favor when he was younger. With my mental image of Voldemort, K doubt he would simply pass up a significant advantage like that if it was restored to a new height. I doubt he wouldn't be as violent though.

I wonder if Voldemort would have gender dysphoria...
