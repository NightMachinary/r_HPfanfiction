I just favourite them on ff.net or whatever site I happen to be using. You can also use the follows page if you want to keep them private. This does lead to a high count of fics there though, I'm at something like 4k on ff.net alone.

Usually if it was a good fix or one I read recently - say a year or so ago - I can recognize the title/summary, or by the first chapter. If I've totally forgotten it, then I look on that as kind of a good thing, I get to reread something I apparently enjoyed at least a bit in the past.

Beyond that, the mobile FF.net favourites/follows page is infinite scroll, so you can use Find in Page really quickly to check as well.
