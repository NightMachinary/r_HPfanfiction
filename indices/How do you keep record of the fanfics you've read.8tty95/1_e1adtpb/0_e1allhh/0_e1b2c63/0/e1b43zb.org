You can also sort by the date you added to favorites, but I find I don't read too many older fics these days lol. Sorting by last updated means I can just update the word counts of fics that have been added to since I last altered the spreadsheet. Maybe twice a year I'll go through the list by date added, and verify that everything I've favorited in the last six months is in the spreadsheet, but it's a long fucking list so I don't usually feel the need to do that as frequently as I update the sheet via the last updated sort.

Really, the purpose of the spreadsheet isn't so much to help me remember what I've read before, but rather to let me estimate how much time I've spent reading. I read between 400 and 500 words per minute (the shittier the writing, the faster I read), so based on the total wordcount I can estimate the time I've spent. I'd tell you what I'm at rn but I haven't updated the file in a month or so, and I don't have a copy of it on my laptop,
