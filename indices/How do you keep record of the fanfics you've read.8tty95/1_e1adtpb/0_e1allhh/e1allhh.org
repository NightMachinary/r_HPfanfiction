Yeah I can't be bothered to actually update my spreadsheet each time I read a fic, so I favorite everything I read, then at a later date I scroll through my favorites by last updated and update or add their entries to the spreadsheet. Sorting by last updated tells me where to stop, I just go up until the last date modified of the spreadsheet.
