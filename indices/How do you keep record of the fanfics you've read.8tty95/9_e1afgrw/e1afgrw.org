I keep a spreadsheet in google docs. I have sections for docs I liked and want to remember or reread, sections for docs I disliked and want to avoid in the future, and then a running list of docs I plan to read soon. It helps keep things neat and prevents me from having 36384737 bookmarks cluttering up my browser.
