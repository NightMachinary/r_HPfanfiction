Calibre; [[https://calibre-ebook.com/]]

It's a great ebook manager and there is a plugin you can dl through it's preferences called fanficfare. It let's you dl from your favorite sites in a format of your choice. It imports all the metadata, and title/author info as well as retains the link back to source. You can also save WIPs and hit update to check for new chapters. The other great thing is you can add your own columns and info on each book.

For example all of my stories have my personal rating (1-5 stars); a drop column letting me know which I've read and which I haven't, as well as a summary I write for myself with little details to let me know which fic is which. Only I get to see this so I can write whatever I want. It's really awesome.

If your reader doesn't let you go back to the website on the fly (I have an old kindle with no web browsing) then I do recommend you still pull up the original fic and write a review though. Remember not leaving reviews sinks ships and kills fandoms. So if you love something, let the writer know so they get positive feedback and keep writing. :)
