#+begin_quote
  A message from Harry Potter to the rest of the D.A. begging them to become sane again.It had taken four weeks to reach this point, but Harry decided to put up a notice board telling the D.A. to stop causing chaos and inciting mayhem. They took it more as a challenge than anything else. There was even a betting pool about who could get the most absurd rule on the board.Luna's winning.
