linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay) is rather wholesome. Harry's just so resistant to all kinds of harm that he can afford to be quite mellow, and Voldemort never really manages to make himself more than a minor nuisance (well, there are a handful of casualties at the Battle of Hogwarts, but that's all). Draco's efforts to stir up trouble go over Harry's head so completely that he eventually gives up and pretty much has a heel-face turn. Most of the story is simply a magical school experience, learning spells and meeting other sapient magicall species and inventing magical rocketry.
