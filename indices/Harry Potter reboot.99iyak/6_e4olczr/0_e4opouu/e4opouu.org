Look, this is primarily fanfiction of the /books/. That the movies bungled Ginny is of no matter to most of us, for whom the basic canon that we're fan of is the novels, with the movies as nothing more than a novelty on the side. Certainly, there are many characters and events that I picture completely differently from the movies (though there /are/ also a few things from the movies that have entered my headcanon).
