I think there's a difference between 'Harry Potter' fanfiction and 'Wizarding World' fanfiction. There's a lot more leeway in the second. I can accept stories where there is a point of divergence as HP fanfiction. But if Harry Potter is a girl and isn't even called Harry, is it Harry Potter fanfiction at all?

I do see quite a lot of fics --- some of them are even pretty good --- which I don't think are really HP fanfiction at all. Take out the odd canon name, and it's original fiction. I understand authors wanting an audience, and there's precious little interest in original fiction unless it's published, but it feels a bit like cheating.

Ultimately though, it doesn't really matter. We all read what we like and ignore what we don't. Or should do.

We don't get all hot under the collar about our own particular peeves, do we? Nobody tries to dictate what is right or not according to their own opinions, do they . . .?
