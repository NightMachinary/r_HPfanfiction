  But if Harry Potter is a girl and isn't even called Harry, is it Harry Potter fanfiction at all?

I'd say definitely. I see your point for stories that star OCs or take place in Ilvermony or some such, but a change to one characteristic of one character isn't enough for it not to be /Harry Potter/ anymore. A story about Ron, Hermione, Neville and Dumbledore would still be a /Harry Potter/ fanfiction even if Harry himself is absentee, I think we can all agree on that (seriously, how many people here read canon primarily for the main character?), so a story featuring a character who's /mostly/ like Harry, except a girl, with an accordingly different name, ought to be even /more/ /Harry Potter/.
