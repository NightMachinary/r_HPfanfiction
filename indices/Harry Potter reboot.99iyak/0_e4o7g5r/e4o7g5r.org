I think this is definitely a very personal question because everyone will differ drastically.

To me it stops being Harry Potter when you change the (very loose) fundamental ideas of JK's magical world. Aka- using different words like mage instead of wizard/witch, the theory behind magic becomes so precise it makes the book impossible, the structure of the wizarding world is noticeably different from the loose idea we are given.

This doesn't mean I don't enjoy someone defining some ideas JK doesn't pin down. But when you start making the magic and it's world incompatible with the books it's not Harry Potter and /his/ world. Now it's your own. This doesn't apply to someone giving the magical world nobility or politicking becoming important. And it doesn't include that people might get tired from using too much magic: this is somewhat canon. But when you suddenly define it too much and make these really specific ideas about people's “magical core” - I will kindly think to myself that you should write your own novel with your own world and close the page (if the story isn't enthralling).

I put up with Emperor for a really long time because I found the story interesting and engaging. I never felt like I was reading Harry Potter however. And that's not because Harry was OOC, but because the authors theories about magic were incompatible with JK's world. And overtime I got bored and stopped reading. That had nothing to do with the AU in which the author had written, but the story telling.

Edit: I should add I can put up with a lot of character changes. If the story is good, I don't care what you've done with Hermione as long as the story accounts for her personality changes in the storytelling. You want to make Harry totally OOC and dark or light or gay or black or abused or an abuser. I don't care. Give me context, give me a story I want to keep reading. But it's the minute you change the world too far that it's not the HP magical world, I'm not reading Harry Potter but your personal world building. And that's okay, but I'm not going to think of it as a HP story.
