  using different words like mage instead of wizard/witch,

Well to be fair, a few other words /do/ seem to be used (albeit less commonly) in the Wizarding World. We have evidence of "warlock" and "sorcerer" at least. And I like the idea that "mage" is a formal word that wizarding anthropologists and the like use when they have to use a gender-neutral term for a member of wizardkind, but it's not widely used orally.
