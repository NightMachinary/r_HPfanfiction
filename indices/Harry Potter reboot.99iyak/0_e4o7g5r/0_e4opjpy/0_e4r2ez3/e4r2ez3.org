I will acknowledge that others words are used like "warlock." But they are only in very formal titles (Supreme Mugwump, Chief Warlock). No one actually says, "hey! You're a warlock, Harry!" It seems to just be a title and not a term any witch or wizard would use to describe themselves. As you said, not used orally. But I don't believe it would be used beyond official titles. We each have our own head canons :) Personally, I really don't like the word mage. I couldn't tell you why, but I hate the sound of it.

Sorcerer was never used to describe anyone, just utilized in the American titles because they thought Americans would be too dumb to know what a philosopher is (cue massive eye roll). Nicholas Flamel isn't actually referred to as one, he's labelled an alchemist. It's only the physical Philosopher's Stone that's ever called a "sorcerer."

Please correct me if I'm wrong!
