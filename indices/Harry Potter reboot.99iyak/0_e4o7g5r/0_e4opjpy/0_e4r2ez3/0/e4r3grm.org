Dumbledore, if I recall, is a Grand Sorcerer, as were several past Headmasters according to the inscriptions in the movies, art books and theme park. Though that's also a title.

My headcanon is that "wizard" and "witch" are the basic descriptors for people with magic; "mage" is more or less equivalent to "human", and is extremely awkward to use in conversation; and "sorcerer" and "warlock" are both initially-Muggle terms that refer more to /occupation/ than to /nature/ --- a warlock or sorcerer is not only someone with the gift of magic, but someone who studies and trains it extensively. Naturally, only such an accomplished user of magic could be a leader of the magical community, hence Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot; and magical scholars whose skill is recognized as extraordinary, like Dumbledore, are granted the title of Grand Sorcerer as something akin to a Nobel Prize.
