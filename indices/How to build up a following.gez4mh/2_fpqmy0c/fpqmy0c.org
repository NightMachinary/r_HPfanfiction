Updating frequently (even if that means shorter chapters) , helps getting visibility

Decent title and summary. I cannot stress enough how many stories i've skipped because of bad ones.

Interact with commments/reviews (not so relevant on ff, but on sites where discussion is visible)

There are hp discord server/ hp fanfiction writer server out there, i'm sure. Join and look around.

Link your story and summary in this thread.
