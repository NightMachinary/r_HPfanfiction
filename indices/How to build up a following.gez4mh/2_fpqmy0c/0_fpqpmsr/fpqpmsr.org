How does this sound? I'm going for a book that is very similar, tonally, to the original series. I'd like to consider it a spiritual successor to the HP series, but that's just me being a little too proud of my own writing, I think.

Also, I used 'Bob Joe' as a fill-in name, because I absolutely love the name I came up with (lol) and would rather not publish it just yet. 'Bob Joe and the Radical's Key' (working title!!!) Bob Joe has been locked up by his family and not allowed to leave the property for years. When he discovers a chest in the forest leaving him the owner of multiple odd relics, he finds himself caught up in a whole new world of magic, but even for a magical school as odd as the one he attends, something sinister is afoot, involving a mysterious locked door hiding a secret power and the key to Bob's past...

I came up with all this on the spot (title and summary) so it can definitely be improved upon. In fact, I'm going to give it a second go here, perhaps you can give me some feedback on my title-making skills, lol :P

After being locked away by his parents for the first eleven years of his life, Bob Joe sneaks out one day only to find a chest filled with fascinating relics, beckoning for him to come a fantastical world of magic and mystery... but even in this world of witchcraft, where the abnormal is the new normal, something odd is afoot, and the future of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry -- and the Wizarding world as a whole -- may depend on Bob and his newfound friends.
