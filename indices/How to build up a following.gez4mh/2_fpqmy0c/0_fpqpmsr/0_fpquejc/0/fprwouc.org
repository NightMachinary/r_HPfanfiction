See, I don't want to draw people's expectations too high if the writing doesn't come out that well, but at the same time, I'm not going to deliberately write a subpar summary so as not to cause excitement.

As for the individual notes --- I'm writing this as a stand-alone from HP, so the first book is quite similar in tone to the Sorcerer's Stone, as it still introduces Hogwarts, Quidditch, etc... that's why there isn't as much of a massive overhaul of the worldbuilding (or at least that I have planned yet) as one might expect. My focus is on the plot and characters and making those very unique and with a different feel from HP, so the story can take place in a relatively similar world but not feel like a carbon copy of the original series. Your comments have gotten me thinking, though, and I'm already brainstorming a few more ways to set things apart... thanks for the help!
