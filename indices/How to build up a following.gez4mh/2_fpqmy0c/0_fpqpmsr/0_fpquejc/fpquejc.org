Writing a story that follows the spirit of another one also has it's issues, which I am sure you are aware of.

Readers will have expectations as high as the original story, but will also want to read something new and refreshing. Does you story have something distinctive, that improves upon the world of Harry Potter ?

Improved or adapted Magical system, heavily expanded world of magical creatures ? World building ? I'd include this in the summary, perhaps with a hint.

If not, the summary is fine. It's miles better than most fan fiction, but do be mindful that a story like this will have readers come in with high expectations, because what your story promises is more Harry Potter and not more fanfiction. Because the summary is a bit generic and if a story is not carried by it's content, it needs to be carried by its prose.

I like the title, because it follows the intent of HP.

Does this help ? Again, I'd recommend finding on of the fanfiction writer servers and ask there. I've only visited one from a different fandom, but i'm sure they can give you decent advice, certainly better than mine.

Edit: I prefer the first summary
