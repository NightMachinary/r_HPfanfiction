Generally, if it's a long fic, it will be highly visible. If you update once or twice a week (don't post all chapters at once!) you'll be at the front page once or twice a week, so many people will see it after a while (it always takes some time to get attention, but if you keep on posting, you will). Have a good summary. Look at common writing mistakes and also make sure there's no typos and grammar mistakes. Have your chapters be at least 1k long. Crosspost. On AO3, use the tags correctly. If you ask some questions in the AN at the end, you'll get more reviews/comments. Reply to your reviews/comments. In [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] there's a weekly fic showcase. Also reply to people looking for certain types of stories if yours fits.
