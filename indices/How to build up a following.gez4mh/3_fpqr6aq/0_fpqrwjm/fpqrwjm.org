Thanks for the great info! If you don't mind, I'm going to copy and paste the two draft summaries I whipped up a minute ago for showing someone else. If you have the time to tell me if they're decent or not, that would be great, but of course if not that's fine!

​

1). Bob Joe has been locked up by his family and not allowed to leave the property for years. When he manages to sneak out one day, he discovers a chest in the forest leaving him the owner of multiple odd relics, he discovers that he is a wizard, and finds himself caught up in a whole new world of magic, but even for a magical school as odd as the one he attends, something sinister is afoot, involving a mysterious locked door hiding a secret power and the key to Bob's past...

​

2). After being locked away by his parents for the first eleven years of his life, Bob Joe sneaks out one day only to find a chest filled with fascinating relics, beckoning for him to come a fantastical world of magic and mystery as a wizard-in-training... but even in this world of witchcraft, where the abnormal is the new normal, something odd is afoot, and the future of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry -- and the Wizarding world as a whole -- may depend on Bob and his newfound friends.

​

My working title is "Bob Joe and the Radical's Key" but like I said, that's a working title. And if you couldn't guess, Bob Joe is a placeholder because (even if this is a kind of weird reason) I love my character's name and don't want it to get taken.
