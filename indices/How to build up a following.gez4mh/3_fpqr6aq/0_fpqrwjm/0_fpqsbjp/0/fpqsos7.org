Thank you for the response! As I'm sure you know, as writers we sometimes forget what the reader does/doesn't know, and as such I forgot to mention that he gets into the forest after he manages to sneak out.

He's a wizard and will be attending Hogwarts.

It's pretty much all OC, set in 2015 and having just about no canon characters. The only character I can imagine returning at the moment is George Weasley for future plot reasons. The whole story is as practice for writing a real novel some day, thus why I don't want to recycle old characters (but I didn't want to focus on worldbuilding so I'm just writing an HP fanfic as practice).

Again, thanks for the feedback! I'm trying to make the writing feel Rowling-esque in tone, but the actual prose has a bit extra of my own invention.
