What precisely does locked away mean if he can go out into a forest? (Not quite clear in the first one) And is he a muggle who finds magical relics and meets wizards that way or is he a wizard who will attend Hogwarts? Will there only be OCs in this story or will there also be canon characters?

Summaries both sound good. Good writing style.
