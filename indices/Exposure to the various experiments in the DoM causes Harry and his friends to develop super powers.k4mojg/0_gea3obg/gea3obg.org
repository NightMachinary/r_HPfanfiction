"Attention all!" Harry called around the Room of Requirement, carefully avoiding getting too close to any of the furniture, "I now call to order the first meeting of - Luna, stop burning the table would you? - of the Wizarding Organization for the Greater Good. The purpose of WOGG is to - er, Ron? Could you put us down please?"

The ginger shrugged sheepishly. "Hang on, still getting used to - there you go."

With a loud thud the meeting table, plush armchairs and lovely tea set that the room had generated for them fell back onto the floor. Harry sighed and looked up.

"Ginny, if you could come down here with the rest of us that'd be really helpful."

"Sorry Harry," she grinned cheekily and floated down to their level, "flying without a broom is just so much /fun/!"

"We should probably get this meeting done soon," Neville said, sipping his tea that he'd managed to keep from spilling over. "I predict Hermione's about to turn into a baby again."

"What?" The bushy-haired Gryffindor, currently admiring her late-20s-looking self in a mirror provided by the room frowned and turned to look at him. "I'm not feeling any diff-"

With a pop she turned into a mess of too-large clothes and wriggling infant, who proceeded to start crying. Luna quickly scooped her up and produced a small fireball. "Shh, here, look into the flames sweetie! Don't worry, I'll defend you from those horrid nargles!"

"Right," Harry contined, "as I was saying, the purpose of WOGG is to fight for justice and avenge the wronged. We shall be a guiding light for the wizarding world, offering hope to every witch and wizard - er, Luna, did Hermione just say 'poo'?"

The pyrokinetic put the baby to her ear. "I think she's saying 'spoo'."

"'Spoo'? Oh, right, /SPEW/, of course. Yes Hermione, we will also fight for the rights of the rest of the magical world." The baby nodded contently. "Now, Ron, what's our first mission?"

"Er..." Ron turned to the massive screen the room had placed along one wall. "Well, um, it looks like there some blinking dots around Diagon Alley? Dunno what they mean though." He absentmindedly caused a nearby display cabinet to glow and lift shakily off the ground. "You know I bet we could really freak out Malfoy with these powers. He'd scamper off so fast we'd never have to worry about him again!"

"But then he'd tell people about us," Neville frowned, stirring his tea. "I'm not sure why that's important, but I predict it not ending well."

"Well of course it's important," a suddenly much older Hermione eased herself into one of the chairs, raising her wrinkly eyebrows at him. "We're superheroes now, we'll need secret identities to keep our loved ones safe."

Ginny swooped down and did an effortless handstand on the table. "Superheroes? Is that a muggle thing?"

"Wait, you mean to tell me there are /muggles/ who can do this stuff?" Ron said in awe, returning to the conversation as the cabinet crashed onto the floor behind him.

"Well yes, but we won't find out about them until the crossover episode."

"The what?"

"Guys, focus." Harry looked at the screen. "There won't be any superhero team-ups until we've established ourselves as local heroes. We need to come up with secret identities and costumes, get our tragic backstories straight and find some villains to defeat, and we've got less than an hour till Transfiguration."

"What about training?" Hermione investigated her pruney fingers. "I really need to get control of this power. Theoretically I can do it to others too, but so far all I've managed to do is make Crookshanks look grumpier."

"I've already got the hang of mine!" Ginny whooped giddily as she flew around the rafters. "What'd you call this, 'Mione? 'Anti-garbity'? It's awesome!"

Harry looked around the room, sighed, and collapsed into a chair. Which prompty turned to dust, causing him to fall to the floor rather painfully.

They had a /lot/ of work to do.

That was fun! And might have helped with this writer's block I've had plagueing me for months now. Thanks for the prompt OP!
