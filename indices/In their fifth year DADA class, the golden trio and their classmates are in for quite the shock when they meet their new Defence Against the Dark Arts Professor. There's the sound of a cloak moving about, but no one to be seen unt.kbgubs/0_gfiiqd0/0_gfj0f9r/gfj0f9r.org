None of the links that you posted, with the exception of the last two even remotely fit OP's request. They're looking for a travelling Harry that teaches during canon era, not whatever you've linked.

800-Rent-A-Hero almost would, with the exception that Harry is the Divination professor, rather than the DADA.
