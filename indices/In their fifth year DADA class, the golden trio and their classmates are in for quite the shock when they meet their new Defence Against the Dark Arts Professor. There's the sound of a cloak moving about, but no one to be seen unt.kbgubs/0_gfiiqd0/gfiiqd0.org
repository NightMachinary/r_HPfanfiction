Notable fics below:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11063892/chapters/25491018][Wind Shear]]: time-traveling Harry teaches Defense, complete. It's a classic. All author's works are 'good' at the least.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8898816/1/Remuneration-for-Instructional-Services][Remuneration for Instructional Services]] , fifth year, for want of a nail: if anti-cheating parchment included a field for name of one's teacher. Pretty decent. Author /might/ be worth looking up too.

In case other variation of Harry has a job are welcome too, here's a few courtesy of [[/u/TheBlueMenace]]:

  In [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113588][Business]] Harry starts off with a moderate amount of money and 'invests' it over the course of the story to end up the wealthiest person alive. linkao3(1113588)

  Have you had a look at the Harry runs a cafe stories? There are a few, but the focus is never really the business (more relationships). I mean like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10867705/1/Starborn-Caf%C3%A9][Starborn Café]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8208936/1/Wanderer][Wanderer]]. There are also stories where he has other stores, like a mechanics shop in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8148717/1/Finding-Home][Finding Home]].
