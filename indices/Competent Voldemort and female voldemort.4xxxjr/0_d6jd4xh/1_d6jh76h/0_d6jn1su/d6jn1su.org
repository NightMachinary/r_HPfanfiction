I dunno man.

  Harry's thoughts suddenly came to a halt when they came in. The 2 people who he hated more than anyone else in the world. Even their idiotic Gryffindor son of theirs.

  His parents. Not that they deserved such a title. In fact, he'd rather be the son of Hagrid and Professor Sprout, the two most disgusting-to-look-at humans at Hogwarts currently. Not that Hagrid was even human. He was the horrendous result of a union between a wizard and a giantess. Flitwick was just as bad. No self respecting wizard should even consider getting intimate with a goblin in any way.

  Harry sneered at James and Lily Potter as they walked in. They had a look of utter disappointment which they projected on him. "Harry...", began Lily. "Yes,mother drawled Harry spitefully. "Son, we know it's hard to be the brother of the Boy-Who-Lived, but you don't have to be so jealous and try to upstage him", said James disappointedly.

  "I'm not even going to dignify that with a response", he retorted, the venom clear in his speech.

  Before the situation could escalate, Dumbledore interrupted them."James, that can be a discussion held later. What I would like to know is how Mr. Potter here, a fifth year student, was able to place his name in the Goblet of Fire, an artefact so powerful and old that it even predates the founders." Dumbledore stared at him, a calculating look on his face.

  "There is a simple answer to all of this, but due to certain people making idiotic statements,I myself have not been able to ascertain how my name came out of the Goblet of Fire", came the suave, cultured voice of Harry Potter. McGonagallstepped in before Harry's parents could respond to his provoking.

  "What do you mean Potter, by you also having to find out? Only you could now how your name came out, since you put it in there."McGonagall was almost raging, most likely due to the fact that Gryffindor would not be representing Hogwarts.

  "I don't know how I can put it any clearer, Professor," spoke Harry gently, as if speaking to a child.

  And then all hell broke loose.

  "I DID NOT PUT MY NAME IN THE FUCKING CUP", all but screamed Harry. He had released his aura unconsciously in his anger, making everyone realise who the true alpha male was. It forced all but Dumbledore to be submissive, and the others could do nothing but stare in awe and fear, as his magic saturated the air,hold im them in place, making it impossible for them to move. Objects in the room were thrust aside due to his rage, while Dumbledore tried to calm him. One thing that Dumbledore noticed, which the others did not, shocked him into a stupor.

  It was his eyes.

  Many people often remarked that Harry Potter had inherited his mother's eyes, while his brother Charles inherited his father's. Even though his eyes were green like Lily's, they were a different shade completely. It was a colour Dumbledore was saddened to have witnessed many times. The Colour of Death.Avada Kedavra.At this point, however, the colour seemed more pronounced as if the curse itself was emanating from his eyes. This affected only one of his eyes. The other almost gave him a heart attack. Instead of the deathly green, it was a colour possessed by only one other person.

  Crimson. Dark red, with malevolence hidden beneath.

The sheer amount of cringe I've felt just from reading this. And this is just the beginning part of Chapter 1.
