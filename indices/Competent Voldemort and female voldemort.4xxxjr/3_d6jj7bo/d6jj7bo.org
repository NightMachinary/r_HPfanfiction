I've written a very competent Voldemort in "Patron", with a matching Dumbledore. Both make plans that do not rely on the other side being stupid, and aim to advance their cause even if a plan fails. For example, Harry was put into the Tournament by Voldemort's helper not in an attempt to kidnap him, but to distract Dumbledore from the real plan to revive Voldemort. If Harry actually dies during the tournament, that is a bonus. Dumbledore suspects this, but he can't take the chance anyway. Needless to say Voldemort didn't even consider having Barty pose as Moody, much less for a year. And things continue in that vein - plots and deceptions. Moves and counter-moves.
