Linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) An AU where Voldemort won the first war and created a society/kingdom/wizarding community that seems to work and not be a terrible place to live in. It's a little strange at times, especially in the beginning and it's really really long, but once it gets going it's absolutely captivating and seriously addicting. The world, the plot and characters are all very complex, multilayered and come together to make a very involved AU world that builds on canon world, yet at the same time it's own. Voldemort doesn't appear until chapter 11, but he is one of the most strangely likable characters considering that he is still technically a bad guy. Characterizations of Harry, Snape and a few other side characters are amazing as well, their interactions with each other and Voldemort are really well done.
