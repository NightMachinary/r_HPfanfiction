Yeah, I'm saying Harry should be just as good.

#+begin_quote
  He's on par with Dumbledore, another genius among geniuses who has about 40 years on him.

Pretty sure Tom is better, they seem to come to a draw when they duel, and Dumbledore has the Elder Wand.

  I really like that Harry defeated Tom by understanding him intimately. When Tom Riddle dies, there isn't another personal alive who knew him so well. Harry understands his motives, his decision-making process, his abilities. He understands his weak point is his own arrogance, and specifically his empathy, which I consider to be Harry's strong suit.

I'm not really sure what you're talking about here. Voldemort didn't lose because he was arrogant, and Harry didn't win by understanding him.

Harry won because Dumbledore tricked Voldemort into thinking he won mastery over the Elder Wand. Voldemort basically cast a spell with it and blew himself up when it collided with Harry's disarming spell.

That's what I remember anyway.
