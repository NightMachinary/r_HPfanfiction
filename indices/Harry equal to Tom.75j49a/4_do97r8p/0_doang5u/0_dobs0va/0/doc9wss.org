  Voldemort, in his arrogance, didn't think anyone would ever find his horcruxes. Voldemort, in his arrogance, took Harry's blood, without realizing the consequences.
#+end_quote

Yeah I suppose arrogance did contribute majorly to his downfall.

The horcruxes were just stored in absolutely retarded places.

But Voldemort /still/ would have won if not for Dumbledore's trick. When we got to the final climax of the story, Harry didn't win because of something he did. He won because of something Dumbledore did.

  Voldemort never once looked into the connection that he and Harry shared.
#+end_quote

Not really true, he definitely used it against Harry. Sirius Black.

  If Dumbledore figured out that Harry was a Horcrux, I think Voldemort could have come to that conclusion with some research.
#+end_quote

Yeah I agree with this. Voldemort definitely should have realized this. The only good explanation I can come up with is that splitting his soul too many times drove him insane. That, or it's just PIS.

  My final point, even if Harry was a genius amount geniuses like Tom Riddle, Tom would still have 50+ years of practical knowledge and experience
#+end_quote

True, and I'm not saying that 17 year old HP should be more capable than Voldemort, just that he should be at least as capable as a 17 year old Tom Riddle that has Harry's resources and incentive to succeed.

This is where the power that he knows not comes in.

#+begin_quote
  The only way I could see them truly being equals, is if Voldemort resurrects himself when Harry is well into adulthood. Now, that, would be an interesting story, and one I'd read for sure.
#+end_quote

Definitely sounds like it could be interesting. I haven't come across a fic where is return is delayed another two decades.

I know this isn't it, but the closest thing I can think of is linkffn(5461900).
