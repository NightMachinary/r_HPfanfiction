I would be interested in a Harry that's maybe like Voldemort at 17. But almost every Harry in a fic like that tends to beat Voldemort through magic alone, which I just don't see happening.

For me, the power he knows not, more than love is empathy. Voldemort lacks it entirely. That's why he doesn't realize that Dumbledore allowed Snape to kill him. That's also why he doesn't realize the type of protection that Lily and Harry placed when they died. He can analyze opponents, an excellent strategist, but he misses the key part, which is empathy. He missed Snape's true purpose because he could never understand how much Snape loved Lily, etc.

In the end, a tom-like Harry (magic only) could probably keep up with Voldemort, and beat many death eaters (which canon Harry does, he's pretty slick with a wand), but I still don't see him beating Voldemort mano a mano.
