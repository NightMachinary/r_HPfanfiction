Isn't that the definition of arrogance. So confident in your strengths you don't acknowledge your weaknesses?

Voldemort, in his arrogance, didn't think anyone would ever find his horcruxes. Voldemort, in his arrogance, took Harry's blood, without realizing the consequences. Voldemort never once looked into the connection that he and Harry shared. If Dumbledore figured out that Harry was a Horcrux, I think Voldemort could have come to that conclusion with some research. Voldemort in the end was his own downfall.

My final point, even if Harry was a genius amount geniuses like Tom Riddle, Tom would still have 50+ years of practical knowledge and experience. The only way I could see them truly being equals, is if Voldemort resurrects himself when Harry is well into adulthood. Now, that, would be an interesting story, and one I'd read for sure.

(side note: there was a one shot in a collection of false starts where voldemort goes through the veil to a universe with Tom Riddle and Harry Potter and Dumbledore as the 3 wizards who define their generation, and it was quite good. I really wish I remembered the link :( )
