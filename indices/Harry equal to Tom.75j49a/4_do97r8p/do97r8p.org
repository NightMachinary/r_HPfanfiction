I do have to point out, that Harry's defeat of Tom in canon was one of my favorite parts. A little plot-padded for sure, but given the canon facts, far more realistic than several fanfics.

Here are the facts: -Tom is a genius among geniuses -He's had about 60 years on Harry when it comes to understanding and furthering his magic -He's on par with Dumbledore, another genius among geniuses who has about 40 years on him.

Tom Riddle truly is a once in a century wizard. Harry is fantastic to be sure. Maybe he could have been a little more interested in magic in canon. But in the end, I see him on par with people like Snape and McGonagall by the time he's Head Auror (youngest ever, so he's clearly good at what he does).

I really like that Harry defeated Tom by understanding him intimately. When Tom Riddle dies, there isn't another personal alive who knew him so well. Harry understands his motives, his decision-making process, his abilities. He understands his weak point is his own arrogance, and specifically his empathy, which I consider to be Harry's strong suit.
