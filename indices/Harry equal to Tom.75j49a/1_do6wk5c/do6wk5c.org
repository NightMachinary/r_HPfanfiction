Something of a nitpick, but the prophecy says that one of its subjects will /mark the other as their equal/, not that they necessarily are. And marked Harry is, by the act of Tom choosing to treat him as an equal in his act of going after him in person.

That said, while it's only a one-shot and thus it skims over a lot of things, “Business” (linkao3(1113588)) may have what you are looking for, at least to a degree.

Outside of that there kind of is “Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality”, but for one spoilers and for another it's a somewhat ... controversial story and not without a reason.

Oh, and there is “Heir of Dracula” (linkffn(8517195)), but that's ... kind of a wank, and it's a mild crossover with Castlevania. If you do want a dark Harry who does stuff, though, it's definitely an enjoyable ride even if it's a guilty pleasure kind of thing.
