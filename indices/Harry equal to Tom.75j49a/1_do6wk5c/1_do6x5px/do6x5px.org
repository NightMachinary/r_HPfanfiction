Not to nitpick back but by "marking" someone as your equal its implied that they ARE your equal. Adding further to this is the implication that they have power you know not, implying that not only are they your equal but they have an advantage in some way.

Now I realize that you could interpret it to mean that the person marking the other as their equal could simply have made a mistake, but the way prophecies work implies that's not the case and that Harry is a true equal to Voldemort in some way. Although to be fair its possible to be an equal in a certain area but not other areas and the prophecy is vague.
