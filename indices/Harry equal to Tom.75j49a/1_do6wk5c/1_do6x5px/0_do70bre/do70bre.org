And to add to that, we are led to believe that this one prophecy is one that only mattered because of a choice, Tom's choice in particular. While I do agree that we are likely all used by now to prophecies mattering in stories simply because they are prophecies, of the two prophecies in this series that we see one relies on someone choosing not to ignore it to work at all, and the other seems to only be there for dramatic effect. There's a lot of bullshitting one can do when it comes to what the prophecies mean and how they work, really.

I can see why someone would choose to interpret the prophecy the way you have, for whatever reason. I just do not think it a universal enough view to justify starting a post with “The prophesy says that Harry is Tom's equal” and not having a counterpoint made.
