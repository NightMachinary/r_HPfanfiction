  Something of a nitpick, but the prophecy says that one of its subjects will mark the other as their equal, not that they necessarily are. And marked Harry is, by the act of Tom choosing to treat him as an equal in his act of going after him in person.

I mean. I guess. But it seems rather silly to have the prophecy talk about someone who is marked-as-equal-but-actually-isn't.

  That said, while it's only a one-shot and thus it skims over a lot of things, “Business” (linkao3(1113588)) may have what you are looking for, at least to a degree.

That's a pretty good fic. Other than the skipping issue you mentioned, the biggest problem I have with it is that, from what I remember, it seems to be telling us that the Wizarding underworld just /didn't exist/ before Harry. Which is pretty ridiculous.

Yeah it's got quite a few problems, but it definitely had parts it did really well. That Voldemort is one of my favorites.

  If you do want a dark Harry who does stuff
#+end_quote

I /don't/ want a dark Harry. I want him to be a good guy, but for him to be willing to do bad things to bad people.

Thanks for the recommendations.
