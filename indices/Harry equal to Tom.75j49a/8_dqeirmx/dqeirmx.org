I know this is an old discussion, but I'm going to chime in hear anyway. Maybe the prophecy wasn't comparing Harry and Voldemort directly, via magical strength or cunning or anything like that. Maybe, instead, it was comparing their ability to gather effective people to their cause.

Voldemort had his Death Eaters. Harry started Dumbledore's Army. Voldemort had Bellatrix. Harry had Hermione. Voldemort has incredible magical skill? Harry had Dumbledore watching his back. To me the only real comparisons that can drawn between Harry and Tom is that (going on the vague memories of hero worship I remember from the books and movies), they were able to attract people, either through circumstance (Boy-who-Lived) or skill (Tom Riddle); the difference is just that Tom choose to actually start his cult, while Harry only did so when pushed.
