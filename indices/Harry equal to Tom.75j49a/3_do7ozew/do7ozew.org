I recently started, and cant stop to read : A Cadmean Victory ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory]])

honestly.... this is soooooo freaking good. Read the Summary on what to expect. Also the romance is rather (atleast up until where i am atm (chapter 35) really in the style of JKR kinda.
