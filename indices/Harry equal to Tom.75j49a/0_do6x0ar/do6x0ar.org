This would make a great discussion on here. I have to applaud you for bringing up the point that the prophecy literally implies that Harry is Tom's equal, but will have additional power not known to Tom. And yet, both in canon and in a significant chunk of fan fiction we don't really see Harry being equal to Tom in nearly any way. Whether power, mindset, cunning, attitude, smarts, or whatever you want to use as a measurement.
