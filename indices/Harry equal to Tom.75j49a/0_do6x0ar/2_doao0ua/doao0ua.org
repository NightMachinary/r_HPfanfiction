  This would make a great discussion on here.

What do you mean by that? People can post topics for discussion I guess?

  I have to applaud you for bringing up the point that the prophecy literally implies that Harry is Tom's equal, but will have additional power not known to Tom.

Thanks. Yeah this bothers me a lot. There's the prophecy, then there's the blatant lies that the Sorting Hat says about Harry.

I want fics where Harry = Tom, but Harry makes up for the experience difference and wins because of the power Tom knows not.

Tom Riddle did amazing, unprecedented things motivated only by his own ambition.

How far would he had gone if he had someone like Voldemort gunning for him?

  we don't really see Harry being equal to Tom in nearly any way.

Pretty much the only way I can see that he's Tom's equal is that he is absurdly brave and seems to have extreme willpower. Oh! Harry would also kick Tom's ass on the Quidditch pitch - but he didn't even get into that on his own, he was shoved onto the team lol.

That's about it.

Edit: Forgot about something that Harry is equal to Tom at.

Edit: Derp. I see there's a discussion flair.
