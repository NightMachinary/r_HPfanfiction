Arc Of Sacrifices, starting with linkffn(2580283) is dang long, though it's WBWL and Drarry so, it may not be your particular cup of tea. It's also super angsty.

Lionsnake Chronicles linkffn(10179438) is likewise pretty long, pretty unfinished and, in my humble opinion, pretty terrible... but you didn't say they had to be good though so [[https://media.giphy.com/media/22xfPU5c9YeGI/giphy.gif][uhhhhhh]]
