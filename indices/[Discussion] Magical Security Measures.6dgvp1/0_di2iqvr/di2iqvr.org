Harry successfully used the imperius curse to get through most of the defences. I suspect Voldemort is far more practised with that particular curse. He wouldn't have needed any disguise either since he was attached to Quirrell who was a respected teacher from his time as the muggle-studies professor.

Voldemort has also shown the ability to fly without assistance. It is possible he taught this to quirrell and so was able to navigate the tunnels without the need for a cart. The Goblins also discovered the break in/were alerted or it wouldn't have been in the paper. This could have been because Voldemort simply blasted down the doors of the vault or assaulted a goblin or two. Can you memory charm a goblin? Could you have imperiused one for the theft then remove their memory for a relatively clean get-away?

With regards to the stone at Hogwarts. The best defence is of course secrecy. If nobody knew the stone was there then nobody would be looking for it. This easily ties into the fidelius charm but I think that has been discussed enough already. My personal preference would be to transfigure one of the castle's stone blocks place the stone inside and reverse the transfiguration. Perhaps set up an elaborate network of curses somewhere else as a distraction but if there was no warnings or other measures then there would be no way to tell one chuck of wall from another. We know from canon that all magic leaves traces. If that is meant in an rather vague way or not it could be extrapolated to give the idea that high usage of magic defending something like the stone is a bit of a give-away.
