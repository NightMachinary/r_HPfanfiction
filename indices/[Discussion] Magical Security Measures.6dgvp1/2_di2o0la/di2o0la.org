Another obstacle could be the sheer size of the place. Vault 713 implies there are at least 712 other vaults and it is miles underground; you would have to either know which vault you were looking for or imperius someone who does. If it is so secret, not everyone would know.

Another security method I didn't see mentioned here was enchantments on the objects themselves. The items in the Lestrange vault had Geminio and Flagrante curses on them to make it harder to steal. It probably doesn't have a direct correlation to Voldemort's break in, but there would have to be a way to dispell the curse on the items so the owners could remove it from the vault. There may be ways to dispell the curses on the other traps. Or if you plan to have Voldemort spend time researching, you could have Quirrell research the curses used on items in Gringotts only to not need the information.

For things Voldemort can't dispell, you could look at how the Goblins get past the obstacles themselves. The dragons were trained to fear the clangers. Sphinxes maybe can only choose from a small set of riddles. If there is a cerberus, play it some music. The door can be bypassed by imperiusing a Gringotts goblin, though the Thief's Downfall will cancel out the imperius.
