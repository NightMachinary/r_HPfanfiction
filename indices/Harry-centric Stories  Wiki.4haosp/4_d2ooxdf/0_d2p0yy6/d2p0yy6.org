linkffn(Morning in the Land of Nod by Zeitgeist84) This is a bit of an oddity, but I found that I like my westerns post-apocalyptic, inspired by /Mad Max/, and containing copious Bowie references.

linkffn(The Gunslinger and the Mage) is a /Dark Tower/ series crossover that I really enjoyed. Spoiler warning for /DT/, just in case.
