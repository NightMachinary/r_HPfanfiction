So is linkffn(Always and Always) rebirth or time travel? They die, but so that their memories go back to their previous bodies, going back in time. linkffn(169)? Hermione is supposed to go back, (spoilers) but doesn't actually, and ends up living out her life.

Neither of which belong on this thread, but still, they make my point.
