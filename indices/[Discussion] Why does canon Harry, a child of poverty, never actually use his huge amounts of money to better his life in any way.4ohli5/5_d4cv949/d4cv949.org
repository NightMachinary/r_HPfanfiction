Well, one explanation would be that he is also a child of psychological abuse and as such may subconsciously hold back on spending his own money on himself while readily offering it to people that care about him. Its a interesting phenomenon that people who are constantly told they'Re worthless eventually believe it and never really let go of that belief once they're adults.

But Harry got out of the Dursleys grasp with almost no scars whatsoever - or at least not enough to have the abuse argument on a solid foundation. He does show some symptoms, like his small circle of friends and his easily broken trust, but its by far not enough for a decade worth of neglect and abuse.

A much better argument would be to look at how poor people who got rich fast, normally react. There are two ways that happen regularly. One, which is the newspaper and "10 dumb lottery winners"-Youtube video material, are those who blow all caution out of the window and want to life the big life they always dreamed about. They normally end up back in poverty, often even worse than before. Harry would be on the other side of this spectrum, the people that react with extreme caution to new wealth. There are millionaires out there who still live in the projects, despite their ability to buy any suburban lil' paradise they'd want. They still drive their old, dented car and still work their shifts, because they have a almost panical fear of loosing what they gained. Harry isn't that extreme, he still buys new robes instead of second hand. However, Harry never tries the upper limits. He's content with his Nimbus. He's content with his old muggle cast-offs, because they're enough. What leaves a bit of a dent in this argument is the fact that he'd readily share his wealth with others.

But then again, Harry isn't atypical for his background, so any explanation will suffice.
