It's not just the money.

Harry had a great time in Diagon Alley after turning 'Aunt Marge' into a Zeppelin. He never holidays in Diagon again. He doesn't even try. He asks his Headmaster if he can stay at school, is told 'no' and schleps off to Durzkaban, sad and passive.

Even if we/you/I write so he can't pull it off, it would be in character for him to try and to not stop trying until he got the result he wanted or an answer to his satisfaction.

He wants nothing more than a family but does nothing to learn about the Potters or the Evans.

Sirius sent him a letter by means of some tropical postal bird, a message from some place safe that isn't Privet Drive, but Harry never decides he's a pasty white English lad in need of a nice hot noonday sun to walk under.

As much as I hate passive Harry, it's what she wrote.
