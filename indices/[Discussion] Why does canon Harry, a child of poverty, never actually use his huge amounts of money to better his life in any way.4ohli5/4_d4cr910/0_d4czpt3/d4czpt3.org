It is what she wrote. I would just like to say that very few stories actually go into detail about his family. Most go for the cliche of him getting money and 'family magic', but never really talk about the people in his family. You raise a point I often think about when you say he doesn't get to know about either sets of grandparents. I could see where he might not care about say extended family, but as someone who only had a single alive grandparent for any time I actually remember I definitely spent a lot of time later on asking as many questions as I could about my others. I know I'm projecting a bit, but the point still stands like you said. He is supposedly all about family, but apart from a wife and kids he never actually wants to know about the rest of his family. As far as we see in the books he doesn't even really try to get too close to Sirus or Remus.

Sorry for rambling a bit.
