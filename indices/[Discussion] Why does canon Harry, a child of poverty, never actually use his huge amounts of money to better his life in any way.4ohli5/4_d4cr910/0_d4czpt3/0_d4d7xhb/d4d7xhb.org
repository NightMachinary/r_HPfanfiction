The first rule of a life with the Dursleys was "don't ask questions". This is a kid who's been yelled at or punished his whole life for asking about anything, and I think life with the Dursleys had an affect on him that people aren't accounting for when they get mad at his lack of curiosity or outreach or expectations.
