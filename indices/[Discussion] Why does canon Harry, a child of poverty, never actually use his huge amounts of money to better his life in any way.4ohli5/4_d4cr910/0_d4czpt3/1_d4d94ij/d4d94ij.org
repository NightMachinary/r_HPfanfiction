The way I see it, the Dursley's specifically focused on punishing any expression of curiosity, desire, and independent action. Harry was punished if he did not passively comply, and especially punished for any questions about his parents: these things are hard to overcome.

He still retained a lot of curiosity and independence/self-starting, and when he first learns about magic that shines through: he gets excited and starts reading his books (see where Hedwig's name came from), and asks some questions of Hagrid (but not really as many as he would have, unDurslied). Then he gets on the train to Hogwarts and meets his first ever friend, and his first ever friend is lazy and complacent about magic and does not value studying and makes fun of people reading to learn outside of narrow parameters. It doesn't matter whether Ron is gently teasing or being aggressive: Harry can't take that from his first ever friend, as seen with how he doesn't stand up to Ron when he is absolutely beastly to Hermione in PoA. And so Harry learns not to be too keen about his magical education either, although he still seems to enjoy holiday homework in the early years.

Harry keeps a lot of thoughts to himself in canon, and doesn't rock the boat unless he really has to (or is channelling Volderage through his poorly-dealt-with grief and depression).
