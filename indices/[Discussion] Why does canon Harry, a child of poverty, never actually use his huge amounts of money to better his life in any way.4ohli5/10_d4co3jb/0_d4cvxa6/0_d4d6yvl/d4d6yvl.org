What 11 year old child would even think of doing that? At the end of the day, you go back to the Durables. That's just what you do. He's have to take out money from the bank. Can he even do that? Is it allowed? He's have to find a place to stay. What if they're full or won't allow a child to make the reservation? How does he get back to the Durables on his own?
