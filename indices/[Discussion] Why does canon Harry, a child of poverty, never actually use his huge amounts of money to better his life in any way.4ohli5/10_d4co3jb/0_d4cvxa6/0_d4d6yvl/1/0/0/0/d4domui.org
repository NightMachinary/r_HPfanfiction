I was curious so I looked it up:

  There was a train to London in five minutes' time. Hagrid, who didn't understand "Muggle money," as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.

  Hagrid helped Harry onto the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope. "Yer ticket fer Hogwarts," he said.

  On the last day of August he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.

  "Er- Uncle Vernon?"

  Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.

  Er- I need to be at King's Cross tomorrow to - to go to Hogwarts.

  Uncle Vernon grunted again.

  Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?

  Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.

  "Thank you."

  blah blah blah. 9 3/4 isn't real

  "Barking," said Uncle Vernon, "howling mad, the lot of them. You'll see. You just wait. All right, we'll take you to King's Cross. We're going to London tomorrow anyway or I wouldn't bother." (to get Dudley's pig tail removed before Smeltings.)

  A second, very small parcel contained a note.

  /We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia./ Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.

So Hagrid did provide money for train fare to Diagon Alley. Based on that I'd wager he paid for fare back as well, especially since it said he "helped Harry onto the train" home. Hagrid handed Harry an envelope for his Hogwarts Express ticket, but it doesn't say he gave Harry any additional money. I don't think Hagrid would think of gifting him some money (especially since it's the school's, not his, and that it's not ideal for Harry to be wandering around Diagon/Knockturn Alley alone) and I don't think Harry would accept it anyway.

I don't think Harry had any muggle money anyways, based off of his general life at the Dursleys and the fifty pence gift. I think other gifts he's received from them have been Vernon's socks and nose tissues. They're not exactly handing him cash for his birthday, or celebrating anything with him gift-wise at all. Harry doesn't have muggle money for train fare even if he is walking distance to the train. He /could/ fare evade, but I don't think that's in his nature and think he wouldn't do it on the chance that it could jeopardize his acceptance in Hogwarts.

Petunia and Vernon won't lift a finger for Harry. They barely carted him to King's Cross (and going to Hogwarts would get him out of their hair!) and only did so because it coincided with their interests (Dudley's depiggifying). They're not going to be dropping him at the station for a day's jaunt to pick up freaky, unnatural things.

Within the limits of his knowledge and age, he doesn't have any options to get to Diagon Alley.
