I agree that he couldn't have gotten the money from the Dursley's. I was more thinking: 1) Did Hargid give the exactly right amount for three trips (two in, one out) with no change? 2) Why couldn't Harry trade a golden coin with someone at the station or elsewhere for the money to buy a ticket? From what I can quickly google, the ticket costs either 3.05 or 4.15 pounds for a child, and either 6.10 or 8.30 pounds for an adult. So on his birthday the tickets would cost between 18.3 pounds and 12.2 and 16.6 pounds. No matter what notes Hagird gave him, he would have change. Did Hagrid take the change back? Why? It seems much more in character for Hagrid to insist Harry keep the money. The UK doesn't have one and 2 pound notes, the lowest is 5 pounds. So by my reckoning, Harry should have between 2.80 and 3.40 pounds, possibly just enough to go back in to London.
