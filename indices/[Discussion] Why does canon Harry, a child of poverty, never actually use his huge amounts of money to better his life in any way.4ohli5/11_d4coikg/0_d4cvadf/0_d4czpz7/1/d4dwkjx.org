There's a reference in OP: "Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waistband on Harry's jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight (which was saying something as the jeans had once been Dudley's)."

But to be fair he probably wasn't wearing his nicest clothes to lounge around the Burrow. Even if he did have plenty of t-shirts and jeans, he might not have pitched everything that belonged to Dudley, especially the things that fit okay if not perfectly.
