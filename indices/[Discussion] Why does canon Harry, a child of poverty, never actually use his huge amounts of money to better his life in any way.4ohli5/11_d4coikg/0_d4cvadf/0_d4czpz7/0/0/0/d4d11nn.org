Do you want to provoke an argument? Because we could argue, but I really don't want to.

  But I'm sure the Dursleys never bought him any and we would've seen if the Weasleys did so. Its also never stated that he bought some himself.

  So, /my conclusion/ would be that he kept wearing Dudleys cast-offs.

Where in that do I state that there is no way he could possibly have new clothes? Your condescending tone makes me think you read someone else's answer.

What I wrote is that he never had a scene in which he got a new wardrobe as a gift. New clothes were never among the things important enough to make a scene about it and they were never a character changing part of any book. *My* conclusion - read *my conclusion*, as in, my subjective filler for this lack of information - is that he kept wearing Dudley's old clothes.

I know that you love to be true to your username in this sub, but at least read responses before you respond to them.
