  It's also barely stated that he uses the loo, and rarely if ever stated that he brushes his teeth.

This is a bullshit argument. Buying clothes is not an everyday thing like hygiene and basic bodily functions. It is also a often used symbolic act in literature, to shed the clothes of the past and restore it with the clothes fitting the coming challenges.

  And how many times is it explicitly stated that he's gotten new school robes?

It got one scene, when it, along with the rest of his tour through Diagon, symbolizes his coming into the magical world. He changes his ill-fitting muggle clothes with fitting wizard robes. He goes from the world that didn't fit him into the one that does. Just like this scene, getting new clothes from either the Dursleys or the Weasleys (or anyone, really) could have made a scene, symbolizing a new change and crossroad.

  Rowling, for all her faults, might be aware that the Great Diagon Alley Shopping Trip In Complete, Hair-Pulling Detail is best done like once in seven books.

And here we come to the condescending part. You're putting my response within the same ranks of a dull equipment shopping trip of a fanfic, even though I have never even touched that subject. You're responding as if I'd advocate that Harry obviously needed such a shopping-list-scene in every book Rowling has written.

You either didn't understand what I wrote, or you didn't want to understand what I wrote and hoped for a little bit of petty online debate. Well, there you go.
