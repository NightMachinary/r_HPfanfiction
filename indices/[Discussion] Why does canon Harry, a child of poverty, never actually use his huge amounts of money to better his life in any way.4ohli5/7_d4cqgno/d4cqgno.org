It's probably a mixture of childhood conditioning (i.e. the constant put downs make him grateful for just the things he has), the lack of access to the funds he does have (vault keys) and the possible avoidance of him being portrayed as being spoiled by his wealth.

I tend to think that the books have always been primarily aimed at children, so these criticisms usually go by unnoticed. Looking at canon from an adult's perspective it seems so devoid of compassion and sympathy - like Harry not even being given the opportunity to visit his parents' graves during Year 1. Even a passing comment of "I am not ready" would have given the impression that others were thinking of his well-being.
