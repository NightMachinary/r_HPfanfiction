Except they also taught almost every single member of the Order, as well as most of the Aurors. How many of them fell in the line of action? How many children must they give special treatment to? Or are orphaned/motherless/fatherless kids only worth showing affection to if they die facing Voldemort? Is Neville less worthy of special treatment because his parents aren't actually dead? Do you have any idea how many favourite students teachers their age have?

It's not their job to show him his parent's graves, and frankly it would be quite creepy for one of my boarding school teachers to have done that. They aren't his parents, and McGonagall and Dumbledore give him enough leeway as it is. Should they cancel the Halloween feast every year because that's the day his parents died?
