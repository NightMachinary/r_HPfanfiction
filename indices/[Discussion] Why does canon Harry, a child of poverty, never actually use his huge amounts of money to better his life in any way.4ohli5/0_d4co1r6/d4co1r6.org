I don't think Rowling dropped the ball; I think it's just Harry's characterization.

Harry, having grown up without much of his own, seems to generally be cautious with his money when it comes to himself. He's generous when it comes to other people though, like sharing his sweets with Ron during their first trip on the Hogwarts Express, or giving away the Triwizard Tournament prize money to the Weasley twins.

Not only that, but he has a great example of what "having too much" looks like in Dudley. Harry would want to resemble his spoilt cousin as little as possible, both in deeds and looks.
