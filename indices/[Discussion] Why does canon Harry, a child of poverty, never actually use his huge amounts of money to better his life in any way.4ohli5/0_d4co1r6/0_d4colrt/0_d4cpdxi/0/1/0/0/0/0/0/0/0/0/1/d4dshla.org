Intelligence gathering organisations should know about mercenaries. Especially since Voldemort might hire those as well. And a small world is no bar to have mercenaries. It might even make it easier to recruit them. Also, I don't mean criminals. I mean people who know how to fight, and will do so if paid. They might even be working for a Ministry in another country, but willing to take a "vacation" for a year or so, to fight in Britain, if paid enough. Or just paid enough so they can afford to spend a year without payment from their old job.
