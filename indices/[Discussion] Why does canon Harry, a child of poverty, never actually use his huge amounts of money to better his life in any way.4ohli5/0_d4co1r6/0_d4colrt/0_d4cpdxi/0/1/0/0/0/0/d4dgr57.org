Kinda? Everyone willing to help Harry was already helping him- for free. If you bring money to the equation, you're bringing people who are in it for the money, not for the cause, which means they can easily be swayed for a larger sum. Not all of them, but it only takes one. If we're basing this around the time Dumbledore died, before the ministy fell (which I'm assuming, since showing his face after Voldy took over the ministry would be suicide) then there are no Snatchers to catch, and I'm fairly certain there's already bounties on Death Eaters placed by the Ministry.

I'll give you the supplies thing. Fucking hell, Hermione, if you're so smart couldn't you have gotten some freakin cans of soup at least? Or does the excessive magic in the bag makes cans stop working too?
