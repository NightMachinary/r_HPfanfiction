Okay, this is a hard thing to debate because you and I clearly have entirely different views of the world. For the sake of argument lets assume there are criminals for hire in the wizarding world, just as there are in our world.

I have no clue how to go about hiring some sort of hitman, or a team of thieves, or anything else that could be considered mercenary-ish. You say that someone in the Order should know how to contact these people or Dumbledore fucked up.

I think your view of the Order is very wrong. They aren't a group of fighters, they are an intelligence gathering organization. A bunch of people from all walks of life sharing knowledge. Dung is a petty criminal, he could fence stolen property, but would he know how to hire killers? Mad-Eye would arrest them if he knew any.

This is also assuming that any contract killers wouldn't be associated with an organization that fosters sadism. I say that if these people do exist they're probably death eaters who got a taste for violence in the '70s then put their skills to use afterword.

Now I'll go ahead and say I don't think they exist at all. The wizarding world is small. Everyone knows everyone. It isn't large enough for this sort of thing to exist.
