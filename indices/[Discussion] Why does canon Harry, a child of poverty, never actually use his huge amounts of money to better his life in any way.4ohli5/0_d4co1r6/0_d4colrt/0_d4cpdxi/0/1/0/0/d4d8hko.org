He wouldn't even let Lupin into the gang, do you think he's gonna trust a mercenary? All voldie's gotta do is offer more money and bam, he turns on harry. Not the smartes play when your adversary also has plenty of resources.

He had plenty of supplies. A whole bag of em. Potions too. We could postulate that Hermione used his money to buy all those things, it's obviously not canon, but it's a possibility.

Bribing is not really his thing, is it? Plus it falls on the same category that the mercenaries do. It's just not a very good idea to rely on people who are in it for the money when your opponent has you beaten on the monetary aspect.
