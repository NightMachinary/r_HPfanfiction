There's a couple possible reasons for this.

He doesn't want to be like Malfoy.

He doesn't want to rub his money in the face of his poverty-stricken best friend.

He's not used to having money to spend and thus doesn't really think of it as a potential solution when faced with a problem.

He doesn't want the Dursleys to find out and potentially try to confiscate the money or the things he might buy with it.

He simply doesn't care about money. It's Ron's dream to be rich and famous. Harry just wants it all to go away, instead wishing for a nice quiet life with a loving family.
