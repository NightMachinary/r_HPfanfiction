  This implies that his towering stacks of gold and mountains of silver discribed in the first book are way more than a meager tuition fund.

Two things - first, there's no tuition at Hogwarts, and second, the 'towering stacks' are from the perspective of a rather poor eleven-year-old. It's possible that there's a lot of money, but also possible that it's just a moderate amount that can be used for school supplies and such, but doesn't make him as wealthy as (for example) the Malfoys or something.
