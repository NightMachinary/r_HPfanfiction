"huge amount of money". We don't know how much he actually had. What we see is from Harry's eyes, and he's a poor, impressionable child at the time who never had more than 5 quid in his life up to that point. So, when he sees mounds of gold and silver, it could seem like a massive amount, when it is likely just a few thousand galleons.

Which, to be fair, is still a large amount, but not exactly enough to do anything too significant with. It's enough to get him through school, and maybe rent a flat for a year after, but it's not like it's enough where he'd never have to work ever again, or buy businesses.
