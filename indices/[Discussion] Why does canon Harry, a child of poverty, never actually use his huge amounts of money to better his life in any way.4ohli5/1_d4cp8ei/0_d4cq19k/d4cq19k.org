Harry's net worth is never mentioned outright, but it's been implied that he's, at the least, comfortably off. Considering the new information on his family's background, though, he might have a bit more than that.

With the price of Galleons known, Harry's wealthiness (or lack of) can then be extrapolated from textual evidence.
