Is there some information on Pottermore or something that makes people say they were secondhand glasses? I'd have thought it would be cheaper and more convenient for him to have ended up with free NHS glasses, which Petunia would know would mark him out anyway, and it makes sense that he'd have been caught in an eye test at school maybe, Petunia would have been told and would have acted concerned, have ostentatiously booked a (free) eye test at Boots or something, and Harry would have got his free NHS glasses.

She could have got free pairs every 6 months, I think, when he was young, but it seems more likely to me that something like the shrinking jumper and growing hair happened to grow his glasses with his head, slowly enough that nobody noticed or thought to ask.
