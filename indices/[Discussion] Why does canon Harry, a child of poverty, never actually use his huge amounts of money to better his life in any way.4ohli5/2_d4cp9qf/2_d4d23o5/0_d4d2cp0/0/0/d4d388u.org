  No, I don't want to read "Harry Potter and the Appointment with the Optometrist", having Hermione ask him about his new glasses when she sees him for the first time of the Summer isn't out of the question. "Yeah, Hermione, I slipped away and got new glasses. I'm going to need every advantage I can while we go traipsing around the forest."
