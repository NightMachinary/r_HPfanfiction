Did he? When? When was there an opportunity to get it done? After 4th Year, he was hiding out at the Dursleys until he was taken to the Weasleys (or Grimmauld Place). If he got them during his 3rd year, he's still using years' old glasses by the time he's 17--and as you say, they wouldn't fit right.

Unless he's just using charms to make them bigger--but that would distort the prescription even further.

No, I don't want to read "Harry Potter and the Appointment with the Optometrist", having Hermione ask him about his new glasses when she sees him for the first time of the Summer isn't out of the question. "Yeah, Hermione, I slipped away and got new glasses. I'm going to need every advantage I can while we go traipsing around the forest."
