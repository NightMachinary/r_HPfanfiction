To be honest, what would he buy? Hogwarts provides free education, food, and housing, which gets all the basic necessities out of the way. Anything he could buy for summer vacation is wasted because he's basically stuck in prison.

So, the only way he can improve his own life with his money is by lavishly spending it on people he cares for. Which is a difficult prospect when:

A. Your best friend hates being reminded that he's poor when you spend money on him.

B. Your other best friend, well, she pretty much just likes books.

So, not a lot of opportunity to make it rain, really.
