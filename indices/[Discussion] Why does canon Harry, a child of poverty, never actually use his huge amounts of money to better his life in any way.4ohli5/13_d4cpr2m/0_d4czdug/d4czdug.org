Technically it's not a room full of silver and gold, for one. Also poor people tend to fall into two extremes when they come into money: go absolute nuts (see Weasleys and trip to Egypt) or hoard their money forever (see Harry).

In addition I'd hesitate to call book one Harry /poor/, which frankly seems like a statement from someone that's never actually known lack. He lives in this weird mix of abundance and penury.
