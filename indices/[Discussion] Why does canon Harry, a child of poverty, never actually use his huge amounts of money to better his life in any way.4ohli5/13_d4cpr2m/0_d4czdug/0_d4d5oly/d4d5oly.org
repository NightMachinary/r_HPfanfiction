I wasn't sure how to phrase it. I always got the impression that the Dursleys were comfortable but Harry saw little of that benefit. Things like his glasses would be free in the UK due to the NHS. He sleeps in a cupboard which is likely in the UK to be much smaller than Americans might imagine, and canonically never gets affection, gifts or celebrations of his birthday or his presence during e.g. Christmas, toys, enough food, or even clothes of his own. A child raised like that alongside a child who is given everything and worshipped... doesn't ever want to redress that imbalance when he comes upon money?
