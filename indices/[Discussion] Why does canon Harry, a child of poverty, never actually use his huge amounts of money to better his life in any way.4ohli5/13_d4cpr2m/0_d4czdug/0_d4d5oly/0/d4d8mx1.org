  I always got the impression that the Dursleys were comfortable but Harry saw little of that benefit.
#+end_quote

Except he does get part of that benefit. You might consider it a retcon but in Deathly Hallows he reminisces about watching TV and playing on Dudley's computer to his heart's content whenever the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves. He hated going to Mrs Figg's not just because she was, well, boring, but because she was boring-/er/ than what he could be doing otherwise.

  He sleeps in a cupboard which is likely in the UK to be much smaller than Americans might imagine
#+end_quote

Except it's a cupboard that can fit a bed, Harry and Vernon without pressing them all up against each other, so much bigger than fandom likes to act though an inexcusable thing to do to a child bigger than a toddler, and not even to a toddler considering it was a three(?)-bedroom house.

  and canonically never gets affection, gifts or celebrations of his birthday or his presence during e.g. Christmas, toys
#+end_quote

True. However birthday and Christmas gifts are a luxury, and the lack of them isn't exactly what I'd use to measure people as /poor/.

  enough food
#+end_quote

True again, for Harry before Hogwarts and Harry in the beginning of CoS. After that he just eats in their faces because Sirius, which was the most amazing thing he ever did to them

  or even clothes of his own.
#+end_quote

He has clothes of his own. They just happen to be clothes that don't fit him because they belonged to his obese cousin (and he himself is slight). Not having clothes of your own is desperately patching the same pair of jeans for the second year running because other than a cheap pair of polyester pants for work they're the only bottoms you own, but buying a new pair is a choice that means less food or no medicine for that week. /That/ is lack, not what Harry's been through.

  A child raised like that alongside a child who is given everything and worshipped... doesn't ever want to redress that imbalance when he comes upon money?
#+end_quote

You've been given multiple instances in this thread of Harry wanting to redress that imbalance, including needing to be restrained from buying a solid gold cauldron. (Snape would've /eaten/ him, but of course he couldn't know that). I mean, he literally buys one of every single sweet on the Hogwarts Express just because he can.
