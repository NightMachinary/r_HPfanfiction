Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure your mother isn't anywhere close to the body size of Vernon. I mean, this is the man that Dudley got his genetics from. I have no idea how Rowling pictured him fitting in there alongside a bed and probably a tiny box or chest of drawers (Harry changes in his room). Did he enter his room in the movie? I forget.

But yeah, I've read fics where Harry can barely move without hitting part of his body on something when he's in the cupboard, or where he's been stunted to the size of an eight year old because he had no room to grow. Strangely enough this is always paired with the most horrific forms of abuse. You'd think I'd have learnt the warning signs by now.

And wow, I forgot about the guest room. Probably mentioned around Marge?
