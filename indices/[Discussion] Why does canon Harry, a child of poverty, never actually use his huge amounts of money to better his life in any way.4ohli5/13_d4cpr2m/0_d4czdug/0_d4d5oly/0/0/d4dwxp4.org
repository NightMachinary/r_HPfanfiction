  Except it's a cupboard that can fit a bed, Harry and Vernon without pressing them all up against each other, so much bigger than fandom likes to act though an inexcusable thing to do to a child bigger than a toddler, and not even to a toddler considering it was a three(?)-bedroom house.

Our house has a cupboard under the stairs, and it's roughly the size of the one used in the films. I don't think there's that much variation, there's only so small you can make a set of stairs. It was claustrophobic but my 6'0'' mother can sort of crouch in the doorway or inside the cupboard itself, it's just exceedingly uncomfortable. Which is probably why Uncle Vernon's conversation with Harry was not very long.

You could also fit in a child-size bed in there. You might even be able to fit an adult mattress, it's just that the bottom section of the mattress would probably be touching the ceiling because the roof is so heavily slanted.

And for the record, the Dursleys had four bedrooms. One for Dudley, one for Vernon and Petunia, one for guests, one for Dudley's toys. Let me repeat that. The Dursleys had /two/ extra bedrooms, and chose to put Harry in a cupboard. TWO.
