Okay responsers, I'm going to reply to you in a group.

He lives in /a magic world/. There's all sorts of things he could potentially buy! Even beyond practical things like enchanted defenses against the Dursleys. Books, entertainment, clothes of his own beyond his school uniform robes and Dudley's hand me downs... Potions, magical artifacts, better equipment than the minimum specified by the school. Maybe even a mail order book to get some ideas of what he might want to buy.

I just don't buy that a poor kid finds that he owns a room full of silver and gold, the ability to buy things he had always wanted as a younger kid, and then decides to shrug and leave it all there and keep going around as he is.
