linkffn(Shadow of Angmar) is often recommended --- it's a "Harry moving into Middle-Earth"-type story. There's also, I'm told, a bunch of vaguely-terrible stories where Harry is adopted by Elves and ends up shipped with Legolas, or something.

What I have never been able to find is the reverse, a good story where someone /from/ the Legendarium ends up in the HP universe. I mean, I have a vague recollection of a story where the One Ring ended up in Hogwarts, but I couldn't even tell you if it exists or if it was discussed as a tentative plot-bunny somewhere on this sub.
