I think he's more cunning than intelligent (not that he isn't intelligent) in linkffn(On the Way to Greatness). The first few chapters feel like rehashes of canon but it becomes far more original as the story progresses.

Also I have to recommend linkao3(1113588). Hope you don't mind a very morally grey Harry.
