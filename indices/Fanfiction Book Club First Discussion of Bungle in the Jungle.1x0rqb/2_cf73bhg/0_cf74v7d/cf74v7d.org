2nd Person takes a bit of getting used to, but after about 2 chapters in I didn't mind so much. I wouldn't so go far as to say it made the story more /immersive,/ like a choose-your-own-adventure novel, but I stopped noticing after a while.

THe style was fairly simplistic, but I think that worked for what JBern did in this story, sort of like a straightforward commanding voice.
