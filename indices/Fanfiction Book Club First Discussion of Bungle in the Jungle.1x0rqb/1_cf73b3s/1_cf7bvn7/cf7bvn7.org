It's a pretty old story now so there are some of the cliches that are pretty annoying today like the manipulative Dumbledore and Weasleys that probably weren't big cliches back when this was written. Still not great to read but I can give it a break because of that.

*Spoilers*

The strengths of this story is definitely everything after once it catches up to the first chapter. The atmosphere of the lost city is top notch definitely helped by the necro wards and the vast amounts of inferi. I like that Jbern wasn't afraid to let people die, what they were doing was very dangerous and the casualties definitely reflected that.

I liked the interaction with Luna, it seemed more like a normal teenage relationship rather than a love at first sight thing like you can find in a lot of other fanfictions.

As far as bashing goes, I'm never really a fan but it's nice to see that it was distributed fairly evenly. In the vast majority of stories it seems that Hermione and the twins are completely let off the hook for some reason while everybody else gets bashed into the ground.

For me the biggest weakness of the story is the first chapter. I understand what he was trying to do with it but it takes away from the excitement of them fighting their way into the city once the story catches up to that point.
