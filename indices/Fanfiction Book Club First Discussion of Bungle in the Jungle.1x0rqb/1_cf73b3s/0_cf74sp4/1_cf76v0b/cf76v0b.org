I also liked Hack and Kwan :D

I didn't mind the Weasley bashing, I am used to read fanfics that have this, but with Herminone... I read 2 or 3 fanfics that she is against Harry, but I still feel bad every time I read one.

I am woried that the sequel will have to much bashing on her, but I will read it because it is a good story. And I want to know how it ends.
