Things I loved: While I wasn't sure at first about introducing Luna as a dual personality type, one of my favorite parts of the story ended up being the Luna / Harry correspondence. I think it served as a fair balance to an otherwise Cassnova!Harry, who was picking up woman left and right. It made the other relationships seem shallow, while Harry struggled to build a functional relationship with someone his own age.

I also liked the original characters, especially Hack and Kwan.

Thinks i didn't like as much: I thought the Weasley bashing went a little harshly, specifically with Ginny and Molly. The way Harry treated Hermione also made me a bit uncomfortable, but I think that was intentional, signifying Harry becoming jaded and spiteful.
