I agree. In fact, I can't say that JBern has done much with strong female characters in his stories (with the limited exception of Fleur, who doesn't do much.) With Luna, however, it seems that at least Harry has the ability to fuck up his relationships from his side of things.

I haven't read JBern's To Fight the Coming Darkness, with Susan Bones, so maybe he does more with his ladies there.
