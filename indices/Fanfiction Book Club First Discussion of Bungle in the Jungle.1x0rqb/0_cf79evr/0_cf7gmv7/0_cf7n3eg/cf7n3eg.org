The "litmus test" I use for characterisation is this: if you take away a character's most obvious (or "primary") trait, are the "leftovers" still enough to make an interesting character? Real people are more than a single trait, after all.

In the case of Luna in Bungle in the Jungle, once you take away her primary trait -- she's a normal girl pretending to be odd -- what you have left is completely vanilla.
