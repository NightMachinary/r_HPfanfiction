I think JBern did a good job of integrating Muggle Tech into the story, and not overemphasizing it's role. I thought it was especially thoughtful to have some diversity in weapons usage among the mercinaries, with Collins being an obsessive American, to Thundercloud who rarely used them at all. It also helped that Harry did not instantly become Dirty!Harry, and that he resorted to the Shotgun because that was the one weapon he felt he could get a grasp on.

I thought the description of spell-chaining and wards, among other magical innovations, too the emphasis off of muggle tech as well.
