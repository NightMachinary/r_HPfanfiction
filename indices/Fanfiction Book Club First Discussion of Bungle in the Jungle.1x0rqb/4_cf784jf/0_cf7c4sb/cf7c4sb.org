In regards to number 4, I really liked how that animagus stuff was integrated into this story. He got the transformation instantly but it took him some time to really master it. Also, his animagus continues to have a central role in the story and Harry's development which is definitely a lot better than other stories where getting his animagus form is just another step in becoming super!harry as Jbern put it in one of his authors notes.

1-3 I think were handled pretty well. Even at the end of the story Harry would still have gotten his ass kicked by Kwan and probably even Bill, his training definitely didn't give him instant power.

5 was integrated well, muggle weapons definitely weren't the focus of the story nor were they game breakingly powerful so they ended up fitting in pretty well.

6, I don't really have an opinion on this. Hack was pretty funny though.
