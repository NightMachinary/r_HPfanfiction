I have a question:

One of the common tropes in HP Fanfiction is increasing Harry's magical ability in an non-cliche way, to the point where he is powerful enough to actually do some interesting things. How do you feel about the way JBern addressed this issue?

What were things that you felt were plausible or intriguing? What things were not?

Some things JBern did:

1) Give Harry more innate power (including an "aura"), because he is a prophesied one.

2) Have Harry grind it out with Kwan (among others), who were ruthless with his training.

3) Have Harry actually study and practice more, specifically with curse breaking.

4) Instant-animagus ceremony.

5) Use of muggle weapons as a means of non-convention warfare against dedicated magical users.

6) Giving Harry his own kick-ass troll sidekick.
