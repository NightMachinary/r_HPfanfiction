I enjoy reading Super Harry sometimes, I think they are funny.

In this one, even if he get some power quickly, like the animagus (or is it animagi?) ritual, he take time to use it completely.

He study wards and find that he enjoy it and it is not difficult to understand, but he still make mistakes. Bill says that his work is good at first, but he is comparing it with others beginners work.

And the aura, well, he does need something to fight someone that practice magic for more than fifty years. I think the aura is better than if he could fight Voldemort after a few months of study.
