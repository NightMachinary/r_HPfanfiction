SPOILER CHAPTER 22

What did you think of he deamon fight? I was curious to see how they would defeat him, since he could see the future.

I don't know if I didn't read but just pass my eyes through the battle. But I didn't understand how the daemon didn't see that Harry would defeat him.

And if he did see it, why didn't try to change it?

EDIT: I forgot we should only talk till chapter 15, now I put a sing saying that this thread have spoiler of chapter 22.
