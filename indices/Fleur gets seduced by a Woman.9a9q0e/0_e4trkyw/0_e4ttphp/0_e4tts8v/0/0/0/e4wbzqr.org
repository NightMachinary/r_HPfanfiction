I mean, for sure there's a strong genetic component to sexual attraction, but there's certainly room for environment to influence this in the formative years. Also, women tend to be a bit bisexual in nature, and even though it's all Fanon, I have a hard time believing a race of explicitly sexual beings who have (evolved? Been created?) for seduction and sex would be repulsed by F/F.
