> It takes control over them and gives them uncontrollable infatuation for the brewer

​

the same goes for the Imperio. THe Caster can order its Victim to show serious affection AND...of course, it takes over full control.

> You're taking the "any spell can be dark magic" route which everyone goes through before realizing that it's dumb

I didnt said anything of the above. I only stated that any Spell, that can Cause harm, CAN be used to "torture" the Victim and "persuade" it to love the Caster (mindbreak, manipulation, hypnotism). Dark Magic is, if the Caster has to make a sacrifice for it to be fullfilled. The "Common" Spells, tat i stated, arent clearly in that Class. But they can used for for i already mentioned.
