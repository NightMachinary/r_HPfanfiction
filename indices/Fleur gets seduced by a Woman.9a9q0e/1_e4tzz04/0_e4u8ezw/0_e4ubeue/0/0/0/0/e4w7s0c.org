Again. pretty much everyone on this sub thinks that using love potions is very rapey, even in the books. It was used, and it was rapey. Nothing you've said in that comment is wrong, it's definitely frowned upon by the sub to use love potions to rape / molest / "seduce" people against their will, which means that fics that use that as its basic premise are also rapey.
