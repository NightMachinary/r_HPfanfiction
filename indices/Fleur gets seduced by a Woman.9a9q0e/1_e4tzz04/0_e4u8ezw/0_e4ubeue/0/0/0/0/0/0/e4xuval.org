What does a love potion do besides sexually harass people? It takes control over them and gives them uncontrollable infatuation for the brewer. You're taking the "any spell can be dark magic" route which everyone goes through before realizing that it's dumb. Incarcerous isn't rapey unless it's used to rape. Love potions /only/ do rapey things.
