Using those spells to do rapey things is rapey, but that doesn't make the spells rapey. The Imperious Curse is an unforgivable for good reason. Comparing love potions to the Imperious in order to show how love potions aren't so bad really does the opposite. Your definition of Dark Magic is noncanon and not really a popular fanon one either. In my fanon, Dark Magic is any magic that's primary purpose is to do bad things with. That way, Wingardium Leviosa isn't dark because you can hit someone with a club, but the eye exploding curse is because all it does is explode your eyes. I'd even say that things like Stupefy are a bit dark because they cause you to instantly go unconscious. if there wasn't a simple counter-curse, it would probably be on the same level as other dark magic.
