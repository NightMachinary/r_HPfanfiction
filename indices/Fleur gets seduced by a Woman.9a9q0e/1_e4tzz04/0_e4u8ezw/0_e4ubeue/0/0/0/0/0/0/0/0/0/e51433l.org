  >Comparing love potions to the Imperious in order to show how love potions aren't so bad really does the opposite
#+end_quote

BOTH Things let the User take "control" over its victim and if someone is crazy enough, s/he could use the Imperious as a better solution, because the Potion needs to be brewed and consumed regularly (Remember Dumbledore asked Harry what Merope could have used to Bind Riddle to her Love? Harry thought about the Potion AND the Imperious. Both have been possible). For each there is a Countermeasure. The Potion (as any other) needs a antidote/Cure and the Imperious need a strong mind and Willpower of the Victim. Barty Jr. managed to free himself because his hate of his Father strengthened its Will...and maybe because Sr got lesser acurate because he thought that his Son would stay ever as this loyal.

​

For the other unforgivables: you can trap your Victim in a Hidden Place and torture it with the Crucio or kill it with the KC, if it doesnt love you.

Ok, Dark Magic doesnt maybe need a Sacrifice anytime (define "Sacrifice" as Voldemort needed Blood of Harry, surely the Dark Lord was perfectly fine in offering it, unlike Harry. Oh and not to Forget his Fathers Bones, im sure Voldy didnt mind at all in giving those to strengthen himself, his cared nothing about his Father at all). But atleast Dark Magic isnt Cureable, shown by the other examples. Sectumsempra, the Twin lost its Ear, not reparable. Malfoy would have dies, if Snape hadnt managed to heal him.

​

The Process of Creating a Horcrus IS Dark Magic (as Hermione and Dumbledore confirm). Voldemort suffered alot, if he suffered at all, but if it was to become immortal, he was very willing to pay the price.

​

So, if Dark Magic doesnt mean to sacrifice anything of the performer, please correct me. Just his Reviving Ceremony wasnt of any real Loss, because Voldemort absolutely didnt care for other Peoples (his Father, Harry, Wormtail) sacrifices.
