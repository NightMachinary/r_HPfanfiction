A heterosexual woman can't be seduced by a woman, that means she's bisexual. Trying to seduce is not the same as seducing, and it's not the same as rape. You said using magic or potions to seduce, which pretty much everyone on this sub considers to be rape because it makes them do what the caster wants.
