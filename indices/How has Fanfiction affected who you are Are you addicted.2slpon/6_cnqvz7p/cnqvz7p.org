Fuck yes I'm addicted. Granted, I may have an addictive personality, as I was previously hooked on playing Civ 4 and Civ 5 every spare moment I had.

Has it affected me as a person? Probably. I was a fairly introverted person before I discovered fan fiction. I'm a bit more so now. I'm a bit of a tightwad as well. So an evening spent reading fan fiction (costing me only time, electricity, and Internet access) is usually more appealing than going out to a bar where I don't know anybody, I can't hear anything, and beers are $5 each.
