I"m a gamer. I'm a reader. Before i discovered fanfiction i was always reading a book or playing games. Now with discovering fanfiction and my dual monitors i can do both at the same time! HEAVEN! Can i do without fanfiction? Sure. Just go back to reading books(which i've drastically slowed down on) Would i miss it? YES! Eventually HP and Naruto(my 2 main reads) will die off and i'll sit down and have a good cry.
