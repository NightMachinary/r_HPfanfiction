Well.. one could say that. Whenever I read something I like I want to read it all in one go. I think my dad called my reading behaviour antisocial at one point in my childhood, long before I discovered fanfiction.

With books that's somewhat okay, because at some point you just reached the last page, even if it's a series, and there is nothing more for you to read about this world and it's just finished and you do other things until you find another book that catches your attention.

With fanficiton that's different. It's just never finished, and for somebody who always reads the whole series of books or watches the every episode of a tv show in as little time as possible, that's a bit problematic ;)

I know I like the HP world, I know that there will be another good story out there, if I just look long enough, I don't have to pay for it, can start as many new stories as I want. I mean with time I get tired of reading bad stories, but when I just found out about fanfiction I had reading material for a few months and read so much that at one point my friends started complaining that I'm never around anymore. I even preferred an evening reading fanfiction to going out with friends. Once they told me I realized how obsessed I had become with reading and forced myself to do other stuff too. Before tests (I'm a student at University) I expressively forbid myself to read fanficiton. It just wastes too much time - looking for stories etc. And it could always happen that I find a 200 000 word story I like and won't stop reading until I finished it. If I want to read something during this time, then I always try to read short stories (Alice Munro writes great ones).

I'm just not the kind of person who can read just one chapter a night of an intriguing book, I always have to read further. Knowing that I try to act accordingly, but fanfiction really makes it hard ;)

Well... I never wrote this down before, I sound like a crazy person.
