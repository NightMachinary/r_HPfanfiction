Something reading fanfiction has taught me to do that reading only professional novels never did was to appreciate all the little things that make up a good story. Because when those little things are absent, it's noticeable.

I certainly am addicted to fanfic, to the point where I used to rgularly stay up until 4 O'clock in the morning just to keep reading!
