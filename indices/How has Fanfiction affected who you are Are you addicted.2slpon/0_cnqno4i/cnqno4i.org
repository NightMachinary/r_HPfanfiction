I notice that the tone of whatever I'm currently reading has some influence on my thoughts at times, minimal though it is, it is there. This is why I avoid fics with a depressed or whiny and moody main character and tone for a majority of the fic. I stick mostly to humor and upbeat adventurous fics.
