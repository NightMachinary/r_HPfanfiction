I am very addicted. Fanfiction for me is a way of seeing a character in a different or new light. I can see what they would do in certain situations, encountering other characters and overall seeing what would happen to them if things twisted. I can compare myself too, judging how I'd like to be a better person depending on those reactions and circumstances.
