I think I am sort of addicted to fan fiction. I read a lot for comfort such as slice of life family stuff and Harry gets saved fics.

I also read OP harry fics to motivate myself to try hard with my studies and to re-remember how fascinating and useful it is to peruse academics and all the interesting things you can find and incorporate into your life.

When I started vaping weed I looked for fics about HP characters that were experimenting with similar things.

I probably read fan fiction at least every third day and when I do read it I usually binge a long fic. Also, my writing style when I write fiction has been heavily influenced by all the wolfstar I read age 12-15
