I wouldn't say I'm addicted. I read fanfiction in much the same style that I read books. I'll have a dry spell for a few months, and then pick something up and finish the whole thing in an entire night. I have trouble putting stories down if I'm really into it, so it's a bit of a problem if I have other things to do (for example, homework). It's kind of a hinderance. The last story I read was "Against the Moon", and that story is 105 chapters long. I couldn't finish it in one night. Also, I had work. So anytime I was not working or sleeping a few measly hours in between, I was reading. It was a bad three days for me. My husband was annoyed.

Fanfiction has impacted my life, just in that it gives me a hobby. I like writing more than I like reading, so it's fun to just write for an hour or two in between work and classes...and the stories stay with me throughout my day. I remember when I first stumbled upon Harry Potter fanfiction (oh, thirteen years ago), it pretty much blew my mind. I didn't know that you could just write stories about your favorite story...and I had soooo many plot bunnies that I just didn't stop for months. It was a great experience.

Other than that, I think fanfiction has just helped me be more open to ideas. Although I read strictly canon, I love hearing AU plot bunnies and "what if" prompts. Also, I was horrified by slash fiction as a young child and couldn't believe anyone would ever do such a thing, and Wolfstar is like my favorite thing ever now (this is also a symptom of a recovering Catholic, so I can't blame it on fanfiction strictly).

In general, I would say that the Harry Potter stories and community have shaped who I am today, and that fanfiction is just a small section of that awesomeness. I'm also LeakyCon/HP Alliance girl, so there's so much of this fandom that I owe in addition to loving fanfiction.
