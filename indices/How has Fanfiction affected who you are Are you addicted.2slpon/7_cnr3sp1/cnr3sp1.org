I used to love real books. Now I spend hours, consecutively, a day just reading fanfiction. Like I tried to go back and re-read Harry Potter. Couldn't. Lost steam at Chamber of Secrets. To much "Hey, I remember this part in X fic" and all that fannon conflicting with the cannon I'm reading.

As far as affecting me, I've finally found an outlet for the crazy ideas in my head, with people who can appreciate them. It's actually spurred me to improving my writing. Some of my early stuff was horse shit, so I got better, which translated over to things like school work.
