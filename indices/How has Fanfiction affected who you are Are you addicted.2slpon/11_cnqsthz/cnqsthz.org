I first read fanfiction while knowing what it was called and the culture around it about ten years ago. Always been a very heavy reader but didn't really read a lot of fanfiction until about five years ago.

I'd never really written creatively before, but after a couple of years of reading fanfiction I thought to myself, "hey, I can do this."

So I did. I've got several published stories on fanfiction.net (under this name), including two novel length ones that I swear I'm still working on.

Then a couple of years ago, I looked at some work by published original fiction authors I liked and said, "hey, I can do this too."

So I am. Currently planning on self-publishing original fiction (sci-fi, classic fantasy, and modern fantasy) in digital serials format, and also looking into novel publishing.

Fanfiction made me an author. Soon, I hope, a /published/ author who gets paid to do it for a living.

Still addicted to fanfiction, obviously.
