I started reading fanfiction summer 2005 (age 16), just after my GCSE examinations. I was definitely addicted then: I spent my entire summer holiday devouring fics 24/7, getting up ridiculously early and going to bed very late to get as much reading time as possible.

I'd definitely say my health suffered for it, due to the inactivity. When school started again I was floored as I'd got so used to reading all the time. I continued to read, getting up early in the morning to read fic before school and reading as soon as I got home. Homework basically stopped.

Eventually this slowed down, largely because I more or less ran out of fics to read and so became dependant on new works being released. That was the point at which I started getting interested in the writing side of things.

Fanfiction has definitely changed my life as it has taken up a large amount of my time and made me interested in writing. But more than that, being part of a fanfiction /community/ changed me. That is to say: DLP. I went into that community a pretty conservative Christian who believed in creationism and had no ambition or intellectual curiosity. I came out a liberal atheist who loved learning new things and wanted to do everything. (Part of that was probably all the fics where Harry becomes a savant over the space of a summer... I think, subconsciously, I started holding myself to that standard. Or at least I embraced it as an ideal: the enlightenment man.)

Not only that, but I have met up in real life with people from DLP, three times in London, once in Berlin and once in Buenos Aires. Most significantly, I had a girlfriend for over a year who I encountered via DLP.

So yes, fanfiction and the associated community has changed me. However, I would not say now that I am addicted. I can go weeks without reading a fic. But fanfic is and probably always will be part of my life, via my love of writing and the friends I have made.
