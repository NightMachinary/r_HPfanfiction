Ask yourself if the change would affect the stations of canon. For example, I'm writing a 6th-year divergence where Tonks helps Harry to deal with Sirius death and teaches him Occlumency. That doesn't really affect anything else at that point, so the rest of the year happens just as it did (which is one of the reasons why I began the story just before Slughorn's Christmas party).
