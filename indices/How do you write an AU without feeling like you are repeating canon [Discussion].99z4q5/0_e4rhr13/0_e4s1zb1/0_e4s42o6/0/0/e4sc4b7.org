(I'm assuming we're talking about Voldemort plan to return)

I'm pretty sure the 'voldemort' that would have returned had Ginny been consumed by the diary would have been entirely independent from the Voldemort hiding in Albania. There would have been a diary Riddle and a spirit voldemort coexisting, so Voldemort wouldn't trouly have returned. Having the diary possess someone wasn't part of Voldemort grand plan, but simply Lucius trying to rid himself of the diary and also bring down the weasleys (I believe Dumbledore says this)
