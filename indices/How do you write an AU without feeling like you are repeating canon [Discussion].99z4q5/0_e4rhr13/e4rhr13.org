My favorite advice for something like this is take the divergence to its logical end.

I've read something where a progression went like this: If Ginny dies in the chamber, the Weasleys don't go to Egypt, Pettigrew isn't seen by Sirius, Sirius doesn't escape causing Pettigrew to stay put, causing Voldemort not to return 4th year.

On a larger scale its a bit harder, so I'm not sure what to tell you, other than to read fics similar to what you want to write and take pointers from them.
