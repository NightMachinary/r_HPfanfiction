1. Figure out how the AU differences would affect the plot - if magic works differently, then some plans will need to work differently as well. Maybe the GoF plot needs to be overhauled to account for runecasting or something.

2. Feel free to skip or gloss over sections that would be the same as canon anyways. If Harry meets Ron on the train to Hogwarts and they become best mates, you can reduce that to a single sentence. You can skip later train rides if no plot points occur, or gloss over the World Cup if Harry doesn't go or it doesn't get attacked. You don't need to worldbuild stuff that was in the books already.
