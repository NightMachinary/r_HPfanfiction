If I may digress, my take on why the Triwizard Tournament happened is mostly that Karkaroff had finally found the Goblet of Fire (which had been long-lost) and wanted to restart it because death tournaments are his jam, natch. Dumbledore and Maxime didn't want to go along with it, but eventually Fudge hears of it and decides holding ir in Britain is the perfect way to divert the worldwide public's attention from Britain's failure to catch Sirius Black.

(Hence, in my story, Karkaroff being killed earlier means no Tournament in Fourth Year... but possibly one in /Fifth/ Year because Karkaroff willed the Goblet to Dumbledore and demanded he organize it as his last request. So Dumbledore is allowed to take more time to make it safer, but he /has/ to do it eventually for reasons of honor. Fudge isn't particularly insistent because, with Sirius believed dead and no Voldemort in sight, things are actually going pretty great for Britain.)
