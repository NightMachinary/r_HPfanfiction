Take a closer look at the Stations. What is happening, why is it happening, and how else can the villain get what they want without repeating each event blow by blow? People say "extrapolate a diverging event to its natural conclusion" or some such, but thinking from small to big is a lot harder than going from big to small. So If you don't want the Triwizard tournament to happen, find out why it was happening in the first place and see if you can take it in a different direction. I imagine the idea for the tournament was because Fudge wanted a PR stunt. So you can diverge from there and figure out some other far reaching stunt, or you can maybe make the schools disagree on where it's held, or maybe the Goblet is just straight up broken so they have to make a new one that acts differently. This means you still get yearly events, but you can point it in a different direction more easily.
