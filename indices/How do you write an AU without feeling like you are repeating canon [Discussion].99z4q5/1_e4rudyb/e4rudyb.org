1. If it's a Pokemon AU, why not have Harry and Co need to spend a great deal of time on the road catching new pokemon and exploring new places.
2. Get rid of the prophecy entirely and have Voldemort obsessed with Harry because he wants a certain legendary pokemon, but Harry was somehow blessed by that legendary and now Voldemort thinks he has to steal the blessing for himself.
3. Make the Death Eaters some sort of mystical pokemon cult related to your specific legend trying to obtain its powers to give Voldemort a super power (I suggest somehow working in immortality since defeating death is Voldemort's deal).
4. Take things to the logical extreme: Hogwarts doesn't need to be hidden, everyone knows about Pokemon. Dumbledore is basically Professor Oak. There is no magic, only pokemon, so have the substitute for any magic spells.

1. Have fun, be creative, and keep your character motivations straight.
