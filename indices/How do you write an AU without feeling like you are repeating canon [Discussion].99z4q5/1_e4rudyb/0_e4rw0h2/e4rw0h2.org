And if I was doing this....

​

Voldemort was once a respected young Pokemon researcher, mentoring under the wise Professor Dumbledore. However, tragedy struck, and Voldemort lost someone dear to him to death. Voldemort became obsessed with defeating death, and researched ghost pokemon extensively. However, he was unable to find a way to bring either pokemon or people back to life, despite developing odd psychic powers. This disturbed Dumbledore, but he sympathised with his young student. Along the way, Voldemort learned of the legend of Ho-oh, and how it had brought three pokemon back to life...

​

One day, Harry Potter and his family were caught up in a horrific fire in their home. Harry's parents were killed along with their pokemon. Harry's burned body lay atop a pile of ashes, dead. However, a miraculous pokemon descended from the heavens: Ho-oh. It brought Harry back to life, marking him with a special scar. As it departed, Voldemort emerged. He had started to fire to lure Ho-oh out, and had captured and corrupted the three legendary dogs. He attacked Ho-oh, and nearly captured it. Just he was ready to claim the legendary pokemon, Dumbledore and the elite four arrive. Now, however, they were the elite three: Sirius Black, Peter Pettigrew, and Remus Lupin. Harry's father had been the fourth elite four member. They drove off Voldemort and his death eaters.

Harry grows up marked by Voldemort as his foe (I would ditch the Dursley's angle frankly. I might have him raised by Sirius, or by someone else. Either way, don't give him an abusive childhood unless it's needed which I don't think it is). People view Harry as having a great and terrible destiny, but Harry really wishes he was a normal kid. Still, he's determined to stop Voldemort one day and restore his parents honor. Feelings on Ho-oh are complicated. On one had, Harry was saved, but on the other, his parents were not. He's torn between resentment and gratitude.

​

Harry ends up at Hogwarts. Here, there are three houses, because fuck Slytherin, it's just the evil houses. I'd pick a legendary trio (probably the birds or dogs) and make them the house themes. To Harry's distress, he ends up in Voldemort's house. His starter should be themed around whatever house you place him in, so a fire, ice, or electric, or type. I'd go with electric personally since Zapados is a BAMF but you don't have to. Don't give him anything too OP to start off with. Also: not a pikachu. I'm hella partial to Mareep personally but that's just me. For the friends starters make it fit their personality. Harry meets up with some friends (one from each other house) and they go on an epic adventure. My advice? Ron and Hermione are his traveling companions and Draco is his rival if you want to be boring, but you could totally make some cool choices like have Lavender and Dean or whatever traveling with him.

​

Also, they are 11. No romance.

​

Alternate between classes at Hogwarts and field time. Harry slowly uncovers mysteries about Ho-oh and Lugia. He earns gym badges, and catches neat pokemon. However, he also has run ins with Death Eaters. The first few times, Sirius and Remus have to pull his bacon out of the fire, or a gym leader (read: Hogwarts Professor) does. Eventually he becomes TEH VERAH BEsT LIEK NO WHUN EVA WUZ and proves his strength. But OH NO VOLDEMORT HAS HO OH AND THE LEGENDARY DOGS NOW OH SHIT. But thankfully Harry becomes BFFs with Lugia and one of the Legendary birds (his friends get the other two birds). They have an epic show down and VOLDEMORT IS DEFEATED YAAAAAY.

The end.
