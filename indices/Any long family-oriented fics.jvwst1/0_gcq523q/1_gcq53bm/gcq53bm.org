  The only thing Rhea Lupin has is her family.Growing up in the same house with a single werewolf for a dad, a funny, immature godfather and her two best friends, makes her family a bit different, but it's home. Suddenly, Rhea and Leo Black are sent in a world where they were never born, family members become strangers and a different Harry Potter needs help to destroy the Dark Lord.
