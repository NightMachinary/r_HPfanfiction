Speaking of Hermione, I feel she was more of the mastermind, dark lord/lady, Tom Riddle type personality.

--------------

Ginny, on the other hand, seemed to have a lot more in common with Bellatrix:

- Completely loyal to her love

- Absolutely devoted to her cause

- Reasonably intelligent

- Magically powerful

- Easily angered

- Prone to aggression and violence

Considering how her sisters Andromeda and Narcissa turned out to be, I highly doubt that Bellatrix was born evil.

Voldemort, in his earlier times, was charismatic, convincing, persuasive, and handsome. What Voldemort preached was also in line with Bellatrix' family ideology, so she was probably groomed to fangirl him (just like Ginny was brought up to 'like' Harry). As a result, she chose Voldemort as her love, and she became a monster herself.

If these two persons had their upbringings swapped, we would very likely have had a Ginevra Lestrange who was Voldemort's chief enforcer and a Bellatrix Weasley who became great Harry Potter's wife.
