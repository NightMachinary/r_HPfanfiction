This is hilariously shit. From "Avrada Kevrada" to the endless walls of unreadable crap, every chapter starting with "and now... its... "SHOWTIME!""

This might very well be the worst fic I've ever read. It's an abomination.

EDIT: in the author's notes of chapter 24, the author actually forbids you from "stealing" his characters. he thinks his grotesque versions of Harry and the others ("Jester King Harry", anyone?) are so good that other people actually want to use them. And he, a fucking fanfiction "writer", doesn't want that to the point where he thinks it's a shame he doesn't have any legal basis to enforce his copyright.
