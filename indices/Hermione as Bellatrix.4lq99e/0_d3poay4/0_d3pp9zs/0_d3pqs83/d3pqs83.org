In *The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig*, linkffn(7135971), although not as insane and cruel as Bellatrix, Ginny definitely played the role of Harry's ruthless enforcer. As for the story itself, it began with Muggles surprising and seriously threatening the survival of Magicals. Under Harry's leadership, they built a magical spaceship and headed out for stars. This fic is a nice merging of magic and technology, and they went through heck of an adventure. The ending was pretty sad though, but there was always A NEW HOPE!
