Not exactly what you are looking for, but linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6341291/1/Harveste]]) in the later parts of the series gets pretty close.

Don't know how much I can tell without spoiling too much, but she becomes a bit unhinged as the story progresses (well, Addams Family level unhinged, but since it is Addams Family crossover it may not look like much in comparison).

Overall it's pretty nice series, every part is longer than the previous (starting 5k with the prologue/pilot and getting to 80k at OotP), but HBP one hasn't been updated since November 2011 and looks abandoned.\\
Still, I enjoyed it very much and is the only Addams Family/Harry Potter crossover I've read that does not ship Harry/Wednesday. I know, Wednesday is awesome, but it's refreshing to read a fic where they are just siblings.
