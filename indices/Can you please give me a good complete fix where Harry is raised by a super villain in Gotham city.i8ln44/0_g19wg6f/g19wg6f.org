Dr. Pamela Lillian Isley was known for quite a few things: botany, casual villainy and being the beau of Harley Quinn. One thing she wasn't known for, however, was childcare. This was the reason why Batman was surprised to discover Poison Ivy herself calming a small child with messy black hair down.

He had been called into action when an alert had been sounded about Poison Ivy trying to take over a cruise ship just outside of the Gotham Harbour. So you can imagine his surprise when he found the famed villain stopping a panic attack.

“You have such pretty eyes,” he heard her say. “They're the same colour as ‘Moluccella laevis'.”

The trembling boy gave her a quizzical look, distracted from his fear as the buff henchmen got to work corralling the frightened hostages.

“They're a form of summer flowering annual, native to Turkey, Syria and the Caucasus....” she backtracked. “What's your name?”

“M-my name's Harry.” The boy whispered in a slight British accent.

“It's very nice to meet you, Harry.” Ivy replied softly. She plucked a flower from a nearby bouquet, giving it a small kiss and smiling when she saw it perk up.

“This is for you.” She said, extending her arm to him. He blushed as he took it. The boy couldn't have been more than 7 at his size.

“Thank you, Miss.” He mumbled, tucking it into the pocket of his large trousers. She smiled kindly.

“I have to go now, Harry. Can you promise me that you'll stay safe?” He nodded eagerly. With a small chuckle, she used the vines to pick her up.

And that was how Harry Potter met Poison Ivy. ------------------------------------------------------------------ Harry encountered Harley Quinn a bit later into his trip. The Dursleys hadn't wanted to bring him along, but Mrs. Figg was away and no one else could take him. It was one of Uncle Vernon‘s business trips, and Aunt Petunia decided that she and Dudley would come to America too for a vacation.

So, Harry was shuffled around from sight to sight, listening in silent embarrassment as his aunt and uncle called Americans they saw “stupid and fat”. He tried to act like he wasn't interested as they toured the famous Gotham Gardens, looking for the same flower that the pretty green lady from the boat had given him.

They had escaped quite easily, though the incident had left aunt Petunia clucking about Dudley's safety for a good two hours. A strange man with a gravely sounding voice had jumped down and quickly dispatched the men in suits that were pushing and threatening people into corners. (Uncle Vernon didn't comply. In fact, he was in the middle of arguing with one of the men when the superhero came and knocked them both out.)

Harry had only read about superheroes in the different books and comics he got from school. He heard one of the other people on the boat refer to the superhero that saved them as Batman, and Harry quickly decided that this man was his personal hero. The green lady from the boat was his favorite person.

You see, dear reader, Harry wasn't exactly treated well. Sure, he was fed (barely), clothed (none of them fit, as they were Dudley's hand-me-downs), and housed. However, many would argue that those are just the Bare Necessities. What Harry was really lacking in was affection. So, when the green lady decided to call him down instead of walking by like any other adult had done, Harry decided that she was the nicest person he had ever met.

“Hiya, kiddos!” A shrill voice ahead called. Everyone looked up to the rafters of the glass greenhouse. Hanging up there by her knees was a strange looking woman. Even stranger then the green lady, one might argue. Her skin was pale as snow, her eyes highlighted by two different colors: red and blue, and her hair was more blonde and than Aunt Petunia's, with dyed tips. Her dirtied t-shirt was ripped and boasted the words “daddy's little monster”. All in all, she was someone Aunt Petunia would've referred to as a ruffian.

She then dropped the 20 feet to the ground, making onlookers shriek in surprise. As Harry felt his breathing pick up, he fought to remember with the green lady had taught him about calming down. The Dursleys hushed him as he furiously counted underneath his breath, looking fearfully around them as if they thought he was performing some sort of feat.

Harley Quinn took one look at the malnourished kid quivering behind a large man, and began to step forward. Villain or not, she knew this kid was on the verge of a panic attack.

The three blondes stepped backwards, exposing a small boy to her. She sneered at them. Crouching down on one knee, she extended her hand to the boy and asked his name in a moment of kindness.

“My name's Harry.” He said. She smiled widely.

“It's a pleasure to meet you, Harry.” She repeated his name back to him with a strong Brooklyn accent. “ you don't have to worry about lil ol' me. I'm just here to meet my girlfriend.”

This last part was whispered, but he smiled and nodded diligently towards her. She mine does zipping motion on her lips, and he repeated it back with a smile.

“Alrighty then.” She stood up and grabbed his hand. “I'll just be taking this child now.”

“Excuse me?” The green lady from the boat walked in. Harry beamed, pulling out the flattened flower from his pocket.

“C'mon, Ives... Look at his little face!” Harley nudged him, so Harry assumed a puppy dog face. Poison Ivy sighed, rolling her eyes before taking a closer look.

“You're Harry!” She exclaimed. Harley gave him a look.

“What, you famous or something, kid?” Harry shrugged. Famous? Him? What for? He wasn't particularly exceptional. Aunt Petunia made certain of it.

“You don't want him.” Aunt Petunia spoke up with newfound bravery. Ivy seemed to take it as a challenge. She quirked an eyebrow.

“Oh?” She replied. “Why is that?”

“He's a delinquent.” She seemed to loose courage as the entire greenhouse stared at her in disbelief.

“Well, that's just better for us then, isn't it? I'm something of a delinquent myself.” With a huff, Ivy scooped Harry up, and two of Gotham's sirens stole away to a hideout with the British boy they would soon refer to as their son. ------------------------------------------------------------------- “Mom!” Harry yelled as the owl carrying a large letter continued to attack the window. Ivy rushed over, and upon seeing the creature, she called for her wife.

“What's up, sugar?” Harley arrived as well, and the family of three gaped at the determined owl that was still scratching at their new windows.

“Doctor Dillimond did say that we should be expecting the letter from Hogwarts eventually.” Ivy sighed and resigned herself to open the window.

“Aren't they magic?” Harley asked, peering over Harry's shoulder. “Don't they know when a student goes somewhere else? For three years?”

“I don't know. Maybe they're just too busy or too stupid to care.” Harry returned in kind.

Ivy rolled her eyes fondly as the two bantered back in forth. It had been hard to get Harry to open up to them at first, what with Harley's enthusiasm. Thankfully, he had become adjusted to their quirks and had joined their marauding crew after only a year.

Harley and Harry had a bit of an ongoing prank battle that persisted even when Harry was away at school at Illvermorny in Massachusetts.

“I'll have to write back, won't I?” Harry sighed.

“Professor McGonnagall, I'm afraid I will not be attending Hogwarts. I've been enrolled in America's Illvermorny, which you'll discover to be #1 in charms, potions and runes work globally, for the past several years. Hogwarts does not even reach the top twenty out of the fifty schools on the list. I will be continuing my schooling here in America. Yours respectfully, Harry Potter-Quinzel-Isley”

“It's good.” Ivy nodded her approval. Certainly polite enough anyway. Harley, after reading it, commended him on his snark. He attached the letter to the leg of the waiting owl, scoffing at how archaic this show was.

A week later, Harry was awoken at 5 am by the sharp and loud snap of a whip that accompanied an apparation. He fumbled blindly in the dark to put his contacts in- glasses didn't exactly work when running away from Batman and police.

When he stepped into his living room, he was greeted by what he would assume Batman looked outside his suit. The man had a large hooked nose, with sallow skin that seemed older than his years, and dark oily hair.

Harry wasn't one for pleasantries normally, and he wasn't one for greetings when a wizard had broken into his house. His Mama Ivy has taught him manners, but his mom had taught him snark.

“May I ask what the fuck you're doing in my house?” The eleven year old boy questioned the man with the lit wand.

“Potter.” The man sneered in a British accent. Harry pursed his lips in a strangely similar expression to Mama Ivy.

“Do sit down. We seem to need to talk.”
