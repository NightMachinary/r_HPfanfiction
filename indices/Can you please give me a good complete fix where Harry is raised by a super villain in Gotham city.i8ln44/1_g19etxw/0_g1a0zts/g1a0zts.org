I couldn't finish that one. For me it felt like to much stuff was happening at once. Every time one plot point was dealt with two more took it's place. And Harry was sick the entire time so he wasn't doing anything and the he gets kidnapped and it's all over the place.

Harry wasn't so much a character as he was a tool for the writer to use to get Bruce and Selina moving. At some point I could see that he wasn't getting rescued anytime soon and if he did he was still only going to be a plot device so I dropped quit reading cause it was a slog to try to get through.

Which was a massive shame, I'd have loved to see a Harry raised by a comic villain but the few I've found are super bad.
