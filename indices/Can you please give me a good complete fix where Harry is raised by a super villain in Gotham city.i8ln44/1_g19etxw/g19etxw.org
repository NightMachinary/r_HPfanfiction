I don't remember the name but it takes place post COS where the Dursley's are done with Harry and take him to Gotham and dump him on Selina Kyle who is Harry's actual mother who had him when she was 16/17. There a whole lot of stuff going on but basically she felt like she couldn't take care of him and lily who is her half sister took Harry in.
