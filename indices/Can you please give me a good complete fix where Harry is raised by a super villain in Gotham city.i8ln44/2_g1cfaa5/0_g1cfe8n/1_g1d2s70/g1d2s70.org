Gonna be tough to find, I suspect. I only know of three stories that have Harry brought up by a Gotham villain. Two have Harry related to or adopted by Poison Ivy, and one has him rescued from the Dursleys by his aunt, Harlene Quinzel.

None of them are finished. One was updated in May, one hasn't been updated in almost two years, and the third hasn't updated since 2012.
