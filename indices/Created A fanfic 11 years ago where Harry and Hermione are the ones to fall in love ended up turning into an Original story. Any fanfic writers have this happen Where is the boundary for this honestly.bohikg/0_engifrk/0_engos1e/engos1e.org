E.L. James wrote [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Master_of_the_Universe]["Master of the Universe"]] under the penname Snowqueen Icedragon.

Another example of fanfic turning mainstream is the movie [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_(2019_film]["After"]]) starring Hero Fiennes Tiffin, the actor who played young Tom Riddle from HBP as an expy of Harry Styles from a Wattpad One Direction fanfic. The serial number filing was so bad that the re-named character is "Hardin Scott".

The boundary is having enough differences that someone is willing to pay for the rights to it without fear of being sued. For written fiction, name and setting changes is usually enough.
