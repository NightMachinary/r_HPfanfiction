There are two major authors whose stories are basically 'fanfiction with the serial numbers filed off'. Cassandra Clare and E.L James.

So it's doable. Where it stands ethically is up to you. Also, unless you've published the fanfic, you probably won't get laughed at quite so much (you can still find copies of Cassandra Clare's Draco Trilogy and...whatever the fuck it was E L James wrote)

+also unless you changed the setting as well, Britain does not have orphanages, dating as far back as the 70's+
