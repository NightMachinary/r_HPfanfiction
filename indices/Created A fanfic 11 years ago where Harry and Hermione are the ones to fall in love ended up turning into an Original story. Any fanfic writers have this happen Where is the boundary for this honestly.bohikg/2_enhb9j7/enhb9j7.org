I've got one like that, albeit not in the HP fandom. It's a Viking mythological fantasy story that started as a Supernatural fan fiction that explains how the archangel Gabriel became Loki (canon as since explained how that happens but I wrote it before).

​

If you're not already familiar with Supernatural, there's absolutely no way you can tell it's a fan fiction because the setting and 80% of the characters are original. Even Gabriel, despite being one of the main characters, and other canon characters being easily be reworked because the setting allows for supernatural creatures, gods and what-not. Or I can very easily remove them from the story altogether because they're not essential to the plot and are more observers to the original characters' story with their own side-plot that doesn't affect the main story at all.

​

It kind of work as an origin story fan fiction, but it works much better as an original work. And I'm more interested in working on it as an original work, which is why I'm doing it.
