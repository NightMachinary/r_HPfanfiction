I never actually wrote it, but the line for me was when I was when the story stood well enough on its own to be its own story, rather than one that fit in fan fiction. At what point does it take more work to explain "It's Harry Potter, except..." than it is to write it as your own thing?

For me, it helped that mine was a massive chimera of a multicross.
