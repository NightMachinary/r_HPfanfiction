Ha ya, I always felt like Dumbledore would of been a great Slytherin, especially in his youth when he was very ambitious and hadn't yet gone through the tragedy of losing Arianna which made him curb that ambition.

Plus I think Dumbledore being in Slytherin would of been great for the plot, and for Harry to at some point after hating on Slytherin thinking they are all evil, to learn that one of the greatest wizards of all time on the good side, Dumbledore is a Slytherin. It could have been perfect!
