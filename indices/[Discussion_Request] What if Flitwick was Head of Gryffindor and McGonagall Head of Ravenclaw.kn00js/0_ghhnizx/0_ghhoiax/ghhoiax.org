  Luna marches to the beat of her own little drum.

Flitwick, who's less strict and more easy going than McGonagall, probably accepted all of his students without question. However, I can see McGonagall being very strict and stern as Head of Ravenclaw (just like her canon self in Gryffindor), and she probably wouldn't tolerate Luna and the latter's wild imagination.

I can see something along the lines of this taking place in a private meeting:

"Miss Lovegood, while I appreciate your penchant for ... creativity, I must confess myself disappointed in seeing a student of Ravenclaw subscribe to such /ridiculous/ beliefs."

Luna proceeds to either ignore McGonagall or calmly argue in favour of her points, i.e. the Rotfang Conspiracy, Fudge's Heliopaths (which McGonagall would shut down, seeing as she worked at the Ministry herself), etc. McGonagall, however, would be just like canon Hermione in shutting down Luna and arguing in favour of logic and common sense.

Suffice to say, neither side will budge, and Luna would probably have a rough time with her own Head of House. Her life would then go in various ways, such as, perhaps:

- She remains adamant in her beliefs, and thus has an even more miserable time than in canon.

- She starts to accept McGonagall's point of view. Perhaps Pandora Lovegood (Luna's mother) was less whacky than Xenophilius, and thus a Luna who accepts McGonagall's common sense might end up being more in tune with her mother's behaviour (we know from canon that Luna was a lot cleaner and tidier when she had her mother around. Perhaps Luna was different back then?).

Of course, Luna without the whackiness wouldn't be the Luna that we know. Perhaps she'd then turn into more of an artistic, creative person but without the whimsical imagination. Perhaps she'd be similar to the character Badeea Ali from /Hogwarts Mystery/, in a way?
