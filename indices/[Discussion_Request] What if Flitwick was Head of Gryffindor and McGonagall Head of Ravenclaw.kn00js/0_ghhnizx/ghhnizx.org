With regards to McGonagall, it's quite possible she may leave an impression on Hermione to go for Ravenclaw instead of Gryffindor--/maybe./

Beyond that--which is by no means small potatoes--Ravenclaw has a relatively small part to play in the story.

Cho Chang might find herself with a halfway decent broom instead of the Comet 260.

Luna...Luna marches to the beat of her own little drum. If Fred and George were able to do as much mischief as they did in canon, then I doubt McGonagall could stop the teasing Luna gets--unless she catches someone in the act.

Oh, and odds are that McGonagall would not be kind to Marietta if the SNEAK incident occurs. Ravenclaw or not, she was still Dumbledore's right-hand.
