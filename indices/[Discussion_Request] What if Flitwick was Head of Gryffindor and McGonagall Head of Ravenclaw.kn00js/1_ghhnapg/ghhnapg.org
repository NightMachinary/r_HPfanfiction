Well, the most immediate difference is that Harry would probably have gotten detention instead of a chance for the Gryffindor Quidditch Team (Though McGonagall loathes Snape and may have told Flitwick to "keep an eye on Potter next year").

Which means no Nimbus 2000 and by extension, quite possibly +no Midnight Duel+--Flitwick interrupted their argument in canon, so Malfoy might be extra cautious if he thinks Harry might tell his Head of House.

Flitwick doesn't seem to be quite as strict as McGonagall, so Hermione might not have had points taken from her for the Troll Incident, if Hermione kept the lie of taking the troll on herself--"I think...I think you've learned your lesson, Miss Granger...please, all of you, go to your dormitory."

Beyond that? I don't doubt they'd get in huge trouble for Norbert, but I don't think a full 150 points would be taken--at least Neville probably wouldn't have gotten 50 points taken.

As for telling him about the Stone, Flitwick /might/ be more willing to listen that "we think someone might be trying to steal it," but that's an open question.

Edit: I stand corrected. I forgot that the Midnight Duel happened right before Harry got his Nimbus.
