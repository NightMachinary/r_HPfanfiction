  Harry would probably have gotten detention instead of a chance for the Gryffindor Quidditch Team

You acknowledge that Flitwick is less strict, so I'm not understanding why Harry would be more likely to get detention here?

Harry joining the quidditch team in his first year depends on the author, but I have no problem imagining a man who fell off a stack of books upon reading Harry's name would also buy him a broom. OotP shows us he's just as likely as McGonagall to reward rule-breaking when he sees fit.

The midnight duel happens before Harry gets the Nimbus and would still happen if Ron is Harry's friend.
