  Harry wishes he could go back in time and tell his younger self---always so lost, desperately searching for a family and a place to belong---that the answer was there all along. Right there next to him. Post-Hogwarts HHr. Illustrations by Hastyhand.

  "This Cinders girl is just like you!" Dudley snickers as he watches the television. "Dressed in rags, does all the chores, always dirty, and no one wants her. Even her parents are dead!" Later, when Harry lies in bed and stares up at the dusty cobwebs on the cupboard ceiling, he can't help but wonder wearily: "If I'm Cinders, does that mean one day someone will come to save me too?" Illustrations by Arishatistic.

  An old house sits at the end of a lane. Abandoned and forgotten, no one would have guessed who was going to buy it... or how full a life that old house was yet to live. Harry/Hermione
