[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13782272/1/Sign-of-the-Times][Sign of the Times]] by BepsiBitch69 is a relatively new one, and isn't very long at all, but has the start of HHr (it's labeled as such in the pairings) and Ron, Harry and Hermione seem to get on well. Doesn't seem to be being updated very quickly though
