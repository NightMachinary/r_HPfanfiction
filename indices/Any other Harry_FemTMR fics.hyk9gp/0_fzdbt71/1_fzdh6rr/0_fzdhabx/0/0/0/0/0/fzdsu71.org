  Their engagement managed to make the news in just about every major magical newspaper. Harry wasn't quite sure how as he stared down at a photograph of himself plastered on the front page of the Lifestyle section of the Nagasaki paper. It was an old photo, from the opening of the school, and was simply him smirking at the camera in his brand-new classroom. Below the fold there was another of him and Priya arm-in-arm in a park. "Anything good in the paper?" Priya asked as she stepped into the kitchen. Harry turned his attention from the paper to her and couldn't help but admire his fianc√© for a moment, especially as the meaning behind that word sank in. Her dark hair was down and falling nearly to the small of her back and she wore a pink negligee. "Us," he said, summoning the teapot and an additional cup to the counter. He used magic to pour it for her as he slid the paper across the counter. She sat in his lap rather than at the other stool and slid the paper back toward herself.
