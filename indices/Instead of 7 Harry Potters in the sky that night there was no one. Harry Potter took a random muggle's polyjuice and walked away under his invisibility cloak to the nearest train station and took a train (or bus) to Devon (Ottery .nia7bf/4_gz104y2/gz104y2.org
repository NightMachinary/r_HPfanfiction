I like it. This is the kind of plan that Harry would agree to. If the Order insisted on sending someone else with Harry for protection in the unlikely event that he was found out, one person is a lot better, and a lot less conspicuous than 13 people. You'd think someone like Moody would come up with or agree to a plan like this to minimize complications and to plug any possible holes that may have been left with the death of Dumbledore. They all thought that Dumbledore trusted Snape and knew that Snape killed him, so Moody's paranoia would likely have had him wondering if Dumbledore told Snape of the plan before that and cause him to change it on principle.

Harry hated the canon plan and protested it until the issue was forced on him without his consent, mainly because it put other people in harm's way because they'd look like him. He wasn't wrong, either. Moody and Hedwig were killed. George lost an ear. A plan like the one described here could have prevented that from happening and avoided some of the later complications that arose from it.

The canon plan was a plan that reeked of Dumbledore's influence and involved at least one person who had no desire to go through with it (other than Harry, of course). If they were going to go through with this plan, they couldn't have found someone in the Order other than Mundungus Fletcher to participate? He was a liability in more ways than one, as it turned out. There was no way that the canon plan wasn't going to be ambushed, whether Snape knew about it or not. Even the people in the Order knew that an ambush was possible and at least a skirmish was likely. I am not sure how they expected Harry to go along with it without protest.
