I can't remember how far away the DEs were supposed to be in the book, but the wiki has Moody telling Harry that they might not be able to get at Harry at #4 specifically because of Lily's protection, but that they knew the "rough position of the place". Whether that means they're staked out on Privet Drive itself or they're spread throughout Little Whinging looking for signs of magical transportation, or of Harry specifically, isn't made clear. What also isn't made clear is how far beyond #4 itself the protection went. It had to have extended a fair bit beyond #4, otherwise Harry would have been left unprotected whenever he went beyond the property line for any reason.

I also don't remember how far the Order contingent and the 7 Harrys were able to get away from #4 before the DEs were on them. The further they were able to go before being ambushed, the less likely it is that there were DEs staking out Privet Drive.

Either way, I think there'd be an abundance of caution with Harry putting the cloak on before he even leaves the house, and with the polyjuice being used as an added security measure in case something happens to the cloak on the trip.

The canon plan practically invited the ambush, had a lot more moving parts and took a previously unseen/unknown phenomenon involving his wand (the 'wand moving on its own' part, not the 'priori incantatum' part) to save Harry from being hurt or killed by Voldemort right then and there. A lot more could have gone wrong than actually did go wrong, and they were lucky to get out of there without more casualties.
