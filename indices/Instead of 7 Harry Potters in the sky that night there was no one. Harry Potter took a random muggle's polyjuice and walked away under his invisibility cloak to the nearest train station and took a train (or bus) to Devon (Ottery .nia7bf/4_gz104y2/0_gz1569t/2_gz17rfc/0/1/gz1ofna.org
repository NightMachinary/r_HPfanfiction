They would probably constantly have to be using Homenum Revelio to actually catch Harry though. Harry could've also gone out the back door and even if the ambush went exactly the same as it did in the books, all they would've seen was the house suddenly appearing. Even with 30 death eaters all simultaneously casting Homenum Revelio, they're going to probably be casting at the house which would show, well, nothing.

If Hedwig left early, if the luggage was transported separately, and if Harry took off the invisibility cloak once he sees other muggles (because the only possible counter I could see to this plan is if the death eaters set up muggle repelling charms for a good distance beyond the house and put polyjuiced muggle plants within the range of the charms), nobody would suspect a random muggle going for a walk.

And for extra security, just fire off some Peruvian Instant Darkness in the house and directly around it to hide your traces. It wouldn't be that hard to rig something up that throws it around the house and yard just as Harry leaves and the house appeared.
