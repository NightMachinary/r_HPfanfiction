Dumbledore never said he could see through the cloak, only that he knew Harry was there, he could`ve guessed, heard their nervous breathing, or having read Hagrid`s mind.

The Cloak was never beaten and showed itself immune to some spells.

It`s not a regular cloak, it`s a Hallow, and the only times they were near to be discovered is because they could still be heard, even if not seen.

DEs were mostly dumb I doubt they would have been constantly casting anything to try and see if someone was leaving.

The Cloak is supposed to be able to hide one from Death, it`s not some store bought thing.
