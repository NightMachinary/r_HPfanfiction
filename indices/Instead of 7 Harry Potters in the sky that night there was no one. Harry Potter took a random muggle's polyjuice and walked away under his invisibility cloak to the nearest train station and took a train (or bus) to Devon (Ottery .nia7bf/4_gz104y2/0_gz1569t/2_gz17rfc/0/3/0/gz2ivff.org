It comes from JKR herself that the cloak isn't immune to it. She has confirmed this in an interview:

  Angela Morrissey: Why is it that albus dumbledore can see harry under his invisibility cloak at certain moments? (during the series is the cloak only infallible to those who do not own a deathly hallow).J.K. Rowling: Dumbledore, who could perform magic without needing to say the incantation aloud, was using â€˜homenum revelio' - the human-presence-revealing spell Hermione makes use of in Deathly Hallows."

And while the DE where mostly dumb they knew exactly the moment when to attack after the order left, so they must have some kind of observation done.
