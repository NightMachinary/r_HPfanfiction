So, how many DE's are you going to surround the location with, constantly, and non-stop, casting the spell to expose the Invisibility cloak? ALL DAY LONG because they don't know when he might have snuck out of the house he was hiding in.

I always thought they were stupid for not sending him immediately to the safe house from the train! Yes, he's at a higher risk while staying there instead of the Dursley's, but it avoids entirely the potential for an ambush.
