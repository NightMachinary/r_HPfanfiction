I don't think it was ever mentioned in canon how dumbledore knew. Maybe he guessed from Hagrid's face, or from minor legilimancy. I do not think there were foolproof measures against the cloak of invisibility that are canon-it cannot be summoned, for instance. Any measure against a normal invisibility cloak may not work with Harry's. But, at that point, they didn't know Harry's cloak was that special.
