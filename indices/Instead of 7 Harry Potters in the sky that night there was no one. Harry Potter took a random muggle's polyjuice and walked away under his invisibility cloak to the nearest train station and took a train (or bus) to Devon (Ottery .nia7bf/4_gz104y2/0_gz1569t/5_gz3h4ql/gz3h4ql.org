Something else I hadn't considered was the time of day that this all took place. I honestly don't even remember what time of day it was in the movie. I want to say it was nighttime, but that's just a guess. Assuming it was nighttime in both the book and the movie, I think that would be an extra advantage for this plan.

Even if DEs are scouting the area, which again could have been as nearby as Privet Drive itself or just the general area of Little Whinging, they don't know exactly where the house is. If it's dark outside, then sneaking out of the house under an invisibility cloak without being spotted would be that much easier.

I also don't remember if Harry, the Order members and the people disguised as Harry left #4 under disillusionment charms or not, but if they didn't, it wouldn't have been that difficult for DEs to spot them, even at night. Especially as one of them was Hagrid riding a noisy flying motorcycle.

So, a polyjuiced Harry who is under both a disillusionment charm and an invisibility cloak leaves #4 at night, either by himself or with one other person taking the same precautions, while the DEs think he's going to be surrounded by Order members and leaving some other way. Even the DEs scouting the area would have a difficult time finding him under those circumstances as long as he isn't stupid about it.
