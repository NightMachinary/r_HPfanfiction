I agree with Mundungus being part of it was stupid. There were many people who would have been better fitted and most likely would have done it without hesitation - which would have Moody allowed to survive.

But to the plan the OP prompted: The Death Eaters observed the house. Don't you think they would have made the connection between a random muggle who never went in there leaving the house and Harry planing to leaving the house? Making that connection isn't exactly rocket science.
