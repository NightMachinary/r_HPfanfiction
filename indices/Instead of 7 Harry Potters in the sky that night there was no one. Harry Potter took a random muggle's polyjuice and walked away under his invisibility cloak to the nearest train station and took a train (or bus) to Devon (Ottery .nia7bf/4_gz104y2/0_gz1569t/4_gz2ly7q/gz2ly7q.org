  Don't you think they would have made the connection between a random muggle who never went in there leaving the house and Harry planing to leaving the house?

Instead of it being a random guy, why not have it be Dudley? Harry impersonates Dudley and leaves the house normally. Maybe two other adults could impersonate Vernon and Petunia?

Of course, this is assuming that the Death Eaters didn't know about the Durselys leaving.
