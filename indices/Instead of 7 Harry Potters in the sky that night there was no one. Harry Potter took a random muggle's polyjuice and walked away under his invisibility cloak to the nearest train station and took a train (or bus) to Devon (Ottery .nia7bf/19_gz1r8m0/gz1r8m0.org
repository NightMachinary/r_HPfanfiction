I can't argue that the 7 Potters plan was dumb because it was but there are ways to reveal someone under the Invisibility Cloak. For example Dumbledore does it in Book 1 and Dementors (who were on the loose) can detect you. As a matter of fact I wonder why didn't the Death Eaters summon the Dementors when they saw there were multiple Harrys and for the real one to reveal himself by casting a Patronus (seems like the shape of his Patronus was common knowledge amongst the DE).

I would assume that if the Death Eaters who surveilled the area didn't know who else lives at that address they were not very diligent and thus deserve to be fucked over by a 17 year old. But assuming they did their job properly then one can assume they only saw the Dursleys get out and didn't care much about them since they were so sure Harry will come out eventually and they'll catch him.

Also why they chose that plan over other methods of magical transportation is explained in the book.

Anyways... that's my in-universe explanation. Realistically it was for plot reasons same as Harry's wand attacking Voldemort's all of a sudden despite Ollivander saying he never heard of such a phenomenon.
