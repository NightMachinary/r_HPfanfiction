That whole thing is one of the least thought through parts of the whole seven books.

- Locking up Harry in a place for two weeks, just to get additional two weeks of protection of household which needs to be evacuated anyway?

- Funny thing. If the limit of Little Whinging is approaching [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2003/11/13/surrey-showing-the-location-of-little-whinging-on-the-scene-investigation-by-nik-the-hermit/][the location of Staines-upon-Thames]] then it is quite close to some rather interesting places: Windsor, Ascot (could you imagine what would snobs like Dursleys do with that location?), but what's most interesting in this situation, Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. It is strange, that nobody used this location properly (not even for example in “[[https://canoncansodoff.fanficauthors.net/Muggle_Summer_Wizards_Fall/][Muggle Summer, Wizard's Fall]]”, where Harry spends a lot of time at Windsor, and where he has to look at Little Whinging right out of his window). I have used this in one of my story, where Mr Granger was the former navy surgeon on HMS Hermes during the Falklands War and he picked up Harry (who arrived under the Cloak by bus) at the Academy (yes, of course, I know that the Royal Navy is not the Army, but he could have friends there).
