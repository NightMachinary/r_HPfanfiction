  Locking up Harry in a place for two weeks, just to get additional two weeks of protection of household which needs to be evacuated anyway?

That I agree with. I mean it was more like a month and not two weeks, but it never made any sense for Harry to go back there. The clever thing would have been for Harry to go directly to a save house with the Dursleys being take to safety while Harry was still at Hogwarts after Dumbledores death so they wouldn't be killed when the bloodprotection broke the moment he wouldn't go back.
