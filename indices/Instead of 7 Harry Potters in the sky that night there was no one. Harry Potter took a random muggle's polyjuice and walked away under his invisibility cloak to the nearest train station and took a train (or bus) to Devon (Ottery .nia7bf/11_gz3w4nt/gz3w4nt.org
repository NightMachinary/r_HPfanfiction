Snape confunded the plan into Mundungus, who probably suggested it to the order. My main problem with the whole thing was who the hell listened to this plan and thought: "Yes Mundungus, (who we trust and all think very highly of) this plan is absolutely brilliant! "

I cannot /believe/ the order would go with anything Mundungus comes up with.
