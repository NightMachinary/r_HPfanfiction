  Why were they camping for months, doing absolutely no training.

  Why did they not tell anyone else about the horcruz in case they died. (Not even any plans to reveal the truth after their death or capture) which should have been on their list right after their capture at Malfoy manor.

It's even worse, the whole Horcrux Hunt as a concept makes no sense. It's putting the cart before the horse. Their problem /right now/ isn't Voldemort's immortality, it's that they don't know how to defeat him and how to destroy his followers & power base. Destroying the Horcruxes doesn't fix that and in the end they only defeat Voldemort due to pure dumb luck (a miracle). If Voldemort had used Sectumsempra instead of AK in the end it would've all been for nothing I guess?

If they capture, maim, obliviate the fuck out of or even kill (it took him years to come back) Voldemort, they (with the help of the new government) would have more than enough time to hunt and destroy his remaining Horcruxes. Getting to some of them would be ridiculously easy in comparison.

It's bonkers. Imagine if the Horcrux Hunt took them years "Great, Volldemort is mortal now, now we just have to take back Magical Europe which is under his thumb and find a way to fight the strongest Wizard ever. No biggie." But for reasons of plot everyone pretends if they destroy the Horcruxes they automatically win?! Maybe JKR forgot that the Horcruxes aren't the One Ring? It's even stupider when you realize that they have no way of knowing whether they actually got all the Horcruxes, so it doesn't even work on it's face if it were an "I Win" button. They easily could've missed one (like Harry's).

DH constantly drives the plot along, desperately asking us "please don't think about anything that's going on. Just be excited about the action, drama and cool set-pieces!"
