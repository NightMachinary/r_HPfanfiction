I completely agree,

That line about not being able to make portkeys made absolutely no sense. They were at war, in a later screen someone tells harry to stop using expelliamus and basically kill death eaters.

Can't really worry about them being able to track the maker of a portkey and not worry about someone being killed.

It's even worse when you actually try and apply basic logic to every plan in that book.

Why were they camping for months, doing absolutely no training.

Why did they not tell anyone else about the horcruz in case they died. (Not even any plans to reveal the truth after their death or capture) which should have been on their list right after their capture at Malfoy manor.

Why did they decide to have a final stand at Hogwarts. They pitted 17 year olds against experienced (and probably trained) killers. It should have an absolute blood bath.

Surprisingly I actually like their plan for breaking into gringots. Despite their warning about not trusting goblins they had a fairly decent plan. An inside man is by far the easiest way to break into anything. But if they had told an adult they could have at least had their plan checked over.

Overall every plan in the final book reeks of someone who doesn't believe they can die. Which is classic for young people. But to someone who has had so much experience with death (Harry) you just hope for better planning.
