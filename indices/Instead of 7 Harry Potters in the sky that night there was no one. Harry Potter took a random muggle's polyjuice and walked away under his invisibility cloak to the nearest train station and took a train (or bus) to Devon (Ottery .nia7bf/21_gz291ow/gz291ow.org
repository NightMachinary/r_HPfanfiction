In the fanfiction that I'm currently writing, the main character is a girl that the Death Eaters aren't allowed to hurt, because if they do Voldemort instantly dies forever. So what I did was, since Harry didn't want to endanger everyone's life with the 7 Potters plan, she proposed to have 7 people who looked like her.
