They acknowledge on page it's not a perfect plan but it's the best they have given the circumstances. The whole idea of Harry staying at the Dursleys for as long as possible was to keep him safe. Given one of the most trusted members was believed to be a traitor and the Order knew the Ministry was slowly but surely falling under the DE control, it makes sense to push a safe bet to the last moment so you can add sufficient protection to the next safehouse which also wasn't safe anymore immediately after the DEs took over the Ministry.
