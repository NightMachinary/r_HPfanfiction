That, and the fact that they waited until the last possible moment. Why didn't they just piss off a week early? If 6 years at Hogwarts teaches us anything, it's that Harry's not safe /anywhere/.

How to find him? Send Dementors and follow them, or stalk all the schools in the area, or grocery stores, or just go door-to-door and see where you can't enter. Then send Inferi, or cast Fiendfyre, or infect the whole area with Dragon Pox. Tell Lockhart that finding Harry would make him /incredibly/ famous, and then follow him.
