So the premise of the conflict, if I understand it correctly, is 'if Harry uses magic he will be found'.

Now why would Harry use magic? To protect himself obviously. But if Harry is in a pre-arranged safe-house, created without Snape's knowledge, then there is nothing Harry needs to protect himself from. Furthermore the Order doesn't need to worry about the protection falling on an arbitrary yet publicly known date and require a last minute risky evacuation from a publicly known location.
