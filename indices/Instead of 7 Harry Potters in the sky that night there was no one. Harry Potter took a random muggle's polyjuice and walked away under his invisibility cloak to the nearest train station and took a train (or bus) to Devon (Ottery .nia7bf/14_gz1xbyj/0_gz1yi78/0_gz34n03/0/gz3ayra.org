Well the only example I remember is for example Molly everytime Arthur brings a muggle object.

It's just that I think everyone in the wizarding world is taught to keep the 2 worlds appart. I get that wizards have to keep magic a secret, but why not venture in the muggle world too ? Especially since its much bigger. I always remember a Disney show named "Wizards of Waverly place" i know it's totally not the same thing but that's why I keep asking why not use muggle things in daily life.

I think that's one if the main reasons why muggleborns are hated. They are considered a link between the 2 words. I mean, all muggleborns are taken from their world and thrust into the magical one and "supposed" to stay in it. For the whole 7 years at Hogwarts, they only see glimpses of the muggle world during Christmas and summer, which is unfair. Like why not belong to both at the same time?
