Well, to be fair the books were always mostly dismissive of muggles as a whole with a focus more on the muggleborns, like: “I, Lord Voldemort, shall eradicate all muggleborns!... oh, yeah and muggles too, they gotta go”; “oh no! The death eaters are prosecuting muggleborns using the ministry!... and they are also forcefully teaching children the Dark Arts!... oh, yeah, they are also killing off anything from a few hundreds to a few millions of muggles I guess...”; “I, Harry Potter, shall kill Voldemort in revenge for killing my parents and all the other people he killed that I liked including Hedwig and Sirius even if it was by proxy! And to save all muggleborns and so called blood traitors like my two best friends! And because the prophecy said so!... ah yes, he is also killing muggles... I think I also should do something about this if I have the time...”

Not saying they weren't being idiots by not memory charming/confounding/imperiosing muggles to provide them the means to live like kings while they are risking their necks to kill Voldemort, only that all in all the muggle side of thing was always sidelined by all sides, so not really hypocrisy... to be fair though I definitely enjoyed cannon and other stories which focus on the Wizarding side of things more than I enjoy stories which try to give muggles protagonism or which explore the muggle world in-depth. Plus, if all those Indy!Harry stories taught us anything it is that “The Non-necessary camping trip of DOOM!!!” is always a better choice than “The adventures of Harry, the Rich, in his Quest to Buy Everything on Existence” which I can see a muggle-aided camping trip easily becoming. Artificial tension? Hell yes, still better than the alternative.
