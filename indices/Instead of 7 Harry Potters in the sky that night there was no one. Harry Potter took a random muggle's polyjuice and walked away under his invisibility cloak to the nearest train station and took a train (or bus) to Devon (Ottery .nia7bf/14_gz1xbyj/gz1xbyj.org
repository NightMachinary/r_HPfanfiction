This makes so much sense. There are so many different ways wizards could use muggles and muggle technology to win the war. Like, for instance, why didn't Harry, Ron, and Hermione just grab someone's RV and drive around England glamping? No need for tents, foraging for mushrooms and edible plants, etc. Comfort on the go. Or hell, stay in muggle hotels or B&Bs! And why didn't any of them have cellphones?! Worried about your patronus being intercepted? Use a cellphone! Pretty sure the Death Eaters weren't well versed in how one can have an entire conversation in only gifs and emojis.
