Addding to that, have the Dursley family leave in the morning and prevent them from returning for a full day. Have Tonks and Polyjuiced Order members return in disguise to give the illusion of everything being normal. Then take Harry out.

We've also seen human-to-animal transfigurations in canon (Crouch Jr. turned Draco into a ferret). That could be a way to take the extra Order member out of the house.

But this relies on logic, and we know how crap wizards are at that.
