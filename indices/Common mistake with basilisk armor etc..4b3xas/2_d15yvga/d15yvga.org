I hate basilisk hide armour in stories. It's not a flying animal so it wouldn't need to evolve thin skin. So for me, it's incredibly thick to both protect and insulate a burrowing creature.

Actually, I hate dragon leather armor too because it's always so OP.

Now characters rediscovering the properties of armour could be an interesting story. I'm basicallly doing that in my Darkness!Harry story.
