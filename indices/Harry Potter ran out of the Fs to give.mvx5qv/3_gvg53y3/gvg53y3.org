Somewhat related, but had a silly idea for one that uses the fact that you lose your magic was never stated and is fanon where the contract literally forces you to compete so if you didn't prep at all you'll likely hurt yourself trying. Crouch Jr 'competed' by entering harry as his proxy champion in the idea, so when harry sleeps in one day Crouch gets increasingly fidgety until he just starts screaming and dives into the lake. I have no idea if any stories currently exist using this premise. One could argue that the goblet works that way in cannon as Harry tried to win even though he only had to compete.
