Although my favorite part of this story is when the aurors ask him if he has a way to contact Sirius, and he gives them three off the top of his head.

  “She has a Senior Auror by the name of Shacklebolt and an Auror Second Class by the name of Nymphadora Tonks on the case of finding him. She's also asked if /we/ have some way of finding him.”

  Confused, he looked at her and asked, “Haven't these people got a lick of sense? Just send him a bloody owl! How do they think /I/ get in contact with him?”

  Harry heard the auror standing closest behind him suddenly groan in dismay.

  When both teens turned to look at him he was staring back at Harry and shaking his head in exasperation. Without a word he then cast an almost silent Patronus and said to it, “Madam Bones, Potter suggests sending an /owl/ to Black.”

  The Patronus, a small bear, then galloped out through the wall, heading south.

  Harry just snorted in amusement and said, “Really? Is /everyone/ in magical Britain that daft?

  “Won't he have up owl redirection wards?” asked Hermione.

  “Any and all wards, including an owl redirection ward, can only be set up on a place---a fixed position,” he replied. “As Sirius is on the move, he will have no such ward set where he is; unless, of course, he's passing through one at the time.”

  Turning to the auror again, he asked, “You realise that, since you can cast a corporeal messenger Patronus, you could also send him one of those, right?”

  The look of pain on the auror's face was, in Harry's book, ‘priceless'.

  Not waiting for a reply, Harry turned back around, Hermione was only a fraction of a second behind him.

  “That's /daft/,” she muttered.

  That's when Harry caught out of the corner of his eye a second corporeal Patronus gallop out through the wall.

  “They're also forgetting they could use a house elf to take a message to Sirius, as well,” he snarked loudly enough for the auror to hear him.

  “Oh, for Merlin's /sake/!” the auror exclaimed.

  Neither teen bothered to look, they just smiled at each other.

  That had a /third/ messenger Patronus sent.
