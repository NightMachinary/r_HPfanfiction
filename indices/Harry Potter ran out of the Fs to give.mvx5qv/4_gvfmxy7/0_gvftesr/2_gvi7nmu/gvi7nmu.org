  this was actually Hermione in Too Many Champions

First, I must admit that too often I read fanfiction in order to nitpick it apart and seek inconsistencies - both internal to the story and in regards to established canon.

Rather surprisingly - to myself that is - with "Too Many Champions", this proved not to be the case. I ended up reading a coherent story that progressed nicely from the premise till the end. And with seeds for further story-points having been planted well in advance without the way too common blindly obvious blinking highlighting of "now you read this part carefully, lad; it will become important later on, you hear me!?"

Frankly, I enjoyed the reimagining of the events of The Goblet of Fire portrayed in the fanfic. Inconsistencies were few and inconsequential, the writing style (and the general behaviour) of characters was extremely similar to that in the canon books and the few grammar mistakes I spotted may have been simply my own imagination (seeing how english is not my native language).

But just in order to get my nitpicking-quota fulfilled;

- to me it nearly always feels "wrong" when the main characters get referred to as "the couple", "the teens" in the text (or "the duo/trio", which I think didn't happen in this fic, but falls into the same category)
- leaving Ron as "less than a side character" ... somehow just feels bad
- the characters making plans B/C/etc. for each of the tasks felt unnecessary since they never got used
- the last chapter was fun, but felt mostly unnecessary for the story

Overall... I liked this one :)
