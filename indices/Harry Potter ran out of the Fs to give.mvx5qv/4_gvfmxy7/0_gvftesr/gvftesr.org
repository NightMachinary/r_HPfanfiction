  One fic had him using "accio" to get the dragon egg. Then he mocks the organizers for bad planning. I think he mentions something about wizards having no logic or common sense. Then he uses "accio" again to get the hostage (he accio'ed the hostage's clothes), and mocks the organizers again. Then he uses "accio" again to get the cup. Every time the organizers claim it was a completely unexpected solution.
