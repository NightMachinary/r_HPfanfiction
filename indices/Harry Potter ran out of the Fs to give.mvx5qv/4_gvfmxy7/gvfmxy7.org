I've read at least 2 fics where he makes minimal effort.

- Sits in a chair reading a book while the dragon glares at him.

- Wades into the lake, shouts "accio", and gives up when it doesn't work (accio doesn't work on people).

- Lets the merpeople fetch his hostage and pays them with their favourite food.

- /Just/ enters the maze, then sits in a chair reading a book.

One fic had him using "accio" to get the dragon egg. Then he mocks the organizers for bad planning. I think he mentions something about wizards having no logic or common sense. Then he uses "accio" again to get the hostage (he accio'ed the hostage's clothes), and mocks the organizers again. Then he uses "accio" /again/ to get the cup. Every time the organizers claim it was a completely unexpected solution.

I remember one fic where he was so angry that he pounded the egg flat with a large hammer.
