Malfoy's mouth shut and he gave Harry a cruel smirk after his latest barb.\\
Harry just sighed, before pulling out an empty bottle and peering into it.\\
"Whatcha looking for, Potter? Your sanity?" Malfoy snarked.\\
But Harry just shook his head, "I'm looking for a fuck to give, Malfoy," he answered, turning the bottle upside down, "But it seems my fucks have runneth dry."\\
"We could get more the next time we're in Hogsmeade." Ron offered, before he shook his head, "Wait, no, there's a shortage at the moment."\\
"Tell me about it," Harry grumbled, "I even borrowed some fucks from Gringotts so I could have fucks to give, but now I'm out again and still owe them the fucking debt."\\
 \\
"Hey, here comes Luna." Ron pointed out.\\
Indeed, Luna Lovegood was approaching them, Malfoy using the distraction to slowly back away.\\
"Hello, Harry and Ron. Or Ron and Harry." she greeted them airily, "I was going to go hunting for fucks this afternoon, did you want to come?"\\
Harry shook his head again, "Sorry Luna, I think fucks are out of season. They'll have migrated south this time of year."\\
