I think there's a difference between folk knowing who you are, and celebrity. How Harry was treated in the leaky cauldron was celebrity. Hagrid walking in and half a dozen folk knowing him by name, and most of the rest knowing him by reputation, is just being well known.

However broadly I see your point. I think jk made the world small, but acted like it was big. Most fanfic authors make the world big, but then make it feel small.
