I think JKR made Magical Britain MUCH too small. The complexity of specialisation, size of government, size of the economy, etc. does not match a tiny community.

So Harry should not be a celebrity in the conventional sense, in the way that one is never a celebrity in one's small town. There is an element of commentary on modern Britain in this parallel magical world, but to add to the plausibility of the Statue of Secrecy (small numbers help with anonymity) makes other elements less credible. I guess realism was not a priority.
