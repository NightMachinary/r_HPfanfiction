  Most fanfic authors make the world *bigger*, but then make it feel small.

FTFY. But yes, this is basically it. JKR made magical Britain tiny, just big enough to function, but made it feel equal to a big city or a small muggle country. As I've written before, a lot of the weirdness of magical Britain makes more sense in the context of small town politics.

But on the other hand, fanfic authors make the world bigger, sometimes by adding more schools, infrastructure, and population in Britain, but mostly by including other countries because JKR is so provincial. When she's not specifically writing about other countries, she makes it feel like Britain is the whole wizarding world, but even when you include other countries, it's still pretty small.
