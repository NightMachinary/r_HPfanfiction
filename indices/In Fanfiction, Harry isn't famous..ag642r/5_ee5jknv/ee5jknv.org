Though fanfiction can tend to make it feel smaller, cus as the fanfic authors know even minor characters so well after immersing into the fandom for so long, the familiarity shows through and is reflected in their writing. Where as JKR's canon didn't have time to address every minor character. It's the fandom that has developed randomly name-dropped characters like Daphne Greengrass into ones with loosley defined backstories and personalities.
