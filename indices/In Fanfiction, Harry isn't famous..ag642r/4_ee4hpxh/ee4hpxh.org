As far as I understand it, there is one school of magic in Britain, and there is how many that go there? Less than 200, I think, even accounting for the fact that the canon classes are smaller than normal (because of the previous war), it is still quite small. I would be surprised if magical Britain is more than 10k people.

And that is the same number as a small town where practically everyone knows who everyone of importance is.
