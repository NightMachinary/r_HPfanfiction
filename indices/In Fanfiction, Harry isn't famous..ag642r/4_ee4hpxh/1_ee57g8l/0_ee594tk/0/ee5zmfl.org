Rowling is bad at math, she said as much in an interview once. I would pick a size between 40 (Harry's year) and 150 (his parents' year) and go from there. The staff is already inadequate for the number of students. They can't see any class more than 3 hours a week, and then only if they double up the houses for all classes like in the movies (even with 6th- and 7th-year classes being all 4 houses). This is with classes starting right after breakfast and ending just before dinner.
