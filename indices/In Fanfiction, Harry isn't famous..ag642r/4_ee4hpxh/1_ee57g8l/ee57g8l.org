The less than 200 estimate is based on all 7 years being the same as Harry's year (5 boys and 5 girls to a dorm, 10 students to a house per year). If that were the case then there would have to be at least one other magic school in Britain to take the extras. But the 40 students in Harry's year were only what was planned and not all of them are even mentioned in the books.

The thousands of students estimate is from (as far as I can tell) the first quidditch game the stands were packed with thousands of people. Fans tend to forget that parents, other relatives, scouts from pro teams, and important community members may also be in attendance; as they would at a school sports event in real life). Moreso because the travel times are more convenient.
