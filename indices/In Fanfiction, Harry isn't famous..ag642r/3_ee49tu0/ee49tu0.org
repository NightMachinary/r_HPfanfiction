i think to a certain extent, the smallness of the wizarding world makes sense, at least for harry's generation--

for one thing, while there's been debate about if JKR did it intentionally or not, many people noticed that her estimate of the hogwarts population was way off compared to the size of harry's class - but i think it's a safe assumption that his class would've had more students had there not been a war on (like, harry's parents & neville's parents didn't make it through, surely other would-be parents died before getting a chance to have kids). so we know his class is smaller than usual.

on top of that, if we assume that harry had at least some coverage in the newspaper, surely some extra fame would rub off on anyone tangentially connected to him - members of the DA, or classmates who had stories about school with him, or anyone who saw him in the final battle and gave a compelling interview. additionally, he spoke at the trials of the malfoys (.... i read a lot of drarry so pardon me if this is pure fanon but i feel /pretty/ sure JKR said this in an interview) so they probably would've gotten press coverage.

so, while i think it makes sense that right after the war there'd be a baby boom and the population would jump up again, i think it makes sense in a relatively insular community that the main players in fic (harry and other students at hogwarts with him) would probably know each other or at least know of each other, and might be a little bit famous on their own too.
