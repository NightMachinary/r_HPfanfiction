That wholly depends on the fic being read, because it certainly does not happen in every fic. I find that in a lot of fanfics it is maybe understated a bit, not that Harry isn't famous but rather that because his fame is already established in canon it does need to be reestablished in the fic.

Besides that I think people knowing each other by face or name is also simply a device to avoid having to write about introductions the entire story, which is tiresome to read. I've seen fics where the whole "I am Heir Daphne Greengrass of the Most Ancient House of Greengrass, but please call me Daphne. Only if you call me Harry." swill is used again and again and I can't stand it because it's not how normal people interact.
