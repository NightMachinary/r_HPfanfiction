Sure. I definitely didn't intent to paint every fanfiction with the same brush. I was just speaking in general.

I suppose I've just read a few fanfictions recently where people will notice that "plan is off" or "something is wrong" because they see someone they don't recognize. Like, that level of confidence is knowing everyone around you is astounding.
