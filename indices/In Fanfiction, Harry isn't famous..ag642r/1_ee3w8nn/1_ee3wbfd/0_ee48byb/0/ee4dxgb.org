Referring to the ministry something I think is if we say the ministry started out small and slowly gained more tasks and power to uphold the statute of secrecy, it would grow and need more people working there but since it seems having only one or two kids is average from what were given the population doesn't increase with the demand for people in the ministry effectively.
