as [[/u/ubiquitous_archer][u/ubiquitous_archer]] said, they are definately books that mature with the reader and the character.

The first 2 are 100% kids books aimed at kids (10yrs?). Book 3 and 4 are a bit older (13 yrs?)... early teens... book 5 is mid teens (14yrs?), books 6/7 are later teens (15/16 years ish?).

You can read them at any age but i don't think you'd really appreciate the themes and context until those ages is what Im trying to say...

So overall yes, they are kids books aimed at kids.
