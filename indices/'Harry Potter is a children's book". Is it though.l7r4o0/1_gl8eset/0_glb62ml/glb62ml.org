Children's/YA books are intended to appeal to an audience a year or so younger than the protagonist, something they can see themselves becoming in the not-to-distant future. Kids as a rule do not enjoy reading stories about somebody younger than they are. So the original target for the first book would have been 9-11 year olds.
