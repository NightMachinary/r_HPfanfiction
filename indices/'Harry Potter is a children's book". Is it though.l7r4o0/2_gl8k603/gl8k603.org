It's a bit complicated, but I guess you could assume that book one was especially targeted towards children. I know it's written from little Harry's POV for the most part, but even the book as a whole just comes across as being childish in many ways. For example:

- The Slytherins are so blatantly and collectively the mean, evil house without even some shades of grey. Yes, it's Harry's POV (such a convenient excuse that's always used), but none of those students are ever shown in a slightly better light at any point. They're the evil ones who younger readers are supposed to dislike, while the average older-reader would probably wonder if an entire house could be such a waste of space.

- We're supposed to cheer and feel triumphant when Dumbledore dishes out those convenient points at the end of the book (I did as a child). However, the average older-reader would see that that was a rather unprofessional thing to do at the time (some children might, too). At the very least, Dumbledore should have given those points earlier or just not given them at all. Let the Slytherins win, so what? But seeing as it's a children's book, I guess the narrative had to make Harry and friends beat the evil Slytherins (hooray!).

- The adults are almost useless, while the children are, for the most part, the heroes of the book. However, the average older-reader might wonder if Harry even needed to stop Quirrell in the first place (what if Voldemort just couldn't get that Stone no matter what?).

- It's very convenient how the obstacle course just so happens to be within the capabilities of the trio. Of course, had there been some truly difficult protections set up (i.e., maybe something Rune-related or some extremely difficult spellwork, etc.), then there wouldn't have been that grand sense of adventure for our little heroes. The trio would be stuck and/or would be forced to finally leave it to the adults. I'm not sure if that would've made for a good outcome in a children's book.

- The Dursleys' abuse is mostly dumbed down (JKR supposedly had to do so in order to reach a wider audience), whereas the later books imply that Harry might have been beaten by Vernon at some stage. Also, what we /do/ see of the Dursleys' abuse towards Harry is mostly played off in a comical, light-hearted way.

There might be more examples of the book itself being made more 'child-friendly', but I'm not going to list them all. Bottom line is that the series originally started off feeling like it was targeted at younger viewers first, and then got darker as things went on (and not just because it's from Harry's POV).
