Outcast Alley is one other fic I know that fits my requirement, but it's so old and kind of strange. I don't really mind the Snape mentorship thing, even if only comes to life late, but it's not really an HP fic, it's more of a young parent with a child fic. Still good, though.

EDIT: I wish it was complete. I remember I enjoyed it quite a lot, even though I never reread it.
