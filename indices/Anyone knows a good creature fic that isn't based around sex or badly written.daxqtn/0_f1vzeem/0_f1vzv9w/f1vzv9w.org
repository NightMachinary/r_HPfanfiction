Yeah, I know that one, it's fun, but not exactly what I was looking for. Creature inheritance in that fic is quite common. While a fun fic and quite humorous, it's not what I was looking for. More in line with Small (Creature) Comforts, with the cliche puberty(birthday)->inheritance or something similar... More in line with HP canon, that's what I meant.

Still, a very good rec, all things be told. Thanks!
