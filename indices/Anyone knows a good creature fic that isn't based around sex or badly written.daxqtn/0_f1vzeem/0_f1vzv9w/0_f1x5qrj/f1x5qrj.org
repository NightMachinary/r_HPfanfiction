yeah i sadly don't know any creature-inheritance fics that don't have a ton of romance involved, it seems that it pretty much all does, usually cause it makes for a good excuse for some romance either cause their form is monstrous and the whole inhuman romance genre existing usually for adults but not always (looking at you Sherrilyn Kenyon and Stephanie Meyer) it's it's really rare that any sort of creature fic doesn't have romance as a plot point and even then it's basically never inheritance but just turned into a creature out of nowhere, usually animagus hijinks but not always....and even some of those end up having alot of sex
