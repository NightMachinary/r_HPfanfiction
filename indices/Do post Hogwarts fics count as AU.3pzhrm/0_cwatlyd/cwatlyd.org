No.

AU explicitly changes something known about canon/assumes a different universe as its premise. Something can build extensively from canon, and so long as canon is complied with, it is not AU.

E.g. Alexandra Quick, Unatoned, and The Pillars of Power, are not AU. Alexandra Potter, Renegade Cause, and OTWTG are all AU.
