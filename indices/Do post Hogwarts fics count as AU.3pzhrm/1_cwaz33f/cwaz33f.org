For me, I consider any fanfic that has any difference in canon /before the start/ of the fanfic an AU.

Also, anything that explicitly changes how the actual Harry Potter universe works is also AU.

Stories can divert from canon and not be AU. Right up until they are. But not always. More of a judgement call.

That's usually how I categorise an AU.
