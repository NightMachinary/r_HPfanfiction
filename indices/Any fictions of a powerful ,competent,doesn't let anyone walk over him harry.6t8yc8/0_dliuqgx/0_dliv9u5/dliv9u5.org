What's ao3,and Maybe my description is a bit too vague,what am really looking for is a well written harry I can relate to or understand his logic behind his actions a good example I know of is the harry from harry potter and the boy who lived. He's sensible,power is growing,he's smart and the book is easy and fun to read,try it if you haven't.
