The FIREBOLT! Not for the broom itself, but for the betrayal of trust (Harry's trust isn't easy to earn - hell, I doubt he trusts any adult at all (frankly that's why I never get why he follows Dumbledore...that guy is the reason he was treated like human trash/a houself for years!), except - maybe - Sirius Black!)

Make a big scene about why Hermione shouldn't have gone to McGonagall in the first place, because she didn't even try to reason with Harry (or: be a true Gryffindor and fly the broom herself to see if it is safe!)
