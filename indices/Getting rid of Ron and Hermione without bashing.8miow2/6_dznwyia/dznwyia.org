Ditching Hermione... The firebolt, but thats kind of a dick move. SPEW... Cursing the signup sheet for DA. I think a canon Hermione would not compromise her values to keep her friends. So if the friends called her on it.. easy split. But easiest you've already said, just do the Troll save, but then Harry doesn't befriend her.

You can get 2 for 1 and have Harry ditch Ron because of how he treated Hermione before the Troll. Harry doesn't want a friend who knows all about him from books. Harry doesn't want a bully for a friend.
