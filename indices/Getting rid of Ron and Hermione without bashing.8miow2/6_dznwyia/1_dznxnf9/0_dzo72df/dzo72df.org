  SPEW, unless Hermione is using Harry's name to get members, I don't see how, outside of "Shut up, ask an elf what they want, end of discussion"

She bullied Harry (an orphan) and Ron (the super poor kid) into paying her/donating to SPEW, and that is a dick move.

Plus she was trying to do the same to others (it did not work out, and alienated the whole house)
