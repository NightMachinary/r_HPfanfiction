The Firebolt could have them with a "But I thought after everything you've been through, you'd trust me" Moment with them, and they'd fall out but not completely. Cursing the signup sheet for the DA, do you mean "That was just mean" or "You could have at least put a silencing charm on it" SPEW, unless Hermione is using Harry's name to get members, i don't see how, outside of "Shut up, ask an elf what they want, end of discussion"

I just don't want to see a Harry that's so reliant on others that he's pretty useless without them. His reliance on Hermione is a major weakness. If she'd died in the DOM, and Harry had stayed the same as canon, Voldemort would have won because he was too reliant on Hermione.
