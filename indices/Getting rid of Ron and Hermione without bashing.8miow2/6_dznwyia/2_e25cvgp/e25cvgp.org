Why is it a dick move? You have to frame it right! It's not about the broom itself, it is about the break of trust (she got a teacher involved instead of really trying her best to convince Harry that he should do it himself! Hell, she also behaves unlike a Gryffindor! A true Gryffindor would take the broom and fly it herself to show if it is cursed or damaged etc.)
