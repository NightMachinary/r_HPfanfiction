Maybe just have Harry apprentice under someone since he's got Voldemort after him? Like if he studies under Dumbledore early on, you wouldn't need to axe Hermione since he wouldn't be as reliant on her. Assuming the troll incident happened, there's not really much that could believably wedge their friendship apart unless it was really heavy-handed. The firebolt incident was practically nothing, Harry was being pretty stupid, and that aside I can't see a split likely to happen without someone being very OOC. I mean, she was willing to give up someone she was in love with and modify her parent's memories to keep helping him in DH, and deal with persistent public backlash and harassment in GoF. Hermione is self reliant, but doesn't seem willing to drop her first friendship.

As for Ron, eh, there are lots of possibilities if you simply must drop him. The midnight duel, making fun of Hermione (wouldn't Harry hate bullying?), his idea to fly the car to Hogwarts landing them in hot water (ok, tbf Harry was stupid for agreeing), etc. Some non-canon compliant events could be if for some reason Harry has to keep spending money on something and Ron grows more and more jealous at his wealth. Heck, maybe he'd be really annoyed that Harry didn't pay for him to get a new wand when his busted in book 2. I dunno.
