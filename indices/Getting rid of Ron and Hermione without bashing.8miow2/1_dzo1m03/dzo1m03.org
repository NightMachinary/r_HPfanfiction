Hermione dies to the troll (really is it that hard to believe two eleven year olds couldn't stop a dangerous beast?). Harry know Ron was a big part of why she was in the bathroom crying. Harry realises that was bullying and he doesn't want to be the Piers Polkins to Ron's Dudley. Harry politely distances himself. Ron is annoyed but forms a close friendship with Seamus and Dean like in the fourth book. That leaves you with a Harry who realises that Hogwarts isn't entirely safe. The magical world is dangerous and a staff feeling they need to do more to protect the students. If Dumbledore knew about Quirrelmort then would he deem that too far and drive him out the castle?
