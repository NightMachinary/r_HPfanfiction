Is Duelling actually against the rules at Hogwarts if it's sanctioned or is that just fanon? Could one of them just said "Why not after Dinner in the Great Hall, or are you too scared?" They DID have a Duelling club, so it implies that sort of thing happens.

I was paranoid at 11 i admit, but that's because i hated Primary so I'd have seen it as a trap.
