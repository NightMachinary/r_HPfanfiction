Not really for 11 year olds, it's basically a fight behind the school at 4 when all the teachers are gone. It's not like they could have had a fight in the Great Hall or out in the open, they'd get caught, and if they had spectators one might snitch. Basically choosing an obscure location at the dead of night was their only option to avoid getting in trouble.
