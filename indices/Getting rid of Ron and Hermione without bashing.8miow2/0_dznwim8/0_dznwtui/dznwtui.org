I was hoping for actively shoving them into the background. Harry's reliance on Hermione is boring (and usually even worse in fanfiction where Hermione is written as a Beautiful genius that knows more than Dumbledore - aka, written badly) I'd rather them just "gone" as such. Like, Harry didn't appreciate Ron forcing him into a Duel.

Would having Harry feel like Hermione is undermining his intelligence by constantly checking his essays without him asking count as bashing? That'd be a way for them to break off a little otherwise
