I like to refer to one of the snippets in this lot, the 'Introduction Ron' one.

If you want to have no Ron in your fic, and it starts before first year, simply have Ron pass up Harry's compartment in the train, perhaps using reasoning like in the above fic. From there he can stay relatively out of focus for the rest of the fic.

Hermione's a bit trickier; at the start she's a bit bossy and obnoxious (It's 'levi-O-sa') and realistically would cast a bit of a shadow over any scene she appears in because of it. Still, she's just trying to help, so given time everyone could get used to her and vice versa and she could fade into the background as a helpful resource to all of our non-protagonist students.

For later years...Hermione is almost-bludgeoned by a troll, Ron /is/ bludgeoned by a giant stone knight, Hermione gets petrified by a basilisk, Ron is nearly eaten by giant spiders, then they all have to endure Dementors, Ron is 'attacked' by Sirius Black and has to deal with the fact that a grown man (le Wormtail) was sleeping with him in his bed for years...honestly, when the only thing that really happens to the two of them in their fourth year is being held hostage at the bottom of a freezing cold lake, it must be a relief. And then at the end of that year Voldemort is revived, blood traitors and mudbloods beware.

So at pretty much any time, Ron could go, "Mate, I'm sure you've noticed, but ever since we came to Hogwarts it's been one life-threatening...threat, after another. And now You-Know-Who's back, in a body I mean, and Hermione & I, well, we're probably on the top-five of his hit-list. Hermione's parents and Mum and Dad are all planning to pack up and move to Jamaica, think you can talk your aunt into getting out too?"

And Harry could go, "Nah, mate, someone's gotta stop Voldy. He'd probably come after me anyway if I went abroad. I'll owl you when it's safe to come back, alrighty?"

And there you go. Ron, Hermione, and whichever Weasleys you want removed gone from the story until the epilogue.

Short version, use 'We don't want to live in a country that has Voldemort running around AND a Ministry in denial' as a justification to Put On A Bus them.
