For Ron, his fangirl reaction in train ride and asking Harry if he remembers that night (Seriously dude! You don't ask someone if you remember your parents death and call the scar he got when his parents died "wicked") might push Harry away. He might just go and sit another place and drift away from Ron. For Hermione there wouldn't be any friendship to speak of if it weren't for the troll accident. So just don't put Hermione in bathroom during troll accident. Put someone else you want Harry to be friends with or don't put anyone let the professors deal with troll.
