I can't remember when Ron tells Harry that Slytherin is bad. If it was on the train or before Draco speaks to Harry, then Harry could snub Ron when Draco tells him to but still be in Gryffindor so Ron doesn't want to be his friend. Ron and Harry's relationship could be like him and Seamus/Dean's, so friendly but not really friends. Dean and Harry could bond over being from the muggle world, possibly Dean could introduce him to football/Harry could already have an interest in it and that's where their friendship starts and then you don't need to worry about breaking up any friendships since Ron/Harry are just acquaintances. You don't even need to address any potential friendship with Hermione. Harry ignores most girls early on so could ignore Hermione too.

I'm not sure if Harry quitting quidditch would be enough to break up Ron and Harry's friendship since Ron is Harry's first ever friend it seems so would take something quite substantial to end that. Also, if Harry wasn't seeker, wouldn't Ginny take on that position so Ron wouldn't be resentful of Harry quitting quidditch when it paves the way for his sister to be on the team eventually.
