After First Year, and Ron is obsessed with Quidditch. Harry might not want them to break up the friendship, but they'd at least be a lot less close. Ginny would be a first year, there'd be no Seeker til 3rd year and would Ginny have the confidence to try out at that point. Ron would get jealous of Harry throwing away the oppertunity, Harry would be like "If you want it so much, you go for it yourself, you can even use my Broom" and who knows?
