Ideally early, but with still Gryffindor Harry. Weaning him off of Ron and Hermione's support, so you can have an actual independent Harry without making him Lord everything cliche. For Ron i was actually thinking "Harry quits Quidditch after first year because Wood had too many practices taking up way too much time, after seeing Voldemort still alive, it gave Harry a wake up call", but Ron doesn't understand why Harry wants to quit, so they kind of part on neutral terms . For Hermione... I really don't know.
