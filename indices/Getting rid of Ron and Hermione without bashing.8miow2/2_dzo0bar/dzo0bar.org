When Ron doesn't believe that Harry didn't put his name in the goblet of fire, that could end their friendship. Equally when Rita Skeeter starts rumours that there's something going on between Harry and Hermione, Hermione could distance herself because it causes friction in her relationship with Krum or Harry decides that Hermione is encouraging the rumours somehow by constantly being around him so he distances himself or they argue.

Or, if you want something earlier, at the beginning when Draco tells Harry not to be friends with Ron and to pick "better" friends, Harry listens to him. Either becoming friends properly with Draco (maybe even ending up in Slytherin because he doesn't know to ask the hat not to put him there) or temporarily being friendly with Draco, realising they don't get along and Harry drifting towards other people who aren't Ron or Hermione.
