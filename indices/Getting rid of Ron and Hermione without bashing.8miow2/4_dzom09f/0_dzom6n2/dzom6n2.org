Just wanted a reason for Harry to suddenly gain competence without him becoming a Trope. So Hermione not being around to hold his hand and do his work for him would help. And an "After first year" because Harry gets shaken by Quirrel would be enough Drama, and enough for Harry to stop jobbing and actually try.
