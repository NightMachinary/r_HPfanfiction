Why not make him ask the twins for stuff (he has an in via Ron and he get the cloak for christmas! I bet the twins would love using it , as it is doubtfull they can already cast a disilusionment spell (much less full invisibility Dumbledore style))? I mean it should be clear that the twins no all sorts of interesting magic! You can then have Ron fall by the wayside as the older students are just more usefull to a Harry who is driven (Ron isn't, he's a slacker!) and wants to learn and make something of himself! Same for Hermione (if you don't want to have the troll end her!)
