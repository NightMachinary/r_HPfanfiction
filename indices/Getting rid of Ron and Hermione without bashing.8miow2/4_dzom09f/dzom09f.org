Just have him befriend other people. 11 year olds aren't that complicated. The most plausible chain of events is just him meeting all the Gryffindors, and then he simply gets on better with someone else. It's the standard first year at a new school: everyone sort of makes an effort for the first few weeks to talk to everyone else and then end up fitting together in groups depending on their various interests.

Maybe Harry gets on well with Seamus or Dean and spends his time talking/studying/goofing around with them. Maybe he finds comradeship in the Quidditch team and their assorted friends. Maybe Harry sits next to some Hufflepuffs in class and finds them friendlier than he's ever experienced before Hogwarts and so hangs out with them.

There doesn't need to be a definitive "break" point for Harry to not hang out with Ron and Hermione, they can be ushered into side characterdom organically as simply as choosing to spend more time with other people. To do otherwise is often just drama for drama's sake.
