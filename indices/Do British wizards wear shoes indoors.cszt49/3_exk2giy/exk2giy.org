Context would vary, but I don't think it would be at all unusual for them to wear shoes indoors. Obviously if they were spending all day at home, they wouldn't put on shoes to walk around their own house. However, if someone came to visit the house, the visitor would not be expected to remove their shoes on entering.

Remember cleaning charms are easy, so there's even less need to make people remove shoes than in the Muggle world.
