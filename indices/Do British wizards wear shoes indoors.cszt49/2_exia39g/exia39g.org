I think, at Hogwarts, they would take their shoes off in their dorm rooms, by their beds or maybe at the door to their dorm, in order to keep the shoes from being lost, stolen or pranked. They would then keep their shoes off while in their common rooms, only putting the shoes on when they're going out into the castle proper. I assume the common rooms have carpets or at least lots of rugs.
