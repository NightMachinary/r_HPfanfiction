Most Brits take their shoes off when they enter the house, or at least before going upstairs. It would be a little odd, in my opinion, to wait until you were getting into bed or into the shower before taking them off, unless you were stumbling in drunk or something. Most of us walk about in socks/slippers/barefoot. There are frequent mentions of slippers in canon.
