linkffn(10972919) in which a SI OC with knowledge of the future ends up as a voice inside Tom Riddle's mind. Does he convince him to use his powers for good? To become the next Dumbledore instead of Voldemort? Hahaha... no.

He corrupts him even more and helps him take over the world and do it properly this time, of course.

An hilarious crack-fic.
