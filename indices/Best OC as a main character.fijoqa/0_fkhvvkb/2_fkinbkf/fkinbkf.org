Eh, many hints point to it being Harry. E.g, when he mentions that Tom should get Dumbledore thick, woolly, socks for christmas. And the timescale seems to match up as well. Only Harry and maybe vaguely in Ron/Hermione's memory it would stay. Only Harry would remember, in my opinion.

It seems like a Harry knowledgeable and integrated into the muggle society, as he say's stuff like 'tom and jerry has a nice ring to it'

He knows a lot more about the wizarding society than he lets on- e.g telling how wizards are sorted, so is definitely a wizard.
