I really like Maud Moody from the Darkness and Light series by R.J. Anderson on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4446/R-J-Anderson]]

It's Snape/Female OC and originally written before OOTP came out with some small changes made later to incorporate the canon from OOTP.

I also really like Rüdiger Zweigl from Rüdiger Zweigl and the School in the Mountains on ffnet , sadly this story is unfinished.
