I know what you mean about Death of today. I do think "what we are" and "what we may be" are close to death of today in quality. Harry's not really a death eater in that and Voldemort goes a slightly different route as "Lord Slytherin" but I really enjoy the politics in that one and the interactions between Harry and his parents. So many fics where Harry sides with Tom involve Potter!Bashing if James and Lily and still alive and those fics are more realistic. "Again and Again" is very good too though Harry's not a death eater in that either.

Thanks for your suggestions. I've read a world gone astray. I've not read rebuilt though. Added to my list.
