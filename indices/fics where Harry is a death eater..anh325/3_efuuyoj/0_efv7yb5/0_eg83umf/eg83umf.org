Oh shit, I must've missed your response in the weird log-in/log-out shuffle Reddit keeps making me do! Glad you enjoyed it :)

I'm not sure that I'll ever do a /sequel/. A multi-chapter Death Eater fic /is/ something I want to do, and I've got like 3-4 incomplete drafts tackling the idea from different directions, but none of them directly follow Initiation and I don't think any will. I'm content leaving that particular fic a oneshot, if only because I have no plans for a plot extending beyond what's there and done.
