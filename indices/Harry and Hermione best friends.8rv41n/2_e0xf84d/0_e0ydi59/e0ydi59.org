No, In canon, Harry goes through something and she sticks by him. the focus is on him and she's the support. I'm looking for stories where they both go through something, or make a life changing decision and go through it together. for instance, in one of the stories I gave as an example, they overhear information and together decide to distance themselves from the Order. they are both going through the same things with only each other to lean on. does that make it more clear?
