Ginny in the later years of linkao3(Harry Potter and the Girl in Red) is the best I can think of, but she's not the MC.

Also, if that counts, my Hermione in linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor) can spit fire since Third Year, and isn't afraid to use that, but she has no affinity for /other/ spells than the modified /Fiendfyre/ in question.
