Harry and Ginny from [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54][The Meaning of One]] kind of apply.

They don't have an affinity for fire, but their overpowered magic turns the harmless bluebell flames spell Hermoine uses in Philosopher's Stone into a room-sized fireball and since as first and second years they don't really know any other powerful offensive spells it ends up becoming their "nuclear option" for when shit really hits the fan.

It's not the best fit but it's the only fic I can think of that matches the criteria.
