I'm fairly certain that marriage laws and other such weird shit in fanon is extrapolated from the way love potions are handled both in-universe and narratively. Everything that we see of love potions suggest that not only does wizarding society not mind that date rape drugs are openly sold, but the way they're treated by the narrative itself is if they're a joke. It would be weirder if wizarding society /didn't/ have some extremely questionable practices as well.

At the same time, I think it was both incredibly cowardly and boring for Rowling to tone down love potions. Not only are they clearly not creating true love (or at least, planting the seed for it), but they have an extremely limited duration It just seemed like a way to play off something she added without thinking about much at first, and had to reconcile it with a story whose characters are supposed to be interpreted as good.

This is why nobody can really agree on the morality of the wizarding world. It's not that there's moral ambiguity, it's that there's inconsistencies between character behavior, the setting, and the narrative.

There are interesting stories to be told and conflicts to be had revolving around love potions, but you wouldn't see it outside fanfiction (and truthfully, there'd be a lot of people complaining anyways).
