Point is, the love potion isn't what made Tom incapable of love, it's the fact that his parents' relationship fell apart, his father did not care about him, and his mother died shortly after giving birth to him. And while those things were caused by a love potion, there is no direct link from this to Tom being incapable of love, thus it is symbolic, the love potion becoming a symbol for what happened but not the direct cause of what happened to Tom.
