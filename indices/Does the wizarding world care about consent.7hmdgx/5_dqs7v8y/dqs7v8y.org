I'd be leery taking the presentation of love potions in the books to represent the position of the wizarding world. Like many aspects of Rowling's worldbuilding, the implications weren't thought through. If they /are/ a correct depiction, that's insane.

Yeah, the twins really suffer from Rowling's 'pranks are funny' bias here. IIRC their love potions last up to 24 hours, which is /really scary/ as a date-rape drug. I will note that the love potions they sell are marketed only to witches, and the 'attractiveness of the girl' apparently influences the strength of the effect (as does the weight of the boy). It's not clear if these potions are totally generic or if they only work when used by girls on boys. They'd be /slightly/ less terrifying in that case, albeit still horrifying.

  brewing Amortentia is a NEWT class without an apparent worry over the potion going awry as with the Felix Felicis.

Did they actually brew Amortentia in class? I recall Slughorn showing them a cauldron of it during their first lesson, but I don't remember anyone else making any.

I think it's fair to suggest that wizards care much less about consent than contemporary society. A few notes:

- Magic-users go about their daily lives constantly armed with a deadly weapon. As a matter of practical course, this means anybody who feels their consent has been violated can retaliate with extreme measures. Even if they can't get away from you, their friends and family can intervene with a lot of firepower.

- The aphrodisiac effect of Veela is looked upon poorly by at least a substantial minority of society, but tolerated. I'm struggling to think of a male character expressing substantial disapproval - Mr Weasley is annoyed, and the referee at the World Cup is angered, but by and large there isn't substantial blow-back against the Bulgarian mascots casually influencing the minds of the crowd.

- There are no canon examples of love potion use I can think of other than women using them on men.

- It's important to remember that there's a huge divide between the rights of wizards and the rights of muggles, who are casually mind-raped with widespread government and societal approval.

- Equivalent effects to what we would consider date-rape drugs (cheering charms, elixir of euphoria) are easily available to high school students and above and not subject to significant regulation or control. The recipes for much more powerful potions (Weasley's Wizard Wheezes) are readily available to intelligence researchers/dedicated experimenters, and Amortentia (assuming Dumbledore's theory is correct) is within reach for an uneducated, possibly illiterate Merope.

- The unforgivability of the Imperius curse does reassure us that the wizarding world considers /some/ levels of coercion to be illegal/immoral.

- But, on the other hand, Harry is bound by the Goblet of Fire without his knowledge or consent, and nobody even /mentions/ this other than to tell him he must compete.

It'd be interesting and illuminating to see what would happen if in reverse of the Romilda Vane love potion fiasco an older, male Hogwarts student successfully dosed a younger, female student. Or even just an older student dosing a younger student. I'd very much like to know what Dumbledore's reaction would have been had Ron (or Harry) not been prevented from acting on his artificial desires.

So by and large, I'd guess that (sexual) consent is important /if/ the people involved are wizards or have powerful wizard relatives/patrons, since they might otherwise register their disapproval by hexing their assailants and making noise in front of the Wizengamot. But if the victim can't defend themselves and no one else comes forward to complain...

If the person giving dubious consent is a somebody in a bad situation (e.g. Merope, a poor debtor not skilled with magic, a near-human who is legally prohibited from having a wand, a squib, or a muggle in the know) then I don't think wizarding society cares (other than people like Hermione). I know some fics have taken this to its dark conclusion: seedy Knockturn alley brothels where the sex workers can, among other things, be forced to polyjuice into whatever form the client wants. I think this is realistic.
