  I'd be leery taking the presentation of love potions in the books to represent the position of the wizarding world.

They did have a presentation on Amortentia in 6th year. Even if they didn't make it (AFAIR), showing a love potion to a group of horny teenagers is gonna give them ideas.

I don't know if Snape would have showed it if he had potions that year though.
