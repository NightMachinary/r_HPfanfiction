  Even if they didn't make it (AFAIR), showing a love potion to a group of horny teenagers is gonna give them ideas.

True... but it /was/ the first NEWT potions lesson, and Slughorn was clearly trying to 'wow' them with some of the most powerful potions available to master brewers. Hence the draught of living death and felix felicis in the same display. It was a much more mature and serious setting than your average potions class and the focus was on technical brewing, not 'here's something you can do.' Students who got an EE on their potions OWL and chose to continue on with NEWT classes might reasonably be expected to behave with reasonable caution when it comes to brewing dangerous stuff (Not that that ever stops teenagers from getting into trouble). It seems tame compared to other mentions of love potions in the books, I guess.
