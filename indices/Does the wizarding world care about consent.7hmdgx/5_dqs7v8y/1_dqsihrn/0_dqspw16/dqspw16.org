To be fair, we do not know how exactly the love potions that the twins sell work. If they have a clear influence on the mind of the one they were given to then yes, it's horrible no matter what limitations they may have, but if what they are doing is limited to simply making that one girl appear way more attractive to the person who took it so they have a hard time to not behave like a horny dog but could possibly resist it then it's “only” questionable.

Since we do not know whether the love potion that was in the chocolates came from the twins or if that's a different one (since she originally offered him gillywater, which presumably was spiked with their love potion), we can't say for sure that the potions they sell have that kind of effect. But yes, considering that she had access to whatever she put in the chocolates (since that one clearly affected the mind), be it gotten from the twins or be it self-brewed, something is seriously wrong with that society as a whole.
