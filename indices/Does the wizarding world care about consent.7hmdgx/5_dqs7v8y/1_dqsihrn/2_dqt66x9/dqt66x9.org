I'm not sure how you can read

#+begin_quote
  They'd be /slightly/ less terrifying in that case, albeit still horrifying.

and conclude that I think girls raping boys is okay. I say, right there, that I think this scenario is horrifying.

Scenario 1: love potions work when used on anybody by anybody. Scenario 2: love potions only work when used by women on men.

Let me be clear: *both of these scenarios allow a horrifying and unconscionable amount of rape. Neither is acceptable.* However, I think it is clear that scenario 2 is /slightly less terrible/ than scenario 1. That doesn't make it okay. That doesn't mean I like it. That doesn't mean I wouldn't run screaming if I ever had to face it. That doesn't mean I wouldn't fight tooth and nail to change it. It just means that one is /slightly less evil/ than the other, and if we /only had these two options/ I would prefer the second.
