I'd like to chime in hear to say that, first of all, this is perhaps one of the most coherent, calm, and decisive explanations of a misunderstanding I've ever seen on reddit in my entire life. Good job! But I do feel compelled (because this is the internet) to say that you're original comment (the whole less 'terrible') thing was incredibly easy to misinterpret, especially as this is a thread about rape.

Rape is a really important, and also easily triggering topic; and in many cases any discussion talking about male victims can cause even more redditrage as we live in a culture where 'don't drop the soap' jokes are still considered relatively PC. In many cases where an issue feels ignored by mainstream media, anybody with strong feelings about the issue, or who knows anybody effected, often feel extremely compelled to speak out against any and all slights.

So all in all this was a very calm and well thought-out response to such an instant outpouring of hate, but I just wanted to try and explain why that hate came both so suddenly and so bitterly. This particular subset of the topic is something very rarely discussed seriously, and indeed public discussion of it is often frowned up/seen as a lot weirder/less important than other, similar issues; so when the topic comes up in places where people can comment anonymously, avoiding normal public scruples and/or the danger of being branded as some kind of crazy MRA, tempers can flare ridiculously high.

:) TL:DR I'm just kind of rambling cuz long angry comment threads hurt my soul.
