Okay, I decided to come back to this comment chain and write a lengthy clarification.

    It's not clear if these potions are totally generic or if they only work when used by girls on boys. They'd be slightly less terrifying in that case, albeit still horrifying.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

This is what I said in my original comment. You originally replied with:

#+begin_quote
  It seems like it's not just the wizarding world who have an interesting view on consent...

  I mean boys being raped is fine as long as the girl is hot? That's an interesting world view you've got there. And by interesting i mean fucked up beyond belief.
#+end_quote

Boys being raped is wrong. The nature of the attacker does not matter one whit. Anyone being raped is wrong. Anyone having their consent violated is wrong.

So we are in full agreement on this point. A worldview that 'boys being raped is fine as long as the girl is hot' is fucked up beyond belief. *I DO NOT HOLD SUCH A WORLDVIEW*. If I did, I would be evil. I would be fucked up beyond belief. *BUT I DO NOT HOLD SUCH A WORLDVIEW*. And I /resent/, in the strongest possible terms, your accusation of such.

What we disagree about, then, is whether I mistakenly, wrongly said something that made you think that I think:

#+begin_quote
  I mean boys being raped is fine as long as the girl is hot?
#+end_quote

I don't see anything in my original comment that expresses approval of this idea. Please, please, please, can you quote the sentence that was problematic and help me see why what I said was wrong? Because I'm horrified that something I said seems to express any kind of approval for sexual assault, and /I can't figure out what it was/. Please, please, please, help me understand.

    Yeah, the twins really suffer from Rowling's 'pranks are funny' bias here. IIRC their love potions last up to 24 hours, which is really scary as a date-rape drug. I will note that the love potions they sell are marketed only to witches, and the 'attractiveness of the girl' apparently influences the strength of the effect (as does the weight of the boy). It's not clear if these potions are totally generic or if they only work when used by girls on boys. They'd be slightly less terrifying in that case, albeit still horrifying.

It seems like this paragraph is where something could be wrong with my original comment. I'll try to break down what I intended to say sentence by sentence.

Pretty straightforward, I think. The love potions that we see in the books are terrifying as rape drugs.

Also straightforward, this is something talked about when Harry et al go to WWW in the Half-Blood Prince. But we're getting closer to the potential problem, I think.

Me musing on a possible fact about love potions; it's possible that the magic is somehow 'gendered', that it is restricted in who can use it and who can be affected.

This is my opinion of the case where the love potions are usable only by a specific group on a specific group. I'll add the clarification that the actual genders don't matter to my opinion (i.e., it would be 'slightly less terrifying, albeit still horrifying' if the potions were only usable by women on men, women on women, only usable by men on men, only usable by men on women, or only usable by X on Y where X and Y are categories smaller than 'anyone').

So somehow the previous sentence asserted that, in your words:

#+begin_quote
  boys being raped is fine as long as the girl is hot
#+end_quote

I do not believe the sentence

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    They'd be slightly less terrifying in that case, albeit still horrifying.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

does anything of the sort. Can you explain your train of logic to me? Where did I express approval for any kind of sexual assault. *Albeit still horrifying*. I don't get how you can read those words and think that /I think/ any kind of sexual assault is okay. I don't! I don't! I'm sick to my stomach that you and a lot of others seem to think that I believe this. I don't know how I can say it any clearer.

  Again, /how is it slightly less terrible?/
#+end_quote

It is slightly less terrible because there are fewer options for rape drugs available to some sexual predators.

Again, it is still terrible that consent is abused by anyone, anywhere. But in one situation /some/ evil predators have a harder time assaulting /some/ of their victims.

It's like, there are evil people who do evil things, and restricting love potions doesn't stop this, I agree. Both worlds are terrible. But love potions are a tool in some predators' toolboxes, and in the case where their use is restricted /this tool is taken away/. Isn't it slightly less terrible if predators have a harder time raping people? Like I said, *this is still horrifying*, but isn't it a tiny, tiny, almost insignificant improvement? Isn't it slightly less terrible, and we all understand that this does not prevent it from being evil in the extreme? Can't I look at two horrific eventualities and note that one is the lesser evil, even if the difference is so small it's almost unnoticeable in comparison to /how evil/ both of these situations are?
