  I mean boys being raped is fine as long as the girl is hot? That's an interesting world view you've got there. And by interesting i mean fucked up beyond belief.

[[/u/jedijinnora][u/jedijinnora]] never even said that. Perhaps you misread of perhaps you are a bit touchy about the topic, but I can't say. You went fully torqued and immediately attacked [[/u/jedijinnora][u/jedijinnora]] which really isn't cool. You assumed they are speaking about their opinion on male rape victims but I don't even think that's what they are speaking about at all.

Here is what was said:

#+begin_quote
  It's not clear if these potions are totally generic or if they only work when used by girls on boys. *They'd be slightly less terrifying in that case, albeit still horrifying*
#+end_quote

They are saying the potions are terrifying regardless of who they effect, and that belief is clear. They are actually correct in saying the situation would be less terrifying if the potions only works by girls using them on boys, but not in the way you're insinuating. It's less terrifying, although still thoroughly terrifying, simply by looking at the numbers. Roughly half of the population not being able to utilize the potions is objectively a less terrifying situation then if everyone were able to dose anyone else whilly nilly. Actually it would be even less than half of the population if you take into account that male/male and female/female wouldn't be able to utilize the potions, so again it's minimized a bit more.

Another point is that [[/u/jedijinnora][u/jedijinnora]] mentioned the drinker's body mass alters the effectiveness of the potion as well as the users comeliness. Considering men on average have a higher body mass, we could say that the effectiveness of a potion dose on average would be reduced if used only on men. Once again the whole situation is /slightly/ less terrifying. Really that would be the best case scenario for possible love potion victims if the victim were on average of higher body mass then the user. Speaking about the comeliness, if the user were already attractive to the drinker then the potions effects would be more pronounced. That just makes logical sense. It has nothing to do with a belief - a belief I doubt [[/u/jedijinnora][u/jedijinnora]] even has - that male rape victims are /not actually/ being raped if the assailant is a pretty woman.

I need to reiterate again that [[/u/jedijinnora][u/jedijinnora]] *didn't* mention anything about a belief that 'men don't get raped as long as the assailant is pretty'.\\
You are entirely wrong in assuming and insinuating that was said.
