  It's less terrifying, although still thoroughly terrifying, simply by looking at the numbers. Roughly half of the population not being able to utilize the potions is objectively a less terrifying situation then if everyone were able to dose anyone else whilly nilly. Actually it would be even less than half of the population if you take into account that male/male and female/female wouldn't be able to utilize the potions, so again it's minimized a bit more. Another point is that [[/u/jedijinnora][u/jedijinnora]] mentioned the drinker's body mass alters the effectiveness of the potion as well as the users comeliness. Considering men on average have a higher body mass, we could say that the effectiveness of a potion dose on average would be reduced if used only on men. Once again the whole situation is slightly less terrifying. Really that would be the best case scenario for possible love potion victims if the victim were on average of higher body mass then the user.
