I agree. They mentioned a bezoar once in class though. Like I said, from Book 4 onwards, none of the classes other than DADA were shown seriously. They are more like a background description to the main showcase - Harry's angst, Hermione-Ron arguments, Snape's bias and all that. The first three books however, were a delight - sufficient insight into each of the subjects.

Also, finding it hard to recall? Use the official HP wikia! I use it shamelessly
