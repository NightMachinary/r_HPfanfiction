Dark thought: maybe they don't give a damn as long as it's used on Muggles? True, there's the misuse of muggle artifacts office, but what if the purpose of that department is actually closer to being a part of maintaining the statute of secrecy, and not about muggle protection? That actually makes some sense- Arthur is already shown to be a bit of an odd one out for his fascination with Muggles, I don't think any other magical raised in the wizarding world shows that much interest. He could be skewing our view of his job.

Maybe using a love potion on another magical /is/ a joke- like they expect you or a friend to realize what it is. I mean, look at some of the darker pranks the Marauders pulled on Snape. The public humiliation, the hexes... maybe it's in the same vein of stuff.
