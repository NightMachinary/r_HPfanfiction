What do you mean how so?

Rape is being forced to helplessly suffer through someone forcing themselves on you sexually. It's a terrible experience that leaves you feeling impotent, violated, dirty and often scarred for life, or at least a very long time.

Obliviation is a painless, instantaneous and (unless you mess it up) harmless procedure that you don't even remember afterwards.

I don't see how you can equate the two at all.
