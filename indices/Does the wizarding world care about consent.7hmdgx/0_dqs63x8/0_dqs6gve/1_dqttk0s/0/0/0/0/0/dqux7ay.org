No one calls obliviations /actual/ rape. That's what the "mind-" qualifier is for. It's not rape of your person, it's rape of your mind. Obviously there's not a direct comparison between physical forcible sex and the mind, so you have to take those elements of physical rape which make it bad, and apply them to an act of crime against the mind. Obliviation fits those, so we call it "mind-rape."

At this point it's as much of a fanon slang term as "rape" is used in video games. If my team dominates another team so utterly that they say that we "raped them," no one is actually implying that I came to their house and physically raped them. Saying "Uhm, ackchyually, it's not rape," doesn't do anything. No shit, it's not actually rape. It's all the elements that make rape bad, except applied to the mind.

You arguing that obliviation isn't "actually rape" makes you sound like you're arguing that obliviation "isn't actually that bad."

  Yeah well, you can use a knife to cut potatoes or stab someone in the chest 37 times. Does this make knives evil? No, it makes people evil.

Yes, and you can use a penis to rape someone, but penises aren't evil. Good, I'm glad we at least understand that tools are not capable of immoral/illegal acts on their own accord. Nice of you to miss the entire argument there. We're not talking about "is the tool which is obliviation equivalent to the act of rape?" We're comparing the /act/ of obliviation with the /act/ of rape. You doing this is like me saying,

  Well, sure penises can be used to rape. But penises can also make babies, so that means rape isn't bad.

That sort of insane logic can't even really be disputed, so all I can do is just hope you see how your statement does nothing except deflect from the discussion at hand into a discussion of how little sense you're making.

Edit: also, your original statement is that "obliviation is nothing like rape." If you would not consent to memory modification, and you would not consent to rape (obviously, because if you consented it wouldn't be rape), then that's one similarity that took me no time whatsoever.
