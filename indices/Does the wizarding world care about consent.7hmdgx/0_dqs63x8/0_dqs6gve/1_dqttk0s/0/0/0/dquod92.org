You'd be cool with someone erasing your memory, then? Or would you be cool with being actually raped and then having your memory of the experience removed?

Hell, think of all the other weird shit that could happen. Would you be fine with someone removing your memory of the color blue? How about someone who takes away your ability to read yet leaves you with memories of reading? You would know that you used to be able to read, you remember reading books, but now you just can't. Etc. etc.
