  You'd be cool with someone erasing your memory, then? Or would you be cool with being actually raped and then having your memory of the experience removed?

Whoa chill dude, that has nothing to do with my argument!

Like I said, there are plenty of things in that world I would not consent to, that doesn't make all them them /rape/.

And you saying that raping someone and then obliviating that memory from them makes obliviation rape doesn't make much sense either. The rape is rape, not the obliviation, duh.

  Hell, think of all the other weird shit that could happen. Would you be fine with someone removing your memory of the color blue? How about someone who takes away your ability to read yet leaves you with memories of reading? You would know that you used to be able to read, you remember reading books, but now you just can't. Etc. etc.

Yeah well, you can use a knife to cut potatoes or stab someone in the chest 37 times. Does this make knives evil? No, it makes people evil. And while admittedly the wizarding world is pretty fucking backwards, there are apparently now laws preventing people harassing muggles with magic, so that /is/ actually against the law.
