  Mind raping Muggles was actually a cornerstone of their society - maintaining the SoS.

I don't understand this argument at all. In what way is this rape? Making someone forget something that has absolutely no bearing on the rest of their lives anyway, but has the potential to see a society destroyed, is quite justifiable to me.

edit: I should also clarify. I strongly object to the use of the word rape for things that are not rape, without making it clear that you don't mean it symbolically. It isn't true that any non-consensual act is is rape. If I get beat up in the street that is certainly not consensual, but it's not rape, it's battery. The only exception for this I can get behind is legilimancy because it's somewhat analogous to rape, but obviation is nothing at all like rape in any way.
