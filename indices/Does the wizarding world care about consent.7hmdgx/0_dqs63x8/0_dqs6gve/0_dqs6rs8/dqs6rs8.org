There's that, and I was also thinking about the fact that no one ever really sat Harry down and went, "Hey Harry, you just went through some fucked up shit --- for the second --- wait, no, third --- no, /fourth/ time. How are you doing?"

It was just, "You just witnessed a friend die and got tortured in the process? Eh, back to the Dursleys with you. By the way, you're going a month without any real contact. LOL."

Y'know, if it wasn't for the fact that Harry was so pure or whatever, I reckon the whole 'Dark Lord will mark him as his *equal*' thing would have played a bigger part in the story.
