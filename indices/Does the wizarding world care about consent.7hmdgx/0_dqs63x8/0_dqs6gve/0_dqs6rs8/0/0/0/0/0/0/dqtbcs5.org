I found one I liked. Apparently I read it over the summer. Have no memory of doing so, but my account posted a review.

It's about Sirius and Harry getting thrown through the Veil and into Yharnam. It's incomplete and not that long, but rereading it now, I like how the author describes the unnatural fuckyness of Bloodborne.
