  In real life my education was paid for by a mix of contributions from other family members, a bursary from the school, help from the government, and help from private charity.

Your secondary school education? Did you go private? Because if not, that's certainly... unexpected. I hardly think it's representative of the standard English high-schooler.

  If they do exist in canon then they wouldn't be mentioned anyway

You don't think the Weasley's would have mentioned it, or Harry would have mused how hard it must be for the Weasleys' to deal with having to pay four tuitions on top of uniforms and books?

  they wouldn't be mentioned anyway because it's a story book for children concentrating on the activities of children, not a treatise on the economics of education.

Because Rowling has in no way used the book series for children to comment on social issues, like poverty, child abuse, bullying, prejudice, bigotry...? It's not as if the main antagonists are literally wizarding versions of Nazis, and it's not as if one of the main families suffers obviously from poverty. /s

+Siriusly+ Seriously, though, Rowling is writing a book series for children, but at the same time, she isn't shying away from +Sirius+ serious issues. (Yes it's a /terrible/ pun. No, I'm not going to stop making it. He's my favourite character!)

  It is quite clearly based on English public schools

Is it? I can't see how, but then I suppose there's nothing to compare it to. The only link I can see is that it's a boarding school, but I think that's more for world-building and to get Harry away from the Dursleys' and into an obviously magical world, rather than a specific implication of tuition fees. Also, I suppose, it has rich upper class snobs there.

(Side note: I probably shouldn't be too harsh on private school kids; I did a year at a private school for A-levels)

But do you really expect me to believe that the Weasleys' put seven children through private school on a single government salary? That's insane! They'd homeschool from Fred and George onwards, if not before!
