How do you know? In real life my education was paid for by a mix of contributions from other family members, a bursary from the school, help from the government, and help from private charity. None of those things are mentioned in canon, but they're also not ruled out. If they do exist in canon then they wouldn't be mentioned anyway because it's a story book for children concentrating on the activities of children, not a treatise on the economics of education.

It is quite clearly based on English [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_school_(United_Kingdom][public schools]]), where annual fees are of the order of the entire annual salary for the average worker.
