  Did you go private?

Yes. My point is that it is clearly possible to go to fee-charging schools even if the family can't afford them. You can't just go from "the Weasleys have to scrimp and save" to "it must be a free school".

    If they do exist in canon then they wouldn't be mentioned anyway
  #+end_quote

  You don't think the Weasley's would have mentioned it, or Harry would have mused how hard it must be for the Weasleys' to deal with having to pay four tuitions on top of uniforms and books?

Being a charity case isn't something that I talked about with people at school, and I have no idea which of my school friends and acquaintances were charity cases, but statistically it's 100,000 times more likely that I win the lottery this weekend than that none of them were. So no, I doubt that the Weasleys would have talked about it, given that I didn't and none of the other charity cases I went to school with did. I don't remember whether Harry did muse about it in canon, but even if he did it would be reasonable for him to assume that they were getting help from elsewhere.

  But do you really expect me to believe that the Weasleys' put seven children through private school on a single government salary? That's insane!

You must have missed the bits where I talked about getting financial support from other family members, the government, the school, and other charities. None of that is ruled out in canon, and all of it exists in the real world. In particular real-world schools tend to have specific programmes to help fund the education of the children of impecunious ex-pupils.
