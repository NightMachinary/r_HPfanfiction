Perhaps not a eutopia (utopia actually means non-place; it's a pun), but somewhere where money is irrelevant. The Gemino spell should completely eradicate the economic structure. It should literally be a communist eutopia.

Hogwarts provides free education. There should be no money. It /should/ be a perfect instance of a meritocratic society. In reality, it would almost certainly be biased based on blood purity, but money shouldn't come into it.

No money. Free education. Easy healthcare (regrowing bones and limbs with magic/potions should be incredibly cheap, especially if you can just duplicate the ingredients).

The society might not be perfect, but it would certainly be post-scarcity. You can literally duplicate anything with a wave of a wand.
