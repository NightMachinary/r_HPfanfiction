  Hogwarts doesn't provide free education.
#+end_quote

I don't remember there being anything implying that there was a cost to go to Hogwarts. And Dumbledore doesn't mention a cost of tuition when he's telling Tom Riddle, Jr. about Hogwarts:

#+begin_quote
  There is a fund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes.
#+end_quote

It could be said that Hogwarts takes the cost from the assistance before it's submitted (similar to financial assistance for uni in the UK), but a) we're talking about the only school in the country, b) it's a secondary school which is almost always free, and c) it should be mentioned when the assistance is given, so a student who suddenly comes into money and therefore isn't covered by financial assistance isn't shocked by not being able to join Hogwarts the second year.

Also, if there were tuition costs, the Weasleys would almost certainly have gone broke after the trip to Diagon Alley in CoS, as I doubt they had enough to cover all the books (second-hand), new robes for Ginny, a wand for Ginny, and an unknown amount of tuition for 5 students.

Also, it is never implied that there is a tuition fee, and English secondary schools (as Hogwarts was most likely based off) don't have tuition fees.

  Food doesn't appear to be an issue in the HP series, but it's clear that other things are, like clothing and wands.
#+end_quote

+See, this is interesting, because I would assume it would be the other way around. Food can't be duplicated (first of the Principle Exeptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration)+

I just realised that you can use the Gemino spell on food:

#+begin_quote
  You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you've already got some...
#+end_quote

The Wikia page links "increase the quantity" to the Gemino spell page, so it seems that is covered.

Let us assume that you can't duplicate magical items, such as wands or invisibility cloaks, and retain the magic, since the Trio duplicate the Locket without any duplication of Voldemort's soul. Does that immediately discredit duplicating the materials? Are the magical properties of, say, wand woods, or potions ingredients, inherent to the material, or is it 'added'? There's nothing implying anything other than that the materials are inherent. An isolated oak tree would likely still provide wood that could be used in wand-making, although certain bits of wood would obviously be more suited to making wands from.

#+begin_quote
  resources are not infinite in the HP universe, only some non-magical resources are.
#+end_quote

If we assume that magical properties don't transfer (for the sake of the argument), that still doesn't apply to non-magical resources like metal. Metalic money would be worthless. Hermione modified and duplicated Galleons. It makes sense that a wizard like Mundungus Fletcher would be fine with duplicating Galleons and buying stuff with it. And since it's implied to be perfect duplicates...
