Their views on consent do not take into account various forms of manipulation. If a girl sleeps with you while she's on love potion then she did so of her own will at that time. Later when it wears off her will would be different but later isn't right now.

I suppose this means that they would also count blackmail as consent since you aren't directly making them do something against their will.
