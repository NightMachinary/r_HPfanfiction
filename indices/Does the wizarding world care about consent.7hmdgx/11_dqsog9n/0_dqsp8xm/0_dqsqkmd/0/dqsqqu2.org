I don't know that I really want to dip into the realm of whether they CONSIDER it rape. Rape has always struck me as a fairly black and white issue, whether someone believes it is rape or not. Even if your theory is correct, we shouldn't avoid calling it rape just because the characters in this completely made-up universe might not call it that.

I'm not up on Game of Thrones, so I'm not familiar with the show's politics on whether rape is alright or not, I'm afraid.
