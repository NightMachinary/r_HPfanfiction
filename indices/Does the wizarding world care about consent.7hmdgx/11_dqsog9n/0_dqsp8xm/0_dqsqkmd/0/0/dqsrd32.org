The Ironborn are basically pirates all around. Rather than actually being a crime rape is like some kind of life goal and you never really meet its quota. Raid a town and rape as much as you can. If you like a girl more than usual just keep her and she becomes one of your saltwives. Go back home, get laid and drink as much as possible until you need to raid for more cash again. Rinse and repeat for basically your entire life and that's an Ironborn for you.

As for the avoidance of calling it rape, that really depends on the narrative of a story. Good writing takes place over politics when it comes to fiction imo. If you can't correctly write a villain or other societies because you can't get over your own views to do so then you're a bad writer.
