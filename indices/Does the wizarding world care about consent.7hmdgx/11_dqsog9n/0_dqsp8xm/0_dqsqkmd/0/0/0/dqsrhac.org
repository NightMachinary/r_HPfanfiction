I mean, they know it's a crime. Like, when they go around with the raping and pillaging, they're aware that people think it's bad, and presumably notice the women screaming, struggling, or shaking with fear. They know it's rape.

Similarly, I imagine Romilda Vane knew what she was doing was questionable when she attempted to dose Harry with a love potion, presumably in order to rape him. Whether /she/ would call it rape is up for debate, but we could agree here, as outsiders from the narrative, that Romilda Vane would be a rapist, because she raped somebody.
