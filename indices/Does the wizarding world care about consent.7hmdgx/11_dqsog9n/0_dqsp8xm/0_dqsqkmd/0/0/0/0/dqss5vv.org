Romilda Vane would be a rapist in our own society. However Romilda Vane herself would grow up, live, and die in her society where she would not be.

It's like saying every man who is not a virgin is automatically a rapist because there are some feminists who believe that all heterosex is rape.

So are you a rapist because some feminists think you are? Because their social values apply that label to you? No, because you don't live in a society where that belief is the prevailing belief.
