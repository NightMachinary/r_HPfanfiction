Cannon always seemed to have an over-reliance on rule-of-cool and not take the worldbuilding part too seriously (Rowling ain't no Tolkien).

However, if cannon allows moral and consent issues to be trumped by the narrative, fannon seems to actively embrace it. Part of it is just people trying to flesh out the world, but there is a scary amount of celebrating the idea of having great power and using it to bend people to their ideals :/.

On the other hand, there are a few really good fics breaking down the implications that prove fun to read.
