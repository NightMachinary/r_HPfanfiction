If someone was gonna do this id direct then towards the thread about Luna being reverse-bashed in fanfics. It's like on the first page of most upvoates posts on this subreddit so it's not too hard to find.

In terms of specifics there should probably be some changes to what goes down at the Malfoy house during the book 7 shenanigans, it'd also be kinda interesting if Harry had been kinda keeping track of her with the map and slipped up and said something he shouldn't have known because of it. Also potential for some interesting interactions with Xeno because of the whole “Hey you betrayed me and my friends during the war and I'm now trying to sleep with your daughter.”

Regardless I think a very interesting twist to it would be to have a lot of it written from the perspective of characters besides Luna and Harry, or at least a few chapters.

There's also a lot of potential to use some of the drums do Grindelwald and Pottermore material to make some adventures and new beasties for the 7.5th year.
