Same, I even got to the point of going straight to the end of the last chapter to check it hasn't been marked as complete when it's been abandoned or if it mentions a sequel, going and checking whether the sequel is complete too. Got burned by that a few times. One I believe had 2 completed sequels, and the 3rd was abandoned after about chapter 6
