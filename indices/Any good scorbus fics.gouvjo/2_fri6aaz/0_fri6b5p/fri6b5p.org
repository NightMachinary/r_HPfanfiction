#+begin_quote
  Albus Potter gets through life by avoiding his family, working a desk job at St. Mungo's, holding onto grudges, and trying to convince everyone that being the son of the most famous man in the world isn't all it's cracked up to be. Meanwhile, he's determined to be silently in love with his best friend until death.But one day, he sees a pattern that no one else has--that no one wanted him to--and things change forever. A story about stubbornness, forgiveness, finding the person who makes you the best version of yourself, and learning to let go.
