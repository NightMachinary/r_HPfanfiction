I'm going to take a stab at the time travel fic you are talking about. Is it linkffn(Laughing All the Way to London)? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13173587/1/Laughing-All-the-Way-to-London][link in case the bot breaks]]

Time travel fic where Harry and Teddy get chucked back to Marauders era and Harry becomes the DADA teacher.
