The Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs is a bit of a controversial series, but by the time I've read the entire thing through I've always cried at least three times. I've also cried at The-Boy-Who-Lived by Gatalicious, Just Bearable by jstrat01, and A Dreary Tale of Katelyn Potter by FenneHP.

Unfortunately, I can't directly link the first rec (goes against Reddit policy), but I'll link the others with the linkffn bot.
