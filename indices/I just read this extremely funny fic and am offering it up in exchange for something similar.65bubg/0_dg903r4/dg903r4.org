It's got a very similar style to The Thief of Hogwarts and the Champion's Champion, which are two of my favourite humor fics. I think it's supposed to be a Harry/Hermione fic or eventual Harry/Hermione with other romantic interests such as Tonks so far. If anyone else knows any more fics like this, that would be awesome. I'd prefer H/Hr as they are my favourite pairing. Anyway, this is by far, one of the funniest fics I've ever read, and I seriously CANNOT recommend it enough.
