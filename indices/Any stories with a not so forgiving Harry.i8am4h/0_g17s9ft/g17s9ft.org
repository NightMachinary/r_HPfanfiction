I seem to recall that Harry not only does not forgive, but he does not forget in "A Cadmean Victory." I also seem to recall it being pretty garbo. Unfortunately, most revenge or ruthless Harry fics tend to be not great.

I didn't love "The Sum of Their Parts," but it is a solid fic if you somehow haven't run into it yet. Good luck with your search!
