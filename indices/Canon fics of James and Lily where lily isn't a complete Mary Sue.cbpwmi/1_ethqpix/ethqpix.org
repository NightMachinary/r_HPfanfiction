Hmmm... well there's An Unexpected Attraction by thegingerhairedlass. It's basically a telling of James and Lily falling in love from their sixth year all the way to the Halloween night of their deaths. It's pretty long but also complete, so that's a plus. It's a lot more teen drama-ish in the beginning but gets darker and more serious as it goes on, but overall I really recommend it.
