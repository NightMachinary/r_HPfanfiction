Linkffn(the bet by auntleona0) and linkffn(the grindylows)

Same author. Her Lily has depth and definite flaws. And both are L/J.

The Bet is complete, long and canon compliant.

The Grindylows reads a little variant (there's some messing with the timeline, and in its current spot of the fic, Sirius is dating Lily--which is like the /most/ non-canon thing I can imagine ðŸ˜‚), but it's not time travel or anything.

(For Lily, I think you find more depth in longer works. It's hard to give such a seemingly perfect character nuance in your one shot.)
