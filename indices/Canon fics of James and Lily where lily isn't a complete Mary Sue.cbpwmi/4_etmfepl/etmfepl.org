Dirty Blood is a brilliant story. You should read it! ( linkffn(Dirty Blood) )

It is about the Marauders and Lily and her friends in their fifth year, so no real romance with James yet, but everybody is equally in need of growing up and has their issues. I personally find Lily the most unlikable out of the cast at times, but in the best possible way. Read it, it is brilliant!

​

Other than that I hope the Lily in my own story isn't too much like a Mary Sue, in that story I focus on Lily and all the issues she has and how and when she has to grow up and prove and improve herself. If you want to I can post a link. Sorry for the shameless self-promo.

​

But aside from that, really read Dirty Blood
