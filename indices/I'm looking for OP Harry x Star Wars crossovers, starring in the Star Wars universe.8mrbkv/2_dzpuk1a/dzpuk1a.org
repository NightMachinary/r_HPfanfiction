linkffn(Magic of the Force) Harry transports himself to the SW universe before he's even ten, and manages to make the spirit of Lily stick around. The Galaxy will never be the same. Be warned, the chapters are some of the longest I've ever read, and its only at chapter 8. (Have a day set aside if you want to read it in one sitting.)
