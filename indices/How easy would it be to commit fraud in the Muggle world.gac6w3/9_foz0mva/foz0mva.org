Obviously we are in fiction but real world one of the last estimates i saw was the world had over 171,300 tonnes of gold in their vaults. That equates to over 6.1 Billion ounces of gold. That would equate to a lot of galleons if in the hands of the goblins.

Now i like the stories where galleons were made from an ounce of gold and the protagonists melt the gold and sell it. For most of 91-97 the average gold price was $350 (£280) which was way more than the common fanfiction exchange rates of either £5 or £8 per galleon.

Some of these stories require goblin magic to be overcome, some stop this due to individual micro serial numbers on the galleons etc.

On the muggle side why not just disillusion yourself, apparate into a bank vault and take the money you want. Back in 1990's a lot of the protections for tracking currency weren't fully deployed or used. The downside would be they would know they were robbed.

Or better yet how hard would it be via spell or runes to take a £20 note and duplicate it but have the serial number increase by 1 for each note? Since each note is different and due to magic exactly real the odds of the muggles discovering the fraud would be minimal.

Finally, how about just stealing the currency from criminals (drug dealers etc) though in that one you risk getting bills marked by police who were looking at those criminals.
