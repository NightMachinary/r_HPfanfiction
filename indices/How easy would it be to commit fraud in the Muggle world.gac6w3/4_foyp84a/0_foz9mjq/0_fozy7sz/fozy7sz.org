It'd be even easier if you brought the non-copied money to Gringotts, because it'd probably take a while for it to be redistributed. Although Gringotts might be able to tell if the money was copied, so that could be an issue. Another way is to go to another country (magical transportation makes this pretty easy) and exchange it for their local currency, as, again, it would probably take quite a while to make its way back into the original country's system. Alternatively, just use it in different places across the country, and use a different disguise (polyjuice or otherwise) at each place. Different disguises would be a good idea either way. Once you have exchanged all of the money you want, and gotten rid of all the bills you duplicated (so you only have clean bills that haven't been touched by magic) then take it all back to Gringotts and get it exchanged. Even if the government caught on and found all of the duped bills, they wouldn't be able to tell who it was, and if they saw different people exchanging each bill then they probably wouldn't be able to prove it was someone perfectly counterfeiting money, so they might assume it was a printing error and just destroy the duped bills.
