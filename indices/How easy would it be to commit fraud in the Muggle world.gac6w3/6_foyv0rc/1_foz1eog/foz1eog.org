Probably. But doesn't that depend on if they have that closer cooperation with the muggle police so they know that a crime was committed and magic was used?

If I remember correctly the aurors don't track every use of the Confundus or magic in general. So unless your crime is so large that the Muggles are talking about it the less the likelihood that the Magicals will know about it.
