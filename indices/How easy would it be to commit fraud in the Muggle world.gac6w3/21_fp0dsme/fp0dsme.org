Fraudulence is making money through wrongful deception. Most mundane fraud schemes can be magicked up a bit with no issue. People are gullible enough to fall into scams every day. A minor confundus charm on a paper to be signed, or a glove worn during a handshake and it becomes a thousand times easier to trick people out of their money.

Fake designer handbags and rolexes would be easy to make. Cars would be easy to steal with an unlocking charm and then probably easy to wipe vins on or create fraudulent registration on.

Identity theft through legilimancy, polyjuice, compulsion charms, etc.

Romance scams would be simple with love potions.

That's just covering scams and fraud, not general crime. So lots of way to make muggle money through magic and a lack of morals.

As another poster mentioned though. If shouldn't be that easy, if there are laws against muggle baiting then there are going to be laws about scamming them out of money too. Is enforcement purely magical? Are there muggle teams looking for discrepancies in crimes that can only be magic that they report to wizards? Are their muggle teams that take care of magical criminals themselves? How well does that Statute actually work? Are most muggles actually unaware of magic, or is power power in the end, and do wealthy business owners and crime moguls keep a wizard close by to protect their interests?
