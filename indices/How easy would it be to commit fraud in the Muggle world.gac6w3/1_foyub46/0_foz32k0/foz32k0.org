I can't think of the name of the fic off the top of my head, but it had the grangers buying damaged antique furniture such that the sellers thought they were nuts buying such junk. They took it to harryxhermione's house and the elves restored it to like new.

If I remember correctly There was another story where Ron and Lavender would go into an estate and then restore/repair items with magic and then sell it in whichever world paid more
