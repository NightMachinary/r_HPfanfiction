A car repair shop seems like the perfect way to get some money from the Muggle world, yeah. The Reparo spell seems like it should fix it right up, cars commonly get dropped off to get fixed, and it's not cheap - so it's easy for a wizard to hide magic + make a tidy profit off of a single spell.

Plus, it's a service that's always in need.
