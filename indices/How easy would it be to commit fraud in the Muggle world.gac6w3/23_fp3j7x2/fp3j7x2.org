Very hard.

You cannot transfigure or conjure money in any form. This is a law of nature in the HP universe, one of the Gamp exceptions I believe.

Not to mention, even if you could do this, real money has a lot of hidden or secret attributes that signify its realness. It's very likely that your fake bills will be detected as a counterfeit. Transfiguration is hard, and requires some understanding of what you're making, so to transfigure a bill you'd need to know the exact chemical makeup of the inks, the precise fabric used for the bill, all the secret hidden markers and be able to duplicate them perfectly. If you're that good at transfiguration, you can probably make more money by doing it as a job in the wizarding world.
