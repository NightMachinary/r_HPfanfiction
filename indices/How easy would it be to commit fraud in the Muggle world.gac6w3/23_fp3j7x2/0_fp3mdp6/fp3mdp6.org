The law is about “real” Wizarding money, there is fake out there (leprechaun gold) and people can be tricked. As for mundane money it depends where and when you are for any security features to be present and that's just with paper money. Some currencies have high value coins with no modern security that a metalsmith could replicate. The muggle on the corner store would have no clue if a bill/coin is real or not. Also Transfiguration is just another skill, to be good you need to work at it.
