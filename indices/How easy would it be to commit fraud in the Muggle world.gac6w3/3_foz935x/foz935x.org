I think the key is that you have to put restrictions on it - if there's no oversight/limits, it'd be incredibly easy to scam/steal from Muggles without a problem (eg - use the imperius charm on a billionaire, siphon all their money away million by million, profit).

So the first thing you'd want to set up is /how/ the Wizarding authorities would identify and stop that type of misuse of magic. Is it a team of aurors/other officers? Is it through cooperation with a muggle team? Some sort of wide area sensor like the Trace? Etc, etc.

Those parameters are important to set up, because they define what your character would have to operate under to avoid detection.

In terms of shovelling wealth back into the WW, the method in question would probably depend. If you have Gringotts as heavily removed from the Ministry's control, then the Goblins might never tell on your character - and he could waltz in with purchased gold/silver/jewels and cash them in with the goblins without anyone knowing.

If there's some Ministry oversight to catch that sort of fraud, your character would probably need some sort of cover - say, a company that operates in the muggle world that the money would be laundered through.

One concern might be with how galleons are created/made - and stored - in the bank. We don't know if in canon, Gringotts has particularly advanced banking system - we just see the vaults with cash in it. Do they have accounts where you deposit it into a ledger and let the goblins invest, instead of sitting in your vault? If so, that sort of constant depositing/purchasing of things from the muggle society would work (probably hard species like gold/silver/jewels, assuming that magic can't create those). If not, and it's limited to just the physical galleons, then going through the goblins would have a limit. Instead, you'd need to find something else that you can sell at a profit to wizards (unless the goblins have no limit to how many galleons they can produce)
