I think a pretty strong argument against muggle fraud would be simply that, with magic, there's just no point in fraud. Even if you make conjuration and transfiguration temporary, so you can't just mass-conjure expensive electronics, you can still get broken things cheaply to repair with reparo. Perhaps you can divine or arithmancy stock markets. If you're not a student, you can automate quite a lot with magic and produce muggle items.

Otherwise, banknotes do have serial numbers, so perfect duplicates can still be detected. Even if a shop wouldn't, Gringotts may as well catch it.
