I expect it depends on when it was set. Money in the UK has a UV pattern/number on which only shows under UV light. Counterfeits don't tend to, or people have written them on with a UV pen and it is really obvious. Not sure when this began. Any Â£50 notes are considered to be particularly suspicious and always warrant extra caution. My thought it that unless they knew to transfigure the UV part, then the transfiguration would be poor.

Money from the Bank of England is extremely uniform, too so it's easy to notice any change. In Scotland Royal Bank of Scotland, Cyldesdale and Bank of Scotland.

Of course, if magic can duplicate this then it was fine, but a great many people are unaware about the UV so it.

Actually, this link shows you how to spot them so you can av avoid it: [[https://www.rbs.com/rbs/sustainable-banking/society/security-and-fraud-prevention/spotting-fraudulent-notes.html]]
