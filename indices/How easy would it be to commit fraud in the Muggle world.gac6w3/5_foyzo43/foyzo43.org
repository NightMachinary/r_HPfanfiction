You can provide currency exchange service by providing better rates than Gringotts. I mean lots of wizards live with muggles except old pureblood families. Halfbloods and muggleborn needs muggle money constantly. I mean if Gringotts was giving £5 per 1 Galleon then you give £7 per Galleon. As it was stolen money you've no problems.
