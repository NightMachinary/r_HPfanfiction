That depends. If Gringotts are the sole/main company dealing with precious metals and stones, then if they operate like De Beers does in our world they could easily limit the amount on the market at any given time in order to jack up prices to the extreme. You'd likely still get paid a lot less than market value, since they're buying it from you presumably in bulk, but the amount they pay you would likely be consistent since they can keep their prices consistent by limiting the stock available.
