There are any number of ways to steal from muggles, but the key problem isn't how to get the money as it is how to get the goblins to turn it into wizarding money. There may be an understanding about converting muggle funds to magical /for new students coming from muggle families/, but there would be an obvious upper limit to how much they would care to convert.

Instead, the goblins might accept gold and gemstones, as it seems they believe such things hold value beyond the reach of wizard spell shenanigans. So, your potential embezzler needs to arrange to buy gold and gems with his cash and bring it to the bank to ask for an exchange. If he's bringing enough to flood the market, the more he brings in, the less they'll give in trade.
