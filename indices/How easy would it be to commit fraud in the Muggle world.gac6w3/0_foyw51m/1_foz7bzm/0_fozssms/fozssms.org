Is Divination that good on the trivial matters? What I can remember from canon seems to be that it predicts the bigger events, though more vague (eg, the main prophecy, the Grim in Harry's cup, Trelawney predicting Dumbledore's death are the 3 that come to my mind).

For the more trivial matters, I can't think of anything that'd be comparable to predicting which horse would win a race - Trelawney seems to be deliberately vague in her assertions.
