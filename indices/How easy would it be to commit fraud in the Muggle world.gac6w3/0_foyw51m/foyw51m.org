If you're happy to cheat people out of money using magic your best bet is to probably go to the races and put on a large bet on something with crazy odds then use a light Impediment Jinx on the other horses. As long as you cast silently and don't get caught on the cameras you should be fine as long as you don't do it too often or too much and try to blend into a large crowd.
