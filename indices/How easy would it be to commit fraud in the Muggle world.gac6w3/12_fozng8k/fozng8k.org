It'd be a crime in both worlds, and while a skilled wizard with detailed knowledge of how the muggle system works (serial numbers and things like that) could probably do it without muggles noticing, if the magical law enforcement system finds out that something is going on they'll probably be able catch the forger. Gringotts probably does some business with muggle banks and I wouldn't want to make the goblins mad at me. A few notes duplicated and I don't think anyone is going to notice, but a large scale operation would be harder to hide. Much easier to just sell goods that are easily produced magically.
