Duplicating bank notes is likely to draw a lot of attention if done in mass quantities. They'll either disappear raising questions or get noticed as counterfeits eventually promoting a high priority investigation. Also if you're breaking the law you don't want to be having to run large quantities of money through a bank that would also raise questions better left unasked.

Thefts of items that can have value to be resold in the wizarding world is a much safer plan. Taking those valuables (precious metals, gems, raw materials, luxury foods,...) and reselling in knockturn alley seems easiest. As for the thefts themselves you have polyjuice, obliviate, confundus, imperious, muggle repelling charms, apparition, switching spells, bottomless bags, apparition, transfiguration, and plenty of other options to steal without leaving any evidence. As long as it is not either high profile and obviously magical the dmle won't be aware/care.
