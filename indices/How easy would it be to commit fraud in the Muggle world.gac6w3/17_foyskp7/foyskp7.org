I think this could work on a small scale, for buying things here or there. But if you try doing this on a large scale, or try doing consistently as a source of income, there'd be a huge problem with hyperinflation. It's the reason why printing more money won't save poor economies. Although, I suppose it would be fine if it disappears. just a little suspicious. And you have to make sure it disappears out of sight.

I read a fic (I think it was Harry the Hufflepuff) where Harry started a sweat shop of house elves making high quality socks. It was great, because the production was cheap and fast but also high quality. Well, it /was/ great, until they made tons, and flooded the market and then everyone had the socks and no one needed to buy anymore, so it didn't sell at all. And sweat shops aren't quite ethically sound. But the point is, with magic, you could make a lot of menial tasks and services a lot easier. So I guess you could start a production company, and just be careful about how you go about it?

edit: and then there's that plan to exchange muggle money into /actual gold and silver/, melt down the coins to uphold the statute of secrecy, and then sell it back to the muggle world at exorbitant prices. And repeat. (from hpmor, and probably a few other fics)
