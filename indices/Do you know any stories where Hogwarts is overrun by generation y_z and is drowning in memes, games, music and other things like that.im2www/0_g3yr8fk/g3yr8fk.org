This a repost of a post of mine from a thread a while ago, with some additions.

*List of Things Hogwarts Students are no Longer Allowed to Do*

1. Replace spell incantations with "Pew-pew".
2. Create moving pictures or portraits of Professor McGonagall speaking broken English.

   1. Not Mrs Norris, either.
   2. Not Crookshanks, either.

3. Perform the Coffin Dance or the accompanying melody on any deathday or Halloween festivities.
4. Order the House-Elves to dance Gangnam Style.

   1. Not the Coffin Dance, either.

5. Address Mr Draco Malfoy as "Karen".

   1. Seriously, stop it!
   2. My father will hear of this!

6. Train postal owls to make the O RLY face.

Furthermore, please be reminded that:

1. An arrow to the knee is not an acceptable excuse for missed classes or late assignments.
2. Dogs are not permitted as pets at Hogwarts at this time. This includes the Shiba Inu breed.
3. Much as we regret having to do this, we will be treating Pepe the Frog imagery as Death Eater imagery going forward.
4. Fedoras are not a permitted accessory to the Hogwarts student uniform.
