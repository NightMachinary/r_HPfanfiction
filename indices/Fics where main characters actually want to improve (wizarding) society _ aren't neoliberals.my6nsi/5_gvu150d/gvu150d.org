it's either "Liberal freedom for all sentient magical things" vs "Conservative magic is sentient pureblood worship" in this fandom....

But the fact is there's no correct side

#+begin_quote
  if new blood isn't accepted into the pureblood faction then inbreeding will wipe them out(unless fanon magic counters genetic diseases)

  If the discrimination against muggleborns are continued its only a matter of time before this prejudiced stereotyping will result in a self fulfilling prophecy - they will create their own enclaves .....it already happened with were wolves and vampires .

If you give full rights to every sentient magical beings what could possibly go wrong?

How many times goblins attacked the magicals? despite multiple attempts of an alliance from human side?

Can the genius hermione guarantee that house elves if given freedom wouldn't want revenge ?

that things like werewolves & vampires wouldn't even accidentally hurt children?
