That 4chan post has some serious flaws, but I won't get into that here.

I have a self-recommendation. True, this hasn't been updated in a while, but I really am still working on it. Reshaping culture so that people clamor for political reform is hard work. Flashy duels are a lot easier than the societal change that 4chan person is asking for.
