1. Well, those two things would be a great start, and if you have recommendations there I'd love to hear them. (IME fanfic is really had to search for, even with relatively broad requirements; that's why I made a request thread.)
2. Some other things that come to mind as possibilities (not necessarily an exhaustive list obviously): rights of other magical creatures; political reform (how did Fudge + Umbridge get into power, why was Harry's stupid underage magic trial held before the entire legislative body); embrace of muggle technologies and/or research methodologies; addressing blood purity discrimination that's not terrorism but still messes with people's lives; Hogwarts' bullying culture.
