No comment on the 4ch post because it's a mix of good and bad points and I don't want to get bogged down. But I'm curious... what are the most important things you feel needs to be changed about the HP world?

Many canon-compliant post-DH fics deal with Hermione's elf crusade and Harry's Auror reform, so that's two. What else are you interested in seeing?
