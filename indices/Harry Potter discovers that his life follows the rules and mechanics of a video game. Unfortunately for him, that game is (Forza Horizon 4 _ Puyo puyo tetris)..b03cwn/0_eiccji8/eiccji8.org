That's...actually, I /could/ imagine a Gamer Harry fic where instead of grinding skills to level them up, he plays minigames tangentially related to the skill at hand that spontaneously bolster his mind/muscles/reflexes/etc when he wins them.\\
Memory Match cards conjure themselves in front of him when he's trying to study magical theory, rhythm minigames start up when he's trying to brew potions ("I don't understand it, Albus. The boy was twitching to some kind of unseen rhythm from the time he sat down, and 5 minutes into class his potion was completed! That potion normally needs a month to finish brewing!"), and of course, when he's learning to weave words and wand-motions together, he sees Puyo Puyo, Dr. Mario, and Tetris.
