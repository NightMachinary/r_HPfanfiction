linkffn(Healer Harry - A Fanfic by SalTalStudios) has Harry as a healer, but it's a crackfic and Harry acts more like House than a professional healer really should (disclaimer: I've never actually watched House, but it's the impression I get). It's an enjoyable story, at least. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13677334][Link in case the bot is still struggling]]

linkffn(Basilisk-born by Ebenbild) Harry becoming a healer is a relatively small part of the story, but it does seem to keep popping up. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411][Link]]
