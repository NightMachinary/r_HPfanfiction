He is an underdog, and also brave and fundamentally decent. Those are things that most people like. He was mistreated as a child, which also tends to earn people's sympathy.

On a more personal note, he did not have friends before coming to Hogwarts, and when he makes them he is very appreciative. I identify with that, because I am shy and have never found it easy to make friends.
