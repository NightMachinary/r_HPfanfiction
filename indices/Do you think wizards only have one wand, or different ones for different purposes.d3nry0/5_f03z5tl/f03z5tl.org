My headcanon is that wizards only use specialized wands when they dont have a fitting wand or are somehow unable to use it, like for example if Harry had James wand which was good at transfiguration, it would still be worse at transfiguration for Harry than any wand that actually chose him, but if he had it in book 7, it would still have been better than any of the other wands he used that didn't accept him as owner.

So it would only really be relevant for people like that Goblin in fantastic beasts who had three wands, or for wizards who dont want their to leave evidence of criminal use ofspells on their wands.

I could also imagine this to be the case in places outside of Europe, where they dont have a long history of using wands, resulting in wand maker not always being able to give people fitting wands.
