I can't quite remember which fic it was that i read but in it fem!harry gets a whole bunch of different wands and foci. Some were single use only and others were only able to be used for specific things like transfiguration. All of those extra ones she got though were able to be used by squibs. That's kind of my head canon now in regards to if people normally have more than one wand. It just depends on if you're willing to spend the galleons on it.
