You phrased it as if you thought you were stating a fact, which comes across as insulting to people whose tastes are different from yours. If you meant it as a subjective statement of opinion, then it would be polite to phrase it as such; i.e. "this idea doesn't appeal to me" or "I'd prefer not to read that sort of thing."
