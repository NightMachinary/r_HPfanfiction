Unless it's an arranged marriage of which you never wanted to be a part. If your parents invited a classmate's parents over, along with that classmate, and said "This is your future spouse. Best get used to the idea.", and you feel it's your obligation to marry this person for the family name, you'll do whatever you need to in order to make that work. If that means putting a few drops of love potion in your drink every morning because you can't stand that person, then it's for familial obligations.
