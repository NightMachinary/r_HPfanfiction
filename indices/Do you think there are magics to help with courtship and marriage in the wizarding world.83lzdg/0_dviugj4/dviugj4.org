It really depends on your point of view. Love Potions are pretty much what you call "Happy Marriage Potions". The magical world has a pretty relaxed attitude about them, despite the fact that Love Potions are just a nice term for mind controlling rape drugs. They are sold in a joke shop for fucks sake.

As for the relationships in the books, Rowling cannot write romance. Almost no build up, little onscreen evidence that the couples would work out and creepy obsessions (James, Ginny, Snape) are supposedly signs of TRUE LOVE^{^{TM}} . The woman can't write romance, simple as that.
