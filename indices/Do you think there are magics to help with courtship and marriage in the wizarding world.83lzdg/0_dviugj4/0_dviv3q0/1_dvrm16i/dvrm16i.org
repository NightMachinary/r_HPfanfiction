IÂ´m not sure if Ginny is hot i mean attractive sure but hot is more something like Fleur while Ginny has great legs and most likely a good ass, from what we know witches are overall more attractive in comparison to there non magical counter part maybe because of better beauty product or magic just does not allows acne etc. I believe Ginny would count as attractive for a witch, but hot would mean she is in the same league as Fleur(part Veela enough said.), Daphne, Susan and Luna(Luna is kinda hot because of her looks remind of a high elf who most people if not all can agree are most of the time hot.)
