Only three female characters are ever said to be particularly attractive in the books: Fleur, Ginny, and Cho.

There is no "league" containing Daphne, Susan, and Luna. The first two are barely mentioned in the books, and certainly never described physically. And Luna is never said to be particularly attractive (indeed many consider her odd looking).
