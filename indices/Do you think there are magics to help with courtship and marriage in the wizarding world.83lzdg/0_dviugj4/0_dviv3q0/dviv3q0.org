  As for the relationships in the books, Rowling cannot write romance. Almost no build up, little onscreen evidence that the couples would work out and creepy obsessions (James, Ginny, Snape) are supposedly signs of TRUE LOVETM . The woman can't write romance, simple as that.

To be fair, these things are fairly typical of teen romances, where it is common for:

1. The relationship to be based almost entirely on physical attraction and social status (people dating because it's cool/expected).

2. Very early declarations of true love.

3. Deciding that a certain person is perfect for you without ever really having spoken to them much (creepy obsessions, more charitably described as a crush).

Like, people say that Harry/Ginny came out of nowhere. Not only is that just false (she'd been flagged as having a crush on him for years beforehand), but it's also off the point. In real life relationships also come out of nowhere. She's hot, he's powerful, and they have friends in common. That's more of a foundation than most IRL relationships have XD
