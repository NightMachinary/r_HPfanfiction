Fics written by Ellory show elaborate courtship rituals the Purebloods follow in order to find the loves of their lives. The author's works are massively AU explorations of this 'Pureblood Culture'.

For instance, linkffn(Of Caresses and Constellations by Ellory) features a fem!Harry and Draco who bond over hairbrushing. It sounds silly written that way so just read the fic to see if you might like it.
