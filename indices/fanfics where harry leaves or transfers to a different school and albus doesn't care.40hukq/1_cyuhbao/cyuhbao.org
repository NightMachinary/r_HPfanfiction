Wrong-boy-who-lived is certainly a good place to start! I read a Harry goes to Durmstrang fic (I wish I could find it, it was abandoned when I read it but I used to periodically check back just in case!) that was really good. Harry was ignored at Hogwarts (his brother was thought to be the boy who lived) so he transferred to Durmstrang.
