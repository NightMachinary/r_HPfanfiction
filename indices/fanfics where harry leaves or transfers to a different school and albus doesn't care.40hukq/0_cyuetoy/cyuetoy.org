I've never seen one, but if you're looking, I'd suggest browsing wrong-boy-who-lived stuff, especially ones that have Neville or a non-Potter as the one, or stories in which Harry really isn't the boy-who-lived. There's really just no way you're going to find a good story in which Dumbledore let's Harry leave if Dumbledore thinks/knows he's the boy-who-lived.
