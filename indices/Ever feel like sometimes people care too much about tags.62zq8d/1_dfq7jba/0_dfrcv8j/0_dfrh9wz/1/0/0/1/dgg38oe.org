Problem with that though is that it obviously only applies to any story posted/updated after the revamp, and even then only if the author actually does it.

Add to that the crappy search and complete absence of tags and you have the reason I've basically stopped using ff.net years ago. It might have more stories overall, better stories overall and most importantly more stories in ships/tags/concepts/etc I'm interested in, but that's useless when I can't even look for them.
