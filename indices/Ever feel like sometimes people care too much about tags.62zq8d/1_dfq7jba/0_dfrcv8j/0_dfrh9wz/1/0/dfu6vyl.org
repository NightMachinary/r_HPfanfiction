Hahaha, I'm the complete opposite! I don't know how to search for things on ff.net if my life depended on it. I actually didn't really get back into reading fanfiction until a few years ago when I got back into gaming... certain hobbies seem to come hand-in-hand for me, I guess.

As for the exclusion of pairings, under the filters tag on the right-hand side, scroll down until you see the header "Search within results". In that bar, place a minus sign (" - ") and whatever pairing/theme/tag you don't want. So for example**, if you are looking under the tag "Harry Potter/Hermione Granger" and don't want to see any pieces that include Snape/Hermione, you would put "-Severus Snape/Hermione Granger" in that line and pieces that contained those tags would be removed from the search results.

Does that make sense?

On the flip-side, how the heck do you even search for specific pairings on ff.net?

** Actually not a fan of HP/HG, but it seemed like an easy crowd-pleasing example.
