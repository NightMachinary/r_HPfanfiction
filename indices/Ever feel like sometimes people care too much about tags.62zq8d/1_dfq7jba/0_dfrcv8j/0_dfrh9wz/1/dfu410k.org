Haha, I was also on ff.net around then. Stuck with it until the last few years, I just haven't been reading as much fanfiction. AO3 has great content so it's frustrating for me to be so pushed away by the tags. And I haven't figured out how to exclude things? Like, on ff.net you could search and exclude certain pairings. In AO3 if I select Hermione/Harry, I'll get literally any story that has a million tags where that one happens to fall in somewhere. Maybe I'm just not trying hard enough haha.
