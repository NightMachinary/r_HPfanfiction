While I agree it totally gets out of hand, I much prefer AO3. I find it's a lot more user friendly for me for searching and bookmarking pieces, and I also find it easier to read. I remember ff.net from like... God, 15+ years ago? I felt like it was much easier to use back then. (My age is showing...) If a piece is only available on ff.net, I'll usually just not read it because I find the site so frustrating to use.
