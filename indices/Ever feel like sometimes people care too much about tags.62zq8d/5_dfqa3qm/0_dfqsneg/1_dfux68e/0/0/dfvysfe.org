Smut's not my cup of tea either, to the point of being a pet peeve.

There's a few...kind-of-okay romance stories on AO3, but the only ones I'm familiar with are part of fandoms that are much, much smaller than Harry Potter.

Basically, there's this one sit-com that has fanfic that I...occasionally skim, though I rarely follow a fic closely.

But yeah, the smut on AO3 can make even Deviantart look respectable.
