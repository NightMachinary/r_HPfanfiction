This is one of my pet peeves when it comes to Fan Fiction. Its IMPOSSIBLE to find fan fiction anymore by tags because people just tag the shit out of their stories, even going so far as lying about whats actually in it. I go to search for something and get more fics that are not actually representing what I want, then the ones that actually fit the search.

And because the more tags the more likely your story shows up on a search, there is no reason for an author to not over-tag. They should really limit the amount of tags one can use, and force authors to write good descriptions and then have the search system use the tags OR descriptions based upon how you search.
