  Edit: Also Hermione is able to completely change her parents' personality with a memory charm.

We don't know what she did with her parents. The books stated nothing, and the movie said she used Obliviate. Both agree that she used a compulsion spell to make them want to move to Australia.

  Fair enough... Now this is another question... how long do you want your victim to forget? What specifically do you want them to forget? How do you replace a memory with another? Most muggles only forget their encounter with magic. Also Hokey or Morfin Gaunt did not forget who they were either. Yet Lockhart became illiterate.

In all of this, in how you use it I'd imagine. As for Lockhart that answer is simple and two-fold. One he used a damaged wand, and two he cast the spell but didn't "command" it, so it just removed everything it could. Both Hokey and Morfin's memory charms were commanded to remove what was removed but nothing else, thus they retained themselves.
