On that note. There is using it, and there is using it so that you can't tell it's been used unless you truly look for it.

Most would only fall in the first category. For me I'd tie it with Legilimency and make it nearly impossible to do a passable job of it without that. And to have a chance of making it perfect, you'd need perfect legilimency.

Though then again, if you were that good at it you probably wouldn't be doing government work unless you were extremely good/nice.
