I guess we agree that there are various levels of complexity to the Memory Charm and it probably can't be used easily by everyone. Anyways, my pet-peeve is the fact that a lot of people think Memory Charms are such a handy solution to all problems when in canon they are only used by Obliviators and a select few skilled wizards and witches. Just like, if every wizard or witch who got annoyed by someone would cast an unforgivable curse on whoever annoyed them, not even out of malice, but out of spite or anger. Sure, some may say that casting an unforgivable curse will land you in Azkaban... but unless a taboo curse was put on those spells, it would be hard to identify who did it. And Voldemort made use of them willy nilly as a kid and still didn't get in trouble.
