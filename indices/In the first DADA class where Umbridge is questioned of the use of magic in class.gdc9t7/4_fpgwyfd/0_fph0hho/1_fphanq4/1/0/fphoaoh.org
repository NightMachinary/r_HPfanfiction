Well Ron was supposedly the owner of that wand (although if I recall correctly it might have been previously belonged to one of his brothers) and it still struck him when trying to hex Malfoy for calling Hermione a 'mudblood'. I think the book implies that Lockhart gets struck with the memory charm because he was using a damaged wand. And he wants the damage to be as powerful as possible because, as he says, Ron and Harry were supposed to be so grief-stricken when they saw Ginny's mangled body that they completely lost their minds.
