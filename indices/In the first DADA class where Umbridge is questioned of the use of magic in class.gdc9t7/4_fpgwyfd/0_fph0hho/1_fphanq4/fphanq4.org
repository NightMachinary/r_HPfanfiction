Fair enough... Now this is another question... how long do you want your victim to forget? What specifically do you want them to forget? How do you replace a memory with another? Most muggles only forget their encounter with magic. Also Hokey or Morfin Gaunt did not forget who they were either. Yet Lockhart became illiterate.

Realistically, it's probably something JKR didn't think the whole way through but if we were to discuss it, maybe there are various levels of memory charms... some stronger and some weaker. In any case, it's clear that most of them don't actually wipe out the memory but mostly lock them somewhere in the back of your brain. Otherwise Voldemort would have not been able to crack through Crouch's memory charm on Bertha Jorkins.

Edit: Also Hermione is able to completely change her parents' personality with a memory charm.
