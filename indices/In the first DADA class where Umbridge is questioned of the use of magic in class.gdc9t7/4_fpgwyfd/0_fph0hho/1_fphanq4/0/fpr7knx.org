I kind of feel sorry for JKR sometimes. I mean sure, she put an amazing amount of work in to creating backstories and meanings and mythology for Harry Potter - but she was only one person - who expected it to turn into a runaway hit with millions of people debating, obsessing and nitpicking over every word she spun and continues to spin? And with the amount of creativity out there, someone is always bound to be disappointed when the canon doesn't match with their fanon.
