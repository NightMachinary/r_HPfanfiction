They were 15 year olds. How many 15 year olds rebel against a teacher that tells them they don't have to do actual work in class? Harry understood the importance of actually being prepared because he had just recently faced Voldemort in a life or death duel in a graveyard and Hermione was way too rational for her age. Malfoy, on top of that, was probably under instructions from his dad to suck up to her.

Also it seems like people around here seem to treat memory charms as something very simplistic, when in fact there is an actual job specifically designated for using those charms. Do you think that if every wizard was competent enough to cast it, they would need a position called Obliviator in the Ministry? Even on pottermore, in Lockhart's entry, JKR states that Lockhart was particularly good with memory charms even if incompetent in other fields.

Edit: also there's no indication that Umbridge is magically incompetent. She can cast a corporeal Patronus (maybe helped by the locket) and she is fully confident in casting a Cruciatus curse.
