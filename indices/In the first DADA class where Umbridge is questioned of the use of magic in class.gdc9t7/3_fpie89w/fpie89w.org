Wasn't Umbridge checking/stealing mail?

There was a fic where Dobby dropped a letter off to Hermione's parents, and then had Hedwig deliver the same letter, and they compared it. And then they did something else, like Bones or something.

  And shouldn't there be more laws? How come Hermione doesn't examine the law books for more than just Hagrid?

That's really not how Harry Potter works. Laws mean nothing. You have the "I was imperiused! /cough cough/ */drops gold/* /cough cough"/, a Minister who illegally arrested Hagrid and threw him in Azkaban. Just so he could be seen doing something. Don't forget that farce of an underage magic hearing. Executing Crouch without a trial. Sirius not getting a trial. Placing dangerous Dementors around a school.

In the world of Harry Potter, laws are only meant to hinder the protagonist, nobody else.
