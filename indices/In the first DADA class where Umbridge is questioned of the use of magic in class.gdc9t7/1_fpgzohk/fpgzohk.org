What amazes me in this scene is how Umbridge is playing the whole "There is no danger at Hogwarts, or even out there", even thought:

- Sirius Black is still a free man, and 2 years prior, the Ministry seemed adamant this man was dangerous, and ready to target Harry and anyone close to him. Not to mention that, while proclaming that "The Dementors are all under controle", the Ministry also admitted that they went out of bond at least 3 times during Harry's 3rd year, making them more dangerous than the criminel they were supposed to protect the student from.
- During the same year, and "dangerous beast" lived in the castle for a whole year and even taught children, proving that Dumbledore was really losing it, but also that danger could enter the castle
- By their own admission, by shooting dangerous lies, Harry proved himself to be dangerous.

Umbridge was main mission was to take the control of Hogwarts while discrediting both Harry and Dumbledore (and if possible silencing them), but seriously, "Voldemort is back" was pretty much the only thing Harry should not have said. Anything else would have been impossible to silence by the Ministry, and admitted by the rest of the school.
