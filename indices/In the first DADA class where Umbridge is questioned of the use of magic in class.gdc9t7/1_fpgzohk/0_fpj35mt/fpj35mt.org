  but seriously, "Voldemort is back" was pretty much the only thing Harry should not have said.

Hmm...that makes me wonder, Harry /can/ point at any of the other disasters that struck the school in the past few years. There weren't many witnesses to the troll, and the basilisk is more of a run-like-hell thing, but what about the time the Dementors swarmed the Quidditch match?\\
So, what if, the reason Harry only brought up Voldemort...was because he was Confounded? By Umbridge, who needed a strawman to argue against?
