  I feel like it started off incredibly promising then dovetailed once it went back to the future. There was a massive tonal shift and I don't think it worked. That's not to say it was bad, I definitely enjoyed the first story very much.

Yeah this pretty much describes how I feel about it. I thoroughly enjoyed it (Well for the most part) up until it went back to the future. I stopped reading shortly after and didn't bother with the sequel. However it remains to this day one of my favourite pieces of Fanfiction. Most of the past with Harry affecting it was fantastic.

I feel like this was a great idea with brilliant execution, up until a certain stage. Then it went downhill. Fast.
