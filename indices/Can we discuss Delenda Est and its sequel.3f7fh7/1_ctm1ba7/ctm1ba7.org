I think the overall idea of the story is great, with the double time travel. I also think the method of time travel is canon-like plausible and the best I've seen done in fics.

I really enjoyed the time Harry spent in the past as a teacher, it was very interesting to see him interacting with the students. Even if some of the reasoning for things was wanting. Like you I think the story lost a lot of focus, the ghost of Harry Ashworth bit especially.

I actually liked young Bella. I liked seeing how she was an intelligent fierce girl looking for a cause, and Harry gave her one before she fell into Voldemort's camp.

Overall I think the fic is a very good one, and with a rewrite to clean up some of the sloppy bits, and a few tweaks to the characterization it could join the undisputed pinnacles of HPFF.
