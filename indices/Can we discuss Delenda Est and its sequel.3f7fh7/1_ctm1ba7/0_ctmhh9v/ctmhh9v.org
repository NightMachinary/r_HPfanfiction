Young Bellatrix was easily the best part. While I enjoyed the back to the future part well enough, I did find it lacking. It is far from the worst fanfic I've ever read. Very far. So that's good.

I'd love a spin off with Harry being stuck in the past as a teacher. Skip the whole time travel back to the future and just focus on the first Voldemort war with Bellatrix side kick/love interest.

The way that Voldemort didn't die yet still lost all his power for a decade particularly irked me.

Haven't read the sequel yet because I dislike reading ongoing works. Especially ones with update times in the months or even years. I forget things that happen.
