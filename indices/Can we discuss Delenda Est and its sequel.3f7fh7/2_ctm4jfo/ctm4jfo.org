I liked it as a whole, but Bellatrix and Harry (to a bit of a lesser extent) becoming as hyper competent as they are once they got to the future at everything and it just wasn't quite as good as the past parts. Voldemort also didn't feel like a threat and almost nothing had changed since they jumped to the future which I found ridiculous. It's easier to say what I didn't like than what I did because there's a lot less. I like the elder Malfoys and Blacks, but I always wonder wtf happened to Regulus? He never appeared, he might have been mentioned a time or two, but they never really talk about him being with Voldemort and he never made the switch with the locket.

The sequel isn't nearly as good. It has a few moments, but it's overall a lot more boring than the original.
