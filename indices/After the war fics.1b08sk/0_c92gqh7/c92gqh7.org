[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][The First Day]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]] picks up pretty much the second Book 7 ends (before the epilogue), and the author just keeps on going. They've pretty much just kept telling the story of everyone after the war, and as far as I can tell they've kept pretty much within cannon, including the epilogue. All the stories taken together, it's actually my favorite take on the post war situation and shows how everyone continues to grow, and I do mean everyone. The author's page on ffn gives you the suggested order to read the stories, and most are novel length. I really enjoy this author, and recommend taking a look at all of them. They'll keep you busy for a while.
