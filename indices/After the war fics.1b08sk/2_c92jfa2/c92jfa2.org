Learning to Live Again and Thirty-One Bottles by seeker68 are wonderful. Thirty-One Bottle is a sequel that is mostly Ginny an Harry. It is 1 year after their wedding and they are watching people's memories of them throughout their loves. It's a neat way of displaying other character perspectives on events. Learning to Live Again is post-battle/pre epilogue and is mostly Weasely family and Harry. Both are canon, with plausible assumptions and addition.
