[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15604416][*/Charlie Weasley and the Department of Mysteries/*]] by [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/peteryoushouldwrite/pseuds/peteryoushouldwrite][/peteryoushouldwrite/]]

  After being spurned by his lover and fired from his job, Charlie Weasley is back in England living with his mother and working at the Department of Mysteries... no, not that Department of Mysteries, the bar, in Knockturn Alley. Unfortunately for Charlie, the publication of a new edition of the Sacred Twenty Eight means he'll find no rest at the Burrow, and he finds himself in the center of a feverish hunt for the Bloodwand, a mysterious artifact allegedly bound to the "purest" wizarding family. This story is marked as part of a series, but it is not necessary to read Percy Weasley's adventure to follow the events of this one.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
