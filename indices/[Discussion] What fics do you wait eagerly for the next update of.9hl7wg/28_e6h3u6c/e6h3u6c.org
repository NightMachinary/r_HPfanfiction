Summary:

What looks like living is sometimes just survival.

Hermione Granger --- Weasley --- Granger has scars: the ones the war inflicted, and the ones she inflicted. Mostly the ones she inflicted. And Hermione Granger has some wounds that never did heal; here in the smouldering aftermath of her marriage, they're about to start bleeding anew. Written in the conceptual universe of the short story, Lies and Red Ink (generally DH-compliant, EWE?, probably requires a mature reader perspective).
