linkffn (harry potter and the boy who lived by thesanti; harry potter and the sun queen; full circle by crazy mishka; whiskey time travel) would do it for me, but I hold no hope whatsoever. Also stuff already mentioned like rent a hero and house reyne.

The only stories that would make me happy AND I've got hopes for are linkffn(the havoc side of the force) and kathryn518's fics, because they're still well within expected updating patterns of the authors.

Also lots of stuff from other fandoms.
