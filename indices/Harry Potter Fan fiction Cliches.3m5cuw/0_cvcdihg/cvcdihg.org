This might not be a cliche, but fucking "Trenchcoats" "Harry and X pretty lady goes shopping and fucking 11-14 year old Harry buys a BLACK TRENCHCOAT BLACK SHIRTS A BLACK PAIR OF DRAGON HIDE BOOTS AND FUCKING BLACK TROUSERS/PANTS!"... I cannot begin to express my hate for this fucking thing. 1. You don't wear a black trenchcoat with a black shirt, that is wrong and bad a bad colour combination. 2. NO FUCKING 11 OR 14 YEAR OLD LOOKS "KEWL" IN A TRENCHCOAT THEY LOOK LIKE A LANKY DORKY FUCKING NECKBEARD! 3. If you want someone to wear a trenchcoat, can you atleast not make it "A kewl black leather trenchcoat or basilisk or dragon hide" If you actually want to use a trenchcoat HAVE THEM WEAR AS SUIT UNDER THEIR TRENCHCOAT! A full length trenchcoat doesn't look good on a little scrawny ass round glassed kid with an attitude problem. Which is what a lot of these fics base Harry around.

Sorry for bad grammar, and sorry for ranting, but I really dislike the "Kewl trenchcoats" and such. English is my second language so sorry for grammar :)
