I thought I'd try to leave a comment on the right story. (:

For the second chapter, my suggestion might be to take out the Dumbledore sodomy line, or at least tone it down a little bit. The rest of the fic is a more light-hearted mocking of mpreg/bond fics, so that line stuck out as it was less light-hearted. I feel like it would be really effective to say

  Harry heard Dumbledore mutter something about a past relationship, but he was still trying to figure out... etc etc etc...

I thought Harry's internal confusion in the beginning was effective. Play that up some more maybe?
