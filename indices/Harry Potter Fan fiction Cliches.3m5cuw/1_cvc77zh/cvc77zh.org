I have an idea: have a chapter that's entirely internal dialogue. Like:

"she's pretty." he thought "wait where did that come from?" And then a massive wall of text about "NO! we're friends! wait but I think I fancy her. NO! We're friends. I'm jealous of her boyfriend, why is that? No idea because I'm an idiot..." etc etc etc. I just read a fanfic where the only conflict in the whole story was the two main characters not admitting their love to each other for years and it was quite frustrating.
