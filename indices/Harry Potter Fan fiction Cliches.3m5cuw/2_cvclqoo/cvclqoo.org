Not only a HP Fanfic cliche, but a general one in Hollywood movies too:

Hero(es) get(s) captured by the villain. But instead of killing them quickly on the spot, villain decides to torture them for fun, thus giving the hero(es) chance to escape.

I'm glad Harry was captured only twice in the canon. The first time the villain, very much in his character, decided to play a little bit and was thoroughly disappointed. He learnt his lesson and didn't waste any time the second time.
