Old school story, Harry goes to Azkaban due to conspiracy. Phoenix animagus, the form is instrumental in his escape and subsequent shenanigans. Good balance of action, drama, fights, romance, reasonable plot. It's Harry/Cho, but she's not a whiny bint like in canon. Harry is resourceful instead of obscenely powerful, fucking up his enemies with clever traps and subtlety. Everyone is out of character, but then this was written before OttP. Has a complete sequel called Midnight Duel, Midday Love.
