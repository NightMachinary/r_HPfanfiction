linkffn(8137134) I read part of this ages ago. Never finished, but HP being an animagus is definitely a huge part of the story. I can't say if the ending is good or bad, though, but I'm just recommending since it fits your criteria.

linkao3(6146470) Good fic, but hasn't been updated in over a year (it was going strong for awhile too...). Animagus!Harry is a huge plot point, but a lot of the story is about him learning to be human.
