No, no one was being mean! I just felt like it.

Sometimes you just need a fresh new blank slate! :). My feed was getting very clogged up so I did it.

Also, I don't like the fact that my cousin and entire family can see my account so I've changed it without telling them! I know they don't look at it but it just creeps me out that they CAN look at it if they want. So now I've removed that ability.

I think that in the future I'll try to erase as much evidence of my existence as possible that links to my name in real life, because I don't want too much to be pulling on me as I move forward i life. I'll keep anonymous accounts like reddit and 4chan however!

Oh. I just realized the remindme 20 years that I did on my old account won't work anymore. Oh well. I can do it again!

RemindMe! 90 years RemindMe! 15 years Edit - it worked! I can't wait to get reminded soon!
