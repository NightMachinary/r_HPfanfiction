I had put off linkffn(the pureblood pretense) forever because I thought it sounded strange and had such a different start from canon, (alive parents, voldemort isn't the obvious terrorist but instead a political fiend). Then, when I caved and read it, I couldn't stop, it was well written and super interesting!
