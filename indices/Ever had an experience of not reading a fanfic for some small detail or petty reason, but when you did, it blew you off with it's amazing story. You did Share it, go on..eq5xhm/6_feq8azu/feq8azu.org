It took me AGES to get to Forging the Sword just because I couldn't really take the premise, turned out completely differently than I thought it would be and one of my favorite fics.

I'm currently reading the second book of the Stygian trilogy by Slide and absolutely loving it, read the first book a couple years ago and for whatever reason just couldn't get into the second one right after. After this I'll probably have the same experience with Anguis and Shade to Shade which I've never been able to get into.
