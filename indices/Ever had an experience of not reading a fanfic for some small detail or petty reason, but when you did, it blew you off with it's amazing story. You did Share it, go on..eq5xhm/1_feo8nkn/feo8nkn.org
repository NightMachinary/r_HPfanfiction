I couldnt read Harry Potter and Prince of Slytherin, it sounded generic.

I read it two weeks ago, finished it all in 3 days. Like damn it's pretty good, only I want more brotherly interactions but that ruined now!!!

Warning James Potter is bashed, however it has a reason. I dont like it but I will let it slide due to the fact it plays in the story.
