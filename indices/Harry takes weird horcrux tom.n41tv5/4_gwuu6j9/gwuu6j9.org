That kinda happens in one of the fics in series I've read(fic 1 is named something about ninjas) the series stars with Harry periodically dreaming from the pov of a Naruto character who is in school and stuff, which teaches him the basics of Naruto stuff, some seals, chakra, basic ninjutsu and genjutsu, etc and also lets him experience a parents love. In the second part it introduces him to the wizarding world and shows how this Harry is different from cannon Harry for example he makes friends from all the houses and is a better student. Part three has him deal with horcruxes by painting the aspects of different horcruxes including teen tom from the diary(he originally uses the diary to paint the picture), kiddy tom from the scarcrux, and voldemo from the diadem. He eventually cleanses the Horcruxes after seeing the painting ones act out the murder that made them and using the scarcrux to feal remorse on toms behalf. The scarcrux is the last to go and during it's removal he cleans it up and is nice to it as his parents are there calling him stupid for being nice to it(thats the bit that relates to what you wanted). After that he builds a machine that lets him travel to other universes and goes to the avatar universe right when Aang first wakes up. I enjoyed all the fics up to that point and the one that happens in the avatar universe but thats where the series starts turning sour for me personally bc it suddenly turns into a tomarry fic and I don't normally read slash at all. I tried to bear through it but never ended up finishing the series. If you don't mind slash though then I do recommend it, again don't remember the name but its a hard series to miss honestly, its on Ao3.
