I thought this post was pretty insightful about that. [[http://inksplattersandearlyhours.tumblr.com/post/97668139669/i-think-one-of-the-reasons-the-harry-potter]]

The 'coming full circle' symbolism doesn't work when the premise of the story is that the wizarding world needs improvement. Instead it just appears as though nothing much has changed since Harry's first year at Hogwarts. Voldemort didn't cause bigotry and death entirely on his own, he just used the underlying issues that already existed, and failing to address those issues and papering over the cracks doesn't work...

If the Hogwarts Express had looked noticeably more modern, or there had been muggleborn families openly reading brochures about how to integrate their kids into the wizarding world, or some kind of sign that things had improved since the 90s, it wouldn't be so jarring.
