Agreed, reading that epilogue was like a slap to the face right after that ending...

  “Are you sure?” said Ron. There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at the Elder Wand.

  “I think Harry's right,” said Hermione quietly.

  “That wand's more trouble than it's worth,” said Harry. “And quite honestly,” he turned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying waiting for him in Gryffindor Tower, and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there, “I've had enough trouble for a lifetime.”

That's not how life works. You don't just sail through the after effects of a war as if nothing had ever happened. There were still many loose ends. It was as if Rowling herself wanted to finish it and leave her characters alone, but really she could have went more into the rebuilding of the magical world and even expanded more on it. Too bad, she decides instead to hand the writing rights for the continuation to some playwright who had little respect for the story and Rowling moves onto movies instead of books. Heck, the movies are expanding on /the past/. Not the present or future after the Deathly Hallows.

/strangles the air/ I don't even comprehend anything anymore.
