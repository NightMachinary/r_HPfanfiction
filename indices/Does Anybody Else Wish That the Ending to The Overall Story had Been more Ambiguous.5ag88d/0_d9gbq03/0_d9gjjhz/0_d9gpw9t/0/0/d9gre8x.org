Yes, agreed, they could have showed the progress made since the war, instead everything's /the same/. Which shouldn't even be possible considering how it's at least been two decades since then. Does the Magical World really not evolve at all in terms of culture and magic and technique? What a waste of potential that would be if that's the case. Especially after the war, the entire government was pretty much in complete disarray, what about the closings for the other characters? Show a bit of what happens after a war. The funerals held, the campaigns made by the newer generation after the war, getting rid of past prejudices and working on integrating muggleborn and magical culture together instead of separating them.

A Dursley approved epilogue... that's certainly a terrifying thought to have.
