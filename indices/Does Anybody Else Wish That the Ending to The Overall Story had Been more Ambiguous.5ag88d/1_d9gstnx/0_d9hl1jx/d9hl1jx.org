This whole statement. It bugged the crap out of me that Harry apparently made all of his major life decisions between the ages of 11 and 17. Who the hell does that?

I wanted to see him stay friends with Hermione and Ron, but drift away from being BFFs and actually make friends with other people. And go out into the world and find interests other than "don't get killed by evil wizards." And heaven forbid he date anyone other than Ginny before getting married (Cho crying all over him doesn't count.)
