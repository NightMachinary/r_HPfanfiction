I think my greater frustration with the epilogue (not to mention the utterly terrible cursed child) is that it gives Harry a mediocre half-life. Part of the prophecy that directs the entirety of the story is that 'neither can live while the other survives,' but the epilogue has nothing new to show for his life. He's married to the girl he dated at 16, he doesn't have any friends he didn't have at 16, he's doing the job he sort of thought about at 16, and all of his kids are names after people who died before he turned 18. So much of life happens after 18...meeting new people, falling in love, heartbreak, trying new jobs, failing at jobs, finding new hobbies...Harry is supposed to finally be able to have a life, but he doesn't have anything NEW to show for it.

And more annoying than boring pairings, poorly named children (seriously, Harry, how did you expect to feel about a child you named after to people who treated you horribly?!), and what appears to be a stagnant wizarding world, is that Harry joins up with the ministry. The ministry treats Harry worse than Voldemort ever does (at least he has reasons for wanting Harry dead)...why on earth would Harry go to work there?! He becomes part of the corrupt system he spent much of his school career fighting (if the fact his best friend admits to committing a crime to the HEAD AUROR and he just laughs it off)
