I'm with you on this. I would even go further and say that I had preferred if there was no kiss between Hermione and Ron and the relationships left completely open at the end of the book. The friendship of the trio was enough.

I remember that I stopped reading in the middle of the action because Ron and Hermione kissed and I was really miffed about that (I projected a lot of my own onto Harry, so I hoped Harry would get Hermione). To read that the character who really annoyed me in the last 2 books gets the character I projected a lot of my own emotional wishes onto... that didn't fly with my 16 year old mind.

When I then continued to read the story a week later and came to the epilogue... Lets just say that Rowling went from favorite author to 'literally the antichrist' in the course of a few pages. I was pissed. Not only because of Ron/Hermione, but also because /nothing/ seemed to have changed. The wizarding world was as supremacist as always - or at least I figured as much when Ron said he hexed his driving instructor to miss one of his mistakes.

Anyway, its over. Now that I'm 25 its not worth more than a shrug and a comment on reddit.
