Well... Jo specifically stated that the epiloque was written as "Wish fulfilment", which means that if you particularly want to, you could consider it non-canon.

And Cursed Child was written by someone else. It was also written as a play, so to me, it's similar to the films in the sense that it's not strictly canon. I mean, there are things that happened in the films which expanded on the books, but there are also things in the films which directly contradict the books - because they are movies, stories in their own right, not moving illustrations of the text.

If you want to write it off that way, it's an option. You as the reader are free to interpret the books in any way that you like.
