While I would have loved an ending wherein there was no epilogue and Potter returning the Wand in Dumbledore's tomb and walking away, people like to have closure. Loose ends would've had rabid fans clamoring for what happened next, which will eventually lead Rowling to the epilogue and maybe the Cursed Child.

It would've been more dramatic, but human psychology got in the way.
