That particular “fan”fic would have gotten created regardless of whether the epilogue was there or not. There is so much wrong with it as far as the author's approach to the world-building already done goes that to pretend that any of it is the fault of the epilogue or anything else Madame Rowling wrote is a disservice to her, if not an outright insult. That she did approve of it all could count as a mistake, but it is a decision-making one rather than a writing one that some people seem to like to imply it is.

As far as the pairing itself goes, Madam Rowling did admit that it is a pairing that is not the most likely to work and as such it is something of a wish fulfilment to her. That said, it being “unlikely” does in no way mean “impossible”, and many of the people who out and say that she'd said “impossible” or that she'd change the pairings if given another chance, do it because they are rabid Hermione/whomever shippers who are angry at Ron for taking the character played by Emma Watson out of the “free to pair with whomever and their dog” circle; in fact, there are some character analyses out there that take Hermione and Ron and drive through their characters fairly deeply only to conclude that the pairing could, surprisingly, work fairly well (though it could crash and burn too, of course, but the very fact that there is a real possibility of them working when some people seem to take it as impossible is fairly telling).
