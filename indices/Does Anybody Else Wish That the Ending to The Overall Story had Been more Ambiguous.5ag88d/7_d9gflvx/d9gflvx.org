I wasn't a huge fan of the epilogue as a piece of writing and for the fact that it sort of closed the door on any sequels set close to the end of the battle, but insofar as it told us that the characters wound up ok, I was fine with it. The final chapter before the epilogue was so abrupt that if there was no epilogue I would've felt really empty. I still argue there was so much still to resolve after Voldemort died that to end it there would have been way too ambiguous. I mean, as a shipper of Harry/Ginny, no epilogue would have left that entire plot line completely unfinished since Rowling didn't really give them a scene together after the battle.
