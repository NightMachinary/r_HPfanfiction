This is 100% the truth. While a significant amount of shite media sites did claim that JKR said R/Hr was a mistake and that she should've put Harry with Hermione, people on this sub (and especially on [[/r/harrypotter]]) like to pretend that she was completely misquoted on the validity of R/Hr as well, even though she herself called Ron and Hermione fundamentally incompatible and said the relationship was a form of authorial wish-fulfillment.
