Disagree 100%. Most news sites that reported on this (reputable ones anyway) said none of this, only citing the fact that JK Rowling thought that Ron and Hermione wouldn't work. I'm sure i'll get downvoted for this, but it seems like everyone on this sub has made up their own interpretations of the interview to fit their own opinions.

EDIT: How about someone offers a counter argument instead of using the dislike button to bury this opinion?
