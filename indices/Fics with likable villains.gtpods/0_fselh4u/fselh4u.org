Are you referring to likable from an in-universe perspective or from a reader's point of view? I can think of only 2 that are both likable in-universe and from a reader's perspective.

Voldemort in the series of shorts/one-shots /there is nothing (to fear)/ is likable from both perspectives. Features a dark!Gryffindor!Tom Riddle. First work in the series is linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15449145]])

Everybody can hate on the Harry of HPMOR all they want, but HPMOR has the best Quirrelmort and is definitely cool both in-universe and from the perspective of a reader. linkffn(HPMOR)
