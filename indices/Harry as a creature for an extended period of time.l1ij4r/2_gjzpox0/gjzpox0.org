linkffn(13230340) Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay: At some point between preschool and Hogwarts, Harry turns permanently into a dragon. No-one else seems to notice until his introduction to the Magical world.

Growing Up Kneazle: linkffn(6690487) Harry is a Kneazle animagus. He spends a long time in Animagus form before someone finds out.

Parsel: linkffn(11585513) Harry turns into a snake and lives on the Hogwarts grounds for a long time before he is rediscovered, to the point of only speaking Parseltongue for a while. Fair warning for uncomfortable conversations about human (specifically female) biology, late in the fic - specifically, awkward mentions of monthlies.
