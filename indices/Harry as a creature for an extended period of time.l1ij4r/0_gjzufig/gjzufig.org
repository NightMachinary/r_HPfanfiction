linkffn(Instinctive Behaviour by Knife Hand): Harry leaves the Dursleys' porch as a lemur, and he's currently partway through first year and he doesn't even know he's technically a human yet.

linkffn(The Natural Animagus by wsbenge): Harry leaves the Dursleys' porch as a kneazel and doesn't become human again until he starts Hogwarts, but he at least knew he was supposed to be human.

linkffn(The Accidental Animagus by White Squirrel): Harry turns into a cat to escape the Dursleys, but he only sticks in that form for a few weeks over the course of a few paragraphs. I'm pretty sure him being an animagus gets used a lot in the rest of the story, but I don't really remember it.

linkffn(Harry Mewter by Alex Ultra): Harry becomes a Mew animagus before his third year, and he spends a lot of time in that form by the end.

linkffn(Serpents and Celestial Bronze by Levity Lirum): Harry turns into a (mostly humanoid) monster after CoS, and he stays in that form (though it's almost entirely a Percy Jackson fic, with very little of Harry Potter showing up before it was abandoned).

linkffn(Incendio by savya398): Harry is a dragon, and I'm pretty sure he mostly sticks in that form by the end.

linkao3(A Hairy Business by Vinelle): Harry is a deer. That is all.
