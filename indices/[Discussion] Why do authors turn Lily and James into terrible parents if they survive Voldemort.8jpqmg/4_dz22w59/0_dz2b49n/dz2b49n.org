I have this headcanon that wbwl is based off of a sideways view of canon where it's normal for a family to have a less loved child, much like in fairytales it's normal for step siblings to be spoiled or evil. I mean, if you look at how Sirius and Regulus, Lily and Petunia, and Harry and Dudley were all treated by their normal families, you could assume that maybe it's just the way the universe works. Of course, I don't generally like or read wbwl fics, but this is my way of trying to understand how they get the family dynamics.
