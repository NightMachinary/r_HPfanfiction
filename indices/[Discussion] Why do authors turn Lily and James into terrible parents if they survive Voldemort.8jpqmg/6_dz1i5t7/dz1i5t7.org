I think part of it has to do with having this notion that Lily and James were portrayed as great people (which I believe was how most people viewed them except maybe Snape and some others) and when you have a story were they actually aren't good parents, it keeps the story interesting. People like to read about people's lives that are bad and get better. I think you could argue that writing super loving parents could be considered less interesting than James and Lily being "bad" parents. (And of course there could be some really good/interesting stories that have Lily and James as the ideal parents)
