A self-insert is supposed to represent the author... or represents the author out of some wish-fulfillment thing. A SI will generally have the same opinions, likes and dislikes as the author, and often look like an idealised, beautified version of the author.

Obviously these are not required traits of an OC, which is a lot broader as a term.
