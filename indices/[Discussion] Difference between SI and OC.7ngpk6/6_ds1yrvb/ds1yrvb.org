Any self-insert is an original character, but only some original characters are self-inserts. Original characters are based on ... things, sometimes on people we know, sometimes on ourselves, sometimes on other characters, often times a combination of those and even other things. Self-inserts are original characters that, on the most basic level, are based on the writer, on the writer only, and on the writer fully.

The one notable difference between the two is that most people don't seem to have it in them to criticise themselves by acknowledging their flaws, faults, shortcomings, and failures, which leads to self-inserts often enough being perfect to the point where it is boring and somewhat annoying and to them never failing which is more of the same. A well-done self-insert is one who is indistinguishable from standard-issue original character because they have their strong and weak side alike, because they have flaws, make mistakes, but sometimes succeed too. A well-done self-insert also requires somewhat in-depth introspection of ourselves, present and past, and acknowledgement of our innermost faults, dreams, fears, but also those strong points that nobody knows about because they only shine through at the time of need when nobody is looking.

I've written a few original characters in my life. Some of them have traits that come from myself, but ultimately if you were to materialise them next to me nobody would be able to say that they are me because they aren't, they just may be similar in some aspects but it would be easy to tell that they're different people. And I've written exactly one self-insert. For what it is worth she is an original character because she is created by me rather than being taken from some other work, but she clearly is a version of myself and if you were to materialise her and put her next to me aged the same as the character the only differences would be those that were required to allow the character to be in the story and at best you'd have people saying they are twins because outside of those required differences and the divergence in character development that happens during the course of the story they would be pretty much identical.
