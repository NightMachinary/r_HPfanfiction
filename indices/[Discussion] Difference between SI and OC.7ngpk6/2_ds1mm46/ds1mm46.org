Eh IMHO that's a judgement call... I've read a few stories that had an OC and only after a few chapters it became obvious that they are sneaky SI fics. Symptoms include: Mary-Sue-ish OC, long ranty monologues by the OC about canon events, the OC always being right and winning arguments with his/her incredible wit. There's a lot more red-flags of course, but they can be kind of subtle.

In any case, I enjoy some honest and self-aware SI fics, but almost always nope out of "sneaky" SI/OC fics ("Random OC character goes to Hogwarts, who is basically the Author and messes with canon").
