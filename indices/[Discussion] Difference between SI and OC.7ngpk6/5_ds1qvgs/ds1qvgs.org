By definition, a self-insert is the author themselves, while an OC is a character created for the story, independent of the author's personality. However you will always find overlap. Some author's OCs will always have many elements of themselves while others will be more gifted in creating characters which meld into the setting as if they were canon characters themselves.

SIs can also be written with knowledge of the fourth wall, it's quite popular, but not necessary and I personally think an SI which is dropped into the world unaware of the entire plot is much more interesting, but then it all depends on the capability of the author.

In a way it's impossible to tell if an OC is an SI if you don't know the author or they don't state it explicitly. You can try to guess based on how real the character seems, but if an author is skilled their OCs will seem real while if they're the opposite even a self-insert will seem like a made up person.
