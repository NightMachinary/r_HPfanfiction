Example... Harry gets a summer job, his boss and co-workers are OC's because they were not in the books or movies. Harry gets a girlfriend that is a muggle, OC. The girl from the coffee shop in the movie, who is a muggle, gets expanded upon... movie canon OC.

Daphne or Astoria Greengrass, Canon OC unless you use a lot of tropes built up in fanfiction over the years, in which case you might call them Fanon OC.

Main Character of the story being non-canon or canon OC and written from the Authors viewpoint? Probably SI. Original Supporting character (or very out of character canon character) that is used to express the authors viewpoint, SI.

Harry expressing authors viewpoint to an extreme...borderline SI, usually goes hand-in-hand with Mary-Sue.

Mary-Sue is usually someone who knows everything, can do any spell perfectly, gets godlike powers, gets the harem, etc... There is a fine line where you can make a God-like Harry with a Harem that is not a Mary Sue character... but its an easy line to cross.
