The line between OC and SI is blurry, but I generally draw the line at meta knowledge; if a character explicitly or implicitly has meta and foreknowledge, they're an SI (that is, even if they don't say that they know things that they shouldn't, if they make a decision based on knowledge that they shouldn't possess, they're an SI). Otherwise, they're an OC.

I should mention that some authors - myself included - deliberately blur this even further. I have a /Naruto/ story I'm working on where the SI is an OC from our world who was inserted into Naruto. Niko/Kenta /isn't/ me and doesn't share all my values or personality traits, but I write him as if he were an SI character. This is basically the inverse of [[/u/Deathcrow][u/Deathcrow]]'s point about sneaky SIs pretending to be an OC.
