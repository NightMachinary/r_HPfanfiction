Then the line blurs even more. But there's still a distinction: a time traveler came from in-universe and only knows the stuff he himself knows. Conversely, a SI will have seen stuff from an outside perspective. If, say, Susan Bones went back in time, she'd still have no idea where the Chamber of Secrets was or what was in it, whereas an SI would. Unfortunately, poor writing can make this even harder to distinguish, as a bad writer might give their character meta-knowledge by mistake.
