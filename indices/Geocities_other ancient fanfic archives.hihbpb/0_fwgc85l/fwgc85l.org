You may want to check out the [[https://opendoors.transformativeworks.org/geocities-rescue/][GeoCities Rescue Project]] and [[https://opendoors.transformativeworks.org/][Open Doors]] more generally. The [[https://opendoors.transformativeworks.org/special-collections-gallery/][Special Collections Gallery]] has 70 archives, including a number of Harry Potter collections.

Fanlore also has a bunch of pages on [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Category:Harry_Potter_Archives][Harry Potter fanfic archives]], including both extant and extinct archives, the latter of which may have been preserved through Open Doors or at least on the Internet Archive.
