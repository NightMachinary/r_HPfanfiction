I would add 'Angelica' by delivermefromeve and 'Harry Potter and the Fall of Childhood', by E. E. Beck. The former is on Portkey, the latter on FictionAlley.

Neither has been discussed much anywhere I have visited. Both do what they do well, particularly interpersonal drama which, when done well, I am a huge fan of.
