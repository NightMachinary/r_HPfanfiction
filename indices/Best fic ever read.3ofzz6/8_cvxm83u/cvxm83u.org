There are some nice gems hidden out there:

*Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution* is darn bloody: linkffn(10595005). Although I usually don't like Harmony, I do enjoy this fic tremendously.

*Strawberry Fields* is a wonderful short dimensional/time travel fic involving Dr Who: linkffn(4940094).

*Always* is a nice post Epilogue short story: linkffn(11379466)
