All of the recommendations here are really great. For something a little less known, we have linkffn(By The Divining Light by enembee), one of the best pieces of fanfiction ever made, and part of a trilogy of books... in which the third book has never been uploaded. It's got a sequel, Conlaodh's Song, but there is no book 3 in sight.

It's a sad fate for any fanfiction, which brings me to linkffn(In Atlantean Caves by obstacle1). It's a great story which was no doubt in part inspired by enembee's works, although somewhat more focused on romance. It's still a totally unique work that is worth reading, even though it's abandoned.

Now let's go even further. linkffn(Ramblings by Shikaku Zetsumei). This is worth reading for the third chapter alone. It's a short, one chapter story that explores a very cool concept similar to linkffn(Dimension Hopping for Beginners by nonjon) but not as humorous.
