I don't know if I could pick a favorite of all time but out of things I've read recently there's "bungle in the jungle"

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure]]

the story is compelling, I really enjoy the writing style from the 2nd person perspective, and personaly I think it's really funny.

edit forgot to mention it's written in the same style as the lie I've lived and it's by the same person.
