I've never even heard of this one, but it caught my attention anyway. I'll have to check it out! My favorite fanfic that I don't /think/ is widely known is Damned by Hecateslover. linkffn(8969241) The plot development coupled with the imagery and world building just drew me in. It's not for everyone, however. There are some pretty dark scenes.
