I did read it (Mainly cause my favorite genre is Harry working with muggles/using muggle stuff ; but there's so few about that so I get desperate.)

It was really good. Really good. And while it is abandoned, and ends on a cliffhanger, it is long enough, with enough completed subplots, that I think it's worth reading despite that. Also I hated and still do, the prologue. Just skip it.
