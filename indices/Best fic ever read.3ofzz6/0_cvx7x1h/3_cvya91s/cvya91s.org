If you're into Avatar fanfics, there's one I read that I really liked called [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1017744?view_full_work=true][The Fall of The Fire Empire]] It's pretty well written, and this particular version is slightly unique in that the author notes are basically commentary on the story.
