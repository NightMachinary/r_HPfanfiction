That is not widely known? God, that's a hard one.

I'd have to say maybe [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8280375/1/Retroactive][Retroactive]]. This is NOT a HP fanfic - it's in the Avatar: The Last Airbender universe, which is not nearly as popular to write in as HP - but it still needs more love. It's stellarly written and cleverly crafted.

In the HP universe, though, I'd have to say [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7689884/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Stars-Above][Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above]], with only 234 favourites. It's incredible.
