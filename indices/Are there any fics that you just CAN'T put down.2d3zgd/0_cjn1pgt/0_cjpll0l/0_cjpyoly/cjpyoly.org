The part where he inherits the "monster" or whatever is pretty interesting, though, and seems pretty plausible. I wish that had been played with a bit more. But yeah, I found his reasoning for joining the Death Eaters a bit too innocent. I don't consider this head-canon, though, merely one possible way in which he could have developed as a character. A more realistic way would be more complex and darker, but it's well-written enough that I could forgive this and quite a bit more very easily.
