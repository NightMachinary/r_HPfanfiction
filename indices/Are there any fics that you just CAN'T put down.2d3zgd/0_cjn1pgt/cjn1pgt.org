A Difference in the Familyï¼š The Snape Chronicles. Seriously, I never want it to end. I just know it's going to break my heart when it does. It grips you right from the first chapter with the realism. My only criticisms are that Hagrid's dialect seems off, not that it's easy to get right, and young Sevvie's a touch too nice. Maybe. Go read it if you haven't. Let's be heartbroken together.
