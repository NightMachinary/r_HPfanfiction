I just read The Fallout by sage (or everythursday, depending on where it's hosted) and it consumed all of my nonessential brainspace for a week. Be warned, it's Draco/Hermione, but it is excellent writing and a great plot and most importantly, everyone is mostly in character and believable. Srsly go read it and love it. It is rated M, though, for sexual situations.
