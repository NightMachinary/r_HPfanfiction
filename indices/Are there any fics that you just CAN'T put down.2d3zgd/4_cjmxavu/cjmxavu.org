DAYD. Not my favorite fic by any mean, and it has lots of problems, but once you pick it up, you can't put it down until ya done. Also, the current Firebird Trilogy fic. The first was pretty good, the second had some pacing problem mid-way, and this one is rapidly reaching epic status (and its updated weekly).
