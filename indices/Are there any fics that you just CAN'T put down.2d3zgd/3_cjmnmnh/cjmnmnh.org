One I just read that was great was: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][a second chance at life]] by Miranda flairgold and the sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3078469/1/Changes-in-a-Time-of-War][changes in a time of war]], unfortunately the 3rd book is a WIP that hasn't been updated in a long time.
