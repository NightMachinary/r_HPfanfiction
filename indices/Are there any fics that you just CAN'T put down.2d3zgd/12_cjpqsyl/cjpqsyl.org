I'm always entranced by the classics: Nonjon, Rorschach, Sarah1281, Robst, GenkaiFan, Jbern, and many others on my user page on FFN. just pretend my own fics don't exist lol.

I can honestly read Browncoat, Green Eyes and A Black Comedy over and over again. Every time I do I find myself hours and hours later with only my internet history hinting at where the time went.

If you check out ARedHair's profile, they have hundreds of fics favorited, and the majority of the completed ones are solid page turners.
