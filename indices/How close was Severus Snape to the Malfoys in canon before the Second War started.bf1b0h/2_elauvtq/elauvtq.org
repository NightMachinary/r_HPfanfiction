The one piece of canon from back then was during Snape's sorting. Snape is deeply disappointed that he and Lily won't be in the same house, but Lucius, as a prefect, warmly welcomes him to the Slytherin table.

My personal headcanon? As a prefect and quite possibly Head Boy, Lucius kept James and Sirius from bullying Snape. But after Lucius graduated, Snape no longer had a protector.
