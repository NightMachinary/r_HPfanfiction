I exchanged several messages with Larry Huss when he and I were actively writing and even after I largely stopped writing in the fandom. He was a stand-up guy who gave me some of the most careful, critical reviews I received.

His story, /Out of the West/, could well have been turned into an original fiction novel since the HP elements were very light and the original fiction elements were just that good. /Remus Lupin, PI/ is an enduring classic of the fandom. /Palimpsest/ was on its way there, a coda to a stellar fanfiction writing "career" (to the extent that any of us do this as a career).

I miss the guy.
