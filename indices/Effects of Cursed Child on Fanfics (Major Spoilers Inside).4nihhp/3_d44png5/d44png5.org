This all just sounds like cringey fanfiction.

Really? As if they couldn't be more stereotypically evil. My biggest gripe is that it's literally the plot of Back to the Future 2. Time travel is just plain whacky. Multidimensional time travel even more so. It feels like Rowling read all the criticisms of the time turners, and went all the way to fix it. Only, it didn't need fixing.

I'm thinking most authors are just going to treat it as Marvel treats the multiverse: outside of the main continuum, and thus, safely ignored.
