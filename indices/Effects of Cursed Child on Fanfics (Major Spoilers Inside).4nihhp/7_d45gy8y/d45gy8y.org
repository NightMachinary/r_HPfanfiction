The story is quite bad to be honest, but I can't see how it will affect fanfics, maybe just fans of next generation(which I'm not). I don't really consider epilogue of 7 book as canon, it was super cheesy and stupid, so I'm not that interested in CC. I think that this is done in poor taste, with time travel, daughter of Voldemort(really?), nazi-like reality with Umbridge and so on. But I think it's not a serious project of Rowling, the story ends with the same reality as it begun with, yes they went back in time, screwed the timeline a couple of times, fixed everything, and that's it basically. It's cliche, it's stupid, it doesn't change the canon(only the daughter of Voldemort??), we can just dismiss it. I will personally forget about the daughter of Voldemort or the possibility of Bellamort, as well as I forgot about Albus Severus, James Sirius, Rose, Hugo, etc. Harry Potter is about adventure, friendship and love, it's not some soap opera with everybody paired up with all the details of kids pressed in one chapter. Harry Potter had very original plot, CC is just pathetic(exactly like "19 years later")
