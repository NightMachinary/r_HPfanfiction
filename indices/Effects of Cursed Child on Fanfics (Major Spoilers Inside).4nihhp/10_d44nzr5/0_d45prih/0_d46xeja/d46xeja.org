I'm fairly sure that Delphi is either a Veela in disguise, and the whole "I'm Voldemort's daughter" claim is a lie [and she's really the old woman on the Hogwarts Express who grew claws in the beginning], or Rowling wrote her intending her to be a Metamorphmagus, like her cousin, Nymphadora Tonks (daughter of Bellatrix's sister, Andromeda). The second one still reeks of Mary Sue-ism to me.
