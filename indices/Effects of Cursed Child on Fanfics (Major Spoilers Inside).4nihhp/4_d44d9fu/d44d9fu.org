Ultimately the plot points are complete garbage and you'd really have to see the play in person and be blown away by the production to like the ideas presented by it.

That's not really going to happen for a large part of the community who aren't even in the same country. The play wont have the same cultural impact as the books or movie simply because of distribution even before you consider it's quality.

Plus we have Fantastic Beast just around the corner, and I think Eddie Redmayne's going to inspire mountains of pairing fics. Can't you already imagine Hermione being thrown back in time for some reason just so she can pair with Newt in America?

I am admittedly bitter because I despise the eight movies already presented and their effects on fics.
