The confirmation of BellaMort canonized infidelity amongst wizards which I thought was a bold choice but for myself regarding most of the major plot element around time travel I feel a retcon this large is a betrayal of the fans.

I say # FuckTheSecrets.

I choose *not* to add this to my view of canon regardless of what JKR has to say about it.
