I know wizards reproduce just like people do, but I like to picture Bellatrix using some of Voldemort's DNA and an appropriately dark potion to create a baby, without him knowing, considering that post-resurrection, he lacked a nose, had slit eyes, and didn't really look human, so it is highly doubtful is he still had functioning human reproductive organs. Although the subtext between the two in the novels seems to contradict that greatly, I still like my mental image better.
