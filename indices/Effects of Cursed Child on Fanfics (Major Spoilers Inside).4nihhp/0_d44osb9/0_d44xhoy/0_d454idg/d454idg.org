Maybe, maybe not.

1. How much does canon really show of Cedric? Not a ton. He's described as likable, and he does a couple of nice things, but I don't think that anything we see is incompatible with someone who's pretending to be nicer and more stable than he really is. His father seems to be rather pushy when it comes to his son's success, and there's certainly a precedent for kids with such parents to snap or just have problems which they cover up.

2. What was the point of showing Anakin Skywalker as a sweet kid? To reinforce the point that no one is born evil, and that with the right push or right set of circumstances, even the nicest-seeming person can turn down a dark path.

Given how old he is, and thus how much of his personality should already be set, it's less plausible for Cedric to suddenly "go bad." However, some combination of inner demons, putting on an act for others, and the right sort of push could plausibly conspire to send him in a dark direction.

That said, "go in a dark direction" isn't quite the same as "join the Death Eaters." Neville's a good example of someone who could plausibly do the first, but certainly not the second. Cedric having a secret mean streak that he works to cover up is easier to believe than Cedric being a secret blood supremacist, so he'd have to have some sort of personal reason to help them, not an ideological one.
