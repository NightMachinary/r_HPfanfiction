No.

Just. No.

That's like making Neville a death eater. /Canon/ Neville, whose parents lie in the long term ward in Mungo's. There is /no conceivable reason/ for someone like Cedric to become something the exact opposite of what we know him to be, working for people the exact opposite of what he stands for.
