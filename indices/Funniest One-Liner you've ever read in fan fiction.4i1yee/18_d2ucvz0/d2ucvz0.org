Not a one liner, but I enjoyed this exchange:

'Who pissed in your pumpkin juice?!'

'Does your father allow you to speak like that?/If I were your father I wouldn't let you speak like that to a teacher' (can't remember the exact wording)

'If you were my father, I wouldn't piss in your pumpkin juice, I'd poison it!'

'If you were my son, I'd drink it.'

For context, it's from some fanfic where Sirius goes forward in time after the veil incident, and the kid is Teddy (but neither of them know)...I think the author said they adapted the exchange from some movie or other book.
