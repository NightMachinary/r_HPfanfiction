My alltime favourite has to be from Coldmirror's HP parody series (not exactly fanfiction, but close enough).

Remember the scene from the first movie (I assume it was also in the books, but who knows), Harry wakes up in the hospital wing after the fight with Quirrelmort, and soon after Dumbledore comes in? He explains why it was so painful for Quirrel to touch him, it was because he was marked, not by the scar, but a greater force that marked him all over, deep into his skin. Harry asks what this force was, which Dumbledore answers with the short answer of “Love Harry. Love.“

Well, coldmirror kept the exact quote, but had changed the context so much, it suddenly had a very different meaning:

Harry wakes up, Dumbledore comes in, steals all his candy, sits down on the side of the bed, congratulates Harry for an awesome battle and comes closer and closer. Harry simply says “that's fine and all, but could you please take your hand off my knee, that's sexual harassmemt.“\\
Dumbledore: “Oh Harry, if I received a sickle everytime someone said this to me, I'd be rich by now.“\\
Harry, now audibly nervous: “w-what do you want sir?“\\
Dumbledore leans in really closely: “Love Harry. Love.“
