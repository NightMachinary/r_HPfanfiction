This means war.

It's a fic where Ginny figures out that harry doesn't have a normal wizard's view of what's possible with magic or not and so (with the right encouragement) can do pretty much anything. Harry becomes hilariously op in short order. I followed to the end because of a nice device the author used which allowed wizards and witches to mmail (email).
