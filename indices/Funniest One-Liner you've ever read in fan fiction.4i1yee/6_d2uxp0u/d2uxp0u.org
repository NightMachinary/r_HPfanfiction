Not a one liner but this one made me laugh and sorta stuck in my head:

Harry reached his son and dragged him to the nearest open door, but little Albus whirled around before they reached it and looked at him expectantly.

"Dad?" he asked. "What if I am in Hufflepuff?"

"Albus Severus Aberforth Sirius Godric Dudley," Harry said quietly, so that nobody else could hear them. "You were named after a bunch of guys I once knew, of whom no one was ever in Hufflepuff, but whose names, once combined and given to a single person, give reason enough to commit suicide."

His son looked at him rather agitated.

"Well..." Harry said, clearing his throat, "One of them was a really great man who loved my mom so much I can't even describe it with words. They just don't do it justice, you know? He gave everything for her. He lived and ultimately died for her. She was his reason to breath."

"That sounds like true love," said the little boy impressed.

"Yes," answered Harry. "Yes, it really was. Much more than what your mom and I share, which is really nothing more than sexual tension. Now that I think about it, that seems to be the foundation of every relationship I've seen in my life. Makes me wonder about my parents, too. We live in a strange world, son."

Harry was silent for a moment, deep in thought, not noticing the reaction of his youngest son.

"Let me tell you something life taught me: when you finally get to know some girls, the one you share everything with; you have that special connection, that deep inseparable bond with; the one you care about most and the one who's always there for you, never leaving your side -- she'll be like a sister to you. The one you want to have sex with -- that will be your wife. So, don't listen to your heart, my son, but always listen to that little chestburster of yours."

His son, completely deranged by now, started crying.

"Well, let's just get on the train then, shall we?" said Harry and hastily scurried his son towards the door, closing it behind him.
