Hagrid was also sent to introduce Harry, which I doubt was a normal occurrence. Hagrid doesn't seem to be the kind of guy who would do such a thing, as he would probably once in awhile just ramble on about his pets /cough fluffy cough/ and scare the children, and would probably forget to explain a few things. Also in book one, Hagrid wasn't a professor yet, but still just the Keeper of the Keys/Groundskeeper. This could possibly point towards some special treatment, though maybe not.
