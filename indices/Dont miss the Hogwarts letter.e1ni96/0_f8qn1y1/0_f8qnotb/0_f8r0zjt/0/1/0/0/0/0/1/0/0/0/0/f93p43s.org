Very true. You can image that there is a deeper meaning to such things, but often, certain scenes and situations in stories are exactly what they first appear to be. The letter and Hagrid opening scenes are exactly that I guess. Although it is fun to delve deeper into the lore than even the author, sometimes, you end up having pointless, unanswerable questions. Thanks for all your thoughts on the topic!
