Your probably right. Hagrid does a good job though as a plot device. He highlights just how different and, dare I say it, magical the magical world really is by being an example of something new and exciting. Harry's status as a celebrity also works to show the differences from his precious life, but is later used to add some conflict to the series. JKR was most likely trying to set up the scene for the unveiling of the magical world. The letters were probably part of this too.
