True. I dont know if this is canon, but I know many authors write that Hermione got a visit from McG because Hermione was muggleborn. Does that mean anything? So far we know that Harry gets a bunch of letters because he didnt reply to the initial one, he is not muggleborn, and a member of staff wasnt needed yet. Have I missed anything? Thanks for your thoughts.
