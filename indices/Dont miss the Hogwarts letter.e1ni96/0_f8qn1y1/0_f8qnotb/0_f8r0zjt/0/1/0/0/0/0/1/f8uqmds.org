Special treatment? What type of special treatment leaves someone nore illprepared than usual? That aside, many fics make a good point- what were dumbledor's intentions when he sent Hagrid? It is believed that he always knows what he is doing, so what was he doing? A lotnof questions could be asked, and the fanfiction community has come up with many solutions. In some ways it would be cool to know what JK intended. But at the same time, I think I would prefer it if it was just a loose end.
