In linkffn(13285012) Harry (well, Harleen, it is the fem!Harry story) has Thestral as a Patronus.

According to [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/news/discover-your-patronus-on-pottermore][the Pottermore]] “There are many forms that your Patronus could take; it could be a familiar animal or, in rarer cases, a magical creature.” In fact the only [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Patronus_Charm][patronus]] in the books which is not mundane animal is Dumbledore's phoenix, even Luna Lovegood, the hottest candidate for something non-mundane, got an ordinary hare.
