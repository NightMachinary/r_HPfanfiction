In terms of patronus and gender, remember in canon Snape's patronus is a doe. Now there have been a fic or two that I have read where depending on the depth of the bond between a couple their patronuses (patroni?) would match hence Jame's Stag and Lily's doe (eg natural mates).

Of course, those same authors then went to the shudder worthy story arc of if Snape really was in love with Lily shouldn't his patronus have been a stag (eg the mate of a doe). And since Snape's patronus was a doe did that mean that he really loved James hence his patronus doe. Remember there is a very fine line between Love and Hate. Thankfully those stories are few and far between.

For everyone else's patronus we don't really know what gender they are because we are never really told about coloration, etc of the animal the patronus takes the form of. And there are only a few animals where the sex is easy to determine by body type versus coloration etc (eg., lion, lioness, stag, doe, etc).
