What exactly do you mean by "but things become worse"?

Do you mean on an interpersonal level?

Do you want the world to end due to it (Voldemort wins because Harry was distracted by Hermione's fine ass for example)?

Do you want Hermione to betray Harry? (Plenty of edgy Indy!Harry here)

Do you want to see them grow to resent each other?

Do you want to see their friendships with others fall apart?

Do you want to read about Harry sullying the "Noble Bloodline of Gryffindor" and how that was bad (There're plenty of pureblood +bullshit+ culture stories with that premise)?
