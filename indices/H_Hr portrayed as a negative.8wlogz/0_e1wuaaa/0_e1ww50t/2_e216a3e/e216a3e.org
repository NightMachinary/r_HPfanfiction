I've thought a little bit more about the second scenario and as it's described, I'm not sure I would accept it. Harry and Hermione going all "the ends justify the means" and accidentally making everything worse by crusading too hard/going extremist, possibly I might accept that. The end of the world would have to be something that H/Hr happening directly contributes to, not passively by being dumb and letting LV win.

Still, whoever did the second scenario would have to be insanely good. That would be a high-risk prompt but with high regard if it actually worked.

I might try my hand at this myself, but (1) I don't think I, right now, have the skill to pull this off, and (2) I'd probably get lots of hate PMs from butthurt H/Hr shippers who believe Hermione has no flaws whatsoever, if I did do it well enough.
