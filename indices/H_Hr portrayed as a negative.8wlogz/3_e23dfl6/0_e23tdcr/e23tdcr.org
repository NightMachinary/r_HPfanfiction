Do you remember specific lines from this fic? I've sometimes re-found fics that I don't remember the titles of by searching key phrases. But also this sounds like it might have been written by Romantic Silence. I literally just remembered this fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7818290/1/He-s-Mine]], but I'm not sure it qualifies because I'm not sure the author thinks this portrayal is actually a negative one.
