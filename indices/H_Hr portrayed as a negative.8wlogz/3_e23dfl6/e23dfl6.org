There was a fic where Harry and Hermione got together after the war. They were cheating on their spouses.(Actually Harry was sleeping with quite a few women including Pansy Parkinson who became Percy's wife) But the thing was that Hermione really only cared about the forbidden romance part of their affair. I unfortunately don't remember the name.
