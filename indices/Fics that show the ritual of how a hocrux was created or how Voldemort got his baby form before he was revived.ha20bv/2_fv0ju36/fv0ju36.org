My fic is a rather embarrassing crossover between Raven from Teen Titans and HP, but I do show a graphic Dark ritual to form a Horcrux (basically Voldemort offers Raven to make one for her to separate her father Trigon's soul from hers) and I tried to make it as disturbing as possible while still being suitable for merely an M rating.

The rest of the story isn't my best writing, but if anyone wants to just read that chapter, it's here: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3044060/26/][Wildcard - Ch 26]]
