The Accidental Animagus briefly describes the homunculus creation in chapter 73 ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/73/]]). Nothing too extraordinary, although it did involve extracting a womb from a random passerby.

Enter the Dragon describes Horcrux creation as a perversion of a soul-bonding marriage ritual; the caster murders the "spouse" before the bond can settle, and transfers it to an object instead.
