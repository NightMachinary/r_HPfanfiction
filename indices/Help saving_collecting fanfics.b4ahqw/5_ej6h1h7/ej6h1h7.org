Everyone forgot about the FanFictionBot !

:(

​

You just send [[/u/FanfictionBot]] a direct message containing commands ([[https://github.com/tusing/reddit-ffn-bot/wiki/Usage][command usage here]]) and it'll package up the fanfiction for you and send you back a link. You can even put multiple link commands in one message and it'll send back ones for each one.

EG

linkffn(4)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20 by Sir Poley)
