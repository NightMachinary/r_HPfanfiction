Your school did what, now? That's horrible. Like, if you are on their WiFi, it won't allow you on the site?.....

Not gonna lie, when I was younger, they didn't allow phones and whatnot to be on in class... So I would print out the fics in very small font size with the school's paper and ink, because I wanted to read, anyway. I would do this in the library before class. This was pretty terrible of me, because that was a lot of paper. Thankfully, I didn't do it for long. However, since I tend to only want to read longer fics, it was a lot of paper. The poor trees. My poor highschool.
