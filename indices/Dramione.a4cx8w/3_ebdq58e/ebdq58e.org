So I'm not a huge Dramoine person, but I do love some... And I always recommend this fic to any people that like Dramoines.... Now you've might have read it might not.... I will say it has its fluffy points with Hermione and Draco but the entire work as a whole is real dark.... "Cruel and beautiful world" by Lena Phoria now you can't find it on Fanfiction .net anymore the author took it down because they adapted the fanfiction into an actual book not in the Harry Potter world(that is absolutely terrific as well and worth a buy).... But if you google search the fanfiction, you'll find a link to it or a download.... The best Dramoine I have personally read atleast to me (I'm sure you have read their other stuff that is on FFN but if not I recommend those as well)
