Ahh i thought you were going the star wars way -- Harry grows up w Dursleys while his twin is raised like wizarding royalty. IDK... let's say.. by the Longbottoms -- since technically the potters are related to them distantly or whatever.

and they just come from different worlds. where she knows wizarding stuff, and is SO aware of the stigma about blood purity and how evil lord voldemort is. and is like "in the thick of it" and had schemed with Lady Longbottom to get into Slytherin and learn all she can, track any resurgence of the enemy.

AND THEN. She -- unofficial princess of the rebellion -- sends a Patronus (AS A FREAKIN FIRST YEAR?!) to Dumbledore, to get help, when Harry and squad overhears. and they come to her rescue but she is really really not impressed. But is thankful, while being a lil bit like "daamn, Hermione is kinda good looking, but her furry companion, Crookshanks is V skeptical of me."

THIS IS WHAT I WANT.
