I liked the school system described in “The World of The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel” linkao3(14259786). Yes, I know “Salem Witches' Institute” was not meant to be a school (it was joke on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Institutes][Women's_Institutes]]), but I agree that there should be one Ivy league (with some kind of magical Ivy!) in New England (easily somewhere around Salem), one Quodpot-and-apple-pie in Midwest, one Native American somewhere in New Mexico or somewhere there, one in The South, and one at the Pacific Midwest.

And of course, talking about Salem Witches' Institute I just have to mention “Pranking The Tournament by Gardevoir687” linkffn(13132217).
