She really didn't put much thought into her international schools at all. My personal headcanon is that there would be one school based in NYC, based on population density alone there could easily be enough witches and wizards just in the city to fill it, one in the New England area, one in the Southeast (maybe either in Appalachia or in the Louisianna area), one in the great lakes area ( I like to think off the coast of Lake Superior), one in the PNW, and one in Baja California. I don't know enough about population density in Mexico or Canada to say for certain but I would imagine at least one per Canadian territory and one in the Yukon Territory with the intention of providing schooling for all students in that area as well as Alaska. For Mexico, in addition to the one in Baja (which I would imagine serviced students from that area as well as southern California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah) there would be one in an area or adjacent to an area with a high population density, and one further south to service Mexico as well as Central America (as I don't remember her ever specifying there was a school there). I also imagine that with so many different cultures present in North America, many of whom have different magical traditions of their own, there would be a lot of smaller schools that would cater to these populations (schools focused on indigenous traditions, schools started by immigrants, creole, Polynesian, etc) as well as some of the larger schools having their curriculum heavily influenced by the local magical populations' traditions. JK's idea of magic is very WASPy, to say the least...
