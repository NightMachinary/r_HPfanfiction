I'm gonna second the Appalachian mountains if we're talking mountains. They're sparsely populated while relatively close to the east coast. Though I totally agree we'd need more than the two she's put in the east. Maybe another large one in the west with other schools focusing on different types of magic in between (like creole magic in New Orleans or different Native American tribes throughout the US)
