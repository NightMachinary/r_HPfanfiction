Jo probably just looked up 'mountins in massachusetts' and picked it without looking at it lmao. I don't know where I'd put them yet but I need to do more research on geography and where would make sense. I think the same goes for south america as well, there should be more than just one school for the whole continant. so mexico would still get it's own school or two, and south america would get plenty of their own schools as well.
