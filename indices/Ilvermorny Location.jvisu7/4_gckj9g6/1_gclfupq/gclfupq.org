Well, she doesn't know anything about Europe either (I won't start about the combination of English ignorance and French arrogance, but something like that). The British Isles have one large magical school, and the rest of Europe (that's in terms of population proportion is almost exactly 1:10) has two, one of them somewhere in the corner. What about students from Greece or Jewish students from Israel (both of them countries with huge magical history)? Somewhere in the Germano/Slavic school in the northern Scandinavia or French school in Pyrenees? And let not me start on Germans and Slavic people studying in the same school.
