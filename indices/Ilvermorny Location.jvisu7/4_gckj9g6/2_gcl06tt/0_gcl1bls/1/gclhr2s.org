They're not actually poor, they're relatively poor due to the number of children they have. Most families we see in canon have one or two children, while they have seven. So even with a good wage there's no way that they are going to be able to afford the same things as other people in the same income bracket. There's also the fact that a lot of families seem to pay for tuition there up front at birth, so if they did the same for each of their children out of savings, the price of tuition could have gone up significantly over the next decade and they'd still be fine.
