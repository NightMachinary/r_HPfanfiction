JK has really shown that she doesnt know anything about america when talking about illvermourny. europe gets 3 schools while all of north america gets 1??? North america is 6 times bigger than europe. 'mount' greylock is hardly big enough to conceal a school. also there arn't just random castles laying around in america. I headcanon it being one of the 4 or 5 schools in north america instead of only one, if it is the one located in the eastern united states (with another located elsewhere in america and 3 others in mexico and canada) then I think it should be a colonial university style building. Idk what the others would look like though, i need to research more on building styles in areas where I think they would be. I might make my own post about it
