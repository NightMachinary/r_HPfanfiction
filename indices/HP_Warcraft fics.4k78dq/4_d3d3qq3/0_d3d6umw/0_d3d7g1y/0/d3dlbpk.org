I disagree at least to a point I mean there is a spell that /makes the caster/ *completely* /immune to all fire/ (at least that's how I think *Flame freezing spell* works) and that would practically negate everything a firemage could do.

In some ways the HP magic is ridiculously powerful because it seems to work on /concepts/.

Edit: Actually forget everything I just wrote about fire.... *Fiendfire* would probably get trough the charm, and in Azeroth(and related worlds) there seems to be quite a lot of cursed flames.
