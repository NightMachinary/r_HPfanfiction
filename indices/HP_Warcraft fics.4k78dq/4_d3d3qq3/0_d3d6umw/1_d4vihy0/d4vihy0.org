Not really - aparation is way better than blink :) (as long as they stay mobile, they stand one hell of a chance!) ;)

Also look at the Voldemort vs. Dumbledore duell: Now that was magic - most others are really weak compared to that sadly :(

Sure, Medivh, Antonidas, Khadgar or Jaina Proudmore would wipe the floor with them, but others? I am not so sure about that (and those are prodigies who've seen all out war, something Voldemort and Dumbledore have not, so they haven't really trained for that!)
