The only one that's worthy of a recommendation is Plums' work, and even that is cutting it close. It's pub stompy and the tropes Plums' is using gets tiresome.

I'm still looking for a decent Potter/Jaina though. The drama that would occur between Kael'thas and the heartache of Jaina's past with Arthas is gold for drama.
