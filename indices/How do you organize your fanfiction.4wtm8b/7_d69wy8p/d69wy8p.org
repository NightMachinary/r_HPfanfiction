I bookmark the page the fic is on, for fics I'm hesitant to read but consider reading anyway. If I decide I want to read it after all, I download it onto my ebook reader and separate by fandoms (but not by to-read and have-read). After that, I delete it off the ebook reader if I think I probably won't reread it but have read it before.
