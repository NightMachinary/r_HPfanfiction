I started a tumblr, and every time I find a fic I want to read, I post it on my tumblr and tag the hell out of the post. If I finish reading it, I write a little description that will remind me which fic it is (usually a scene that stood out, or a unique plot point, like "Total crack fic, dude's dead, it's all a video game." or "Great fic, but who describes smut from a cat's point of view?") Anyways, then I just search by my tags to find something I want to read. I'm still working on posting all of the fics I had bookmarked across 3 computers and multiple browsers, lol, but it's coming along.
