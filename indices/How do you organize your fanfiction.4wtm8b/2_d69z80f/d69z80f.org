I have an organized set of bookmarks in Firefox and if I'm in the middle of a fic, I leave it in an open tab. If I want to continue reading on-the-go I use the sync feature to pull up what I'm currently reading and my bookmarks. I've also started downloading any fic I want to read with Calibre, because I got tired of finding one that sounded interesting and returning to it just to find out that it's been deleted or the website's gone.

Both my bookmarks and my tags in Calibre are based on ships (if there are any), so at a quick glance at either I can tell if I've already gotten the fic or not. Once I've finished reading it, I delete the bookmark and mark the fic as read in Calibre.
