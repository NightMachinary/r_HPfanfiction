I have a "reading" folder on my Chrome bookmarks bar, and I'm subscribed to a bunch of fics on AO3; each time I get a notification e-mail I bookmark it (using a "month/day title" format). Then I go through the bookmarks when I have spare time and read the fic.

I try to remember to delete the bookmarks when I'm finished with the chapter, but don't always remember.
