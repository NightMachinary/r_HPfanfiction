Some people suggested you keep the tabs with the fiction you're reading open, I really wouldn't do that. Why? I have five windows open, with around fifty fics on each. It is hell to try and find anything. I also have a bunch of stuff just downloaded via ePub on my phone and recommend doing that. But there was one time when everything on my phone deleted itself because I downloaded a real book. Get an app, it seems the most practical.
