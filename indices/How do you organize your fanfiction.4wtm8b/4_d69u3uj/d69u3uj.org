I use the ffn faves button to keep track of fics I've completed. For fics I'm reading or planning to read I just bookmark them in my browser with some nice sub-folders to keep them tidy. I don't use this since I don't have a smart-phone but you may find it useful: some web browsers have the ability to sync bookmarks and such across multiple devices, which would allow you to keep track of your fics no matter what device you're using.
