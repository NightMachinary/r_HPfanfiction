That's difficult to find.

There's obviously no such thing as a magical core in canon, but authors like that.

They also like making Harry indeterminately stronger than his peers.

Then there's the whole intent thing powering spell strength.

I kinda like a mix of 2 & 3. Where each character varies in spellcasting, but intent does a lot of good.

I'll look though. I read something with a good teacher Quirrell that sounded like that, in which every wizard had the same potential.
