Firstly, I should note that we appear to have a very different idea of what HP magic is, which may be the source of unresolvable differences. I have found this to be the case in the past. However, that doesn't mean we can't try...

For me, HP magic is essentially anti-physical. The fundamental nature of magic is the ability to defy natural forces, not work with them. So levitation isn't the application of some unknown but physical upwards force, in line with Newtonian mechanics. There's no upwards thrust. Rather, levitation is simply making an object go up, not through any physical mechanism, but... well, by magic. It happens in spite of natural law, not in conjunction with it. (There may be a complex magical mechanism in place, but if so, it has no ontological relation to the forces described by physics).

With this in mind, you can see why I would say that there are no physical limits to magic. It would make my position inconsistent. If magic occurs in spite of physics, then it doesn't make sense to draw lines in the sand along magnitude terms (e.g. a rule like "a shield can stop physical objects, but the faster the object is moving, the more powerful the shield will need to be to stop it"). If a shield stops a physical object in spite of the laws of physics rather than with them, then it's no more difficult to stop a bullet than it is a tennis ball. Both are impossible according to current physics, and impossibility isn't graduated, but binary.

However, you're certainly right that wizards can't summon the moon, or cast Blasting Curses with the power of nuclear bombs. I think this is for two reasons:

1. While magic has no physical limitations, there are such things as magical laws which describe the limits of magic. These limits may look like physical limits (e.g. wizards are severely limited by distance, only capable of affecting their immediate surroundings), but they will be for reasons of magical theory, not physical theory.

2. While magic in itself may have no limitations, wizards do. Further, their understanding of magic is incomplete.

Dark magic:

The problem with classifying dark magic by the idea of magic used for combat, or magic used for harm, is that almost all magic can be used for combat or for harm. The levitation charm could be used to kill someone.

Given this, either all magic is dark magic, or there's no such thing as dark magic and it's just a term used to denote a way of using magic, rather than properties of magic itself.

However, I think there are two problems with this.

1. Very smart wizards who know a lot about magic, such as Dumbledore, talk about dark magic as if it's a real thing and has some intrinsic moral badness.

2. We know there are spells which can't be healed or resist healing, and these are always referred to as dark magic.

Those two points seem to point towards dark magic being some aspect about magic itself, not a social phenomena. And the only common theme in Dark magic appears to be the fact that it resists the attempts of other magic to counter it.

Warfare: you are right that there are locations that wizards care about. However, I phrased it in relative terms: Wizarding infrastructure is much less than Muggle infrastructure, and they rely on it far less. Yes, there are locations of importance - in particular, repositories of knowledge. However, it wouldn't take more than a couple of hours to pack up Hogwarts library and transfer it to a different location. So it's not the location that's important, but what was contained there. The same goes for Hogwarts as a whole: it would be fairly easy to just up and leave for a different location. It's the teachers and the students and the library that's important, not the castle.
