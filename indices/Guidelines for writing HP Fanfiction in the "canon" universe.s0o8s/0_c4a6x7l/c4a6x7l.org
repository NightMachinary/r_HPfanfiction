Brilliant, but I do have to disagree on three points:

First, there are physical limitations to magic. Though they are far less constant than non-magical physical limitations, no physical limitations on magic would lead to all sorts of problems when it comes to magic interacting with the environment.

Okay, first off, I see magic as akin to being a quantum thing, ie a physical phenomena that is badly misunderstood.

If there aren't any physical limitations, then you could just incant a single reducto spell and have it level the entire countryside, given that distance, resistance, gravity etc have no bearing on how powerful the spell would be which, in turn, would mean that it would be very difficult for the person casting the spell to regulate how the spell is going to react given a certain set of instructions.

Spells interact with the physical environment; they affect the physical properties of objects and people, bleed energy in the form of light when casting and, most importantly, can be stopped by physical barriers. There is no way they could do this without there being limits to how powerful a piece of magic that does such a thing can be.

Second; the dark arts anti-magic qualities. Dark spells are mainly used for one thing, namely magical combat. Their ability to bypass magical protections is what makes them such a feared and dangerous weapon in the first place, kinda like owning a rifle in a world of spears and swords. It's not a quality as much as it could be a feature built into the spell from the very beginning. To me, the Dark Arts don't necessarily have to counteract, bypass or destroy any other magic they come across to be seen as dark, but they do have to present a viable enough danger to life, limb and/or sanity to be treated as such. Though, in order to enable the spell to bypass whatever shields stood in its way, could the Dark Arts be using sapient spells?

Third: wizarding warfare. The idea of there not being any fixed territory important enough to hold is ludicrous. Yes, it's harsh, but you manage to contradict yourself five points later; wizards guard their knowledge fiercely. Given how most of their knowledge would have to be written down somewhere, this means that they have to safeguard said repositories of knowledge from attack by others looking to weaken their enemy's knowledge base.

This doesn't mean you are completely wrong here, though. Thanks to apparition and portkeys, wizards don't have to worry about silly things like logistics and transportation. They can just completely skip any areas that have enemies in them and strike at vulnerable spots on command. Guerilla warfare, despite having its many, many uses, would be hard to effectively execute given that the enemy can magically find disturbances and pinpoint the affected areas incredibly rapidly even if the actual aurors themselves are slow and ponderous beasts.

Well, there you have it. My three points of contention to your guideline. Also, I do have to point out that, to me, the magical world is still suffering from social shock due to the events in the 20th century. World War one probably gutted the number of incoming muggleborn, what with most of a generation dying in the trenches. Then you had the troubles of the 20s and 30s, with the rise of a dark lord and the unacknowledged death toll that goes with it. Finally, there was world war 2, which involved both the mundanes and the magicals and ended up gutting yet another generation of muggleborn. Then, you had Voldemort. Which was followed by fourteen years of peace that were barely adequate when trying to replenish a population whose numbers had been steadily dwindling and trickling away. Then Bam! Voldemort rise #2 comes out and, once again, the work of a decade and a half of steady population reconstruction's Azkabanned while a fair chunk of the wizards & witches on the light side were once again butchered like swine.

My take on the wizarding world was one devastated by an incredible death toll, a society that had collapsed three times by the end of Book Seven and hadn't recovered enough by the time 2017 rolled around. What we are witnessing is not so much the wizarding world as a thin veneer of civilisation trying and failing to hide the empty wasteland wizarding Britain had become since the start of the twentieth century.

That's it, rant over. The rest of it is fairly awesome, I think.
