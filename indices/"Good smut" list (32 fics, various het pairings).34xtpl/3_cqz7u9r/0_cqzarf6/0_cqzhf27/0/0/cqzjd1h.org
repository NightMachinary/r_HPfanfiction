I think this mechanic is used most often in fanfic to make Harry look bad, often a kind of "Slytherins are just misunderstood" rehabilitation where Harry is made out as incredibly naive.

As I identify primarily with Harry, I'll generally perceive this as a personal attack and dislike it accordingly.

Not to mention it's a dirty trick. In canon, Slytherins aren't just misunderstood... they genuinely /are/ House Evil, with very rare exceptions. Changing that canon fact without changing Harry's canonical perception of Slytherin accordingly is just character assassination.
