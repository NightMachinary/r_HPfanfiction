Mmh, I don't know if it's specifically to make him look bad/naive; at least, in the majority of the 'fics I've read with alternate perspectives, I haven't really seen them as having that as their goal. But, then, I suspect we probably tend to read different 'fics. :)

Regarding it being a "dirty trick"... I think it's important to keep in mind that the majority of our canon facts /are/ Harry's canonical perceptions -- it's possible for the "fact" (in a fanfic, of course) to be different from canon than what Harry's perception of the situation is, without either of them being "wrong" (or at least inconsistent).

Taking Slytherin -- we know Harry perceives them all as evil. But how do they perceive themselves? (Most people don't think of themselves as 'bad guys', after all.) And both of their perceptions -- Harry's and Random Joe Slytherin's -- can be valid at the same time; they just emphasize different things, and each include some pieces of knowledge that the other doesn't have (and that, if the other DID have, may change their perception of the matter).

Taking a concrete canon example: Harry thought Snape was evil -- but it turned out there were things he didn't know about Snape that showed he was not evil. Harry was certainly justified in thinking Snape was evil (he had many, MANY good reasons!), but he ultimately changed his mind when presented with new facts that he was previously unaware of, at the end of DH.

A fanfic that is, again as an example, from Dumbledore's point of view (who knows the truth of Snape, but also doesn't have Snape's biases against Harry) of the situation would necessarily show a very different light on things that happened between Snape and Harry than Harry's point of view does in canon.

It doesn't make Harry naive to think Snape is evil; his conclusion, based on the facts he has available to him, is perfectly reasonable. But it does mean he doesn't have */all/* the facts available to him.

...

I'm not sure that what I'm trying to say is coming across very clearly; am I making sense here?
