Especially with the revelations in DH. We learn that Snape's only real motivation for siding with the good guys is his "love" of Lily Potter.

He doesn't actually believe in the cause. Snape remains a believer in pure-blood supremacy, it's just that he has a personal grudge against Voldemort because of Lily's death. You see this all the way through the books: his treatment of Hermione for being Muggleborn, the way he prefers the company of people like the Malfoys, his choice of friends while he was at school. Snape was a racist. He just so happened to an enemy of an enemy.

He certainly doesn't care about Harry's survival for Harry's own sake. Again, the only motivation was his "love" for Lily, and that didn't transfer to Harry: when he went to Dumbledore, he tried to bargain for Lily's life without caring about Harry or James. And it's not necessary to mention his treatment of Harry throughout the books. Snape himself explicitly recognises that he doesn't care at all for Harry, only Lily, when pensieve!Dumbledore asks him about it and he conjures his Doe Patronus (implying he was still doing it for Lily, not Harry).

Snape's certainly an arsehole as well as evil, though. No more on this needs to be said than pointing to the time Hermione's teeth were enlarged by a hex and Snape said "I see no difference". Adult deliberately undermining a teenage girl's body image. Go Snape? Do that to the right (or rather, wrong) person and you've got a suicide on your hands. An honourable mention also goes to his continued attempts to get Sirius Black killed, even after Snape knows he's innocent.

Harry and Dumbledore seem to admire Snape simply because of his love motivation. To Dumbledore, it's not possible to be motivated by love and evil. I disagree with this fundamentally. People can do terrible things for love. Plus, I have major doubts over whether Snape loved Lily. He was obsessed by her, certainly. But love her? I don't think so. Not once does he show any kind of consideration for Lily's happiness, nor respect for her world view. Snape is entirely selfish with regards to Lily: he wants her as a possession, not a partner.
