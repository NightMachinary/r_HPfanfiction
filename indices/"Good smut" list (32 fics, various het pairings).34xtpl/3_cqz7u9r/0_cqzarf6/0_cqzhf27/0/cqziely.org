Heh, I'm definitely one of the former, too. But I also identify with the protagonists of the fanfic -- and I like getting new and interesting perspectives. (Fics that can take an absolutely canon scene, down to the dialogue and gestures, and reinterpret it to being something else, because they're /not/ from Harry's viewpoint, I find especially awesome.)
