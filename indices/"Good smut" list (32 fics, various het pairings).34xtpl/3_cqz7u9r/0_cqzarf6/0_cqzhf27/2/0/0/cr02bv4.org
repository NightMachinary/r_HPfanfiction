The point, as I see it, of a fanfic, is to tell a fascinating story set in the world of the original novel. Which character is the main one is irrelevant if it's a good story. I am a fan of the world JKR created, not of Harry Potter himself and I don't understand why people are so fixated with him (especially since Ender is a somewhat better version of the exact same character). It isn't as if he's particularly interesting.

So, it doesn't work that way for everyone. And looking at the sheer numbers, over 70% of the fans agree with me.
