I... hadn't noticed that before. I have always had difficulty identifying or imprinting on Harry. Even as a young child near to him in age I always day dreamed my way into the world as another character who was not Harry. Harry could never have been me, the Dursleys were clearly not on enough kinds of fire for Harry to be me. I couldn't manage sufficient mental gymnastics for that until I was significantly older. weird.

I wonder if that's why Ron, the only main character who's role I could probably have pulled off, pissed me off so GD much whenever he acted like a dingbat.
