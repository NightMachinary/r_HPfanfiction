Harry Potter is an example of the classic sci-fi/fantasy trick of having the main character be an "everyman", through which you experience the oddities of the world. Winston Smith, Arthur Dent, Frodo Baggins, and Harry Potter are all examples of this. Some people just find it hard to identify with normal.
