Yup, it should be identify with the protagonist OR become drawn in by the world-building. Plenty of stories juggle multiple storylines and a huge cast of characters, and rely more on you becoming invested in the world--if only a single protagonist mattered, half the story wouldn't be emotionally accessible.
