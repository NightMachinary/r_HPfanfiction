I'm curious as to why Harry/Pansy is your favourite pairing. What fics have you read that do this quite well?

Thanks for sharing this list. I think it's one of the genres that's almost impossible to get right.

I've recently discovered [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600025401][Folie a Deux]] and found it was extremely well done. I usually despise affair fics, but the author does a great job of ensuring Ron and Hermione have zero chemistry without resorting to bashing. The Harry and Hermione dynamic is excellent.
