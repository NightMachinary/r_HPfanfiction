I don't see any controversy. Teens are bundles of hormones who likely go through multiple shallow relationships based almost entirely on physical attraction.

It's quite rare for teen couples to have any real personal connection beyond wanting to make out. They haven't yet developed the adult social skills required to genuinely think of other people as subjects with their own agency, a necessary precondition of an adult relationship. Further, they'll still be too shy/nervous/insecure to communicate properly, and likely never even show their true self to their partner.

Generally, each partner will continue hanging out with their own circle of friends and only meet up occasionally to make out. If the circumstances are right (privacy, lack of religion, alcohol), they'll have sex, because see above: hormonal teenagers with a physical attraction. A lot less maturity is required to have sex than to have a genuine relationship.

In the vast majority of cases, teens are simply too immature to grasp the nature of an adult relationship that goes beyond the honeymoon period. That kind of relationship requires your partner to basically be your best friend, someone who you can trust and who you know inside out, as well as they know themselves... it's the only way to survive cohabitation with someone XD
