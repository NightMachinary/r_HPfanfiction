Dislike the characters, the plot, and the setting.

Characters: super angsty Harry, adult Harry who acts childish, adult Harry who spends his time with kids and has romantic feelings towards 11-year-olds.

Plot: completely illogical and full of rehash filler, there's no reason for Harry to be hanging out at Hogwarts reliving events with minor variations. He should have gone AWOL to horcrux hunt as soon as he got a wand. Or as an alternative, just told Dumbledore everything.

Setting: the magic is incredibly boring at best, rage inducing at worst. Point and shoot, dodge and shield, training dummies, magical cores sort of stuff. Given that a large amount of the fic is focused on "training" (and the use of the word training instead of studying always indicates bad things to come), this is a serious problem.

The author comes up with contrived in-story reasons to justify stuff like the hanging out with kids, going through all the rehash etc. but they're just excuses. The author didn't have to write a story full of rehash, they wanted to, then came up with an arbitrary reason to justify it in-story. No one is buying it.
