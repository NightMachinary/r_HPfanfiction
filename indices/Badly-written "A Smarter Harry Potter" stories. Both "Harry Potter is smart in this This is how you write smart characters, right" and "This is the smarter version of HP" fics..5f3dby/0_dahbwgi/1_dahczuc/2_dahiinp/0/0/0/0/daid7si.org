That's okay. It's good to express your opinion, albeit within certain limits.

I actually agree with you about HPMOR. I loved the beginning, but around when the battles started I had to start treating it as a crackfic to just get through it. To this day I can't get past the middle, although I constantly reread the first several chapters.
