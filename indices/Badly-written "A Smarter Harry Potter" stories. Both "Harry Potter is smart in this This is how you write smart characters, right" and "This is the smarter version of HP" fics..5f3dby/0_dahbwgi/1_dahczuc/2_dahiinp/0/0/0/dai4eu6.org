Oh. Uh... Sorry, I didn't realize I was coming off like that. My bad.

I enjoyed it at the start, when it seemed like another dumb but fun "Smart X/Harry Black/Naruto the Nine-Tailed Edgelord" fic. But then, I was forgiving the work's fault because I wanted to find it fun. When the books were thrown into a pile for Yudowsky to urinate on as he stands atop a throne of sci-fi books and "AI Research Donation" money, I stopped forgiving the fic's flaws and started wondering if I should do a MST3K of it some day. I mean, I normally dislike those, but... There's opportunity for comedy here. More than there would be in ANOTHER "Let's react to dumb shit"/"The canon cast of X, maybe with an OC, read and react to and review fics starring themselves" thing.
