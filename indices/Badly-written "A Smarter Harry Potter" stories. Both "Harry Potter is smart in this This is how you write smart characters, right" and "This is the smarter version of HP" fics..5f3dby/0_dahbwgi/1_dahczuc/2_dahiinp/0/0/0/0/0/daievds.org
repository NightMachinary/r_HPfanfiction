It gets worse. So much worse. The "Mock Battles" arc solely exists to give Elizer a power trip and let him show off what he believes is tactical genius and therefore proof of the superiority of Elizer's Rationalism. And it gets worse. Turns out Harry is super smart because lol, screw nurture, in this "More rational world", Harry having a part of Voldemort's soul inside him makes him "Smart and cold".

And it gets worse, Draco is converted to Elizer's Rationalism with only slightly more time than it'd normally take a christian in a christfic to convert a nonbeliever to the word of Jesus.

And it gets worse, Quirrel is turned into Old Elizer, another power-trip for EY, only because Harryzer needs to be the best and specialest and he can't have anyone else steal his thunder of love, Quirrel believes in Fascism, and is revealed to have orchestrated the mock battles to show why Fascism Am Best. Oh, and he pulls out the expected Hitler Ate Sugar "But real fascism isn't like italian fascism! Communism has never really been tested!" apologetics, which Harryzer doesn't argue with because this scene exists to remind cultists how edgy the Old Rationalist is and how idealistic the "Idealist" Harryzer is in comparison, not to actually add anything to the narrative.

And it gets worse. The Harryzer/Hermione parts are annoying because Hermione isn't Hermione, she's a hermione bodypillow with the personality of the Designated Traditional Smart Character. Memorizing pi to tons of digits, "As opposed to Harry who is better than that"...

And it gets worse! "Mysterious figures" conspire to ruin his life by framing Hermione for a crime and lining things up perfectly so the young girl Hermione either goes to Azkaban forever and gets Dementor'd, or she becomes his slave, bound to him by an Unbreakable Bond on her magic and life.

The only part of this story that isn't garbage is the musings on death. Death is very bad. Immortality is good. The stupid thing is Elizer's inability to follow canon or notice any depths, or his beliefs that anyone who says "I have no problem with dying, because I've truly lived" or "After what I've done, I want death" or "At my age, I'm looking forward to it!" or anything other than "I love you, Elizer! I'm a Rationalist too!" is "Just too scared to face death head-on like him".

I think the main thing I hate about this fic is how Elizer uses it to advertise his scam religion and preach stuff like "You can become as smart as Harry! Just follow my religion!" to his followers. In that moment, it ceases to be "Just a fanfic", it becomes outright propaganda. Because of a depressing traumatic past, I hate cults.
