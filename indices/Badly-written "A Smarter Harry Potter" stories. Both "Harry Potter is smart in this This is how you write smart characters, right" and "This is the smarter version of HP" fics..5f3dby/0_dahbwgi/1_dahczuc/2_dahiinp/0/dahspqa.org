I don't like hpmor

it's extremely, supremely stupid

it's like he was specifically designed with pissing me off in mind, from the cult thing to the canon-defiling every-button-mashing fanfic that reads more like an extended recording of someone like Chris-Chan playing with Harry Potter dolls to the 'Hermione gets enslaved by the author' thing. I know some of these are worse than others but I COULD WRITE AND PUBLISH BOOKS about everything wrong with this man and his cult of Rationalists(TM). And maybe also the "Lol we aren't a cult, we just hang out with cultists, circlejerk over the 'wild beliefs' we all share, and like HPMOR and/or fics like it!" useful idiots, too.
