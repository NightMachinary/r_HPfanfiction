Actually, I have to say that I've read some of the other stuff he wrote and he isn't that bad at creative writing. He's not the greatest writer ever, sure, but he is good enough at it that HPMoR should have been way better than it was; and it wasn't because ... I'm not sure exactly, but my best guess is that a large part of the reason was Yudkowsky deciding everything in the story has to be “right” which made it seem ... pretentious at times, I guess, and definitely arrogant in a way. It can be enjoyable and at times it does have bits that I'd say can be counted as quite fun, but I don't think it's supposed to be a comedy fit through and through and calling it a parody seems like a huge mistake.

I won't comment about the “smart!Harry” thing, though, as I am not sure what exactly Yudkowsky wanted to achieve with the character.
