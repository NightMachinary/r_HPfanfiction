HPMOR is not a smart!Harry fic though. It's a great comedy fic and a parody. At least in early chapters. I don't think the author ever advertised it as smart!Harry. Hermione is smarter than Harry in that fic. Harry is very childish in it, how he should be as 11year old, he just knows a lot of scientific theories. You shouldn't take everything at face value, unreliable narrator is a thing.

I wouldn't call an actual AI researcher stupid, that was uncalled for, but I would agree that his strength is not in creative writing. That fic drags. Brevity is a soul of wit and it's not even a quarter way through year one by chapter 20. But I disagree that it's such a bad fic as you imply it is.
