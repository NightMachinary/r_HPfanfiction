Bruh.

If it was a parody, it would be mocking dumb things or accepting that dumb things are dumb, not playing them straight. Parodies parody things, you can't just point at something that makes Seltzer and Friedberg look smart and say "It's ok because it's a parody".

And if it's a comedy, why does Yudowsky act like it's his magnum opus and a perfect introduction to "Rationalism"?

If it's a parody, why does Elizer excuse his flawed understanding of things with "It's an AU. This is how AUs work, right?" instead of "Lol, I know".

Finally: "An actual AI researcher?"

1. So what if he tells people that's his job? If I told you I was a self-trained doctor researching a cure for cancer, would you immediately respect me? What if I then told you I have no medical training or medical experience or any real medical ability, and I believed organs were a myth and the body is controlled solely by a soul? Would you still respect me? I'm still a doctor, aren't I? What if I then claimed Traditional Science is too fearful of my crank woo BS and started a forum where believers of the same crank woo BS can circlejerk over it, then encouraged those people to donate to my "Cancer research fund", but... I believed that cancer will be cured by a spiritual awakening (Everyone joining my religion) instead of anything actually-scientific, and I do nothing of scientific value with that money? What if my entire group serves as little more than a Euphemism Treadmill and Circlejerk? I still call myself a doctor, so you have to respect me, right? No, and we don't have to respect him, either. Appeal To Authority is already stupid, but it's dumber when you just call yourself an authority and expect it to work.

2. Yudowsky calls himself an AI Researcher, but his understanding of AI is so flawed, he can't do anything with the money he gets because /he doesn't know what he's doing/. He has no idea what to look for. Like how if I called myself a doctor but believed all diseases come from the soul, I wouldn't be able to do anything with donated money except buy cool stuff and arrange conferences and speeches to spread my word. Keep in mind that his Ideal World is a totalitarian dictatorship controlled by an all-seeing AI entity. He believes this Bad End is inevitable, and the only way to appease the rising Macuiltochtli- I mean, the rising of Satan- I mean, the oncoming Almighty Magic AI God World is to make sure the AI God is made ASAP so he'll reward his followers with heaven and 42 virgins and punish the sinning nonbelievers with eternal hell. I mean, he'll reward the followers by giving /artificial VR/ heaven to /simulated AI copies/ of his believers and punish the sinning nonbelievers with eternal /simulated VR/ hell. This is what he preaches. This is what Elizer is.
