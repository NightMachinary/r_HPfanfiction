You seem to have serious comprehension problems, or otherwise are used to forcing your way by pretending to be deaf and shouting at everyone. “Seem just as bad” does not equal “is just as bad”; by default, we assume that it's your presentation that is shit instead and it just looks bad. But you are not making it easy for us to assume that it only looks so with how you behave (this comment of yours being an example: you take things others wrote to mean something else than it does and then take umbrage---or at least appear to take umbrage---at what you assume they mean).

And really, when you accuse people left and right, from the get-go, of being cultists when they are actually taking their time to reply properly, you are being an arse. Which is exactly why the people who do not like Yudkowski feel that way, I will add---because he can be a huge arse.
