Hey, now. I like that you're bringing out the clever-seeming moves instead of rolling your eyes and saying "You just don't get it, his story is deeper than JK's because reasons andsaying the emperor has no clothes means you're too dumb to see them". Unfortunately, this attempt to brand me as a Hateful Person(TM) is exactly that, an attempt. If you'd like, I could seem less like a Hateful Person(TM) by talking about something I do like, rather than something I don't. How about Jojo's Bizarre Adventure? You've seen that show/read the manga, right? Man, I could spend hours talking about all the callbacks and parallels and depth in that brilliant series.

Also no, housefires do not win if you say you don't like them in public, and saying that doesn't bring you down to the level of housefires. Get that stupid "X is as bad as Y, anti-X is as bad as X, neutrality and passivity are strength" Lite stuff out of here.

Edit: Also, if I hate "Christianity In General", why would I care that Elizer ripped it off, threw a layer of soft sci-fi BS on it, and preached it? 0/10 bg no re
