You seem to be full of hate for this person, as well as for Christianity in general. This is not exactly healthy.

Every person has their own beliefs and convictions. We may agree with them or we may disagree with them, but when they are so distant from us that they are practically nothing to us and we disagree with what they think then the proper thing to do is to distance ourselves from them, not drown in hatred. Because if /they/ are bad for thinking what they are thinking then you are /also/ bad for stepping down to their level if not below it even when you could have done the sensible thing and simply not cared about them.

I do not particularly like some of the things he says as I think them wrong and thus I do not particularly care about them. But I do not /hate/ him. There is nothing for me to gain by doing so and nothing for him to lose by my potential act of it, but much for me to lose. And likewise, there is much for you to lose by doing so. Please do not discard those things for something as unenjoyable as hating someone you've most likely never met.
