That scene in the Mock Battles arc that manages to make what it's based on look intelligent in comparison, where Harry's guys fights Draco's guys. Draco arranges his guys into sets of three, and has them spread out. In sets of three, one can defend while the others attack, it's a good formation.

Because Elizer doesn't understand how tactics work, Harry's guys run in with a blind zerg rush, overwhelming the spread-out groups of three that are WITHIN SHOUTING AND BLASTING DISTANCE OF EACH OTHER, "Because Target Clusters". With all the subtlety of a bad sonic OC smirking at the camera and saying something along the lines of "Psssh, nothing personnel, kid", Harryzer Elitter-Crackpotsky-Unverifiable-erres says "Don't just blindly copy your parents. Think, like me".

This... is a symptom of whatever disease or disorder has claimed this man. His beliefs that being mainstream makes you wrong and being him makes you special, smart, and automagically right.

Btw the guy set up a "Foundation" for "AI Research", even though his understanding of AI is fundamentally flawed on the most basic of levels, ergo throwing money at a man that thinks wrong thoughts become right when the special one thinks them is a waste of money. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE. His ideal world is one where a Rationalist(TM) supercomputer that gains magical superpowers from being super smart takes over the world and forces humans to act according to its understanding of rationality. Elizer's rationality. Where saying something like "I believe letting two trains crash so the third train, which contains important people, is more moral than letting the first two trains live and the third be delayed by five minutes" is not a sign of mental illness or edgelordery, but something to be celebrated.

OH, AND DON'T GET ME STARTED on the parallels between his cult's mythology and Christianity. I'd say I'm amazed some people actually fall for it, but I'd be lying.
