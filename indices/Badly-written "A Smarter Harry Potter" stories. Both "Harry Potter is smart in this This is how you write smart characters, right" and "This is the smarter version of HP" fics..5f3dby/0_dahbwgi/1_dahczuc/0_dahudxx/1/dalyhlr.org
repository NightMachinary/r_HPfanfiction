I also hate sneer culture. Or cringe culture, as it's calling itself these days.

"What is cringe?"

"Anything cringey."

"And what does cringe mean?"

"Second-hand embarassment."

"Oh. So that's why you sit around taking turns bullying children for daring to attempt art or writing? You want people that watch you to feel embarassment because they're part of the same species?"

"Lol u cringey! Cringeeeeee! Im laughing so hard right now!"

"Enlightening."
