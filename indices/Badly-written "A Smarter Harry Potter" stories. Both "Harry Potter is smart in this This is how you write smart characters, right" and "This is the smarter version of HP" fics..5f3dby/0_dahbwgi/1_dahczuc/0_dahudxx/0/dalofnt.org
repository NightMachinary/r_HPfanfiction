I don't think he's a worse ego than average for smart people, or that he's especially intellectually cloistered. I benefited from his recommendations of ET Jaynes and hyping of Bayes theory. The typical cloistered autodidact never gets nearly so far into finding good sources in the previous literature. He has a big audience and so he inspires a lot of backlash. And he talks about his opinion of his ideas straightforwardly, with little regard for politeness norms of modesty. But plenty of people in academia are at least as arrogant as him, though less direct about it.

I strongly dislike some of his behaviors and arguments, but I like much more than average others of his behaviors and arguments. This is also how I feel about many of the scenes in his fanfic. So to me, both the people who hate him and the people who automatically agree with him are wrong. He's just an average significantly smarter than average person in atypical circumstances.
