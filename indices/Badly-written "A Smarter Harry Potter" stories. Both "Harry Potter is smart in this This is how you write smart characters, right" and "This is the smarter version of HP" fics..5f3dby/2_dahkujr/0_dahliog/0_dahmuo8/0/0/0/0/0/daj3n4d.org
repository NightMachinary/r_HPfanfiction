Honestly, for me it's not even the flair. I'd tried to reply a few times and every time I got something that is either an attempt at trolling or a reply of someone used to forcing their way through. I was trying to see it as simply someone feeling a bit too strongly about it and maybe needing time, but by now I am convinced this person is not going to be rational outside of the moments when they complain about how people don't see them as being rational.
