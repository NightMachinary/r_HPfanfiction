It's a fic I enjoy, but not more than maybe a hundred others. Unlike you, however, when I don't like a fic, I may say so if ask, but I don't go out of my way to talk shit about it and the author when nobody talked about it.

I don't know, maybe I prefer talking about fics I liked rather than advertise those I don't like as well as my own stupidity. A fic I don't like just isn't worth it, and I know I'm just going to piss off a lot of people that do like them without any reason.

I suppose it's a difference of worldview.
