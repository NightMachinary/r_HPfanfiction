My first message wasn't an insult. I was merely stating a fact, that your OP and almost all your responses to this thread were attacks to HPMOR, and were completely uncalled for.

My second post was indeed insulting, please accept my apologies.

"Wow, nice mud-slinging there. Real subtle."

I wasn't exactly aiming for subtlety... Although from a guy that shout in caps, repeatedly, that a fic and an author are stupid, I'd say look who's talking.

"and then encourage me to stop telling people the emperor has no clothes?"

Well, you didn't, you just call the author stupid and left it at it. So I'm sorry but I find it difficult to see your posts as anything but gratuitous insults.

Now, you don't like that fic? So do a lot of people. If it's all you got to say on the subject, well that ok, we got it, you can stop shouting at us.
