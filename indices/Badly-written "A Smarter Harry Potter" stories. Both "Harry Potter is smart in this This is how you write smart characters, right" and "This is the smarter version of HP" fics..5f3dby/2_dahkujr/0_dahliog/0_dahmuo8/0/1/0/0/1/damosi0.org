It seemed like you were implying I'm an angry hateful person that rages over fanfics.

I'm not. That one's just a special case thanks to outside factors. I could probably talk about other badfics with the same level of "This is objectively bad", but there wouldn't be any soul behind it, you know?

Also, "X is dumb, here's why" is an invitation for you to respond like an adult, not go "Yes, wonderful. Are you done talking now?".
