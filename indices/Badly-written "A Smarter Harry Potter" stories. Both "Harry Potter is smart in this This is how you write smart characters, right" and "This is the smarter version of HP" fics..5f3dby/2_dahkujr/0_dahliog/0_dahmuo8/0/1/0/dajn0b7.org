"Unlike you".

Wow, nice mud-slinging there. Real subtle. Tell me, do you see me standing here, talking shit about that Conversion Bureau shithow, or that Tensai Yagami fic full of almost-funny Protagonist Centered Morality? No, because this is a Harry Potter fanfic subreddit and I'm talking shit about HPMOR whether its fanboys like it or not. Tell me, is it "Worth it" to try and insult me, and then encourage me to stop telling people the emperor has no clothes?
