  It seemed like you were implying I'm an angry hateful person that rages over fanfics.

In this case, I thought you were. I mean, that you were an angry person, raging over A fanfic.

  Also, "X is dumb, here's why"

There was no "here's why". That was my problem actually. I wasn't attacking you for not liking a fic.

  "Yes, wonderful. Are you done talking now?"

Well, understand that it's really all I have to say to someone who just seeks to advertise his hatred for something. Like I said, it doesn't seem worth it to me. I'm sorry if it weren't your case, but it certainly felt like it was.
