I love smart!Harry trope, but finding them is a literal pain. 97% of fics labeled as smart!Harry is just authors writing what they would do in Harry's situation, forgetting that we as book readers know much more than characters, and most of the time their solutions wouldn't even work if you really think about it. I also hate the ones where they have 11year olds act as adults and call it them being smart. Knowing a lot =/= being smart, reacting to a situation like an adult =/= being smart. There are a lot of adult people who are idiots, age is not a measure of smartness.

P.S.: Despite the lack of flair, I assume this is a discussion thread and not a request for badly written smart!Harry fics. Because I can easily find them, if you want. Thank you for creating this thread, I wanted to vent about it for awhile.
