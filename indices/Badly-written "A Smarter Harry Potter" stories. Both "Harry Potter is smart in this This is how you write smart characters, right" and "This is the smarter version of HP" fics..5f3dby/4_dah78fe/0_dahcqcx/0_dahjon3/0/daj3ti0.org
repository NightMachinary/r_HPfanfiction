Indeed. It can be enjoyable if you ignore the characters' ages and treat it as a stand-alone story rather than a fanfic, but there are many stories that are far superior to it.

To be fair to it, though, it does have a few moments that are entertaining if you can get through the rest and have a specific sense of humour. But that's really not much considering how a certain person (the author) is known to hold his story above the original that it is derived from (which, amusingly, makes his approach to it the same as an average 12-year-old kid writing their first fanfic).
