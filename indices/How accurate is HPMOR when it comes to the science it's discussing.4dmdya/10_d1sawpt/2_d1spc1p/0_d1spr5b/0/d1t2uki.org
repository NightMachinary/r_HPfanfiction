Correct, although the standard is often the first 10 chapters (as suggested in the preface at the start of Chapter 1). Given the variety of content involved, I think telling people to read the first 10 chapters works better. That's also conveniently up to Harry's Sorting, which I've heard is sometimes used as the trial point for first year fanfics anyway.
