I've never read it, but someone recently recommended it to me after I analyzed part of the book. I was confused, because they said I would like it based on the way I was analyzing and that the fan fiction re-imagined the story in a way that made sense. But... I was making sense of the book as it is because the book makes sense to me.

Should I read the fan fiction just so I know what's up? Everything I hear about it makes me not want to, and then I realize I don't owe anyone on the internet anything anyway, but it just seems like I would be able to argue my points better if I knew the fan fiction.
