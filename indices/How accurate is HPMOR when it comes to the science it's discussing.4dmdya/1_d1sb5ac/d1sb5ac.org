A tumblr user, su3su2su1 did a chapter by chapter review of HPMOR and commented on the science. Unfortunately, the account is dead, looks like some of the original posts were archived though.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2z3sz0/hpmor_full_review_su3su2u1/][Here's]] a discussion on [[/r/HPMOR][r/HPMOR]] about su3su2su1's review

EDIT: I don't care to take part in the pro/anti HPMOR debate, just posting a source in response to OP's question
