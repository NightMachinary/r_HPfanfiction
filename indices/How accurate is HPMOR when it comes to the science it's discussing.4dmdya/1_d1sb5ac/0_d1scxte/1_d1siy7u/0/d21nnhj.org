Eh. All the stuff about Harry inanely babbling about rationality -- that's true. And the science quibbles are probably mostly correct (although EY did say that he avoided looking things up when writing Harry, so that Harry would have plausible errors, like the misnamed fallacies the reviewer complains about). And the stuff about EY shoehorning in too many of his favorite theories is also true: HPMOR would be a better novel if it didn't mention "timeless physics," for example. And, yes, MIRI is ridiculous. And, yes, the book would need an editor if it were to stand on its own as a real novel. There's a lot to reasonably hate in HPMOR.

But there are a lot of criticisms in there that seem really silly. Like the rant about kids using their time turners too much (like he wouldn't), or the complaint about the laws of magic being poorly defined (which is something I think HPMOR did very well). Also, he keeps complaining about there not being enough magical science, which, well, how much of the book /should/ that be? Is it bad to write books that aren't 100% descriptions of scientific experiments?

Random example nitpick:

#+begin_quote
  Hariezer tries (and fails) to transfigure something into “cure for Alzheimer's,” [...] I guess the thought here is he can then give these things to scientists to study? Its unclear, really.
#+end_quote

No, it's not unclear; Harry says specifically that this is exactly the idea. Is EY too verbose, or does he not repeat himself enough? Make up your mind.

Another:

#+begin_quote
  -the author intends for Hariezer to be a teacher. He is supposed to be the master rationalist that the reader (and other characters) learn from
#+end_quote

Is he? The author says in the intro:

#+begin_quote
  [...] the views of the characters may not be those of the author. Not everything the protagonist does is a lesson in wisdom, [...]
#+end_quote

Or this bit:

#+begin_quote
  I have some bad news for Hariezer's philosophy. You are going to die. I'm going to die. Everyone is going to die.
#+end_quote

Did he forget that he was reading a book involving magic?

#+begin_quote
  Hariezer solves this through the time-turner-ex-machina of Quirrell knowing someone else with a time turner, because when Yudkowsky can't solve a problem with a time turner, he solves it with two time turners.
#+end_quote

Well yes, the Harry Potter universe has so many time machines that it gives them to children. Complain to JK Rowling.

And the damned "not enough science" complaints:

#+begin_quote
  Terrible things in HPMOR: Lack of science: I have no wrong science to complain about, because these chapters have no science references at all really.
#+end_quote

or:

#+begin_quote
  Another large block of chapters with no science.
#+end_quote

or:

#+begin_quote
  Another chapter with no science explored.
#+end_quote

We get it: you misread the title as /Harry Potter and the Unbroken List of Scientific Experiments/, stop whining about it.

Or when he repeatedly complains about having battles after the mid-year celebration, as though it would be weird to have a football game after homecoming.

And there are big complaints that just make me think, "Yeah...it's supposed to be like that." Like Harry being an elitist asshole: it's OK to have a character be an elitist asshole if it makes sense in the story. Or their being a tension between Harry's ideals and the magical world. Or complaining about things being different from canon (why did you even start reading it!?).

Oh, and our reviewer says this:

#+begin_quote
  Also, I know as much physics as anyone,
#+end_quote

...which I'm sure is totally accurate, and not at all a hypocritical boast from someone actively ranting about nerd elitism...
