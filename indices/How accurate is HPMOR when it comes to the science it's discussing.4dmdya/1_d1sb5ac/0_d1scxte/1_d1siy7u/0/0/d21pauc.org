You have a lot of emotions about this.

I found the review entertaining, and it accurately conveyed many of my frustrations with the fic. I feel sad for EY since I connected some of the things he has said about himself with some of the things about Harry in his story, and a little worried for him tbh, but I do not think I would enjoy his company. I also would not enjoy discussing Harry Potter with him, as he seems to have a superficial understanding of the books and an alarmingly classist attitude. I even, sadly, suspect I would not enjoy discussing scifi or science with him. I probably would enjoy discussing these things with the author of the review: they seem like they have a pretty laid back attitude, and a desire to learn things and share them.
