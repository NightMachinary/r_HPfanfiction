I'd add to this that the author has stated (either in a footnote, or in an author's note, I can't remember right now) that when talking about real-world science from Harry's perspective, he uses his memory (so he could be incorrect or imprecise), but when he uses Hermione's perspective, he checks it in a book so he's sure it's accurate. I think that most of all, this shows that the author's intent is not for the reader to take everything Harry says at face value. It's mostly supposed to be a way for the reader to get a general idea, and, if curious, to look up the science on his or her own.
