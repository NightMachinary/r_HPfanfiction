Harry is most certainly shown to be wrong. Not about science, but that's not something you could plausibly do in a fictional story where most characters are scientifically illiterate. But I think he's shown to be flawed enough that the reader would pick up not just to take what he says at face value. The whole point is to figure out why you believe what you believe - trusting a fictional character would be silly.
