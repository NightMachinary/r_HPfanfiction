It is reasonable to assume the science of /magic/ from a /boy's/ perspective, a boy who is proven wrong and stupid at times in the story (not a retcon), /may not be/ factually true. Which is besides the point that for much of the science in HPMoR, "real science" and "factual" don't have to be mutually inclusive.

HPMoR is obviously a work of fantasy fiction, and HPMoR is obviously not a textbook or journal article. This is much less of an unreasonable stance than yours.
