I know damn well you come off like you have an axe to grind. I don't know which "he" you're referring to, but regardless, if the standard is no mistakes then /nobody/ meets them. Infallibility is utterly unreasonable for either a human or a fictional character. I characterize your comments as trolling because you are continually sidestepping completely reasonable points as if they're unreasonable with the only intention, as far as I can tell, of being inflammatory and obtuse.
