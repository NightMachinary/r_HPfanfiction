It's been a bit since I read it, but from what I remember:

HPMOR doesn't contain that much hard science, as in biology, chemistry, or physics. There's some physics jargon dropping, which I can't comment on, as I'm not particularly well versed in this topic--see the links that others have posted to su3su2su1, who actually was a physicist, and who hits the author pretty hard. But Harry doesn't bother to explain much of this, or really any, so I'm guessing that you're not that interested in the possibility of that being incorrect...so let me go on...

There is a fair amount of cognitive science. And I think that for the most part, this is pretty widely accepted material. When talking about cognitive biases (e.g., the planning fallacy, the Lake Wobegone Effect, scope insensitivity), I believe the author was mostly drawing from research done by Kahneman and Tversky, who were/are (Tversky is no longer alive) considered to be reputable researchers in cognitive science and behavioral economics. The descriptions of the biases themselves in HPMOR seem fairly accurate. However, as su3su2su1 points out, they are perhaps applied in questionable ways once or twice (su3su2su1's mentioned Harry talking about the bystander effect, referring to countries that refused to intervene in Voldemort's rise to power, when the bystander effect is really focused on individuals), but I can't think of any other examples. Su3su2su1 also mentioned that the Robber's Cave experiment is misrepresented, and I believe he was right on this--Yudkowsky says that the two groups of boys developed individuals cultures and names only after they found out about one another, but that's incorrect. The names and cultures came in the first, non-contact phase.

And then the evolutionary psychology...I don't feel well informed enough to really debate the particulars of HPMOR's forays into this field. I will say this: there is a huge debate regarding the validity of all sorts of evolutionary psych claims, among academics and among laypeople. I always am rather skeptical of evolutionary psychology claims, because they're very difficult to test, but really easy to come up with and get them /sounding/ reasonable (and they're often used to justify views that one already holds or that one desires to hold for personal reasons).

So that's a brief summary of the science itself. But I'm guessing that the OP might also be asking about the "methods of rationality"--that is, the reasoning techniques and logic that HPMOR claims to teach. And as for those, I'll go out on a limb and say that they're probably correct. I'm willing to discuss with people if there are particulars that they think are wrong (and it's also entirely possible that I'm just forgetting about some stuff--as I said, it's been a while), but the hypothesis testing (though su3su2su1 did have a good point about Harry's testing of the blood purity thing), the Bayesian updating, the focus on empirical observation, the way that Harry tries to use evidence--that's all pretty reasonable stuff. Of course, you can find people who will take issue with that (philosophers of science argue about how much we can actually know from science and what is the best way to conduct science, and philosophers of mathematics argue about Bayesian probabilities and how you can actually arrive at them), but for most of these cases, such controversy is probably irrelevant for the casual reader--what's important is that these "methods of rationality" will hold up in everyday life, and I think that they will.

*TLDR: Not sure about the physics, mostly accurate for everything else, but there are a few questionable things that you should be careful about*
