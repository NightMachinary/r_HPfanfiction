The rationality stuff isn't anywhere near as thorough as you'd need to apply it to yourself. It's also applied loosely, sometimes deliberately applied poorly, so you can't use HJPEV as an example of how to act. You can read the author's nonfiction work if you're interested in that sort of philosophy.

The rest of it I'd treat as unreliable.
