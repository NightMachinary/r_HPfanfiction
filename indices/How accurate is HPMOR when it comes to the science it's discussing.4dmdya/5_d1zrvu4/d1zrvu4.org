This isn't exactly relevant to OP's question, but as for the criticism of the fic (because there isn't enough debate on the matter already): Harry is shown to be wrong in many different fashions many different times throughout the story. The author never pretends Harry is anything approaching a perfect person, but Harry is fairly narcissistic and the story is primarily told from his perspective. So there's that. Keep in mind though prior to Hogwarts, he deals exclusively with condescending adults and is horribly undersocialized (is that a word? I don't think so. I think my meaning is clear though.) He's basically never had a friend his own age.
