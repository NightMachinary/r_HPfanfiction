Almost all the stuff on psychology and biases is correct. The author's interpretation of quantum physics is not widespread. Drexler style nanotech is unlikely to ever happen. Dyson Spheres are obviously highly theoretical but legit except for that. The discussion of genetics is oversimplified but essentially okay. I can't remember anything else that might have been in the book. I only read it once, although I was slogging by the end of it.

I think the best aspect of the story's attempt at realism was all the safety related changes made to transfiguration.
