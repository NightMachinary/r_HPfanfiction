I was really surprised when I read this one because the summary made it sound like a fairly normal professor fic and then some really interesting but out stuff smacked me in the face. It delves into wizarding house magic pretty deeply and two of the house elf characters have a prominent role. An interesting interpretation on the nature of house elves.
