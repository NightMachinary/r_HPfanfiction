I don't know if I'd consider the character great, but Limmy from the Ever Upward series by Stranglefig is pretty interesting. It's not Drarry (Harry's year haven't made it to Hogwarts yet), but it's got very similar vibes to The Secret Language of Plants series by Endrina, so if you enjoyed that, you'll probably enjoy this. The bot doesn't seem to like series, so I've put it to link the first story.
