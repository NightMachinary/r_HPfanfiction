He corrupted half of the good guys in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/][I am Harry's Brother]], linkffn(8192853), and killed the other half, along with Death Eaters whom he no longer needed. The fic ended with his total victory.

I'm of the opinion that there are no â€˜light side' in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), as the three main factions are all controlled by significantly to very evil individuals.

The most ridiculously overpowered evil side I have read is in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942), in which Harry was definitely evil and Voldemort boosted himself enormously with a ritual.
