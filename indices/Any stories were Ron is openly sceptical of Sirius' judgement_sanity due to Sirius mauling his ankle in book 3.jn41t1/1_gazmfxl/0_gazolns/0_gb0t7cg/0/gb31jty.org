I think that despite the affects of the obliviate charm, the human brain has a really funny way of remembering them. Honestly, I think obliviate is really over powered and instead of erasing it completely, the effect of the spell should be suppressing the memory really deep into one's subconscious, but the risk is that in a Deja Vu scenario the memory will bounce back with full force.

I can only imagine the confusion (and horror) of Fred and George every time they saw a fellow called Peter Pettigrew sleeping with Ron in his bed. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
