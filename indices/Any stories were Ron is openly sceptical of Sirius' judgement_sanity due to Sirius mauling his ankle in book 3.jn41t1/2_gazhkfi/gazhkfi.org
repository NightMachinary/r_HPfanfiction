I've never heard of any story like this that isn't straight out bashing, but it would be interesting to play with. One concern I have is that it might be a bit OOC for Ron. Seems more like something Molly or Arthur (as concerned parents) or Hermione (skeptical of the rationality of Sirius' actions) would do to me. Ron has a unique position though.
