In canon, Harry has strong reaction to finding out about Dumbledore's seedy past as seen below.

  ‘Oh, yeah,' said Ron at once, ‘people are talking about it quite a lot. 'Course, if things were different, it'd be huge news, Dumbledore being pals with Grindelwald, but now it's just something to laugh about for people who didn't like Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who thought he was such a good bloke. I don't know that it's such a big deal, though. He was really young when they --' (/DH CH:20/)

  ‘Our age,' said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and something in his face seemed to decide Ron against pursuing the subject.

Here Harry isn't willing to excuse people for their past choices. It's something he's had to deal with in regards to his father's bullying too.

But Harry has a double standard where Sirius is concerned. Harry never confronted the fact that Sirius chose revenge over protecting Harry. He never criticised Sirius for his ridiculous dramatics in third year:

  ‘Did you hear me?' Ron said weakly, though he was clinging painfully to Harry to stay upright. ‘You'll have to kill all three of us!'

  ‘There'll only be one murder here tonight,' said Black, and his grin widened. (/POA CH:17/)

Hell, Harry had to be talked into understanding the Sirius was a shit to Kreacher.

But Ron no doubt thought he was being dragged to a messy death that night and I don't care how long it took Madam Pomfrey to heal him, he still spent hours with a broken and bleeding leg, after being dragged the best part of a miles by that very same leg!

That's more than enough to traumatise a 13 year old. To colour a young teens impression of a person going forward. So it's Harry's double standards that Ron would be revealing.
