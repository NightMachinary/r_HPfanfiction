I was shadowbanned - FOR NO REASON - and I have been unable to turn that around, last admin that looked at it said "you were spamming links," which is something I've never done. They can see my post history and so can I... no such thing in it. I'm completely stumped. Once my gold status runs out I guess I'll just have to bite the bullet and make a new account... this is the dark side of Reddit... someone's shadowed my account, maybe they didn't like my opinion, and there's virtually no way to get it back. I've discovered since than that it happens far too often and the admins don't care.
