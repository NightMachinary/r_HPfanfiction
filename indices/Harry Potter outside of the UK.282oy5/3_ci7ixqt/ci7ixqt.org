Away From The Sun - hgfan1111

Hard to find, I think. I couldn't come up with a link as I downloaded an archive some time ago. If you really really want it, I can e-mail it to you. It takes place largely in the U.S. after the war, and quite a bit of it in my favourite city in the U.S., New Orleans.
