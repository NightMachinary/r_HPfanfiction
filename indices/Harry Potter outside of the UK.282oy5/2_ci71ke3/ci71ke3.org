RiddledWays covers a few I would've mentioned so just a few from me. IT recently began updating again after a too long hiatus, but I've hopes it will continue now:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8575201/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Escape-to-New-York][Harry Potter and the Escape to New York]]

It is a crossover with some TV series I never heard of, 'Beauty and the Beast' (no relation to the fairy tale other than inspiration apparently), but even with no knowledge of the latter, it is a good read.

Harry ends up in New York when 9 and is adopted in a unique non-normal community. Features a Harry/Hermione/Fleur trio.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9939304/1/][Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum]]

After the fall of Voldemort Sirius kidnaps Harry to Bulgaria, along with Narcissa and Draco, she abandons Malfoy in this story. AU story where Viktor Krum and Fleur Delacour are the same age as Harry and Draco.
