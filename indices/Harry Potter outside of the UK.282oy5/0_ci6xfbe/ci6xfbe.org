Several of my all-time favorite fics are about this. They are all worth multiple reads; I have personally read each of these at least four times.

"He left the Wizarding World after nearly destroying it. Now he was drawn back into that world against his will and he'd make them pay for their crime."

This story can only be accessed by making an account, but it only takes a second and Bobmin356 has multiple amazing stories about Harry leaving the UK and becoming powerful.

Disobedience Writer is another fantastic author whose work you should explore. I heartily recommend The Birth of Evil, The Potter Family Grimoire, The Heir of Magic, and a Naruto fic called Master of Seals.
