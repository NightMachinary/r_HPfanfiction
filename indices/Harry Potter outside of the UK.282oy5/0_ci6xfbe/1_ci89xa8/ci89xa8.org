To the OP: I would strongly urge caution when reading a Bobmin story. There is very little conflict due to Harry being either extremely overpowered /or/ wealthy beyond anything you've likely read before. Also, there will /always/ be a Native American who either provides or circumvents plot devices in a lore-breaking way.

The dialogue and narration will be absolutely excellent, but there are drawbacks such as those listed above.
