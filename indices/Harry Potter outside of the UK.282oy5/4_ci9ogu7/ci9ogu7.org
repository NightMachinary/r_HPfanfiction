[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6569][Here's]] a H/Hr story that's complete, fairly long, and MA rated. Please don't mistake this as an endorsement.

My own (extremely subjective!) review of it: I sincerely understand the motivation a lot of people have for having Harry leave magical Britain as a central plot point, given the wildly disparate ways in which that world tends to pay him homage or denigrate him. For Harry to leave like a thief in the night without acknowledging the extraordinary part Hermione played is an irredeemable character flaw.
