Linkffn(too young to die) Great story, although it may not seem like it in the beginning. Harry is as amoral as they come but I wouldn't exactly call him cunning or even smart. He makes lots of stupid, childish decisions(well, he is a child). Actually the fact that the character is flawed is what made me like the fic. He gets away with a lot of stuff.
