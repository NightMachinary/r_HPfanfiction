There's this one shot I read a while ago where Harry is getting interrogated with veritaserum for the murder of Nott(?) and the twist at the end is that he's been obliviating himself every time he off another death eater or something. If you can find that it would be perfect for what you're looking for.

  Gets away with a whole bunch of them. It's effectively a time travel speed run and one of the fandom's greatest fics imho.

  Been a while since I read it but from what I remember there's some real creativity to get Voldemort and Harry through the French Border. There's some other stuff too but I don't really remember much of it. Hopefully it's what you're looking for.

  Again, been a while since I read this one but he gets away with /a lot/ here. Neville and Harry's roles are reversed. Neville isn't a spoiled little shit and Harry's single-minded focus on healing his parents is a little disturbing.
