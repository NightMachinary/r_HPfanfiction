"Bellatrix is actually controlled by a mixture of love-potion, Imperius and mental conditioning."

I don't really know why, but I always enjoyed reading of the talented and intelligent, but confused and disoriented, mentally-fragile girl forced and beaten into a loveless marriage, only to be then made into a marionette. Its seldom well written, but when it is, it makes for a great, tragic tale.

Bonus points if she remains off her rocker after being cleansed off the potions and controls, and just goes on a rampage in the opposite direction.
