Yeah the bashing either needs to be over the top for comedic effect, or (the way I prefer) subtle and believable. For example: I like when fics make Dumbledore the manipulative chess master who plays with people for the greater good and only appears to be the caring old grandfather figure. Make him too evil and it's just bashing - but make him cunning and I love seeing other characters struggle against their puppet strings.
