It's good. I like Harry's reluctance to dive in the dark arts. I'm not disliking a story when he gives up immediately being a good guy, but having the realism of him being slowly twisted into something else, while not becoming a villain, is a nice change of pace.

I'm not that far in, but it's well-written and really interesting.
