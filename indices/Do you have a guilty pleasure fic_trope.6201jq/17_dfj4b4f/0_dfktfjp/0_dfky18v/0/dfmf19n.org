I've read some of these, but a couple are new to me. Also, I've been trying to find Stand Against the Moon for ages! I read it a while ago and then completely forgot the title.

Have you read anything by ObsidianPen? You might like linkffn(Hauntingly by ObsidianPen), which is the sequel to a 30,000 word one-shot. I love their writing style.

Also, I LOVE body-swap fics.
