My favorite would be linkao3(Butterfly Heart) LV/HP, but major AU. Quite similar to the show Hannibal, if you've watched it, as it inspires itself off of it. A pure delight to read. Also, it's rated M and there's no explicit sex scene, which is a plus to me.

Other than that...\\
linkffn(Keep Your Enemies Closer) Mentor!Voldemort (sorta... kidna...)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness) that one I'm hesitant, as the sequel has been abandonned and the person who took it up really does not have a style on par...

linkffn(Birth of a Nightmare Man) Incomplete and also very good. It's sequel (which have been written first) does not picture the slip, but already has a solid insane Harry linkffn(The Nightmare Man). The Nightmare man is completed however.

linkffn(Evil Be Thou My Good) A 40k one-shot which is an absolute delight. The "slip in insanity" is not so apparent, but it's there, definitely.

linkffn(Shadowed Malice) Mentor!Father-ish Voldemort Wrong-boy-who-lived, etc. You got it all. The writing is kind of... okay. A bit jarring on the sides and juvenile, but it lets itself be read.

linkffn(Stand Against The Moon)

linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute)

linkffn(To Define Treachery)

I'm also trying to find one where Harry ends up in the body of Tom Riddle, but I'll be damned, it disappeared. I read it like a week ago. :c
