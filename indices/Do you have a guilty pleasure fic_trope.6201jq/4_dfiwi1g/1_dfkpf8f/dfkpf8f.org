I've tried a few but can't seem to quite get it. One of the problems I think is that by casting Alan Rickman (not complaining about his casting, just his effect on this type of story), I see Snape as this 50-something year old professor in a much more mentor-y way than he really was. Canon, he's what, like 19-20 yrs older than Hermione? That would put him at more like 37 when she graduates high school, but I picture 55-yr-old-ish Snape and I think it's just my headcanon of not shaking older Rickman and how much older he is than I'd picture Hermione Granger.
