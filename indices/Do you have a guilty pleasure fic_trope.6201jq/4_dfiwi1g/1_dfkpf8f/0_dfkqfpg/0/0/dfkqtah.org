Yeah as brilliant a performance as Rickman gave to Snape, he just didn't fit the character physically. That's probably the largest reason some people get weirded out by SSHG.

I'll be happy to recommend some fics if you like! I've been in the process of [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3meO7obwCb4RXNuMUpvLTRnUE0][archiving a bunch]] for my private library (though some are better than others) and have included some fan art in a few to give better imagery of Snape.
