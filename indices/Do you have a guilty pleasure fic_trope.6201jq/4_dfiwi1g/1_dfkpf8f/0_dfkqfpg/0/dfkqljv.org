Yeah I ready the books first too, but like many my headcanon is just Alan Rickman as Snape, probably more than any other character. So even when Hermione is like a 20-yr-old adult in the fic, making canon Snape like 40 tops, it's still jarring to me because my headcanon Snape is so much older.

Maybe time to give this another shot- there's definitely a lot of options out there.
