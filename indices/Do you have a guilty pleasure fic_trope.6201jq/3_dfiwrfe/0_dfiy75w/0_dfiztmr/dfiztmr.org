[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5856625/1/The-Return-of-the-Marauders][The Return of the Marauders]] has Neville as the BWL, but he is completely OOC. The fic starts out good but can go off the rails at times.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5503587/1/Ghost-of-You][Ghost of You]] is one of my all-time favorites. It's an angsty post-War Harry/Ginny story where Neville is a good guy at first who is just really close to Ginny since they shared experiences at Hogwarts under the Carrows. Ginny is recovering from serious PTSD and Neville for most of the story is just a really good friend. But then we slowly (or not so slowly) realize he's in love with her, even though she is with Harry. Everyone sees it but Ginny, and then Neville finally comes on to her and sorta ruins everything. He becomes that awful "Nice guy" who can't accept they are just friends and suddenly is not such a nice guy anymore. The bash happens well into it so at first you don't see it as Neville bashing. But it is by the end. Also, I found the entire thing realistic and not too OOC for him, at least until the end.
