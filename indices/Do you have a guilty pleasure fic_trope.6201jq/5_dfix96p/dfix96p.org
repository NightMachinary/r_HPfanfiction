I love the 2nd & 3rd chapters of a time travel / dimension traveler fic where the main characters are trying to hide who they really are. The ones where they have to invent a new name, etc. Bonus points if they can talk their way into Hogwarts despite being absent from the Book of Admittance, dodge legilmency, etc.
