Oh man, this is basically my entirety of fanfiction. I love the shitty tropes.

I started by reading all the soul bond fics, I'm pretty sure that unless it is new I have read it. Or at least started, some of them were too bad for even me to read. I've read 3 that I liked, and 2 that I would recommend to people. This is out of probably a couple hundred.

Then I followed that up with wBWL fics. Generally more homogeneous in terms of structure and plot, but with a higher rate of acceptable.

Then the time travel "fix everything" OP Harry stuff.

/edit/ Oh I forgot the marriage contracts! Only read a bit of them in terms of how many exist, but more than enough.
