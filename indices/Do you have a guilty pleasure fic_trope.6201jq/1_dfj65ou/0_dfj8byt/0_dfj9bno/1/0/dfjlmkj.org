I know! Sadly, the USA is the only nation to field the A-10. Thankfully, the Apache AH1 is actually a variant of the Apache fielded by the RAF. I um, I might have moved it's production years up little so it could enter service in time. If I write any scenes where it would make sense for the Warthog to show up and kick some serious ass, I will of course include it because it's the single most badass plane ever, except for possibly a P38 (Mostly because it looks SUPER kickass).
