[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Republic_A-10_Thunderbolt_II][A10 Thunderbolt]] would make an excellent dragon killer: its 30mm GAU-8 Avenger autocannon fires 3900 rounds per minute and penetrates 55mm of reinforced steel at 1200 meter distance.

50 caliber machine guns should be enough against acromantulas, trolls, and werewolves. Mounting them on broomsticks could work wonders!

To take down giants, anti-tank missiles might be needed.
