Good ones are extremely rare. Many of them are smut fics without a plot. In this category, I like [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/955771/chapters/1870387][No Boundaries]], linkao3(No Boundaries). Others have Trio cheating on Harry's spouse (usually Ginny), and I will NEVER recommend those.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771), is the only romantic Trio fics that has a great plot and is not an one-shot. Flashbacks of the War and fleet actions are excellent.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is a great story in itself, and Trio's love and friendship is a central theme. However, there is no word about romance between them, other than that they live and sleep together.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/16/The-random-craziness-file][Chapter 16, The Damned]] of "The random craziness file", linkffn(8222091), could be a great romantic Trio fic if someone fully fleshed it out.
