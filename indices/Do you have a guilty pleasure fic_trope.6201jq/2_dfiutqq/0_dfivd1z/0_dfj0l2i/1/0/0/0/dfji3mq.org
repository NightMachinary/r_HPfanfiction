yeah book ron was snarky and not an idiot, and movie ron was an ass, also the whole him abandoning them in the DH was due to harry's stupid idea of wearing a horcrux, and harry and ron's friendship breakup in book 4 was just two hormonal teenagers getting mad at each other and they were friends again a while directly after the first task, fanfic usually blows this completely out of proportion
