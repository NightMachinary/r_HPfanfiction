Powerful!Hermione; in particular, more powerful than anyone in her age cohort. (By "power", I am referring to ability to do large scale magic and win magical battles; what mechanics are used --- magical practice, ritual, magical core, etc. --- is immaterial.)

Especially when, over the course of the story, Hermione gets to have a pitched magical duel with a character usually portrayed in fic as being more powerful (e.g., Harry) and win.
