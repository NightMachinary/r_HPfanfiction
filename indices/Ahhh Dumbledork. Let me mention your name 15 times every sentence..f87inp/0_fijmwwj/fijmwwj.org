I mean, we don't really use the word 'Dork' in the UK anyway. It's very much a US thing. Same with most of the variations of that 'insult'. We might use Dumbles, but that'd end up sounding more affectionate to a British person than insulting. Most of my friends call one another 'cunts' in joyful tones upon seeing each other.

So, it doesn't piss me off. It just makes me think the story is written by a tweenage US American kid.
