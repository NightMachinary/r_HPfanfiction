Actually writing (or rather was writing) a Master Manipulator! Spymaster!Dumbledore where the concept of Greater Good wasn't nefarious and the only reason the Philosopher's Stone is in Hogwarts is to set up a kill box to lure Voldemort in. Voldemort is just a bit smarter by unleashing chimera creatures as a distraction.
