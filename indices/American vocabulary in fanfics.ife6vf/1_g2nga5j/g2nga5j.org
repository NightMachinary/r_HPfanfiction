The ones that throw me out of the story are:

- Little Whining instead of Little Whinging.
- "Graduation" from Hogwarts. In America, graduation has pretty much lost all meaning, with everybody from kindergarteners to dance classes having a graduation ceremony. In the UK, it's a university-level thing only. At lower levels, /they just leave school/.
- Pancakes. Since I learned that American-style pancakes are not a common food in the UK, I notice it whenever it appears --- and it's /everywhere/.
