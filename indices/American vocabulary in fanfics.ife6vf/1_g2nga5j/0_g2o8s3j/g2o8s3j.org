Everybody drinking coffee. Yes, I know that even in UK they eventually learnt about good coffee (thanks Costa Coffee for that), but in the mid 1990s' I still got that wild look from the stewardess of BA when I asked for coffee, “you really don't know what you are asking for”. And I didn't, I got horrible weak Nescafé, and I quickly realised that the only right answer to The Question was “Tea, please. Thank you.”

And of course, every time when a boy gets with his girlfriend “to the second base” something little dies inside of me.
