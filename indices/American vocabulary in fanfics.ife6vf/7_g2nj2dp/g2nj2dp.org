My trying to watch Misfits or the last two Dr. Who's was like watching a foreign language film. Capaldi and ...the lady whose name I can't remember are completely unintelligible. Language is organic and evolving, and British and American English are evolving along different paths. We're still the same written language, but the verbal language is drifting, as is usage. Which was my point. Asking young amateur American FanFiction writers to learn your slang and usage is just a little on the silly side.\\
