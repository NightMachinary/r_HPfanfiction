Please try to remember the following: 1) Many if not most fanfic writers are young Americans. They are, accordingly, amateur or hobbyist writers. 2) British and American English have drifted so far apart that they are essentially two different languages. I have to watch British shows with closed captioning because I can't understand you any more. So asking a young hobbyist to learn your language so you can better enjoy the free story they've written on their own time is a bit much; and finally, 3) You chose to read the story.

I completely understand a sense of pride and possessiveness for the British when it comes to HP. And deservedly so---I doubt any American writer could have nailed it the way JKR did (although I could do without the subsequent commentary). But when complaining or Britpicking all the young American fans who fell in love with the HP universe and wanted to contribute to it, please try to take pride in the fact JKR inspired the world instead of being upset that the world doesn't talk the way you do. Just a thought from an old American who rediscovered a touch of magic in HP.
