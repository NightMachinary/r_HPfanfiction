That's a good point about not knowing. As a Brit myself, I wouldn't expect writers from other countries to have an extensive knowledge of British culture. One example: I regularly see stories where the Dursleys refuse to buy Harry glasses or pay for hospital/doctor visits because these things would cost too much. Actually they are taxpayer funded through the National Health Service and would in almost all cases be free. This is the sort of thing that people from other countries might easily not know about.
