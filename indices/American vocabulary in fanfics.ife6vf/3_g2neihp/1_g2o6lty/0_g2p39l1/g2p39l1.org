You're conflating “ignore” with “don't know”. That's my point. By your words you're assigning intentional disregard. I'm telling you it's not people ignoring anything. It's about them NOT KNOWING. And because of language differences and their own age and amateur status, that's not going to change. If it bothers you that much then you can choose not to read fanfic written by Americans.
