If you've read the original books you should be aware that there are differences between UK and US culture. If you aren't, then you're skim reading and not thinking about what's on the page. At that point, it becomes "ignore" by default.

I beta for an American writer and 99% of his word choice goes unchallenged because it's not important. On the other hand I've changed a few things because they were anachronistic or culturally wrong, and he accepted those changes because he wanted the story to be believable.

You are encouraging people to do no research and to engage in lazy writing. That's a very unhelpful attitude.
