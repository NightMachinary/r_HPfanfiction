It is absolutely nothing to do with pride or possessiveness. It's about ruining the atmosphere of a story and breaking the immersiveness.

A few Americanised - or Americanized - words here and there don't spoil anything, and people can get a wee bit precious about them. The problem comes when somebody totally ignores the differences between America and the UK. If a story has Harry putting on sneakers to go to the mall, the author clearly can't be bothered to do the slightest bit of research so I won't be bothered to read the story. If you want to set Harry Potter in America, do that. Some stories have and there are some excellent examples.
