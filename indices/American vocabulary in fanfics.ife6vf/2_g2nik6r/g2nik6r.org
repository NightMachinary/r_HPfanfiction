I don't notice it most of the time unless it's very obvious American slang. I live in the US myself so it's what I'm accustomed to.

Actually, I notice the reverse far more often. I'll see fanfics or crossovers where an American character will use British English words instead of American English(like "whilst" instead of "while")
