Hmm.. I think Im the same way... but tbh, most of the writers from the uk or Australia and Ireland I read are pretty good at American picking.

Sorry Canadians. As a Michigan boy I see a lot of you and I visit your country quite often as well. We dont really speak or write much differently at all. And before you ask no, most Americans didnt even know you were involved in the war of 1812. And we have no hurt feels over it.
