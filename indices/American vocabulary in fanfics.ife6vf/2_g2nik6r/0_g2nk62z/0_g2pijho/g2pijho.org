Canadian to American, nah not too different. I'm born and raised in British Columbia and been in NY/MA for 3 years now. Accents, yeah upstate NY picked out my NV born husband who lived in BC for 7 years as "Canadian". The main differences I see are the regional things. Ie. In MA now, packy for liquor store, bubbler for water fountain. Most of the rest of it is close enough.
