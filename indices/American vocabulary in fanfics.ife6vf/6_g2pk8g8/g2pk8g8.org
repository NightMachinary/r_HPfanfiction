I'm going to just have to disagree with you. Vehemently. Your position is built on a frankly offensive sense of entitlement. You're demanding young people writing as a hobby who give you free stories to make their hobby into a chore for your personal enjoyment. That argument might hold water if you were a paying customer. You're not. It might hold water if these kids were make a living off this. They aren't (if you find any who are, have at them). In sum, these kids owe you nothing, and you are entitled to nothing in return. Edit. Dang it. Responded to the wrong one again. I need new glasses.
