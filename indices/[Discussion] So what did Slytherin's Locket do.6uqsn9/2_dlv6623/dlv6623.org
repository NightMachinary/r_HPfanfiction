I personally don't need it to do something. Slytherin having a locket with a picture of a loved one makes sense on a human level. Think of it like Snape: horrible person, but a complex person with real feelings nonetheless. Or if you want a softer Slytherin, he could be not as horrible as history has painted him and was actually the kind of guy you wouldn't be surprised would have a locket. Or maybe like Snape, he too lost a loved one at a young age. Whichever way you characterize Slytherin, the locket could hold a pensieve memory or just a simple picture of a loved one, etc.

Or it could be as devious as allowing him to disguise carrying around a poison or something else that's deadly or dark. Because who would suspect something dark in an object so innocent and associated with sentimental things?

Also, I think it's appropriate that we don't know much about any magical properties. Slytherin is supposed to be sneaky, so he wouldn't advertise what it could do it it did have special properties.
