The Diadem definitely did /something/. Helena Ravenclaw clearly says that when she put it on, her mind erupted in a cacophony of madness. Whether it was malfunctioning, was "keyed" to Rowena's mind and hers only, or rejected an unworthy wearer is unknown, but there was /some/ mind-related magic to it.

We do not have any hard evidence for the Cup, but I think a collector like Smith would have /checked/ if it had magic in it at some point, even if she didn't dare use it. Exactly what it does, I don't know. As I said, it may have had something to do with potions, or, as someone from the wiki suggested, it may have been a prototype of the spell that vanishes food from the Hogwarts kitchen to the Great Hall and back, befitting of Hufflepuff's association with the House-Elves and her reported proficiency with food-related charms.
