I'm much the same, I have a lot of really interesting ideas and I know all the important elements of writing a good story. But I frankly refuse to contribute to the endless pile of unfinished work on fanfic sites. Because I know myself, any story i start has a 99% chance of never being finished and as an individual who gets so extremely frustrated every time i find an truly excellent story that has been abandoned, I'd rather not be hypocritical
