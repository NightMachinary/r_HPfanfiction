The thing is that adapting from prompts is not usually your main fic. IN my case I'm doing it just for fun. So, I don't put as much time on it.

Currently, I have those 2 chaps (2k words each)... I am looking around for a beta to go over grammar and stuff as English is not my main language... then I'll publish.

I have half an outline as well... but I think that since this is for fun, I'll just go for it and publish and improvise after the middle point.
