I guess that is, if nobody wakes him up (Draco would totally do it), it would mean Harry enter Hogwarts with a little less prejudice.

He disliked Draco the moment he talked to him in Diagon Alley, and Hagrid did say some bad things about Slytherin. But without the train ride to remind Harry of this, maybe he would have been a little less adament about not going to Slytherin.

Also, no friendship with Ron, doubt he would turn into a "Gryffindor Malfoy" trying to confront him every time they meet, but it's doubtfull they would become friends.
