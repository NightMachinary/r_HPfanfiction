Only other 2 worth recommending are unfortunately both unfinished and abandoned, but what is there is far better than most of the drivel that is produced. linkffn(Equilibrium by Surarrin) is probably the lesser of the two, there is only the setup of the story which makes it all the worse that is abandoned. linkffn(Discordant by Heather Sinclair) is the other one, its fun for what it is and is the only story other than the others already mentioned worth reading that I have found.

Havoc Side of the Force is still far and away the best HP/SW cross, there is also a decent sized side story that goes along with it that I enjoy, just know that to the best of my knowledge every single other story will not match up to it.
