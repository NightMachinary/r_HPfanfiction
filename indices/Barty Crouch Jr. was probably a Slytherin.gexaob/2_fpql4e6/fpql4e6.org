Wow, it's insane that I thought he was canonically a Ravenclaw. I never even thought about it, just took it for granted. Somehow, I can't imagine him in any other colors though??? It sounds shallow, but the reason I can't really consider him in another house is that I always imagine him in blue, and I think green doesn't fit him at all.

But ok, I could see him as a Slytherin, if Crouch Sr. was a Slythrin as well (but only then).

Though since people have traits from several different houses, I might as well ascribe unknown House headcanons by colors lol
