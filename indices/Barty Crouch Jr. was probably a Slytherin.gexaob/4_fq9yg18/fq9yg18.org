I disagree. At a glance, any house could potentially fit, as he has qualities from all four. But first, we can probably rule out Hufflepuff, because although he was loyal, a Hufflepuff going dark is rare enough to have been noteworthy. I believe we can potentially rule out Slytherin as well, thanks to his father. Barty Sr. was highly ambitious and probably was a Slytherin himself. Though it's only lightly touched upon, Barty Sr. was at best neglectful, and I don't believe that Barty Jr. would have wanted to be anything like him. Also, Sirius was highly unsympathetic to Slytherins thanks to his own family, yet was sympathetic toward Barty. Gryffindor I can find little against, but for the following reasons, I'm sticking with Ravenclaw:

- He successfully manipulated a highly powerful magical object without incident. That took both power and brains. He knew enough to flawlessly pass himself off as a highly celebrated and successful Auror for a full school year. Everything Moody could do, Barty did, and Moody had decades more experience than Barty at this point, and had been unable to cast for twelve or thirteen years.
- He learned about and imitated that Auror without even Dumbledore, a close friend, noticing until the very last minute. - And, frankly, this was more plot convenience than anything else. He gave believable responses, recalled everything Moody would have known, performed all of the same magic. He was so accomplished at this, that when the real Moody actually appears, the change is seamless, not only to the reader but to the other characters. Moody needs no introduction of his own.
- Both non-verbal magic and transfiguration (particularly of the human kind) are tricky. He combined both at least twice, again, without incident.
- He had to brew a continuous supply of Polyjuice, which is fairly complex. He was probably the most competent of the Death Eaters in general, all considered.
- Everything he did and said held two or more meanings.
- He gained twelve OWLs - two more than Hermione.
- He clearly valued education. He was an exceptional teacher, educating his students well, despite the plan. Dean Thomas informed Umbridge that they "still learned loads from him". Some think it's down to playing the part, but can you really imagine the real Moody being so comprehensive?
- Even Voldemort, not at all known for compliments, considered him intelligent: "Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody whose loyalty has never wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulfill neither requirement." He would have won if Voldemort hadn't managed to screw up and let Harry escape from the Graveyard. It was only a last minute improvisation combined with the dead body of a student in front of him that made Dumbledore suspicious.
- And speaking of Dumbledore, Barty was the only character in any official material ever to outsmart him. Grindelwald manipulated his emotions, not his mind.

I realise that members of other houses can be smart, but all things considered, I think Ravenclaw is quite a clear front-runner.

So Ravenclaw. Hatstool, perhaps. But Ravenclaw.
