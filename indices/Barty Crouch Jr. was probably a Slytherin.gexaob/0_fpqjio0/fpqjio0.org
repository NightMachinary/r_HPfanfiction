The sorting hat sorts students based on the qualities they value, not the qualities they have, otherwise you wouldn't have Crabbe and Goyle in Slytherin, or Hermione/Peter/Percy in Gryffindor.

Also, you make the assumption that people stick to the qualities that are their strongest at age 11 for the rest of their lives - they do not. If you were to resort them at 16 or 17, the majority of them would go to Slytherin, because, let's face it, what teenager isn't ambitious?
