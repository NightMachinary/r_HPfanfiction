Exile by bennybear - fic about Draco in the muggle world after the war

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile]]

Blood Magic by Gateway Girl - AU written before the HBP came out, so some things are different (Snape is a pureblood), but it is really really good.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719610]]

Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood by cambangst - it is a next gen fic where Harry is a grandparent and he and his friends and family need to fight another dark wizard

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647/chapters/15327019]]

Paganaidd's Memories and Dreams series is another fic featuring adult Harry and Ginny with kids. I also really love hir "Digging for the Bones".

A one-shot featuring Pansy and the Malfoys that I think is really well-done would be "Heartsease" by Slytherincesss.

And finally, Angie Astravic's stories would be something you could check out.

Ditto for Iniga. Hir "Darkness Dying" is my fav Marauder-fic.
