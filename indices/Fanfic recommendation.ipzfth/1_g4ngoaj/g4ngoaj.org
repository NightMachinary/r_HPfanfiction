Yes, I hate it as well. I generally consider [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] to be on the sane side (start with “Tales of the Battle” and go on; you can return later to the earlier stories). Or I am just reading [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/119685004][Moving On by The_girlwholived]] (yes, it is on Wattpad, but it is not like one of /those/; and yes, [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare][FanFicFare]] supports Wattpad as well).
