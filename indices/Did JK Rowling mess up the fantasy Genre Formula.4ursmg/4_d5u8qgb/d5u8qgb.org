  However Rowling created a world as diverse and as amazing as Middle Earth
#+end_quote

Simply not true. Rowlings world is paperthin and whenever she adds something to Pottermore, I can never shake the feeling she just pulled that out of her arse because of her contracts. To compare that to Middle Earth, or the inheritance saga... feels wrong.

Harry Potter didn't mess up the formula because it never used the formula to begin with.

#+begin_quote
  It is the formula for the contemporary fantasy novel. There are few rules in the formula : Antagonist that threatens the entirety of the world Protagonist lives in. Protagonist must have allies. Allies must be fleshed out characters to matter.

That is the rule for every story ever, not just contemporary fantasy.

  "Make the world matter by exploring its nuances."

That also counts for Thrillers, Romances, Sci-Fi, any story really. If you cannot bring your readers to care, you won't get them to keep reading. How you get them to care is your thing. Rowling decided that she wants to do it from Harry's perspective only.

Frankly, I don't even know where to start and end to point out how freakin wrong your statement in that thread was. I'm not sure if this is your own theory, or if you picked this up from somewhere, but fact of the matter is, its bullshit. There are very little rules to writing. There are a lot of guidelines, but actual rules are very few and in between.

Anyway... I could write you a thesis about this, but I'm not gonna start. I can only recommend you to research this more and find out why Rowling didn'T mess up "the formula".
