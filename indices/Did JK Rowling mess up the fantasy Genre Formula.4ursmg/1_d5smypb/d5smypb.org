While I don't know anything about the "Genre Formula" I read your comment and I do agree that Rowling didn't really make me care about many characters, or make me think the Wizarding World is worth fighting for. Voldemort was worth fighting against, but I didn't really care about the world, or anyone besides Harry, Ron and Hermione, and maybe some others like Neville and Luna.

I think the switching POVs wouldn't really work if it was done for the first time in the 7th book, I think it would have been jarring after 6 books of just Harry. She'd have had to start with it in the second book for it to work, so I don't agree with that, as cool as the idea sounds.
