please read the link applied to the edit. I forgot to link it when originally posting; my apologies for that. I would counter that all authors when published are asked "what genre is your work?" or some question that is essentially the same. When asked that question, Rowling had to have answered fantasy because that is what the book is catagorized under. Therefore she wrote a fantasy series.

Basically I stated that Rowling failed to make characters other than the trio matter, and that falls under making the world matter in the formula. For example. During the sixth book when Dumbledore dies, the readers are sad. Yet what about the countless dead in at the end of the series from the final battle? We dont FEEL like Harry saved the world from Voldemort. Instead we feel as if Harry went back to school. I stated that I would have prefered a mixed perspective in the last book. I wanted to see the story of Neville. I wanted to see Snape's hardships as he watched the children that a part of him hated yet strove to protect. I wanted to SEE Minerva's plight as she worried about her students.. I wanted to feel Ginny's helplessness as her world crumbled around her.

Instead I got 600 pages of Harry running around trying to save a world that I didnt care about. I stuck with the series after the sixth book hoping that the formula would be fixed. It wasnt.

I also stated in that comment that we love JK for her skill in writing the other portions of the formula so beautifully that it defined a generation. I believe that JK failed in using the stereotypical formula for a contemporary fantasy series, and that is the root of most of the complaints we have about the series as a whole, but if she had followed the formula, we wouldnt have harry potter.
