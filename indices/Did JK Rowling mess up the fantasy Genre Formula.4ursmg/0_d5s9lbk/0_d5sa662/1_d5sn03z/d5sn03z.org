Tolkien is credited as being on of the pioneers of fantasy (side note: when he wrote [[http://www.rivendellcommunity.org/Formation/Tolkien_On_Fairy_Stories.pdf][this essay]] he doesn't even call the genre fantasy because the term hadn't been established yet, but calls them fairy-stories!), but that doesn't mean we have to follow his example to a T, he did what he felt like doing, and so should all authors. Then we can decide if they were successful, but to do that, I think every reader who wants their opinion respected should understand that not all art has or should have the same objective. A simple blue canvas can seem pointless until you put it in the right setting and then it looks much better than the photo-realistic Napoleon battle painting that it replaced, but the battle painting looks wonderful in an ornate building down town where the blue one would have looked like a construction banner. Tolkien was very interested in world-building and language, Rowling is very interested in symbolism, and George Lucas is interested in a fun adventure. None of them are wrong, they are just different and have different strengths.

If you have issues with JKR's writing, that's totally fine, but I would suggest not saying she fucked up a formula. As far as I've noticed, artist are urged /not/ to follow a formula, so your wording makes it seem like you want to sound like you know what you're talking about. If there is a strict formula, then it's the sort of thing an author ought to understand so they can break it in useful and informed ways if they want to. If you feel Rowling was not successful in her story-telling, I would focus more on explaining why McGonagall's plight with her students is important and what it would have added to the story - how witnessing Ginny's hardships in real time would help you connect to the world in ways that's not possible without her, and in what specific ways you feel Neville's story is lacking.

I have no idea what you're saying here,

  Game of Thrones makes the landscape less about the world and more of the characters, then makes it apparent how the world functions around said characters. The inheritance saga, spent close to a whole book exploring the concept of natural balance in relation to characters. A key aspect of the book is Aleigasia. Twilight saga has the vampires battling against their natures to ensure that there is balance (yes the book is bad but whatever). Shoot even Star Wars follows the expanse of the world it builds and makes it matter. Just watch the Star Wars the Clone Wars series on netflix and you will grow to care about characters other than the MC.

There are more than enough words that I should understand what these examples have that Harry Potter doesn't, but I have no idea what point you're trying to make. The Inheritance Saga explores natural balance through magic, but I would say Harry Potter's main theme is extremely similar - the natural order of life is death, and in this world, magic favors those who accept death over those who fear it. Twilight has vampires battling against their nature, but I would say Dumbledore and Snape's entire characterization is about their inner conflict and guilt and over-coming it to do what is right over what is easy. Star Wars' having hundreds of creators who work on the films, novels, and tv shows separately notwithstanding, is a world built on feeling in much the same way Harry Potter is - two suns! Why not? Giant sand monsters - okay!! (even though Luke could have totally used his jedi powers sooner, but whatever, how else are we going to get this bad-ass scene?)

You can make your arguments, but at least keep in mind that many of us feel attached to minor characters in the same ways you feel attached to Star Wars or Twilight characters. I've always said the minor characters in Harry Potter feel extremely fleshed out without requiring pages upon pages to get the point across. JKR has always struck me as an author that takes less is more to heart. She also writes in a way that allows us to /feel/ the story.

For example - when Rita Skeeter writes about Harry, Hermione, and Krum's love triangle, we are not told or described Harry's opinion on it. Perhaps you would call that a fuck-up, but after reading it the first time I would have sworn up and down that Harry was mortified only for me to go back and find it's just Ron and Hermione talking about how they feel about it, and Harry is silent until later when Snape read it out loud and he goes red. JKR shows us through subtle characterization what sort of person he is and we /know/ how he's reacting, because she successfully uses what we're thinking as readers. I think it's quite cleverly done.

The world building is also something that is written as a feeling - it's how the whimsy is achieved. We do not get the level of detail as Middle Earth, nor do we understand magic in the same scientific way as Eragon or Lyra in His Dark Materials, but there is a poetic logic to JKR's world that gives us both the silly interdepartmental memos fluttering up lifts and de-gnoming as well as understanding why the darkness of Dementors is different than the darkness of Thestrals.

And why flying memos anyway? Why did they only just recently switch from owls? Surely the Ministry is old enough that whatever is being used in Arthur's time has been used for centuries and tested with time! But maybe they tried things before owls, and maybe they tried things before the things they'd tried before owls. The key to JKR's world building is - does it make you chuckle? LOTR was built by a god who was interested in the concept of time and how it changes language and landscapes, Game of Thrones was built by a cruel god, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy's God vanished in a puff of logic (so who knows what that guy was thinking), and Harry Potter's world was built by Elizabeth Bennet's father who delights in the ridiculous even at the expense of propriety. If you want to know what the Harry Potter world is like, just remember that JKR named her school Hog Warts.

And the magic that pulls the plot along makes the exact amount of sense as it needs to and no more. Her magic is not scientific, but it's also not faith. Maybe it is closest to the Dust from His Dark Materials, but instead of being powered by self-awareness, it's powered by intention (so maybe similar to Eragon's magic after all?).

Harry Potter seems to not be your thing, but that doesn't mean the author fucked up, it means she wrote something that's not your jam.
