Here's a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6ewgt/reddit_markdown_primer_or_how_do_you_do_all_that/c03nik6][great guide]] I was sent recently that blew my mind about formatting - have fun!

I'm sorry that I thought you didn't like Harry Potter - clearly you're on this subreddit. I also didn't mean to make my assumption that you didn't seem like the focal point - in the end, I don't really care if you like it or not, but I also didn't understand what you were saying in the end. I'm still not entirely certain what GoF, Twilight, and Inheritance are doing that Harry Potter isn't.

I think because to me, some of what you're saying Harry Potter isn't doing is something I've considered and /liked/ about Harry Potter, and other things you're saying about it are things I think /are/ there, so it just seems confusing - in the end, I'm not really sure what exactly is lacking. And also, the things you're saying about HP I feel like are in other stories, like His Dark Materials, LOTR, and Star Wars. Especially now that you've mentioned Sally-Ann, I feel I have to mention Boba Fett - who was introduced in the infamous Christmas Special and then made into a character in the films who does nothing and people loved him despite him basically doing nothing, and his background grew from that instead of the other way around. And even then I feel like we could come up with a hundred Star Wars charactrs that are as relevant as Sally-Ann - how does a story feel realistic and fleshed out /without/ minor characters who only serve one small purpose? Again - why I'm confused, I think every good world-building story does this, because there's just no way hundreds of people can be fully fleshed out. I hate linking old links to "prove a point" (it always seems so lazy to me), but in this case, I think it's relevant, but I was a mod for [[/r/hprankdown]] and we spent months analyzing minor and major characters for their literary merit (with varying definitions of what literary merit meant, haha!), and some extremely minor characters served very useful purposes that didn't /need/ to be expanded on, while other more major characters' background's felt unnecessary.

But on another hand, even though I think you're examples need some work, I think your main points, if properly fleshed out, are very interesting and probably true, but I still don't think all your points are a bad thing about the books. Firstly, condemning someone for breaking a formula is never going to be an argument I trust because my first instinct is to think "good!", but I do definitely want to understand what you think is lacking and why it's important to you, because that is a discussion I would trust and I think then we could have a really interesting conversation about the books - especially now I know you love the books as much as I do!

I would love to keep going, but I gotta head out - feel free to respond so we can keep chatting if you want! I seriously would love to, and if you're paper isn't done yet, maybe our conversation will help fuel discussion points for it!
