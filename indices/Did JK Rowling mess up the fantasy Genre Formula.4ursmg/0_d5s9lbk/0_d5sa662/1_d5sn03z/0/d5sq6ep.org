Harry Potter is my first love... looked upon fondly, but there are issues that at the time, I did not realize existed. For me, I have recently been forced by a terrible professor to write about how an author adhered to the stereotypical fantasy "formula". I realize that such a thing seems... absurd. Yet all painters utilize the standard strokes of a brush to create multiple works of wonder. All people who carve wooden figures utilise a simple kit of chisels files and cutting instruments to form their masterpieces. I was taught that such is true for any genre of fiction. Fantasy follows a set of rules that were outlined in my linked comment.

What I was attempting to state in the part that you have quoted (how do you do that btw?) is that each of those works made things OTHER than the main cast matter in some fashion. Where as every time i reread Harry Potter I cannot help but ask," Why name this character if you will never mention her again?" We even have a work of fanfiction over a character that JK named and then... NEVER mentioned again. (Sally Anne).

However all this being said, I LOVE Harry Potter. It is as much a portion of my childhood as my family and pets. It is the first book I bought on my own, it is the book I would take a flash light to bed so I could read it under the covers when I should be sleeping, it is the story that opened my eyes that not all people are simple, that magic is more than just abrakadabra and that tyrants should be overthrown. If my post ever put the doubt of that in any minds, I deeply and sincerely apologize to both you, and to my past self for not clarifying. This post was not an attempt at degradation of JK Rowlings work. It was intended as a sounding board for my own personal feelings about a story I love and cherish very deeply.
