Most cases suck because people let their (often poorly thought out) personal interpretations come to the forefront. Bashing normally requires either picking and choosing scenes from the books, playing up negative character traits, or just adding random negative character interpretations. It's done in an attempt to improve the standing of other characters (i.e. all the super!Harry and Suemione stories). Dumbledore is vehemently against justifying things the "Greater Good," but fanfic bashing makes that his catchphrase. Ron's a teenager with his own insecurities and problems, but bashing turns him into a traitorous, lazy, food-obsessed lackey. In his first year, Ron's heard stories about Slytherins, but hasn't met many/any until he starts Hogwarts, so it's unlikely that he's going to suddenly start sneering at Harry for being sorted there after befriending him on the train. Molly is looking out for an orphan who's a good friend of her youngest son. She's nosy, overbearing, and doesn't have the right to speak for him, but she has a reasonable set of justifications for her actions.

Crack fics/self-aware fics work- I remember a story challenge/one-shot about a smart Ron being money-obsessed and plotting with Dumbledore that was pretty fun. I like fics that don't suddenly add unreasonable hatred and evil traits (i.e. love potions) because they tend to suck, but there are a couple that are readable because the author has good grasp of mechanics. I think conflict among a set of friends is natural and makes for better writing, but I like when they can overcome it and move forward such as in linkffn(Forging the Sword)
