Just to be clear, the fics where Dumbledore and/or the Weasleys do it are invariably bashfics where the potioners get their comeuppance at the hands of the newly liberated Harry. Are you asking for a Harry-bashfic where he gets his comeuppance at the hands of his victims? Or, are you looking for a fic celebrating the depraved triumph of this Harry?

That said, linkffn(Compound Interest by Cillit Bang Bang) has Vernon have Harry brew potions for him to use on his coworkers, business partners, and competitors.
