There is a wizarding school fanfic that is worth reading--it is not a Harry Potter story, but a stand-alone story called Mother of Learning by Nobody103. linkfp(2961893). It is nearly complete--102 of the 103 chapters have been posted. It features a groundhog day-like situation, where a 15-year old wizard-in-training keeps reliving the first month of school. It features lots of interesting creatures (including demons) and advanced magic.

My only real complaint about it is that the female characters are underdeveloped and weak.
