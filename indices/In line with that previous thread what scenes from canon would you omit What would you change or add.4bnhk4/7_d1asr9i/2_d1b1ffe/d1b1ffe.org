Sirius' death was the most heartbreaking thing in the whole series to me. I may not have wanted it to happen, but it was much stronger and more important narratively than any of the deaths in book 7.

Like, it hurt, but I don't know that I would take it out. It's always good if you can make your readers feel.

Hedwig's death was just senseless :(
