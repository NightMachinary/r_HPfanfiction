*Dumbledore's backstory. This should have been interesting (as I am very interested in it), but it felt shoehorned in and didn't have much purpose.

*Grindlewald. He's mentioned in book one as having been "defeated". Don't be so fucking vague, since in book 7 he's apparently alive. Well done JKR.

*Molly shouldn't be the one to kill Bellatrix, it should be Neville.

*Elder Wand and the confusion around wands changing owners. Shouldn't drop this sort of information in book fucking seven (though obviously its easy to just say it only applies to the elder wand). Same with the Trace.

*Don't name a kid fucking Albus Severus. Seriously, that name is enough to make any kid turn into a dark lord.

- Why would James make Peter the secret keeper rather than his own wife?
