Hey so I agree with you on most of those but just want to add my two cents on a couple of them!

-Molly killing Bellatrix: the purpose of this was to go with the whole theme of love. If Neville killed her, it would have been revenge for what she did to his parents. Molly kills her out of love for her daughter, and only aimed to kill when her child 'missed death by inches.'

-I think when they first researched and found the Fidelius Charm, they didn't know you could be your own secret keeper. I always interpreted as 'Peter is the secret keeper for the /Potter family./' So since the family is the secret (since Flitwick mentions in PoA that Voldemort could have seen the /house/ and pressed his nose up against the sitting room window, but still wouldn't have been able to see the /family/), nobody in the family can be the Keeper. On the other hand, by the mid-90s, they're making the /houses/ the secret: Grimmauld Place is the secret, Shell Cottage is the secret. So any person could potentially be the secret keeper. Another reason they mightn't have made Lily nor James the Keeper is because then they would have to leave the safety of the house if they wanted to tell others the secret. If Sirius/Dumbledore/Peter is the Keeper, they can let Lupin or Bathilda or whomever know where to go if the Potters ever wanted visitors. But this bit is mostly my theory based on book evidence; the charm can be interpreted in other ways too.
