  HBP - the Cave
#+end_quote

--------------

I got to say much of the cave was excellent, but I would change something. Harry, as competent a wizard in Defence as you're ever likely to meet at his age, repeatedly uses ineffective spells.

- petrificus totalus- useful. Single target, and technically temporary but it is very likely to last long enough for his needs.

- impendimenta- near useless. Single target, lasts seconds. The fact that he switched to this spell from a more effective spell is baffling.

- incarcerous- another useful if single target spell. However it allows the victim wiggle and struggle, and when dealing with the magical undead I wouldn't put my confidence in anything that allowed movement, strength, or self damage to promote escape to be worthwhile.

- sectumsempra- single target deadly spell. He's at least getting his priorities straight now. Who knows when/if inferi are covered in DADA but cutting/blood loss has NO effect on the /undead/.

Then Dumbledore saves the day. Awesomely. And then Harry says he forgot about fire and panicked. This is an understandable reaction- except this is Harry freakin Potter.

He destroyed his professor with something approximating the effects of heat/fire in his first year. He killed a basilisk with a sword second year. He sent flying over a hundred dementors in third year. He faced dragons and the Dark Lord returned, greater and more terrible than ever before fourth year. He faced a squad of Death Eaters against whom he had no special protection fifth year. And more besides. And he forgot about fire? He panicked? An O.W.L graduate with an O in DADA not only couldn't put up a decent if losing battle, but his effectiveness actually reduced throughout his encounter.

Rowling always used magic for plot, and did it wonderfully, but sometimes it feels like she reduced Harry's growth and effectiveness from the early books to reinforce his regular joe in over his head-ness. I suppose my preferred course would have been to up the ante and make him more capable with the years /and/ make his threats more... er, threatening.
