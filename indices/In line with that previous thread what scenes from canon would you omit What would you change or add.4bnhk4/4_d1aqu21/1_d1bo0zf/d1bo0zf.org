  I understand the need for secrecy, but there's very little reason to believe that Hermione couldn't have used the Royal Mail or phoned up Harry to fill him in on some details.

Good idea! Let's give actionable intelligence to a person with a mental link of unknown nature to the greatest Legilimens alive!

I am sure that doing so via Muggle means will be far more secure than doing via magical means!

But seriously, I don't see how the medium makes a huge difference. Muggle post is probably no harder to intercept than owl post, and both it and phone have to get past both Voldemort and the Dursleys.
