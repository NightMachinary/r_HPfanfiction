Snape's is one of the greatest Occlumenses alive, doesn't have a direct link with Voldemort's mind, and actually has need-to-know.

As for Snape selling out Vance, it's something he bragged to Bellatrix about, so he might have been stretching the truth. And, even if we assume that he is as culpable as he claims, he did it to maintain his cover, not for fun or out of loyalty to Voldemort. If not for that, he would have either not able to continue as a spy, which would have been disastrous, or he would have had to sacrifice someone else. Again, that's assuming he is as culpable as he claims.
