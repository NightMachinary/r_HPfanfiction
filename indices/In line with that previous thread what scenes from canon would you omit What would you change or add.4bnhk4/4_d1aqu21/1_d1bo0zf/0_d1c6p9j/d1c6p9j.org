JKR had Snape in the Order meetings. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard of. Why would you have a double agent knowing the roster of your group? He should have been isolated and fed only what Dumbledore wanted Tom to know. He wouldn't have been able to sell out Vance if he didn't know she was a member.
