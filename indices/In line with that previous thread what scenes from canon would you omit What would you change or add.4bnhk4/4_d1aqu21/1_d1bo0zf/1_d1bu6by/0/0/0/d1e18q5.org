Before I get into this discussion, I'd like to point out that the relative security of the three media considered is irrelevant when your /intended recipient/ has a mental link of unknown nature with the enemy who is a Legilimens. Also, neither Hermione nor Ron were in a position to assess how safe any particular medium was.

  No, my original statement was about telephones, but since you're hung up (haha) on the fleeting reference to the Royal Mail
#+end_quote

I was merely replying to what you chose to emphasize: you quoted me on Royal Mail (and not telephone) before asserting there's no evidence, so I focused on that.

  As early as CS, Hedwig was attacked by a house elf. Owls: not secure. There are no anecdotes of any wizards attacking mail carriers, mail lorries, or any other part of the Royal Mail. Ergo: secure.

Um, no. There aren't any anecdotes of wizards attacking clown cars either, but broom-riders were attacked in DH, so does that mean that if you wanted to travel from A to B with Voldemort and/or the Ministry after you, a clown car would be harder to intercept than a broom?

You need to compare apples to apples: the reason no wizard has been seen bothering Muggle post is that no wizard who had any need to intercept Muggle post in Harry's presence. Whereas Dobby wanted to isolate Harry to keep him from returning to Hogwarts, how many people even knew about the letter the Weasleys had sent to the Dursleys?

  Molly & Arthur are two of the most Muggle-loving wizards in the series. Indeed, Arthur's job has made him keenly aware of the Muggle world.

If we take Arthur's words and actions at face value, no, it didn't, and nor does it need to, since he just deals with magical artifacts that happen to look like Muggle stuff.

  why would you expect wizards who despise Muggles - and have no interest in their non-magical culture - to be able to intercept letters?
#+end_quote

Two reasons:

1. Forget rank-and-file Death Eaters. /Voldemort/ grew up in a Muggle orphanage. He is quite aware of telephones and Royal Mail.
2. The Ministry, which runs a bus service and a train, owns a fleet of enchanted cars, and keeps tabs on Muggle communications as a part of enforcing the Statute of Secrecy with enough celerity to make a giant invasion look like a hurricane to the military chain of command, probably do have ways to monitor undesirables' Muggle communications as well. In the summer after GoF, that would include Harry.
