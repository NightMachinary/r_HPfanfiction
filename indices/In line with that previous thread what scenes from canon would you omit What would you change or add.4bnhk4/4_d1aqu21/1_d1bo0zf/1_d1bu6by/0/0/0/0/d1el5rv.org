  the relative security of the three media considered is irrelevant when your intended recipient has a mental link of unknown nature with the enemy who is a Legilimens

Dumbledore later expressed regret ("weakness" Harry calls it in OOtP Chapter Thirty-Seven) at having locked Harry away from any information that summer. In his final speech in OOtP, he makes many references to 'an old man's mistakes.' Clearly, Albus made that decision /not/ because of Voldemort's abilities, but because:

#+begin_quote
  "I cared about you too much," said Dumbledore simply. "I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your piece of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act." [...] "I have watched you struggling under more burdens than any other student who has ever passed through this school, and I could not bring myself to add another[.]

Let's look at the strange relationship of 'actionable intelligence' as you put it versus what Ron and Hermione really know. From their letters:

#+begin_quote
  "We've been told not to say anything important in case our letters go astray..." "We're quite busy but I can't give you details here..." "There's a fair amount going on, we'll tell you everything when we see you...."
#+end_quote

Harry assumes they're at the Burrow and has every reason to think so. Now what happens when Harry finally arrives at Grimmauld?

#+begin_quote
  "I know our letters were useless - but we couldn't tell you anything [...] we've got so much to tell you [...]

  "I wanted answers, you know...."

  "We wanted to give them to you, mate," said Ron. [...]

  "How come you two are allowed to know everything that's going on - ?"

  "We're not!" Ron interrupted. "Mum won't let us near the meetings, she says we're too young - "
#+end_quote

Sure sounds to me like they don't /actually/ have anything interesting to say that could compromise the Order's operations. More likely a case of Ron and Hermione rather immaturely implying that they know a lot more than they do.

What /could/ they have communicated to Voldemort in a worst case scenario?

- That the Order is active again? Voldmort could have guessed that easily.

- The location of Headquarters? Covered by Fidelius; they wouldn't have been able to write it down in any case as neither of them are the Secret Keeper.

- Membership roster? Ron doesn't have any idea of how many there are, let alone any identities that aren't readily apparent to any Dark Lord.

- That Order members "are standing guard over something?" Voldemort already knows about the Prophecy orb!

- Snape's presence? Voldemort already believes Severus is /his/ spy.

- Percy working for Fudge? That's public knowledge.

- The Prophet has been trashing Dumbledore and Harry? Harry has already been reading the Prophet over the summer.

I don't think we're going to find any common ground on this point of contention.

  *probably* do have ways to monitor undesirables' Muggle communications as well

Purely conjecture. You're really reaching here.
