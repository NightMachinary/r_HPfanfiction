Sorry for necroposting, but I wanted to give you some time before I replied again. Things were getting a little heated and I thought it was best to walk away once you started confusing your arguments with my own. Thank you for your addendum clarifying the issue.

#+begin_quote
  The passage you quoted refers to the whole 5 years at Hogwarts
#+end_quote

I disagree. This passage is meant to counter Harry's anger at not being told more about TMR, despite having successfully survived encounters with him in the past. Specifically after CS. I don't think it's a stretch at all to apply this same anger - and weak, overly emotional rebuttal - to the summer after GoF as well.

#+begin_quote
  What's actionable and what's not and to whom is not something Ron or Hermione were in a position to determine before the fact.
#+end_quote

On the contrary, I think it's feasible that Hermione (at the very least, and quite possibly Ron as well) could have worked out all of the points I bulleted above, save for the Prophecy Orb or any intrigue regarding Severus (seeing as how she had no idea as to the existence of the former or the contested status of the latter).

#+begin_quote
  Also, what's not actionable for Voldemort may still be for the Ministry, which is looking for an excuse to punish any of them.
#+end_quote

The Ministry had its chance to punish Harry, but they failed to do so even after having stacked the deck against him. Fudge was a paper tiger.

#+begin_quote
  So you're going to continue insisting that because a mode of travel or communication was never attacked on-screen it's more secure?
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  Ministry, which has been shown to be able to mess with Muggle communications whenever and however they wanted (including the military and a foreign President), couldn't tap a phone line on 4 Privet Drive, that's reaching.
#+end_quote

Let me start by saying that I don't like Muggle wank. That being said, the passage that is so often quoted to instantly dispel the notion that Muggles would ever have a chance in any engagement against the magical community is often misunderstood.

The quote from HBP:

#+begin_quote
  "Er, said the Prime Minister, "listen.... It's not a very good time for me.... I'm waiting for a telephone call, you see... from the President of - "

  "That *can be* rearranged," said the portrait at once. The Prime Minister's heart sank. He had been afraid of that.
#+end_quote

Emphasis mine. So, despite Kingsley Shacklebolt being /very/ close to the Muggle Prime Minister, the Ministry for Magic doesn't even know his schedule. There was no indication that the portrait had /any/ idea that the PM was about to speak with another head of state. How effective can the magical response be if they don't have the PM's schedule down? Either Kingsley isn't very good at his job, or the magical counter to the Muggle government is overblown. If the quote had been:

#+begin_quote
  "That *has already been* rearranged,"
#+end_quote

then I would have more confidence in the Ministry's ability to keep tabs on the Muggle PM.

Continuing:

#+begin_quote
  "But I really was rather hoping to speak -"

  "We shall arrange for the President to forget to call. He will telephone tomorrow night instead," said the little man.
#+end_quote

So far I see evidence of a Confundus Charm, an Obliviation, or a false memory implantation (a la Hermione's parents in DH). Nothing at all about the knowledge of how to tap a phone. Not a single word about having the ability to do so.

I don't think it's reaching to say that those are two very different skills.
