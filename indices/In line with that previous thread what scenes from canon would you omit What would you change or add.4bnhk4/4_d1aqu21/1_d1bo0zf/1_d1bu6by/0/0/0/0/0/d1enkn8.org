  Dumbledore later expressed regret ("weakness" Harry calls it in OOtP Chapter Thirty-Seven) at having locked Harry away from any information that summer. In his final speech in OOtP, he makes many references to 'an old man's mistakes.' Clearly, Albus made that decision not because of Voldemort's abilities, but because:

The passage you quoted refers to the whole 5 years at Hogwarts, perhaps the preceding decade as well, not the summer before OotP; and it was spoken with a benefit of hindsight, when Dumbledore had a much better idea of what Voldemort could and couldn't do through the link. To quote Snape during the Occlumency lessons, "The important point is that the Dark Lord is now aware that you are gaining access to his thoughts and feelings. He has also deduced that the process is likely to work in reverse; that is to say, he has realised that he might be able to access your thoughts and feelings in return --"

  Let's look at the strange relationship of 'actionable intelligence' as you put it versus what Ron and Hermione really know.

What's actionable and what's not and to whom is not something Ron or Hermione were in a position to determine before the fact. Also, what's not actionable for Voldemort may still be for the Ministry, which is looking for an excuse to punish any of them.

You know that, I know that, but they didn't at the time.

  I don't think we're going to find any common ground on this point of contention.
#+end_quote

So you're going to continue insisting that because a mode of travel or communication was never attacked on-screen it's more secure? That a clown car is harder to intercept than a broom?

#+begin_quote
  Purely conjecture. You're really reaching here.
#+end_quote

No, ignoring what I actually wrote and insisting that the Ministry, which has been shown to be able to mess with Muggle communications whenever and however they wanted (including the military and a foreign President), couldn't tap a phone line on 4 Privet Drive, that's reaching.
