  So you're going to continue insisting that because a mode of travel or communication was never attacked on-screen it's more secure? That a clown car is harder to intercept than a broom?
#+end_quote

As was pointed out to me, this can be read as implying that [[/u/MacsenWledig]] was claiming that a clown car would be harder to intercept than a broom. Since we're in a debate, I don't want to edit the post, but I want to clarify that while I believe that the first sentence ("So ... secure?") is an accurate representation of MacsenWledig's argument, the second sentence was meant to emphasize the absurdity of that argument, /not/ actually claim that MacsenWledig made this argument. My apologies for the poor phrasing.
