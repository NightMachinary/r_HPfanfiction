  The burden of proof is on you to make the case that Muggle post is more secure

No, my original statement was about /telephones/, but since you're hung up (haha) on the fleeting reference to the Royal Mail, I can address that too. As early as CS, Hedwig was attacked by a house elf. Owls: not secure.

There are no anecdotes of any wizards attacking mail carriers, mail lorries, or any other part of the Royal Mail. Ergo: secure. In fact, the /only/ example we have of wizards using the mail is when Molly sends Vernon & Petunia a letter, where we can deduce several things:

- Molly considers Muggle Post abnormal
- Muggle postman for Ottery St. Catchpole and the surrounding area doesn't know where the Burrow is, has never made deliveries
- Does not understand how much postage would be required to get a letter from Exeter to Surrey

Molly & Arthur are two of the most Muggle-loving wizards in the series. Indeed, Arthur's job has made him keenly aware of the Muggle world. If the Weasleys are this incompetent at even /using/ the Royal Mail, why would you expect wizards who despise Muggles - and have no interest in their non-magical culture - to be able to intercept letters?
