I would change Hermione's phobia of using a telephone.

At the end of PS, Harry gave his phone number to /both/ Ron and Hermione. In CS, JKR had Ron ring up the Dursley residence because it was funny. The notion that wizards are utterly clueless as to the rather straightforward use of such a common household item is a brilliant bit of worldbuilding.

In OOtP, Harry rightfully blew his stack at his friends for their purposefully oblique letters throughout the summer. I understand the need for secrecy, but there's very little reason to believe that Hermione couldn't have used the Royal Mail or phoned up Harry to fill him in on some details. JKR cheated her narrative because she wanted Harry to be emotionally volatile in a particular scene.
