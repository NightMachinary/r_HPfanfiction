I really wish Sirius didn't die. I get so sad when I think of all the shit Sirius ended up going through in his life.

- Horrible family life/abuse
- The complete annihilation of his choose family in a single night
- 12 years in the most horrifying prison you can possibly imagine
- Spending ~two years on the run from the ministry in horrible conditions.
- Being imprisoned in his childhood home that he vowed never to return to.
- Falling through the veil.

Pretty everything that wasn't his life at Hogwarts was shit. At least Harry ended up happy after the war, Sirius never had that luxury.
