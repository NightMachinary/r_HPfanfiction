  (and from the earlier thread...) Hermione isn't given the Time Turner by professorial fiat- she solves a long-standing mystery that leads her to it; she leverages it until the end of the year, when making a change to past events (Sirius' soul being stolen) causes it to break- or maybe that's how they change things- usually the turn back is only for observation, but by Turning back and breaking it, they are given a second chance. There is still a Time room at the DoM, but the Unspeakables obviously don't have the key to making a traveling device like the one Hermione found.
