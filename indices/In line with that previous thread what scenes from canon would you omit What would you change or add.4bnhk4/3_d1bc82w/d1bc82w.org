- The Goblet of Fire is the tournament trophy. It has unique divining properties valued by all three schools. Throughout the fourth book Harry has nightmares of the Cup, always feeling its presence threatening his future.

- (and from the earlier thread...) Hermione isn't given the Time Turner by professorial fiat- she solves a long-standing mystery that leads her to it; she leverages it until the end of the year, when making a change to past events (Sirius' soul being stolen) causes it to break- or maybe that's how they change things- usually the turn back is only for observation, but by Turning back and breaking it, they are given a second chance. There is still a Time room at the DoM, but the Unspeakables obviously don't have the key to making a traveling device like the one Hermione found.

- Lily invented the Wolfsbane draught for Remus and published the formula anonymously at James' suggestion (and Sirius' protestations)- because Lily was awesome, and that would be evidence of it.

- The Order of the Phoenix is heard to implement several operations of mixed outcome; they're there when Voldemort opens up Azkaban and are involved with tracking recruited Death Eaters based upon Harry's memories of the graveyard.

- During Half-Blood Prince, Harry goes out of Hogwarts on day-trips with Order members, particularly Albus as he hunts for evidence of Riddle's method for immortality. Sometimes it's Harry's lonely upbringing which helps him identify with Riddle and find key clues; other times it just proves painfully educational

- Use the real-world calendar- 1st September isn't always Sunday. Or dump the use of weekdays as a reference- perhaps the wizarding world operates on moon cycles: "See you Sunday!" "What?" "She means second Gibbous descending."
