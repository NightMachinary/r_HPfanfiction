The fact that we skip forward from the end of a war where family and friends died in front of them, with zero after effects, where they're literally only 17-18, to suddenly being happy adults with jobs and kids. It's... I don't know, hard to fit in with? It's like a complete 180 from the rest of the series, like it was put there as an afterthought.

For me I think it's just the lack of transition. An epilogue could've been maybe at the one year mark, showing that they're healing, recovering, rebuilding, and moving toward that epilogue that she had put in. 19 years is a hell of a jump considering where we had left off.
