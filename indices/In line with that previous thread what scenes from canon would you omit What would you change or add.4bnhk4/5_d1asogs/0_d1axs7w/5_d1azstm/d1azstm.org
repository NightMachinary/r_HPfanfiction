Harry/Ginny - enough said...I could add Ron/Hermione (come on, they aren't right for each other! They fight too much (no, not "Old married couple!" as couples who really stick together do not fight constantly about fundamental believes and politics - I mean Ron believes himself superior to muggles like Draco does, the driver's license stunt proves it!) Harry would be a better fight - not perfect, but better!) and Harry's naming of his kids (I'd hate him to be named after a grease-ball everybody hated!)
