Yes I did, many people don't like the crapilogue because of the relationships (Harry/Ginny might be popular, but not everybody likes it).

Then there's things like:

- clemency for Deatheaters (why? - I think the Malfoys should rot in prison for example and have a significant portion of their wealth confiscated to pay for rebuilding and to help war victims!)
- nothing (well: not much!) changes in the WW (the rich purebloods still remain in power, despite most of them at least passively supporting the DEs (if they had acted then the ministry would probably have never fallen, I mean Voldemort didn't have thousands of followers, no most people were just to afraid to fight/stand up for themselves, despite all of them having the means to fight (every witch/wizard has a wand after all, it's not like in most western countries were citizens aren't armed and couldn't even mount a credible resistance if they wanted to!))
- wasted potential (Harry using favoritism (and his fame, despite saying he hates it all the time!) to become an auror without having the proper grades/qualifications (he's got NO NEWTS!))
