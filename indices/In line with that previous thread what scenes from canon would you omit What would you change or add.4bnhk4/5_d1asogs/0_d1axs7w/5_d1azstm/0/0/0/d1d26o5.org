All right, I'm really not that interested in this subject anymore, but I feel like I should just correct you for next time

no.1 Realtionships: Fair enough, nothing to say there,really

no.2 Clemency: I'll point out the only ones who actually got clemency were the Malfoys, and it's a very similar situation as to why Snape escaped from azkaban in the first war- Narcissa saved Harry's life. It's only natural he would intercede for her.

no.3 Nothing changes: I'm really not sure what would make you think that: I'm fairly certain JK has said before a lot changed after the war, and even if she hadn't there's /nothing/ in the epilogue to make you think otherwise. SO that's not a problem the epilogue has.

no.4 undeserved auror-ship : Again, this is not a problem with the Epilogue since nowhere in it this is mentioned. But I'll point out that Harry didn't use his fame to become an auror: He, ROn, and I believe some more talented people were /invited/ by Kingsley (who's the minister) as an effort to have as many aurors as possible to raly up all the dark lord supporters.
