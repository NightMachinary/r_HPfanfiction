A sibling relationship isn't the same as a romantic relationship. Even Rowling has said that guys like Ron are "fun to write, less fun to date", and she based Hermione on herself. To be honest, just with the way his table manners are described in the series makes the very idea of my favorite character dating him offensive.

I could go into the fact that they don't even respect each other's interests, and all, but no, apparently for you that doesn't matter. Because as long as they're different they'll complement each other? In my experience relationships need common ground to survive.
