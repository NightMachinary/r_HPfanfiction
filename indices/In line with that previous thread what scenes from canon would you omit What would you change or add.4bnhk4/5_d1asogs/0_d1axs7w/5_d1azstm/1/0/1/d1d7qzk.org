With regard to house-elf slavery and the SPEW movement, I think that it's important to remember that Ron had very little interaction with house-elves before this - the Weasleys never owned one, and those he did know seemed, in his opinion, to be happy where they were. Whether that was true or not, I think that was a large part of his teasing - in his eyes, she was fighting to help a marginalized group that didn't really want to be helped. I'm not saying that's anywhere near correct, but that's how he had always seen it, and it's difficult to change part of your worldview.

As for learning, I don't really think that those are fundamental differences in beliefs, though maybe it's just me. I'm not trying to excuse Ron's actions, because those really aren't okay, but Hermione could have definitely put her foot down with regard to the copying/help, and she did need to be pulled away from the books every once in a while. As for the troll incident, that was on Ron, yes, but it was also an unfortunate coincidence that she happened to be in the bathroom where the troll decided to camp out, so I don't know that you can totally put that blame on Ron.

I don't know that Ron feels superior to muggles as much as he's still looking for someone that he's better than. We know he's got a lot of insecurities, the byproduct of being the sixth son, the king of hand-me-downs, the sidekick, and the second choice. I think that probably still plays into his worldview as an adult. It doesn't make his actions acceptable at all, but I honestly don't think he has any bias towards muggles - not once can I recall him making fun of someone because of their blood status, and that speaks volumes to me.
