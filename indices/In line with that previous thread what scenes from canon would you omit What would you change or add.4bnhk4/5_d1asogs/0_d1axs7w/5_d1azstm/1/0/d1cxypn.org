House-Elf-Slavery - enough said (note: I might not agree with Hermione's claims, but she sees it that way and Ron makes fun of her) - and not to mention learning (she corrects his pronunciation in the first book and he makes fun of her (and nearly gets her killed!), hell he often uses her to copy homework or notes, while telling her to stop studying all the time etc.)

It might not be conscious that Ron's a bigot, but unconsciously he feels superior to muggles (which is true of course, but it doesn't make it right to just use your magic on somebody with no defenses against such a thing...it's almost as bad as muggle-baiting IMHO!)
