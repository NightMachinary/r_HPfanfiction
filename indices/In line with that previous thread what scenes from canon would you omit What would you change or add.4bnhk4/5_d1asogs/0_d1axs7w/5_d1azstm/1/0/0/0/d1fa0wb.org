Of course! I always was critical of that (I loved a fanfiction that covered that and showed she also messed with Harry's mind (it's H/Hr and she deleted the memory of them having "comfort-sex" after Ron leaves them and Harry finds out later and doesn't want to talk to her anymore/doesn't want to see her again...sadly unfinished!)) and I myself would rather die than have somebody muck around in my mind (deleting stuff - adding stuff, like knowledge and skills would be fine though!)...I love fictions that have her parents cross with her when she undoes it!
