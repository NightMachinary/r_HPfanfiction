  I mean Ron believes himself superior to muggles like Draco does, the driver's license stunt proves it

I don't think so. From /Deathly Hallows/, page 754; “As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,” Ron whispered to Harry, as together they lifted Albus's trunk and owl onto the train. “I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let's face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that.”

I'm not seeing how this translates to wizards > muggles, /especially/ given the Weasley reputation as an anti-supremacy family. Sure, it's not the best thing to do, but you can't tell me that even comes close to Draco and company's constant use of Mudblood and other slurs - don't forget who defended Hermione in second year and spent the afternoon burping up slugs.

I think Ron and Hermione work because they're so drastically different. Where Ron is hot-headed and quick to act, Hermione is cool and logical, and while she struggles to separate herself from the books she loves so much, Ron is nearly the opposite, always waiting until it can't be put off any further, trying to come up with anything to evade work, and that's a good balance.

My brother and I are very similar people (not in the romantic aspect, we're not from Alabama), rather in that we're yin and yang, yet it works so well. He's very much like Ron, the extroverted ball of fun that's also kinda dopey but loyal to a fault, struggling to make his own path yet never seeing the admiration of the people who watch him blaze that trial. Meanwhile, I'm much more like Hermione, the quiet bookworm with a constant nagging fear that I'll never fit in to the places I go. He pulls me out of that fog, sets me straight, while I keep him tethered to the ground just so that he doesn't inflate himself too much and float away. I'm the thinker, he's the doer - he's brawn and I'm brains, but when it comes down to it, we'll be okay if we've gotta switch things up, too.

Don't tell me that relationship doesn't work, because the two of us are living proof that it does.

Full disclosure: Ron/Hermione is my single favorite pairing from this series, so I've got a bias in this argument.
