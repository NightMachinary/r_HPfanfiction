I don't really hate the epilogue as much as don't particularly care about it (I'm not the person you replied to, by the way), but I think it's this /combined with everything else/ that makes it substandard compared to the overall level of the books.

There's many bits and pieces in the epilogue, the one with confounding the examiner included, that together all scream “nope, not a single damn bit of character development for anyone, hah!” to the reader. And considering that this series can be construed as a “coming of age” story, that kind of epilogue to it is ... kind of pathetic, to be honest, and probably left many a reader thinking “J.K.Rowling could have done /a lot/ better”.

So, I guess it all boils down to the words “wasted potential”. I won't touch the issue of pairings since I don't particularly care about those in stories and it's not like people writing pairing-centred stories care about sticking to canon (for the most part), but it's probably similar for that one.
