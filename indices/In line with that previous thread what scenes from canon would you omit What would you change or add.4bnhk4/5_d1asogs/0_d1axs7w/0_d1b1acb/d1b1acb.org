As lovers of fan fiction, we're all speculators and wonderers. I remember that in the weeks preceding a new books release, my family and I had a piece of paper taped to the refrigerator door that we would write our ideas about the next book on, from the silly (Dumbledore is a dragon animagus) to the sentimental (Hermione and Ron finally get together) to the hotly debated (Snape is a good guy).

While the end of the series was inevitably going to bring an end to some paths of speculation (how will Harry beat Voldemort? is Harry going to live?), the epilogue killed off any chance of things ever changing. You could want Hermione and Neville to end up together, let's say, and while they're not after Voldemort is finally defeated, there's still the rest of eternity for their relationship to play out. What the epilogue does is say that, twenty years on, they're still not together, it's not going to happen, that's not something that you get to speculate about. Dig? Along with pottermore and her various interviews, its one of the main ways I think JK mishandled her fandom-- she should be leaving Harry Potter in the hands and minds and hearts of her fans, and the epilogue she does the opposite. She says: you don't get to speculate about this. You don't get to wonder. You're wrong.

And so while I think the epilogue serves a narrative function in showing Harry's progression from having no family to having a huge one, that's ultimately why I don't like it. To me, it's a symbol of how JK wasn't willing to let go.
