I think it's more about the fact that had it not been for Dumbledore Hagrid would have just been thrown away into the wilderness with his memory wiped or sent to Azkaban until the end of time or so. Considering that Hogwarts was a home of a kind for Hagrid and that magic was the one thing that allowed him to be a part of some kind of society, someone else than just a savage, that's one heck of a reason to be loyal to someone, you know.
