More seriously, I'd edit the earlier volumes to integrate important worldbuilding elements that JKR didn't develop until later in the writing process (Death Eaters, Unforgivables, Beedle the Bard, &c). There's no way Harry should have to ask what a DE is by /Goblet of Fire,/ and /Deathly Hallows/ might be a lot more effective if more of the answers had been right under their noses the entire time.
