A mass murderer who was believed to be the right hand of Voldemort. Third year would actually be the most likely for Harry to go on a learning spree but what does he learn instead? Divination and the Patronus Charm. Granted, one of those proved quite useful, but not once during the series do we see Harry voluntarily seeking out information on his enemies.
