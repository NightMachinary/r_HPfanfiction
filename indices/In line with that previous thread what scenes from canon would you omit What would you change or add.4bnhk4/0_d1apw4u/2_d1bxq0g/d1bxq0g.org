God, I'd excise that in a hot second.

The book would've been better served by ending it at the previous chapter. I could rant all day, but I'll just save some time and sanity and say that the epilogue feels as if it was written well before the darker, more mature tone the books took around /Goblet of Fire/. It's a tonal mismatch that rings false for me.
