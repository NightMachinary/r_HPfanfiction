I hate that she put a limiter on the series by sticking a this-is-where-the-gang-will-be. On the other hand, I'm genuinely interested in where she saw the themes of her book going. The way I would have loved it would be if she phrased everything past year seven as "this is my opinion, I would like to have seen Harry marry Ginny and that he had three kids, etc."
