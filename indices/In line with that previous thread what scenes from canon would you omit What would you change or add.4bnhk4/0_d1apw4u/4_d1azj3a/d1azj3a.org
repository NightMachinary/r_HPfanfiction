Indeed, the "Crapilogue" would be out the door ASAP (and none of the trio would marry each other and Harry would not fall for the "I have a bad crush and a Harry Potter Shrine"-fangirl, nope, he'd finally free himself from depending on his friends, Dumbledore's lingering influence and his upbringing by the Dursleys...Hell, maybe there would be no Epilogue of any kind, so that everybody can imagine what they want about Harry's future!)
