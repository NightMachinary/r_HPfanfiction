Take out Ron speaking limited Parseltongue. While it made for a funny line in the movie ("he talks in his sleep") and maybe it leaves room for "normal people understanding even 'evil snakes'" or something, I think the whole notion of Parseltongue being a genetic magical language was ruined by it being learnable.

Also omit the scene where MadEye saw through Harry's invisibility cloak.
