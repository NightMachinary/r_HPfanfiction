I'd replace books 4-7 completely, and either keep the children's book tone, or replace the plot with something more plausible, and less "everyone gets the idiot ball, the plot needs this" stuff.

At the very least though: A real Happy Ending. With far, far more Evil scumbags dead, and more good guys alive. All the shit that made Harry's life hell in the series should be dealt with.
