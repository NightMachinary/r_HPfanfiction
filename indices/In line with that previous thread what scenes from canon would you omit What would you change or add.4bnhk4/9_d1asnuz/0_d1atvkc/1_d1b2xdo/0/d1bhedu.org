Sorry, that last bit should have read 'until the final battle.'

I base my interpretation off of the line:

#+begin_quote
  either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives
#+end_quote

It seemed to me that JKR was building up for a final, monumental battle and until then, Harry & TMR were insulated from any lasting harm.
