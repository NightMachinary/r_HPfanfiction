I would've liked it if the prophecy had been completely and utterly misinterpreted. Change the wording a bit to make it more vague and give Neville a crowning moment of awesome in defeating V (and Bellatrix).

But yeah the prophecy is disappointing because of how clich√© it is. And it presents a major problem for fan fiction - dealing with prophecy inevitably invites a conversation about free will, etc. that can get old after too many reads. Same with the mcguffin-horcruxes: they were a plot device in canon that often get poor treatment in fanfiction.
