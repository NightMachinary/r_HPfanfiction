I don't really think it gave them plot armor. Maybe the illusion of it? Anyone could have killed Harry. Anyone (armed with the right information and tools for destroying horcruxes) could have killed Voldemort. The prophecy just set a specific series of events into motion.

Were Harry to end up getting killed (say in GoF for fun) that's one chunk of his soul gone, Dumbledore was already suspicious and suspecting horcruxes for a while, the last Horcrux had already been created (Nagini). Harry getting killed in GoF would technically be at Voldemort's hand, even if it was before the graveyard, because Barty was acting as an instrument of Voldemort. Thus fulfilling the prophecy.

Looking for different interpretations gets rid of the tiny little box the prophecy ended up creating, because it certainly /did/ do so in canon.

I'd probably modify the 'big reveal' to make it clear that Harry was still very mortal, and that prophecies are up for interpretation. Maybe give an example of one that was fulfilled by a very loose interpretation.
