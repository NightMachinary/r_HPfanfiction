- Exchange the Horcrux hunt with a war-story.

- Remove Harry's relationship with Ginny and use the words freed up for something (not someone) else.

- Remove the Epilogue - its not needed.

- Remove the Horcruxes - maybe use the Ring of Death as the artefact Voldemort uses to remain in the world.

- Add Wandlore (especially Wand-Alliances) during the course of the books, not as a cheap last-minute worldbuild in the last book. (If needed after before mentioned changes)

- Add a bit more flesh to the world in general

edit: I have no idea why I get downvoted...
