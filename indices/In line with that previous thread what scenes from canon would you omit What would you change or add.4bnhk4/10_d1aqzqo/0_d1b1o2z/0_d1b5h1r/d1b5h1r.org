Then just change the plot-device. It always had been a bit of a pet peeve for me that the Horcrux hunt is, in the end, a Fetch-Quest in an MMO. Collect and Destroy 7 Horcuxes.

Sure the story around it was good/okay - depending on whom you ask - but as I've written in my first point, I'd rather see a war-story with the Order infiltrating, sabotaging, entreching and all in all going full on freedom-fighters.
