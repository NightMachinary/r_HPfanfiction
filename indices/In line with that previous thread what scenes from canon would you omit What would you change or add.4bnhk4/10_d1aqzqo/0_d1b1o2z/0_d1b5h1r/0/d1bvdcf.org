Eh, I think horcruxes as a plot device aren't bad, to be honest. Instead, it's that they are used wrongly.

I mean, there was the diary, which clearly did /something/, even if over a long period of time, whereas the rest of the trinkets just “are” and “increase misery” ... oh, right, and the locket “increased Umbridge's dark affinity” because the one thing the series needed was more nonsense gibberish ... not.

Had all the items worked more visibly, like the diary, the story itself could have been much better. Also, don't have Harry be a horcrux, because it doesn't make that much sense (make him a faux horcrux and play it for the red herring stamp); I mean, considering the whole “sacrifice” thing Harry does, for as long as Rowling though to foreshadow that Harry could survive at least a book back (yeah, I know, she didn't), there would be no need for him to have been a horcrux there.
