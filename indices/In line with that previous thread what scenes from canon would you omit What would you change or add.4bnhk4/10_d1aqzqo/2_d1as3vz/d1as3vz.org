I always had this theory that JK originally had Ginny slipping Harry love potions.

There is a line or two where it says Harry has this sudden uncontrollable fire in his gut, specifically when he sees Ginny kissing Dean. We are lead to believe it's just jealousy, but I never understood it. Harry never looked twice at Ginny, what's he got to be jealous about?

I always thought that line was a carry over from the effects that the love potion was having on him.
