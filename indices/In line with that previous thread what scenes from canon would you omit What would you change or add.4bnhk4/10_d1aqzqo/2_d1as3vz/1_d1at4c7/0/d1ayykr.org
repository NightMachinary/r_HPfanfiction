I thought that was about differentiating the real from the false. The theme worked with Slughorn having a fake memory covering up a real one. Dumbledore was revealing the truth to Harry. The love potions were meant to be an example of false love. Dig deeper and you figure out it's rooted in an enchantment. Dig deeper into Ron/Lavender, and they're rooted in lust. Harry convinced himself he just had overprotective brotherly feelings for Ginny. That was a falsehood.

Ron/Lavender and Ginny/Dean broke up the same night Harry was getting the true memory from Slughorn. Harry finds out what his task is (horcruxes,) and he and Ginny get together in the very next chapter. Love potions were a falsehood, while Harry/Ginny was the uncovered truth.
