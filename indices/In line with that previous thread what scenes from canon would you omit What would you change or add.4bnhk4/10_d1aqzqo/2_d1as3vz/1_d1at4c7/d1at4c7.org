While it is weird that it happens so spontaneously, I highly doubt that Rowling would even consider this. Its just not how she thinks and writes, imo. But the whole thing seems so forced that I would erase it completely, hence why I wrote what I wrote.

I think it also doesn't help that we get introduced over and over to love potions in this particular year. Once in WWW, once in Slughorns lessons and once when Romilda tries to get Harry with it and Ron springs the trap.
