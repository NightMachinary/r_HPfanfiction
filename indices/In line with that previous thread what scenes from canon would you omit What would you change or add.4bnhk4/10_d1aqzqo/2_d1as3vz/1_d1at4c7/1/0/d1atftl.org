It seems a lot like the build-up to something that in the end didn't make the cut. Maybe love-potions played a bigger role in her first draft? I don't know and can only speculate, but it seems a bit overkill, especially when we see other explanations for things that happen, to introduce love-potions so often just for the Ron incident and to give context to Meropes doings.
