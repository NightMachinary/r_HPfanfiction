I thought that as well, I mean we don't learn much about Harry's type of women, but Ginny looks nothing like Cho who Harry had a crush on and a short relationship (hell, she looks disturbingly like his mother!) and really, he didn't look twice at her!

Sadly this has been used in Fanon too often, so people don't take you seriously when you say that (they say: Oh look another of those idiots and down-vote you!)
