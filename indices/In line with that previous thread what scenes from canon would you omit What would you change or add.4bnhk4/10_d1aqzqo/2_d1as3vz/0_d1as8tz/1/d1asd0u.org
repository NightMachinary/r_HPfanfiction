It's just a theory! A lot goes on when writing a series as vast as Harry Potter, and I'm pretty sure JK has said she +didn't originally plan for Harry to be with Ginny.+ Stands to reason there could have been a scraped plot line to get Ginny out of the picture.

Edit: Confused it with her saying she should have put Harry with Hermione.
