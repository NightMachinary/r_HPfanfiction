The edit's not totally correct, either. The Wonderland interview between JKR and Watson is one of the most annoying things in the fandom because everyone is so biased about it. HHr shippers misquote JKR and take it as gospel that Harry and Hermione should have gotten together, and RHr shippers clamp their hands over their ears shouting about how JKR was misquoted, and, in doing so, /also/ misquote her to make her comments on RHr look more mild.

All JKR said about HHr is that in some ways they work together better than RHr. Other than that, she studiously avoided any HHr questions and later clarified that Ginny was still the best choice for Harry. The major crux of the Wonderland interview, from what I recall, was that JKR said something to the effect of RHr being fundamentally incompatible, which means that they likely wouldn't have worked out in the long run (or, at least, not without counseling). But there's no real endorsement of HHr over RHr, nor an admission that she should have put Harry and Hermione together, but it was an admission that RHr is an unrealistic pairing that Jo chose for her own personal wish-fulfillment.
