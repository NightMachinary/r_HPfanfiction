A lot of people misunderstood it, because Harmony shippers took it WAY out of context. Like said above, it was H/Hr /may have been better in some ways/ than R/Hr; but Rowling has literally said H/G are confirmed soulmates and Ginny had been written to be the final love interest since the very beginning (with a brief interlude for the Cho crush). In one interview, she actually implied that she thinks H/Hr shipping is 'delusional' (the interviewers' word, although Rowling didn't contradict it).

If you actually look at the books carefully it would be very difficult to try canonically pairing H/Hr over H/G with the way they're written; people were able to accurately predict the H/G pairing in OotP and R/Hr by GoF (with surprising amounts of evidence from the first three books actually). The movies on the other hand, definitely insinuated H/Hr throughout, and combined with the hero-gets-the-female-lead cliche, many people ended up thinking H/Hr was going to happen (including me!).
