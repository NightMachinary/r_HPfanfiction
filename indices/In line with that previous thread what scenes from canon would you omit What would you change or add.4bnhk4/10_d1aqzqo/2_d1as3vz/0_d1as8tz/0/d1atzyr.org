I understand your frustration, but JKR did treat free will quite casually throughout the series.

As early as PA, Hermione and Ginny were giggling as Molly told them about a love potion she had tried to brew in her youth. Presumably, the Weasley twins still sold Amortentia-based products out of their shop after TMR's defeat. That's terrifying.
