Whole “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Nineteen Years and Beyond]]” series by Northumbrian is about family, and there are some explicit pregnancy and birth stories.

But there are some more stories where Harry as a parent has a significant role:

2. “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]]” series, where there is a very different Harry from what I expected, but very well written ineed.

3. linkao3(Raindrops on Roses by backinyourbox) ... Harry and Ginny are very much in the background, but I love their parenting very much.
