Alchemy. True transmutation, not a mere magical shell. An ability, long honed by decades of study, to look at a thing, or a magic, and perfectly understand what it is, where it came from, and what it can become.\\
Albus Dumbledore is a master of alchemy, but more importantly, he is a master of the alchemist's mindset; visualising the flow of magic, shaping the environment to deprive his opponents of the opportunity to use their most powerful spells, bewitching entire battlefields to act according to his whim.

Horcruxes. The gateway to the darkest magic. To store a sliver of soul inside a receptacle and experiment upon it, twisting it into a corrupt shard that can channel the most abominable and destructive of energies, magicks that would horrifically burn a healthy soul.\\
Voldemort has created not one, but six Horcruxes, channelling vile power through each to perform horrible mockeries of traditional rituals; brainwashing innocents and warping animals into heartless fiends, laying curses and carving wounds that never heal, spreading poison across the land, and warping time, fate and fortune itself.

Love. Compassion, courage, adoration. A mighty force for all its intangibility, true love can drive a being to rise and prevail against insurmountable odds, provide determination enough to withstand any bewitchment, from the Dementor's cold to the Imperius's control.\\
Harry Potter's heart is filled with love; despite the Dursleys' neglect, his being swells with unconditional empathy for all those around him. His inclination to benevolence is such that it resonates with the magic around him, answering his kind heart with kindness in turn, hostile curses refusing to do him harm and his own spells flying strong and sure.

A man who fights with learned wisdom, shaping the world with a gentle hand to serve his needs.\\
A monster who fights with sheer power, tearing the world apart with his alien, twisted magic that is so antithetical to life.\\
