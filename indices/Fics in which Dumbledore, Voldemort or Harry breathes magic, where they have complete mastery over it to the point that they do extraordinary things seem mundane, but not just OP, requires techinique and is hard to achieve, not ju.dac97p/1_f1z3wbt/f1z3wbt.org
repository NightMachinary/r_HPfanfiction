This is somewhat the idea behind linkffn(Mind Arts)

Harry has a natural talent for mental magic that grows over the series but also begins to specialize. He starts by trying to replicate a dementor's decaying effect before branching out in to other areas: trying to control elements like the various magical creatures.

Similarly Dumbledore admits to specializing in magical artifacts, Grindewald mentions conjuration and space manipulation, and Voldemort shows to be a master of rituals by experimenting on Barth Crouch. There's even an OC villain who can control metals.
