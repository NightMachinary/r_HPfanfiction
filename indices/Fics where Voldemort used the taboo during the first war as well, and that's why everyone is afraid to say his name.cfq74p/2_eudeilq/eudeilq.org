I don't have a fic but one explaination is that during the first war, anyone who said Voldemort was targeted with their family. Anyone publicly going against them, they and their families are targeted. People are less likely to want to risk their families lives than their own for what they do after all. I don't remember the fic where I saw it but Harry told Arthur the fear of a name thing and he responded with the terror of saying it and coming home to the dark mark. After all people didn't know who was and wasn't a supporter/fake/imperiousd.
