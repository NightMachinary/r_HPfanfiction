Voldemort was to separate himself from his muggle roots and he likely targeted people who said his name as a scare tactic. He became a monster instead of a person. Because people can be killed but monsters are much worse I guess. Also it could be an attempt to be called the dark lord. Also just think, people would think “people saying his name let alone opposing him gets them and their family killed”. His numbers were likely much smaller than the population so he was winning by making people too scared to fight back.
