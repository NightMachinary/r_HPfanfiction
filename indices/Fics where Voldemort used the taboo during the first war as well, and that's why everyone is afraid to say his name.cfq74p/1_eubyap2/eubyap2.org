There's a wee bit about this buried about halfway through [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2290003/1/Pet-Project][Pet Project]]. It was something like, the original first-reign taboo (still in effect) was simply that Voldemort could tell when his name was spoken in proximity to a Dark Mark, and since you never knew who had one, you just didn't say it.

The poignant bit in the story was Hermione's horror that Dumbledore says it on purpose around Snape simply as a /taunt/. And then the second time I read the fic I realized there's strategic places where Dumbledore says Tom instead of Voldemort, like during the summer, which when Snape tells the Dark Lord that he doesn't have as much access to Dumbledore. It's just another detail in the story that gives us more character building for Hermione, Snape, and Dumbledore, but I spoiler-tagged it because I enjoyed reading it not knowing it was coming.

I like this fic for all the ways it extends canon magic. House elves, arithmancy, the sheets (!), the affinity, and probably some I've forgotten.
