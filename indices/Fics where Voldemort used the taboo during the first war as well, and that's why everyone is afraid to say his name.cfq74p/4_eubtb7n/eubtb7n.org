I have seen this sometimes, but beyond using it for bait, it's mostly only mentioned in Dumbledore bashing fics, as he wants Harry in trouble and all that shit. Of course no one bothers explaining the taboo to muggleborns or muggle raised, so they also get rounded up often very easily.

Sadly I can't remember the name of any specific fic, since this isn't all that remarkable.
