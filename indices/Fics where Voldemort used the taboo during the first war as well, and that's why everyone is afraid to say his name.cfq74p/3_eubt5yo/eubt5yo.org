In linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) Dumbledore tried to promote calling him Voldemort just because he wanted to avoid the renewal of the taboo which existed during the first war (if everybody called him Voldemort the power of taboo would be effectively broken). Unfortunately, he failed, because not enough people stopped call him You-Know-Who and similar nonsense.
