I am so incredibly glad you shared this because The Accidental Animagus is actually the fic that inspired this post. I'm currently reading it and am only at the start of second year. They've already had Harry making a big deal about saying the name a couple times (references to not being scared of Hitler's name, Harry saying it over and over in the Great Hall while everyone flinched, etc), and there's been a lot of implication that muggles are better than wizards (which I'm not usually a big fan of), and then this passage just rubbed me the wrong way:

”Voldemort. That's You-Know-Who's name. Some of us aren't afraid to say it.”

“Wow, that's really brave,” Colin said in awe.

“No, it's common sense,” Harry told him. “I was raised in the muggle world, too. Out there, I'm just a normal kid, like you.” He motioned vaguely out behind him. “You know that no one's scared of names out there, the same as I do, and you shouldn't be scared in here, either.”

“Huh, I guess not. I figured it was some kind of magic name or something.”

“No, it's just people being scared.”

It made me crave a fic that mentioned that there actually is magic attached to the name. I'm glad you commented because that tells me that things aren't quite as they seem and Harry is just thinking that he knows it all based on the knowledge he has, which is realistic.

EDIT: tried to err on the side of caution and black out everything, but it doesn't seem to be working.
