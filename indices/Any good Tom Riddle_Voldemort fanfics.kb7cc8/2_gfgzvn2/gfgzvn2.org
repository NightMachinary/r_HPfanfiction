My heart is a fist of barbed wire linkao3(18224369) starts in the orphanage, where Tom is not the only magical child. There's a sequel in progress, which may not have been necessary, but Barbed Wire is a must-read.

I'll second [[/u/RookRider][u/RookRider]]'s recommendation of In The Bleak Midwinter, which hasn't updated in almost a year.

Ouroboros linkao3(24476011) is a Voldemort raises himself fic which is also quite good. Recently updated.

There Is Nothing To Fear linkao3(15449145) is a Gryffindor Voldemort. Well-written and updates fairly frequently.

Twelve Dark Moons linkffn(3037156) is Voldemort/Luna, and focuses on the latter. Contains sexual violence.
