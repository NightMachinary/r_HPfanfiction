  "Now I have three heads: one for speech, one for sex, and one for second guessing." - Analicia Sotelo. 'South Texas Persephone'.Her door clicks open and nearly clips her in the face. It could be a sudden draft, but Amy is doubtful. Her fist clenches shut around the marble. It is pretty. She could look at it for hours, the way it catches the light. It's almost like a sweet. Want curls up in her chest like a cat. She thinks she'll keep it. A gift from the big grey orphanage, just to her.“That's mine,” comes a thin, cold voice, and she sees the boy across the hall for the first time. His room is directly across from hers. He is pretty, she thinks, like a drawing from a book. The lines of his face are smooth and pale. His hair is dark and neatly parted. He holds himself very rigidly, like a miniature soldier or a wind-up toy. “That's mine,” he repeats, sharply.(In which Tom Riddle is not the only strange child to come out of Wool's.)

  A strange man adopts Tom Riddle and it is not his father, as Tom desperately wants to believe. Stranded in the past, Voldemort once again comes to the conclusion he's the only one he truly needs.
