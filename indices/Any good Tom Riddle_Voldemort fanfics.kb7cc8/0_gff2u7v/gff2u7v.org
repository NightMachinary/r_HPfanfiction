1)That Glorious Strength Lomonaaeren Summary: Instead of becoming Voldemort, Tom Riddle established a school of “secondary importance” for Muggleborns, half-bloods, and Squibs. Since the school frees Hogwarts to continue drifting more towards the purebloods' whims and wishes, they haven't raised any large fuss. Besides, everyone knows that half-bloods and Muggleborns don't have any real power. Just look at Riddle, who had ambitions that outpaced his magical strength. They don't see the revolution coalescing under the surface.

2) Boy Who Lived » Not even the birth of her son could compel Merope to continue living after her husband's abandonment, but the green-eyed stranger sitting by her deathbed, cradling her squalling babe, proves to be an unexpected savior. Time Travel. Rare Pair: HarryxMerope

This story begins Merope and Harry-centric, but migrates toward Tom and Harry as the story progresses. Don't expect an angelic, lovely Tom; just because he has parents doesn't mean that he isn't prone to screwing up or having serious emotional issues. People will die. ... Eventually.
