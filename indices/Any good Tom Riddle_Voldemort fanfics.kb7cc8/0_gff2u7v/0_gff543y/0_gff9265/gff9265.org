Ok then I would like to recommend these fics too because although they might contain more romantic elements they are nonetheless a good rendition of Tom's character.

1) Hail and Snow by Runic Healer In the dreary old orphanage of Wool's, Tom is alone and will always be. Two-shot, pre-slash TMR/HP. Harry Potter, K+, English, Hurt/Comfort (underrated story) ‚ÄúAnd when Voldemort possesses the boy, and Harry remembers love, Tom cries, because for that one moment, he pretends it is for him, and it is okay.‚Äù

2) Remembrance by Ancalyme Voldemort remembers. Set in the distant, indefinite future veeery slight HPLV (underrated one shot. It resonated with me for a very long time) Voldemort reflects on the life he lead

3) October ¬ª It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux. AU, time travel, Death!Harry, Tom/Lily and Tom/Harry, not threesome The beginning of the story starts like this:

‚ÄúTom Riddle first met Death on the train to Hogwarts, although he did not know it at the time.‚Äù Words: 209k+,

4) When Harry Met Tom ¬ª When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry

I like this story because you see the gradual shift of Tom disassociating himself from the persona he calls Voldemort.

5)üíïüíï The most romantic heart warming yet still in character story

To Kill You With a Kiss Summary: After Dumbledore's death, Harry searches for answers in the Pensieve. But something goes wrong. Trapped inside a memory, Harry finds himself back at Hogwarts in 1945 where he meets an 18 year old Tom Riddle teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts.

6) Little Prince on B612 Run_of_the_mill

Summary:

In the back of Knockturn Alley, there is a small Apothecary where Tom meets a mysterious young man who draws him a tiny sheep in a crate with three little holes. Tom takes it home.

Does this mean Tom is no longer a dull, drab, adult?

A/N: This isn't a retelling of the Little Prince. It's simply the story of two people who read and loved the Little Prince and allowed themselves to be influenced by it.
