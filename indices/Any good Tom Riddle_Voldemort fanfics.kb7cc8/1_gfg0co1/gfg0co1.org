/Last Lord of the Sun/ by Lomonaaeren linkao3(11486688) - Dumbledore finds a mal-adjusted kid in Wool's Orphanage and decides to try helping the kid instead of setting his things on fire.

/A Mentor's Burden/ by Naidhe linkao3(18394745) - if Dumbledore is powerful and he sets other people's things on fire, then if Tom wants to be powerful he should _____?

/If Them's The Rules/ by MayMarlow linkao3(284278) - Harry decides to raise Tom right. I really like this one because it doesn't downplay the fact that Tom's mentally disturbed but still shows him as capable of moral behavior. Off the top of my head, there's a scene from Tom's POV where he wonders what would happen if he poked out Harry's eye with a stick, but resists the impulse because he doesn't want Harry to stop giving him a home. A messed up kid who nonetheless learns to make good decisions.

/In the Bleak Midwinter/ by TheLoud linkao3(15430560) - Hermione time travels to bring newborn Tom to his father's family. Tom Sr. decides that his son deserves the best and sets out to transition the Riddle family from Muggle nobility to Wizarding nobility - yes, even though he's a Muggle.

/Anonymous Letters/ by JayGwen23 linkao3(18707485) - Harry gets letters from his soul mate! Which is great, until he realizes that the spell is sending the letters across time as well as space.

/You Asked If I Were Happy/ by local_doom_void linkao3(22008067) - Tom decides that all that dark lord hoopla was too much trouble. Let "Voldemort" stay dead, Tom's going back to his original dream of teaching DADA. How hard can it be to avoid 12yo Harry Potter?
