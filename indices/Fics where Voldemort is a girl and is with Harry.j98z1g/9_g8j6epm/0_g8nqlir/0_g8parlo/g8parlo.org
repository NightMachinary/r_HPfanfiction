Reposting my old comment because I hated how slow it is more than anything in this fic.

  Riddle says hello.

  A jolt goes through Harry, and he drops his book, attracting the attention of nearby students. He finds Riddle standing a hair's breadth away, grazing his legs with her skirt, and recoils in shock. She tilts her head with an inscrutable smile and a wicked gleam in her eye, and he flushes in embarrassment. Blah blah blah, three paragraphs of introspection and sweating.

  Harry finally asks her what she wants.

  Her eyes narrow as if he just told the most amusing joke, and his breath hitches as he feels as if she's peering right into his soul. Blah blah blah, four more paragraphs of dramatic body language descriptions until she speaks again... and I realize I'm 2,000 words into the chapter and so far they literally just exchanged two lines of dialogue.
