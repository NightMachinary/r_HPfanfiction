Gonna leave this comment for posterity.

First of all, this fic is /creepy/. And not in a good way. There was nothing compelling about the story, just a slow simmer of nausea growing as I read. The only thing that kept me going was curiosity about the ending and the general lack of Harry/female Tom stories.

Harry is characterized almost as a complete buffoon. Literally a simpleton.

Like 40% of the story is unnecessary exposition and could be cut with no real difference to the "plot". /Purple/ exposition at that, full of flowery adverbs and thesaurus-inspired descriptions.

Finally, in the story tags you get: *Rape/Non-con Elements*. It's not elements bruh. From the moment the "smut" starts to the end of the story, it's straight up *RAPE*. One rape after another. Either by coercion, potions, threat of violence or what have you. If the genders were flipped I doubt this would have 1/10 of the kudos or comments.

To sum up, I award this story no points, and may god have mercy on the author's soul.
