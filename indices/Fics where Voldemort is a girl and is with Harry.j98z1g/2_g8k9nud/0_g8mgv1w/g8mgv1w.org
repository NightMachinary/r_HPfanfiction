Bwoah, I read more weird shit in Xianxa webnovel genre. I think it looks weird because Canonically Harry is still a teenager. Fast forward a decade into a story where Voldemort (firstly is sane) decides to slowly take power as all her powers base is close to the ministry of magic High up in 1995, and you can get a 30 year old harry banging a 100 years old ageless Cougarmort.

I know you need to sketch a ducking lot to get there but people write whatever they want, at least it still is less weird that the fem!harry fictions where Riddle bangs her when she is just 15.
