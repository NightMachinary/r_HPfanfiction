Or Lily could just be talented at Potions. Just because her wand was good for Charms does not mean that Lily could only ever be good at Charms. People have different talents.

Problem with Lily is that we don't really see her at all. Harry doesn't really seem to be very interested in learning about her... it's JAMES he's interested in learning about, so we get a lot more info on James.
