Firstly, Potions is not a wand subject - just because Lily's wand was good for charms does not mean that she was good only in Charms. Harry's wand isn't good at anything in particular, but he's very, very good with Charms. Therefore, the fact that her wand is good with Charms has nothing to do with anything.

Being good at Charms isn't mutually exclusive with being good in Potions or anything else. That's just absurd.

Lily wised up to Snape at the end of their fifth year, and Slughorn taught them both for the next two years, where she relied on her own skill. He wouldn't be full of praise for her if her talent with Potions somehow mysteriously dropped to a "smart but not genius level" after being at "genius level" for the previous five years. He wouldn't say that she was one of the brightest witches he'd ever taught if that was the case.

Lily's also not getting the highest grade possible in her exams with Snape's help either. She does that on her own.

Lily may have studied together with Snape, and he may have helped her initially - but that opens up the possibility that they found out the modifications to the brewing methods together, which means that the intellectual ownership of those modifications is shared between the two of them.
