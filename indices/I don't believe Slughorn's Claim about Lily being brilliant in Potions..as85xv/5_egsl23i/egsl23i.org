Or it was Snape that writes down the things he saw her do...

You know for a genius in potions he never created a new or original potion. He didn't even seem to like the subject he teaches considering that the first thing we learn about him was that every student knew he wanted to teach another subject.

The book was a NEWT potion book (6th and 7th year), now we see the spell levicorpus that is credited to him, already used in the year by James and we learn that it was a very popular spell at that time... So a possible example of him recreating something he saw

Other than that we see Snape claiming other people achievements as his own when in the third year he claimed to have protected the trio from the demeanors and werewolf Remus, when he was unconscious at that time and was protected by Harry and Sirius respectively, but he acted like it was his right to earn a metal for it.

when did Lily ever give any indication that she would claim something as hers that isn't? She would give praise to Snape if it was his to earn. After their friendship, she was still great at potions and she probably wasn't paying him much attention or mind anymore after that fact, with him we know that he was still a bit obsessed with her and he could have easily noticed when she does something other than the descriptions and copied it.

I don't really think that Snape is a copycat in potions, but I think it is as stupid to claim Lily was. That is why I made this list to show that we have more character points for the other way round
