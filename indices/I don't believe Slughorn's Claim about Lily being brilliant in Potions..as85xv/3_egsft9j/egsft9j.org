Yeah but we don't really see any wand getting used for charms other than what, to vanish the contents of a failure. I'd say it's more likely that it's just not a wanded discipline.

Sure, Lily coulda been piggy backing on Snape's efforts- probably was to a degree- the man made a lot of improvements to potions, but she likely had to at least be competent enough to follow them on tests where she was working alone.

Edit: As to her creativity, we never really get an explanation for Harry's survival beyond Lily's sacrifice- and the lightning bolt /does/ look like a 'real' rune called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sowil%C5%8D][Sowil]], "Sun is the light of the world; I bow to the divine decree." seems like something right up Rowlings alley.
