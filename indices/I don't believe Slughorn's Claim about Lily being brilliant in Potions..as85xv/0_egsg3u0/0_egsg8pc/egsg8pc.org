Slughorn basically speaks praise about her creativity and skill in Potions and how he has inherited his mother's aptitude for Potions. This after Harry demonstrates with Snape's knowledge of Potions. There are a number of instances where Rowling uses irony and what is more ironic then mother and son getting praise for the work of another guy.
