People can be good at multiple things. I don't believe there's ever a wand mentioned at being useful for potions so it's a bit of a weak basis for your argument to be honest. Slughorn has all around praise for her talents in potions and there's nothing that really detracts from that.

We don't know if she was on the level of Snape in Potions but as a student she is described as one of the brightest Slughorn ever taught.
