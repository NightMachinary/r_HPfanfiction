The most heart-wrenching example I can think of is linkao3(Blood Crest by Cauchy), where Harry is pressured (by his mentor) into making a horcrux while being sorta-deceived about the full implications (he kills a unicorn, not a human, but we're told this is a moral alternative by a pretty bad dude who lies and obfuscates at other times, so Im not buying it).

The first few chapters are a little rough but it works out.
