I think Harry would wear some suitable clothes. I don't know, maybe a shirt, black pants. Then, on advice from classmates, he would buy some flowers, take her to some store, buy her something, and then go to Madame Pudifoot (I think she was called).

How would a girl wear? I think maybe she would braid a thick braid, wear a blue dress, some elegant but not too much shoes and slightly paint her eyes and lips.
