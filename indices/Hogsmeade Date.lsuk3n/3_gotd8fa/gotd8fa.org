Canon Harry is wearing whatever; his school robes or maybe someone will take pity and doctor up his muggle clothes.

As for the girl, I think it depends, but as a general rule she'd dress up a bit. Some makeup, straighten/curl her hair depending on its original state, and probably a skirt. It's the 90s, so probably jean or corduroy. Someone who was more aware during that time would be able to provide better details.
