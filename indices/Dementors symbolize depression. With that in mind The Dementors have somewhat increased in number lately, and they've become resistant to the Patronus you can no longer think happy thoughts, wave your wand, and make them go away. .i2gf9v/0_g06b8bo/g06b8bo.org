This is a really cool thought. Dementors are quite powerful in that they can make an ordinary person feel despair just by being near them. I've always thought that Dementors are particularly vicious on those who already suffer depression. They feed on emotions of sadness (grief, hurt, loneliness, disappointment, sadness). It makes sense that the "cure" is being around multiple people who can reassure you that they love and support you.
