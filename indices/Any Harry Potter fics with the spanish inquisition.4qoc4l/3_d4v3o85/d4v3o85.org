I'm curious as to how you could ever make a muggle be threatening to a wizard, let alone a muggle from the 15th century.

The Wizarding world doesn't take the muggles seriously at all, the only believable fear I've come across is in HPMOR and Quirrells fear of a nuclear war.

One muggle repelling charm and they'd never even know you where there.
