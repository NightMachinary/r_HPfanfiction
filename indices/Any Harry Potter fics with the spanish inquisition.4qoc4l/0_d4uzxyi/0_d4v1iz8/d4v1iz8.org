Harry was looking at Cedric's corpse, horrified, when he was distracted by a familiar voice shouting, "Nobody expects Voldemort's resurrection!". As he turned around, he found himself pinned to a tombstone by Wormtail. "I've actually been wondering why it didn't happen last year" he muttered,"Should have guessed it was your incompetence".

"Shut up! The Dark Lord will rise again, and you will play your part. Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken... No, wait that comes later. lets not cut you yet."

Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son. blood of the enemy, forcibly taken...no no wait... Flesh of the servant, willingly given, you will revive your master... on second thought it may be better to start over"

"You need some help there Wormtail?"

"Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son."

He dropped the bone into the potion.

"Flesh of the servant, willingly given, you will revive your master."

Wormtail lopped off his hand and let it drop into the potion

"Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken, you will resurrect your foe!"

As Wormtail came towards Harry, Harry, had a rather stupid idea. It was his only idea, so he decided to go ahead with it. "You can have my blood! I willingly give it you, all of it! I'll even jump into the cauldron!" Wormtail stopped in his tracks, looking confused.

"Maybe you could start over with another enemy of Voldemort? Unfortunate that you already killed Cedric though. You have no idea how to finish this Ritual now, do you? "

I don't know how to end this either, first time I've ever written anything.
