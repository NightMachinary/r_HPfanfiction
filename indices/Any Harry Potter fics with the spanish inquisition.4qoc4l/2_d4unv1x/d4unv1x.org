I don't know any off the top of my head, but I am working on a story that has an inquisition that hunts down witches and wizards and anything magical. They use enchanted items made by their leader, who thinks he is the Chosen of God, because his talents manifested in a time of dire need and he thought it to be a miracle. So he's essentially a zealot who hunts down heathens, without realizing that his own powers are magical and not faith-based.
