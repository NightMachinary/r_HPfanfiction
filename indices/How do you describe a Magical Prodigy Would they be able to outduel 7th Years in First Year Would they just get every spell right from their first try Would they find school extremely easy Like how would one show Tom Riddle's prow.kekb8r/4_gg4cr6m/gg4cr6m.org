Different levels

Weasley twins/marauders/Snape: curriculum is mostly easy and boring, the real challenge is in their own projects

Voldemort/ Grindelwald: effortlessly master normal magic and move up to arcane magic that would scare others (horcruxes and whatever it was that got gellert kicked out of durmstrang) Plus Tom had the whole controlled accidental magic thing

Dumbledore doing things with a wand no one has ever seen before.
