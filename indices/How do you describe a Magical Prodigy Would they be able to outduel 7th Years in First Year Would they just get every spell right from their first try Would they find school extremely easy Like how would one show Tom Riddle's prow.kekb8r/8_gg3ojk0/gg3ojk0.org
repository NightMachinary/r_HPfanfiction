I feel like it really depends on your definition of prodigy, or at least, what kind are they? Like you can have someone who's amazingly book smart but is terrible with people skills. Or they're Fantastic at quidditch but can hardly get through charms. Another thing to keep in mind is that being smart isn't a replacement for wisdom/years lived. I'd say that they wouldn't be able to outduel a 7th year, but they'd maybe know more spells than the average first year and could pick them up more quickly. Not necessarily on the first try, but once they got the feel for certain types of spells it wouldn't take nearly as long to learn them. Maybe they're able to grasp at their magic a lot more intuitively than others their age. And as for finding school easy, maybe? I wouldn't call myself a prodigy but I was in the "gifted program" growing up, and while I picked up on things quickly I struggled with getting my homework done on time and so my grades were more average even though I tested well

And, once I reread your question I realized you were asking about Tom riddle. I didn't have him in mind when answering, but I hope this still helps!
