When it comes to magical knowledge, Hermione is foremost among Harry's generation. But throughout canon, we consistently see Harry perform the spells that take the most raw power (imperius, cruciatus, patronus in y3, long distance summoning charm). Dumbledore is an example of the combination of the 2, incredibly intelligent with a drive to learn and no power bottleneck.
