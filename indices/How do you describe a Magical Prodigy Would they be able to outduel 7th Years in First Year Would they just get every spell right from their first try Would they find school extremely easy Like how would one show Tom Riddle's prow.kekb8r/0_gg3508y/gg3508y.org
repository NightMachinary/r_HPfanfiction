For a canon-esque feel, I tend to imagine it based on my own school experience. You'll know the smart ones by how easily they understand things, they may look bored after a fashion. They're the type everyone knows; ‘never study but ace the exam types' or at least you never see them study, which means they are efficient. For a canon reference, this is how I interpret James Potter, Sirius Black and probably the twins. I went to school with a lot of these people.

There are also the smart ones that ‘fly under the radar'. Not the ridiculous ‘I've got to hide my intelligence to not draw attention to myself' I've seen in fanfic, which does not make any sense, example, Tom Riddle flew under the radar by playing a ‘perfect' façade, which is practically more effective than ‘hiding'. I digress; These smart ones are the ones that put themselves on the sidelines but maintains high marks, they just either don't get involved eith other things, are introverted or a ‘loner'. A canonical interpretation would be Snape, or at least how I imagine he was.

There's the legitimate geniuses, like Albus ‘Did things with a wand, I'd never seen before' Dumbledore, the ones who could go anywhere and do anything and likely already have. Tom Riddle would also fit into this category.

The key link between these three categories, is that they make whatever they do, look effortless. That is the mark of a prodigy, because the ‘basics' are so far beneath their notice.

There is then what I would call the ‘lesser smart' people. People like Hermione and to an extent Harry and Ron, whom I think realistically would have done better than we're shown. I put Hermione here, because she's ‘book-smart and for the amount of effort and she feels she needs to put in. She doesn't make it look effortless.
