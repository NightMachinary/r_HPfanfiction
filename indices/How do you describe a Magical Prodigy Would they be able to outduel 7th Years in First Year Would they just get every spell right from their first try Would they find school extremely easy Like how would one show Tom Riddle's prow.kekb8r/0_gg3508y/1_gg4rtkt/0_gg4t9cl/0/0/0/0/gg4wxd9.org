However then you get into the fallacy that an exam, especially one like the OWL or NEWT is an accurate guideline for intelligence, which it isn't really. Yes, intelligent people will tend to do well on exams but it's not always the case. Personally, I got the impression, that the Twins failed because they weren't interested in what the school was teaching. In Half-Blood Prince, I believe that Hermione even remarks that their patented daydream charms are a piece of â€˜extraordinary' magic.
