The "make it look effortless" heuristic is an interesting one, but Hermione is a weird case in which just because it doesn't look effortless doesn't mean that it isn't (relatively) effortless. This is because she is a workaholic who studies far past the point of diminishing returns but doesn't have the insight to realise it, and seeks validation from adults and formal examinations.

Contrast that attitude with that of the Weasley Twins (who, contrary to what you wrote, actually earned only 3 OWLs each): they have their goal (joke shop), and so they put in massive amounts of effort towards it, while pretty much ignoring everything else, including (and especially) what the grown-ups want.
