depends on what type of prodigy, is it a generational one like Hermione James Sirius and Snape, or is it a exceptional one like Geller Albus and Tom. The former will maybe be a year ahead in their 4th year, eg Hermione doing owl level work in year 4.

Tom Albus and Gellert, in the magic they are interested in, could probably take their newts and ace them as of their 4th or 5th year, depending on their work ethic, they are that much above the ordinary wizards aswell as regular prodigies
