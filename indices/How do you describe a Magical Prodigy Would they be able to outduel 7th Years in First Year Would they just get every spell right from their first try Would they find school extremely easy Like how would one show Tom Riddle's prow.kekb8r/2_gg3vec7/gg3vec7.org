The dueling aspect of your question intrigues me. I think about defeating a 7th year in terms of basketball. Could an 11 year old LeBron James beat an average 17 year old in a game of one-on-one? Maybe? I think a lot would depend on his physical development up to that point. The first whispers of real talent would be there, but the physical gap could be too great. Him at 12 or 13, with time to grow? He's beating the vast majority of older kids. At 17 he's destroying all but maybe the elite of the elite.

The fic Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos does a really good job of following this same mentality. Harry is recognized as a prodigy in the story (and is shown to be one through multiple strong examples - kudos to the author), but as a first year he gets absolutely worked in duels with older kids. As he goes on though, and he puts in incredible amounts of effort, you start to see him get a leg up on people he really has no business beating. It's well done, and you can believably look at Harry at his current age in the story (second year) and know that when he's a seventh year he will have no peer, and in fact be one of the greatest to come through the school.
