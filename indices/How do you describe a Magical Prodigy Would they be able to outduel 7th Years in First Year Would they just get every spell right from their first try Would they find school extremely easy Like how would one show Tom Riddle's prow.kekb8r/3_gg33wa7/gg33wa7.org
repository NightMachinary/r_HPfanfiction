To me, it would be knowledge beyond that of a first year, maybe Riddle has already mastered several first charms and spells and has already become knowlegdeable on 2nd and 3rd year spells. Or maybe he has read about several curses and mastered them.

I dont think a 1st year should be able to outduel a 7th year, but maybe them just doing better than expected but still losing would showcase prodigious talent.

If its Riddle then maybe advanced ability in Potions, Charms, and DADA. Portray him as if you're writing an evil Hermione, incredibly smart and knowlegdable but with more of a cunning, charismatic and sinister side to him.
