Depends. AFAIK, prodigies (as opposed to the merely gifted) usually show it from a very young age---definitely before 11. Tom Riddle's conscious and sophisticated control of Accidental Magic marks him as a prodigy, for example.

If the story starts at Hogwarts, I'd probably go with something like early-canon Hermione: first touches a wand in July at the earliest, and figures out how to do all of the first-year spells by September from the books alone, while also memorising a bunch of history books.

After that, though, it depends on the demands of the storyline and the personality and the values of the character.
