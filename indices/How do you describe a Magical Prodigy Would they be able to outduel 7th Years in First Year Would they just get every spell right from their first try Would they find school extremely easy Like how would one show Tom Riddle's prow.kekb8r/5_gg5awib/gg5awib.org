The easiest way to show a characters talent is to compare them to their classmates. It's way too common in fanfiction to see first years casting spells like accio and vanishing objects. Canonically these spells are hard to learn for /upper years,/ which makes it stupid for every single friend of the main character to learn them. Realistically a magical prodigy would be one who easily completes spells their classmates struggle with, while working harder to learn spells above their year.

Then there is the discussion of what degree of talent they have, so I thought it would be fun to make a few categories:

First category: Students that learn all the spells in class during the year and stay top of class. They enjoy learning spells outside of the curriculum and might study OWL-level spells in third-fourth year and occasionally succeed. Studying and being a general bookworm is common in this category. People in this category often become powerful wizards/witches. Examples for this category would be: Hermione Granger, Percy and Bill Weasley.

Second category: Students that intuitively succeed with magic, often on the first try. They are often bored with the curriculum and learn magic outside of the curriculum. These students might learn nonverbal magic in their fifth year or earlier. They learn spells that most would consider impossible for their age. These students can match adult wizards in their later years at Hogwarts, and will become exceptionally powerful adult wizards/witches. Examples: James Potter, Sirius Black and Severus Snape.

Third category: The student will learn a new spell on the first try. Every class is easy and they spend most of their time studying more difficult magic. They could probably ace their OWLs as second or third years. They will learn more about magic before completing Hogwarts than most wizards ever will. They will be remembered in history books for their exceptional talent. Examples: Tom Riddle and Albus Dumbledore.

Now after all this we get the average student. I think fanfiction writers should include more characters with average magical talent, because it will make it easier to put talent into perspective. The average student will have a subject they're particularly good at but will still struggle. They experience the normal school stress about handing in essays and not being able to master spells in time. OWL results would include mostly As and some EEs sprinkled in. Most adult wizards are in this category.
