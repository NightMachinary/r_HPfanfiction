  How do you describe a Magical Prodigy?
#+end_quote

Subtle with the ability to understand magic beyond what's in a book and an imagination that fills in the blanks.

"Doing things with a wand never seen before" or, in other words, performing standard spells in a way the average wizard can't. Dumbledore banished Harry's trunk in Surrey and it was at the burrow in blink. He conjured hundreds of sleeping bags at once. Harry wasn't a prodigy, but his patronus was significantly better than almost everyone else's.

Mastering advanced magic is cool and impressive, but I believe canon makes it clear that's not the (only) mark of an advanced wizard.

  Would they be able to outduel 7th Years in First Year?

No. In fact, they should be as outclassed as any other first year.
