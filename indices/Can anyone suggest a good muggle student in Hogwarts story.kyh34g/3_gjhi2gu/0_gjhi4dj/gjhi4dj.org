  Let's get something clear... I'm a Muggle, I was born a Muggle and I'll die a Muggle.But that doesn't change the fact that somehow I have magic and am attending Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizadry.I've read all the Harry Potter books and seen the movies and now I have to live in the Wizarding World. WIzards are idiots, complete and utter bloody idiots. Who's smart idea is it to use quills and parchment? What's with giving hormone ridden, pubescent, angst-driven teenagers a wand and teaching them how to use, then telling them don't cast hexes at each other? What about sending letters by owls? What if you live in a muggle area? Who thought up Bertie Botts Every Flavour Beans? Vomit, earwax, really?
