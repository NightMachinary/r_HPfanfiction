Sorry for giving such narrow parameters by saying "muggle." Thank you for ignoring those parameters because what I meant was a non-magical person dealing with a magical world and magical classes and magical friends.

Squib, muggle, witch/wizard who lost their magic and don't want to leave Hogwarts because their friends are there. Honestly just anything and everything, as long as MC is non-magical.

It would be nice to have the "wake up as magical" cliche turned on it's head.
