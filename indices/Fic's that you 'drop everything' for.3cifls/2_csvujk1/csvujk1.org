[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10041727/1/The-Ambiguous-Artifice][The Ambiguous Artifice]], 3rd in the series. When I get a update mail for this, I drop everything immediately!

Also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10298096/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Emerald-Trance][Harry Potter and the Emerald Trance]], which has a biweekly set upload schedule. So I suppose I don't drop anything for it, because my schedule is already planned around reading it immediately!
