I really enjoy this one as well, just wish it would be posted faster! I'm a binge reader, and waiting for updates just drives me batty...I know, I know, but really...I can't even do episodic books. I wait until the entire season is done, and then buy them. I don't watch tv (no cable) just wait for it on netflix, and watch it all at once. It's a problem...
