For me that would be a series by Nightfall Rising / Potionpen called [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/55402][The Truth is What I See It Is (subjectiverse)]]. The latest story in the series is Valley of the Shadow, but you really want to start with Album of the SangReal.

  Gryffindor isn't what Slytherin sees in it, and the reverse is way more true than that. Lily Evans doesn't know she looks different depending where you're standing, the Blacks know exactly how they come across and like it that way, and Severus Snape isn't exactly who anyone thinks he is---least of all himself.

  *Canon Compliance*

  It is advised that the reader be familiar with the biography of Harry Potter written by Ms. Rowling. The reader should be aware that this seven-volume series was fact-checked by Ms. Skeeter rather than Miss Granger, and cannot be relied on in the matter of dates. Furthermore, Ms. Rowling's books are written from the point of view of the subject, and not only contain a distinctly pro-Gryffindor bias but largely confine themselves to what Mr. Potter saw, heard, assumed, and speculated.

  This is a Slytherin story, and truth is subjective.
