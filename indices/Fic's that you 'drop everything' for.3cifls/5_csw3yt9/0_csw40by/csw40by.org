  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project.

Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.
