These are interesting, thank you. I already have my set up for most of the arcana though.

•Fool: Igor

•Chariot: Hermione

•Death: Sirius

•Devil: Tonks

•Emperor: Remus

•Empress: Luna

•Hanged: Snape

•Hierophant: Draco

•Moon: Neville

•Priestess: Prof. Trelawney

•Star: Prof. Burbage

•Sun: Parvati

•Temperance: Prof. McGonagall

•Tower: Ginny

•Strength: Ron

•Magician: Prof. Dumbledore

•World: Lilian

I am still looking for characters to fill the: Hermit, Fortune, Lovers, Justice and Judgement Confidants. I think Susan is a good shout for Justice but I think it's also a bit unoriginal and easy so I haven't put her there yet. Though I am considering her as a Persona user. And I did really consider Dumbledore for Death but he really just IS the Magician.
