Really? I never got that. Maybe something got lost cause you jumped to Panic Switch? He knows he's Harry Potter but when Vernon dumps him on the street he starts using the name Henry. He then meets Denny Brooks and starts his life of crime and takes Denny's last name to become Henry Brooks. He also gets connected to the Wesley's and uses the name Christopher so that part of him/his life can be separate. I never got the feeling that there were other personalities or that he was being controlled. Harry always seemed like the puppet master and that everything was Smoke and Mirrors. He has you looking right when crazy stuff is happening to the left.
