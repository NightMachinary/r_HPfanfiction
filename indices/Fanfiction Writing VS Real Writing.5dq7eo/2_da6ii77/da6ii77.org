The latter means I spend a lot of time on world-building. It requires more effort in that regard, so it is not something I can do without mental preparations (so to say), but the very fact that what I am writing is about something /I/ created leaves me with that sense of fulfilment.

That said, if I were to put my notes about the world created and its lore and the basic mechanics of how certain important for it things work, I'd get another book out of it, and not just a thin booklet at that.

PS. I'd change “real” to “original”, as it's quite a commonly used way to refer to stories that fully originate from their authors rather than being derivative works (which, by the way, is also a fine way to call fanfics: “derivative works/writing”).
