I don't like the idea that fanfiction is less "real" than original work. Not everyone wants to write professionally - fanfiction is a fun pastime, and it's not less real or less work because it's fanfiction.

Implying it's not real implied there's less work and effort in the actual writing, and that's not necessarily true.
