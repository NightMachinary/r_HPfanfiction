The OP didn't say fanfiction takes less time and effort - in fact they said that fanfiction is more difficult and more time-consuming for them.

The opposite is true for me - I find wriiting original fiction much more difficult. But everybody is different and plenty of people write both. The reasons for and rewards from writing either are different.
