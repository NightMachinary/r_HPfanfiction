I like both equally, I'd say. Writing my own stuff is challenging. You can't just type ahead and hope for the best if you want the result to be any good. Characters need to be designed, story-elemets and plot,............

Fanfiction is great because it lets me just type ahead, almost meditative. Its a great pastime if I can't focus 100% on what I'm currently doing. Its gets my head free and the results of that get posted on FFN from time to time.
