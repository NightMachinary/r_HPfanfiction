  How do you feel writing fanfiction compared to writing your own story?
#+end_quote

I've had what you might call a ‘difficult relationship' with fanfiction. It is two years ago almost to the day that I started posting my first story. Of course I was looking for some sort of validation and I didn't get it -- not at all. It pretty well crushed my already fragile self-esteem. It's painful even to remember how awful I felt at that time.

You would think I'd have stopped then and taken up crochet or something, but I'm a bit bloody minded and I didn't. I'd caught the writing bug, and once you've got it, it's hard to get rid of. From the sense of failure grew a desire to understand why what I had written failed to engage many readers. Was I a bad writer or a bad storyteller or was it just that I was in the wrong place altogether? I suspect that if my fanfiction stories had been more popular I would not have felt the need to move into original fiction, so unpopularity can indirectly have a positive effect. I became interested in the whole storytelling process; the tradition, form, structure, archetypes and why things work in certain ways. So I kept writing fanfiction, but fought my way through ‘The Seven Basic Plots', joined a local CW group and started writing some original pieces. Then I started taking an evening class and wrote some short stories and at last I realised I didn't have to write fanfiction any more. I could write anything. It took a while for me to fall in love with my own characters, but when I did, it was liberating. They're mine, I can do whatever I want with them and it's delicious.

So now, as I write what is technically my first novel (and everyone knows first novels are always terrible) I don't regard it as my real first novel. My first novels are my fanfictions; that was my apprenticeship. And yes, the first one was pretty bad but my writing has improved over subsequent ones.

I find writing original fiction harder and more challenging than writing fanfiction. I wrote an 80k fanfiction in seven months, it will take me at least twice that long to write the same length of original fiction. It's frustrating and exhilarating in equal measure, but I'm finding it very rewarding - though I do hope to go back next year and finish the fanfiction I put on hold back in September.
