I enjoy writing both. In my original fiction, I love the greater freedom I have, there is no way a character "should" be, there are no limits other than the ones I give myself. My motivation for original fiction is, among others, to write something worth publishing, while that for obvious reasons is not a possibility with fanfiction. Fanfiction I continue to write for the fun of exploring JKR's magical world, for the readers who enjoyed reading my story so far, and also for the at times insightful reviews I get that help me improve my writing. For me, writing fanfiction is a bit like a treat. I enjoy it, but I'm aware that it won't get me anywhere in life. I can't publish it, won't put it on my resume, I won't mention it in interviews, while with original fiction these things are at least possible (even if not probable ;) ).
