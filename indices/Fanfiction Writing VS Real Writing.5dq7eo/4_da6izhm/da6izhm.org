It would certainly be easier for ME to write fan fiction ( especially HP ) because of course I'd already have a lot of foundation to begin with. I don't think that me doing that, and "playing in someone else's sandbox" debases my own creative writing ability. Its not like any 'good' fan fiction writer is writing the Canon work over scene for scene ( though some do ). I think it takes equal ability to be able to pull it off smoothly.
