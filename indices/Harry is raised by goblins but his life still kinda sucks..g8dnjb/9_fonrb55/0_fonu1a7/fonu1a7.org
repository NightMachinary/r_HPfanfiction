I made this prompt exactly because of how much I dislike Harry Crow. Aside from the goblin thing It is pretty much the exact opposite of what I described in my post. He shows up at Hogwarts already being a master of transfiguration, a magic knife and no horcrux in his head being trained in all the secret goblin arts and uses his status in the goblin nation to steamroll over everyone.
