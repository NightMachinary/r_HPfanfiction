I get really excited for this kind of fic. Where it's set up with one of the same old beaten to death powerwank concepts (master of death, inheritance test, goblin and elf magic, etc.) but then flips the whole premise upside down to prevent the expected power wank.

A few examples of what kind of plot I mean (no specific fics in mind).

Harry is taken from the Dursleys as a child to receive specialized training from a pureblood. But the pureblood is a moron and thinks Lumos is the best spell to have in your arsenal so Harry doesn't actually learn anything special. Cue illusions of grandeur when he shows up to Hogwarts and being swiftly beat down by all the other students he's been irritating.

Harry takes the inheritance test given by the goblins. He's heir to the Potter family, which has about 1000 galleons in the vault. Turns out inheritance tests just see who your parents were. Harry takes a "buy all the cool stuff" shopping trip. But instead of buying all the ancient artifacts of infinite usefulness and silk robes he buys secondhand robes and secondhand books. Even gets an ordinary trunk which doesn't have an apartment in it.
