What if he showed up to Hogwarts with whatever the UK wizarding equivalent of a CPA is instead of any kind of physical or magical training.

-He tries to explain investing and sound business practices to the twins and is very cross when they lose all their startup money gambling with Ludo Bagman.

-He reports Draco for selling the 'Potter Stinks' and the 'Weasley is Our King' badges and not paying taxes on his small business that he's clearly started.

-Dumbledore thinks that he's 'gone dark' at first, but he's really just networking for new clients and started with the Purebloods because they have more assets in the wizarding world.

Bonus points if Professor Binns crosses over when he realizes that Harry was raised by goblins (due to his obession/fear of the bloodshed and brutality of the goblin rebellions) and Harry blithely asking if they should be concerned about Hogwarts finances if the teachers are that afraid of bankers.
