First, agree that subscribers don't matter except for your ego. But if you must obsess about it, the bottom line is that it's a numbers game: the more people who read your works, the more will like them. So the best way to get more subscribers is to get more eyeballs on your fics.

- Watch the various fanfic subs and rec your work whenever it matches the search criteria. In my humble experience, I've gotten the highest number of responses to the fic that I've recced here on Reddit. DON'T rec fics that don't fit the request, and make sure to say that it's self-promotion, or you'll get a bad reputation.
- Write more stories. The more variety you have, the more likely that people will be interested in seeing what you come up with next. (If you try out the various writing prompts that get posted, you can combine this with the above.)
- Update frequently. People don't want to follow an author when there's nothing to see.
- The obvious: write GOOD stories, WELL. This includes an engaging plot and an adherence to SPAG rules.
- And some conflicting advice: write a lot of stories (which usually means short stories), and write long stories. Long stories because some people prefer epics. Lots of short stories because those are the authors I tend to follow: the ones where the stories aren't necessarily linked but I want to know when there's a new one.

Overall, though, if you're writing for the accolades, I think you'll end up disappointed. You'll have to write "what the people want" and agonize over each negative review (and there will be many). You'll be happier overall writing for yourself.

Writing in multiple fandoms is only an issue for me if your only author account is on FFN. I hate scrolling through dozens of stories in fandoms (or worse, cross-overs) that I don't follow. On AO3, I have the option to click on the fandom I'm interested in and then scroll through only those stories.
