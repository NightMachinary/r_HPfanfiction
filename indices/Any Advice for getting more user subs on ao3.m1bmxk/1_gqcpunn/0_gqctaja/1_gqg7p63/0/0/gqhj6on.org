I want to see what people are reading. /Especially/ if it's smut. I guarantee you're not the only kinky person. That's why smut fics have so many hits, I want in on that lemony goodness too.

And I guess I've never cared what people thought. If someone who knew me saw my Reddit username, my ffn one, my ao3 one, they'd hands down know it's me. If they were a friend that is. Family might have a harder time. But I've never bother hiding it.
