I don't see why it matters at all.

Kudos and bookmarks at least encourage more people to check out your work, but you're the only one who knows how many subscriptions you have. User subs are really flattering because it means they're following you instead of just the fic, but even if someone likes your writing, they're probably loyal to their preferred fandoms, so you're right that using the same account for multiple fandoms might deter people. I never subscribe to anyone because my account is linked to a weird email that I don't check ever, but if I were getting emails from a user for a fandom that I don't read, then I'd unsubscribe.

Unless you want user engagement on some kind of social media platform like tumblr or whatever, then I'm struggling to see why you should care other than just the ego boost, which you can also get from fic subscriptions.
