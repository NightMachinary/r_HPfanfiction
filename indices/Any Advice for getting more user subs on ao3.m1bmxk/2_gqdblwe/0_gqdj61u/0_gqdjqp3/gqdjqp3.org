Cross-posting never hurts, though it does make editing or rewriting a bit inconvenient, especially if you want to keep the stories identical.

Also, be careful of straight copy-and-pasting into FFNet's Doc Manager, or into AO3's text editor. There's often the risk of having the spacing between your paragraphs increase when you do this.

Always double-check everything before publishing, especially spacing and anything to do with italicised text.
