I'm not sure about indenting (which I don't do, as it's apparently not really necessary online).

Basically, I type out my stories in a word document and save it as a docx. Then I upload it to FFNet as a story file in the Doc Manager.

As for cross-posting, I've found that copying from FFnet to AO3 usually doesn't give many problems. But always have a read through of your chapter prior to publishing it.
