You might be surprised. My first fic (posted on FFN and AO3) had insanely different receptions on each site. Ao3: 40-ish comments, 150 (? Maybe less, i haven't looked in awhile) kudos, maybe 15 subs. FFN: 2k follows, 1600 favs, well over 1k reviews, half-million views.

It's nuts, right? The readership is just sooooo different on each one. I feel a little bad, because of the few comments i got on ao3, people were really nice, but posting there is generally a waste of my time. Like, why put in the effort to keep updating there when maybe 2-3 dozen people are reading, compared to thousands on FFN?
