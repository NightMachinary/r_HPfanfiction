I often forget that exists. For me to sub to you I must like 99% of your fics. Which rarely happens. The last person I did that to was FlamingoQueen.

I don't even subscribe to stories. I bookmark them.

Point is I wouldn't bother about it. If you write a great fic, chances are the reader will want to see more of your work. At least that's what I do.
