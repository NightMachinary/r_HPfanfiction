True I very actively avoid fics with walls of tags. ESPECIALLY those giant crossover fics or the mega fic compilations. You know the ones.

I didn't want to spoil future chapters with my tags but my comments kept bugging me about the wrong things so I had to steer perceptions in the right direction.
