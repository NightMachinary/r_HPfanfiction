I once had a particularly passive aggressive comment on my pwp fic that started with "you have an undeniable talent for erotica" and ended with basically "can't wait until the plot allows your characters to have more personality than looks :)" SMILEY INCLUDED and I took that personally. I don't respond to comments too often, but I just said "wow I'm glad you think I'm so talented with erotica! There's more to come :)"

The relationship dynamics are really interesting with Tomarry. When I first saw it on the ao3 sidebar I was soooooo confused why it was popular and had to check it out. I understand it now lol. Young Tom Riddle was a p interesting character. Looking back, I did have a crush on him in the Chamber of Secrets when I was a kid.
