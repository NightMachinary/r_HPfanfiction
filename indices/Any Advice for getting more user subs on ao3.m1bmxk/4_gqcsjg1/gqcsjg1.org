I might be wrong, but the HP fandom on AO3 seems to favour things like Dumbledore and Order of the Phoenix bashing + Drarry, Snarry, HarryMort, Tomarry, etc. shipping + James et al. and Gryffindor in general bashing + Dursley abuse turned up to eleven.

For example, you could have two stories of similar length posted on AO3, and chances are that the one with Dumbledore bashing and/or Drarry, Snarry, HarryMort, Tomarry, etc. and/or Gryffindor bashing will get high numbers of viewers fairly quickly.

Fics which are similar in structure to this ...

Relationships:

Draco Malfoy/ Harry Potter, Harry Potter/Tom Riddle|Voldemort, Harry Potter/Severus Snape, Harry Potter/Lucius Malfoy (might be more).

Characters:

Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy, Tom Riddle|Voldemort, Severus Snape, Narcissa Black Malfoy, Lucius Malfoy, Rodolphus Lestrange, Rabastan Lestrange, Bellatrix Black Lestrange, Albus Dumbledore, Amelia Bones, Susan Bones, Antonin Dolohov, Fenrir Greyback, Tracey Davis, Blaise Zabini, Mrs Zabini, Daphne Greengrass, Millicent Bulstrode, Bartemius Crouch Jr, etc. etc (continues on and on and on).

Additional tags:

[Usual bunch of additional tags, and then loads of freeform] Dumbles is an idiot, Sev is trying, really, he is, Harry and Draco are so cute together, Order of Fried Chicken are losers, Voldemort is sane, Tom deserves better, Dumbles made Tom a monster, Dumbledick is the real Dark Lord, Dumbles faked the prophecy, Sev didn't deserve the werewolf incident, that was all Sirius's fault, I hate Dumbles, the old coot will get what's coming to him, Sev is healing, maybe not, but he's getting there, James was an asshole, no beta we die like men, fuck JKR, Nagini is mother hen, smol Draco (or smol Harry), REGULUS IS ALIVE, etc. etc. (continues on and on and on and on).

... seem to get loads of hits, kudos, bookmarks, etc.

Basically, don't worry too much about your number of subs. It's not always an indicator of the quality of your writing.

It's often hard to get loads of hits, kudos, bookmarks, and subs when you don't write in line with what tends to get high traffic.
