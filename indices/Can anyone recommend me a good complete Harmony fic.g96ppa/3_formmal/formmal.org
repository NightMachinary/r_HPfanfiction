I got a few, they of the older sorts so you may have read them already. With a few newer ones at the end

A Different Halloween - linkffn(6439871) - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/RobSt][RobSt]] has a lot of complete Harmony fics. His fics however a mostly based on wish fulfillment.

Quoth the Raven, Nevermore - linkffn(6652537) - It's been a long time since I read this one but I thought it was a very interesting story. But my memory could be terrible.

H J Potter - linkffn(5093897) - It's an excellent story and one that I enjoy a lot.

Old Soldiers Never Die - linkffn(2784825) - The relationship is hinted at here but not overtly mentioned or focused on. However, it is a good story and is worth recommending.

Breakfast In New York - linkffn(5141159) - This one was an interesting story, I enjoyed it.

Harry Potter and the Last Chance - linkffn(11922615) - This is a great story and very well done.

Picnic Panic - linkffn(12265183) - One of my utmost favorite stories and the one I recommend the most.
