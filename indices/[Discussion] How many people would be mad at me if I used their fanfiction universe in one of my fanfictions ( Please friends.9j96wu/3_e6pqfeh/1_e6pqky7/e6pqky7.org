Well I don't want to like use an entire unchanged story here, like in a meta "I'm just going to copy a story and write it all down" way. I mean I just would like to be able to have a few universes as sandboxes for a sort of fanfic crossover where some of my characters would cross out of their universes and into other ones made by other authors, and then get to meet THEIR characters. :)

But yes you are right! Nobody who writes Harry Potter/Star Wars crossovers ever calls up George Lucas and asks if they can use HIS universe, so I don't have to ask any FANFIC authors to use their universe for my crossover either.
