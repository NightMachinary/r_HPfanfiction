Most fanfic authors would probably be pretty happy with a recursive fanfiction. Here's a reply I got:

"Uh.. Sure, but really why don't you just make your own world." Mind you it was a Minecraft fanfiction so the argument was pretty valid. He basically had to create his own world from scratch.

Anyway I think asking for permission is best no matter the hypocrisy.
