  I remember a scene in Philosopher's Stone that has Harry threatened with expulsion if he doesn't join the quidditch team.

You remember incorrectly. Hooch threatens to have anybody who flies without suprvision expelled, Harry does so, gets caught, thinks he's going to get expelled, thinks he's going to be beaten with a cane, then is shocked to find out he's being put on the Quidditch team.
