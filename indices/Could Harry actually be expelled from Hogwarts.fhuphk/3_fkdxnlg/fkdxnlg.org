I think yes?

Dumbledore could very well have a plan for such an event. He was obviously prepared to defend Harry in OOTP when Harry cast the Patronus in Little Whinging, but Dumbledore's plan was always to keep Harry at Hogwarts where he could be close and well monitored and where Dumbledore knew the rules of the game.

Harry outside of Hogwarts and outside of the Dursleys turns him into a wildcard. Harry has a penchant for mischief, not necessarily his own fault, but he attracts attention, sometimes powerful attention, which escalates pretty magnificently at times. I think Dumbledore would plan to isolate and educate Harry some other way if he were expelled (private tutors, a Fidelius-hidden location, etc). Harry would probably gripe and grumble as he usually does, but it would be necessary in Dumbledore's eyes, and not a /terrible/ alternative to Hogwarts. Hogwarts is just the best middle-ground between having a normal magical childhood and training to defeat a Dark Lord. Outside of Hogwarts, and everything has to skew toward the latter far quicker.
