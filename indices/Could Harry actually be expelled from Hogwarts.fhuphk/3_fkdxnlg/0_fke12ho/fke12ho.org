Yeah, you may be right.

Another angle, and this one really delves into fanfic territory, what if Harry just... left? You say that Dumbledore would offer private tutors and somewhere safe, but what if Harry turned it down and just left the wizarding world entirely?

As both you and I point out: Dumbledore /needs/ Harry to be at least partially trained to fight Voldemort. But what do you do with a Harry that refuses to be a part of that? A Harry that, after being expelled (a process that, if memory serves, involves the snapping of your wand), decided that he didn't want to be a wizard.

I question Harry being expelled, because that's really the only place Dumbledore really has unilateral control over Harry, whatever the reasoning.
