cant remember the name but it was a fourth year rehash fic that was harry/fluer and his animagus form is some kinda cute wild pig?

also bungle in the jungle has harry become a jaguar but then its super OP (cuz its a freakin jaguar) and basically becomes the goto solution in all the fights; also interestingly its all written in second person [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure]]
