In Hermione Granger and the HBP Hermione has a unique animagus form that I won't mention because /river song voice/ spoilers but I thought it was pretty cool.

And in The Problem With Purity she's a unicorn animagus and Harry is a phoenix. I kind of like TPWP but it has a Tragic Misunderstanding that, no joke, lasts for almost a thousand pages. And at one point Hermione gets badly burned in a duel, and I feel like she's entirely too quippy for someone whose torso is basically cooked.
