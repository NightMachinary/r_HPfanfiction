[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2388416/1/Growing-Pains]], it's this series, lots of things this sub isn't a fan of (HP/DM, Severus mentor etc) but it has some good elements too. Personally the tree Animagus was a good element, it develops a useful ability in the sequel (I got half way through the sequel before losing interest)
