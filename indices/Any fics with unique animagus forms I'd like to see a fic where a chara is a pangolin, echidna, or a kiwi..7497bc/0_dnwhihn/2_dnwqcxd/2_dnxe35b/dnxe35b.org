It has been done. Linkffn(11689576)

Short Summary: Hagrid doesn't get his hands on Norbert's egg. He gets a velociraptor egg. It hatches, and imprints on Harry. Harry trains it, gets a couple more and freaks everyone out. Then he becomes an animagus. His form is [[#s]["an Indominus Rex, from the latest Jurassic Park movie. He can turn into the Indominus, or a T-Rex, or a velociraptor I think - because it's a hybrid of those two."]]

Edit: From what I remember, it's an alright fic. But, as someone has pointed out somehow and for some reason Hermione [[#s][doesn't know that they are dinosaurs]]. Which is retarded.
