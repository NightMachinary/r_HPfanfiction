I'm 90% sure someone's done that. Or at least, some hyperactive kid Harry managed to turn himself into a dinosaur while Spiderman was looking after him. Three women were robbing a museum, they tried to distract a young Harry by turning him into what he idolises/thinks about most (thinking he would turn into one of them, as /of course/ all young boys think of women 24/7). They were rather surprised when he turned into a T-Rex and trashed the place. Nobody else was though, after all which 12 year old /wouldn't/ want to be a dinosaur?
