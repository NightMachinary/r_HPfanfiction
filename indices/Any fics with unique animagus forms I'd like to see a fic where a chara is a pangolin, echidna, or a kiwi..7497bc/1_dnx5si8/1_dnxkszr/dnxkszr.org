Hm. The closest I can think of is a fic where Harry becomes a species of dragon from the Shadowrun universe. That is, an actual dragon (although he relearns how to take human form later), not an animagus. And that kind of dragon was sort of machine-like, I think? He had to eat barrels of oil and scrap metal, as the dragon fire was based on actual chemical reactions.
