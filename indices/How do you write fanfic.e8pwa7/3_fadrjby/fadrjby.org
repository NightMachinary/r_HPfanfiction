I have a folder in google drive, and each chapter is a separate doc. I label the first chapter as Title Here, and the rest are TH2, TH3, TH4, etc,. It's a lot easier for me to upload this way, and I keep a separate doc (my outline) that has a few quick points that each chapter hit, so I can always find the chapter if I need to look something up. Plus the word count tool is so much easier to use when each doc is separate.
