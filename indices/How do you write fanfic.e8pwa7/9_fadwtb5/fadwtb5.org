I write everything in Word because it has some features I like (various languages for spellchecking, custom style checking, and easy page/chapter navigation).

I keep my chapter notes on a google doc so that I can take note of any ideas or things I want to change while I'm on the go. And if I feel particularly inspired when away from my desk, I can write snippets or scenes on the google doc and then integrate them into my Word document when I get home.
