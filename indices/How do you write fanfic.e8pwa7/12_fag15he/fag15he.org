I have an excel file and use the tabs to keep track of various aspects of my world: notes on OCs, timeline, plot points, notes on aspects of the magic system, etc. I keep the story itself in a word file with headers at chapter beginnings to create a table of contents. I've been seeing how OneNote works for organizing research and notes and stuff. It's always a work in progress.
