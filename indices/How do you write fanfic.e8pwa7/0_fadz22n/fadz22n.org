I use LibreOffice, I keep a folder with all my fanfictions in it. I have subfolders for each fic then each chapter is a separate document. After I finish writing a chapter, I run it through Grammarly, because I'm lazy, then read over it once and fix anything, then copy it into FFN. Add the breaks, then upload, then copy to AO3, then upload.
