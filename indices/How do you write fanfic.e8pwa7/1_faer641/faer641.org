Google Docs, full screen mode, sometimes with Dark Reader turned on. There is just something about having no visual distractions that makes the flow a lot easier. Basically the only reason I use Docs.

Primarily stored on Drive, each chapter its own document and each story its own folder. Backups downloaded as .docx on my computer.

I keep notes about the story (such as events, quotes, poems, schedules and everything else I might conceivably need in the future) in a Notion page, since it's a bit more organised than just having it in a doc.

Funnily enough, I never wrote on my phone, even though I could. I sometimes proof-read it that way, but never write. Asking me to write on that small keyboard is like killing puppies. It simply isn't done.
