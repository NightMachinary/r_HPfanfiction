I usually have at least 4-5 tabs open every time I'm writing: the fic doc, my outline doc, [[https://thesaurus.com][thesaurus.com]], what's posted of my WIP on Ao3, and a research tab (my research tabs sometimes grow to 10 or more, depending on how sidetracked I get).

I write everything in Google Docs because it allows for easy beta-reading (the beta readers can leave comments as well as suggestions so I can accept or deny them). It also allows me to read my WIP on my tablet as I'm going to bed, which helps me spot typos better because it's on a different screen.

I do each chapter as a separate file just because it cuts down on load time. (This is why I have my fic open on Ao3 as I'm writing - flipping between chapters there is easier than using G-Docs outline tool.)

I have the Grammarly extension installed, which finally works with Google Docs, yay!

I tend to make at least three edit passes once I've completed a chapter or work (in addition to constantly editing as I'm writing, too). I'll make one thorough pass, then I'll change the font from Arial to something with serifs (usually Droid Serif) and do another pass - reading something you've written in a different font ALSO helps you spot typos (it's why you always always always spot a typo right after you've posted your fic even if you've read it 10 times - seriously, learning the font-changing trick was life-changing). Then I'll change the font back to Arial and edit it one more time and send it off to beta (if I've got one; I'm mostly flying without right now).

Once I've got the finished product, I run a Google Add-On called "Docs to Markdown," which will do all of the HTML work for me (for the most part - it doesn't do blockquotes, do I do those manually if I have them), then I copy and paste into Ao3's HTML editor. (Copying directly from Google in Ao3's rich text editor does some really annoying crap with italicized words.)
