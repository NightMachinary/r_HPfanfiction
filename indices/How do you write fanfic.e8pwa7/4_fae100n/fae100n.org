I am a programmer by profession, so I write everything in a plan text editor ([[https://neovim.io/][neovim]] in my case) using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText][reStructuredText]] format and then converting to HTML/Open/LibreOffice/ePub/whatever-else. I really liked that AO3 is capable of importing multiple chapters (80+ in my case of linkao3(20896994)) at once.
