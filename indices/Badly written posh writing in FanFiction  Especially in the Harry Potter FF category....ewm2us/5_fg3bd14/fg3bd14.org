To be fair - I can see this happening for the economically well-off characters. I remember even back in elementary school they would actively encourage us to use more complex or nuanced words, similarly my parents would not stand for any sort of contractions or "ehrms" at the dinner table. Especially for those from the Old Families, I can easily see that happening. A distinct language structure that clearly separates them from the rest of the population.

We see it all the time in our actual interactions as well, word choices are a very easy but direct method of communicating all necessary social structures to one another (abstracting from general rules of politeness such as avoiding swear words when speaking to people higher-up than you). It's really not too different from code-switching. And: we like eloquent people. Similarly, the use of this overly posh language can be trained, hence my parents refusing to let me use contractions and more "southern" vernacular.
