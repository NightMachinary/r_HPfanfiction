It happens in fics where the author really wanted to write about adults, but for some reason sticks to the canon-ages. This is also why you get weirdly sexual situations in most of these fics, and why they have to emancipate a teenaged character.

I think the most frustrating one is when they tease you with an amazingly written setup, like an unbreakable trio of Ron, Harry and Hermione scavenging through the post-nuclear wasteland, or Harry sitting within a prison cell as the last fellow wizard is wheeled away for demented experiments by some private company, or anything of that nature, and they do a bait-and-switch and the second chapter is the main character waking up as their younger self, and the fic is 500k words with nothing differentiating it from the story of the books in any way.
