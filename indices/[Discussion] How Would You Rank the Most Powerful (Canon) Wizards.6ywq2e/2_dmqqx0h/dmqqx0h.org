Judging by the movie, and the articles from pottermore, newt is pretty damn good (held off grindewald), and seraphina is an extremely talented witch (she had the equivalent of a four way hat stall.) it's also mentioned that newts brother was famous, so I'd assume he's on the same level in a different proficiency.
