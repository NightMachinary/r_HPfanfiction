This is hard for me... I don't think Grindlewald was actually trying to beat Newt. We have a completely canon statement from the orginal books, saying that He and Dumbledore had the best duel ever. And I didn't see that happen with Gridlewald vs Newt.

I would equate it to Voldemort and Harry's battle in the cemetary. Newt was doing his best to beat Grindlewald, and Grindlewald wasn't even close to being beat. Same with Harry and Voldemort in that battle.
