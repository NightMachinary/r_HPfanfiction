Yup, we agree on most things, including the way magic works. And oops, I forgot Fleur! Shame on me! (I'd really put Flitwick in the "exceptional" or "probably exceptional" category though. He was a duelling champion for goodness' sake!)

As for Harry, as I noted, all the "child" characters were judged by their adult counterparts in my list. He was nothing special as a kid, but I assume he wised up with time, since Adult!Harry became Head of the Aurors Department, which, if it doesn't get you in at least 'Probably Exceptional', I don't know what does.
