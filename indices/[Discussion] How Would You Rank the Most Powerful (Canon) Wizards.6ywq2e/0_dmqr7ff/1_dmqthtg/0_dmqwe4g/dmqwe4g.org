Yeah, I forgot Flitwick.

And concerning Harry... He never had to get his NEWTS to become that, if I recall correctly. Chances are that he never had to proof his academic skills to anyone. I don't know, but I kinda penned him down as "not interested". And apparently you /can/ take down a Dark Lord with schoolyard jinxes and a shitton of luck. Maybe he remained lucky. Maybe he learned on the job. Maybe Auror Academy drilled his lazy ass to some goddamn usable potion brewing. We'll probably never know.
