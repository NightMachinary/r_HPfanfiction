Basically your list.

*Legendary status:* Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindelwald

*Exceptional:* Snape, Moody, Bellatrix, McGonagall

*Probably Exceptional:* Sirius, Remus, James Potter, Lily Potter, most of the Order of the Phoenix, most of the upper echelon of Death Eaters, the Aurors

*On the best way:* Hermione, the Twins, Fleur

I excluded Harry because he basically doesn't give a shit about learning anything beyond the necessary. The pattern I see in the legendary ranking alone, is that all of them are one thing first and foremost: scholars. HP magic fuels itself with knowledge by a big margin. Willpower, strength of mind and concentration, and control over your emotions are big parts too, but for the most part magic is /knowing/ what to use, how to use it and when to use it.
