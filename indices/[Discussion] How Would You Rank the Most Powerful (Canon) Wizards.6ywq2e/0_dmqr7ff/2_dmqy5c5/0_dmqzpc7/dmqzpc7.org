Triwizard Champion, end of argument. I mean, I don't know her all that much - nobody does. We never get to see what she does with Gringotts, we never really get to see her up close doing magic. But I'd add any Triwizard Champion (I forgot Krum and Cedric) to the "potential" list as long as they don't prove me wrong, like Harry did with his disinterest to learn anything beyond the necessary (which, to be fair, is probably my biggest pet peeve in the entire HP series. I remember being angry at that kid /as a kid/ in Philosopher Stone because that twat got to do the best fucking homework ever and I was sitting there doing Algebra).
