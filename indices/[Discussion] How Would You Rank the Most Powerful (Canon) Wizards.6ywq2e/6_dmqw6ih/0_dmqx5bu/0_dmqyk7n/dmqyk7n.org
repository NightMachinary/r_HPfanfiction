Fawkes took a killing curse for Dumbledore in the OotP fight.

  But even as he shouted, another jet of green light flew at Dumbledore from Voldemort's wand and the snake had struck.

  Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore, opened his beak wide and swallowed the jet of green light whole: he burst into flame and fell to the floor, small, wrinkled and flightless. At the same moment, Dumbledore brandished his wand in one long, fluid movement - the snake, which had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him, flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke

Voldemort managed to corner Dumbledore into a two-pronged attack. The snake was an instant away from striking Dumbledore when he managed to parry it. Had Fawkes not taken the killing curse, it would certainly have hit him. Although, I do wonder if Dumbledore could have disapparated in that time, or whether he would have been too slow or opened himself for further attack.

Dumbledore holding back is a fair point, but I think Dumbledore is skilled enough that he can fight for the kill or mere capture with similar effectiveness. Then again, may be not. He did not drive Voldemort away - the pain from possessing Harry (Dumbledore in HBP says that Voldemort had never experienced such pain) plus the threat of detection by aurors were bigger factors.
