  Voldemort would have killed an Elder Wand wielding Dumbledore had it not been for Fawkes
#+end_quote

When? The only time we saw Voldemort and Dumbledore duelling, in /Order of the Phoenix/, Dumbledore still had the upper hand even tough he had to protect Harry at the same time. He forcefully drove Tom away, and Voldemort notes that even then Dumbledore is /holding back/, not actually going in for the kill (because he knew it'd be futile with the Horcruxes).

As for Moody... yeah, he got old. He was /retired/, for goodness' sake. First-War!Moody must have been /very/ good, but thirty more years and one less leg do bring someone down. And Dolohov I assume lost quite a bit of his skill in Azkaban.
