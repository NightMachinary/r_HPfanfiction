What makes you think that? Snape was a superb legilimens, potioneer and occlumens. We have no evidence of him being a great duelist other than that duel with Minnie McG so his duelling feats are none. McGonagall would've beaten him. His job as a spy wasn't to practice duelling. I'd be concerned if he was trained daily.
