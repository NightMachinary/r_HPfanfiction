Voldemort>Dumbledore>Grindelwald*Snape>=McGonagall*Bellatrix/Molly/Sirius>>Harry>Ron/Hermione/Draco

These are the important characters we see duelling in canon, and I'm fairly certain this is more or less accurate.

Voldemort would have killed an Elder Wand wielding Dumbledore had it not been for Fawkes, so I think he should be first. Plus, if Duimbledore had been capable of beating him, he probably would have sometime. Grindelwald being number 3 is rather self-explanatory.

Snape and McGonagall are the only ones in canon outside the big three to use transfiguration and complex spellwork. McGonagall got the better of Snape in their duel after Flitwick's interference, but I get the feeling that Snape was holding back. She is also incapable of occlumency, which is a huge disadvantage when facing a skilled legilimens actually trying to kill you.

Bellatrix doesn't use complex spellwork, but instead relies on quickness and reflexes. Don't think she would stand much of a chance against more technique-oriented fighters like Snape or McG, but everyone else is fair game. Both Sirius and Molly hold their own against her. Sirius laughs instead of taking Bella seriously, and she does him in. Bella doesn't take Molly seriously, and Molly gets a spell past Bella's defenses.

Harry's position is also rather self-explanatory. Both Ron and Hermione do surprisingly well against Death Eaters in DH. Draco showed decent skill in his duel against Harry.

Flitwick would probably be somewhere around McG's level. Remus a bit below Sirius's level. Moody is described as very badass, but mostly loses a lot. May be he grew old? Dolohov killed the Prewett twins and Remus, but also lost to the trio, so I have no idea what that makes him.
