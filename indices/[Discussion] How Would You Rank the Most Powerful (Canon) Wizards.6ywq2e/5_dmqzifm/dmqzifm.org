I think a lot of people here are talking in terms of /ability/ more so than general /power/ (Which I know is what you're asking, but i'm now intrigued by power). I'd have to make a (very brief) list of something like this.

*Top Tier*

Founders; Voldemort; Dumbledore; Harry (Contriversial! I know but remember I'm talking pure /power/)

*Pretty Damn Powerful* McGonagall; Flitwick; Snape; Kingsley; Snape; Sirius; Bellatrix; Remus; Mad-Eye

*Powerful* Tonks, Fleur, Weasleys, Hermione etc. (I'd say this is the general level, and it's knowledge and skill that get you up or down in the rankings from here)

I also exclude people like Newt from Fantastic Beasts and anyone from ^{theplaythatshallnotbenamed} because honestly I hated both of them.
