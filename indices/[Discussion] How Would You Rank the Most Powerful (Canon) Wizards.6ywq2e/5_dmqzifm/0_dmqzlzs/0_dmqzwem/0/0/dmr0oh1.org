It's certainly possible that emotion is the reason his patronus is so strong, but I prefer to think of the emotion as the spark if you will, where a clearer or more powerful emition will give you a brighter spark, but you then need power to amplify that spark, which will result in the strength of the spell.

Also, I was unaware of that reverse patronus. I assume it's on Pottermore? I accept it's 'canon' but honestly I don't use it nor read anything from there, especially since the whole sleakeasy thing.
