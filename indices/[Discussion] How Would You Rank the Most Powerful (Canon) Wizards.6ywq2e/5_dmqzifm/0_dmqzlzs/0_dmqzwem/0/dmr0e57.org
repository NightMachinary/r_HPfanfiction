While there is a fair share of circumstantial evidence that could fit the "inherent power" idea, I (and the others in the "it's all skill and learning and anybody could do it" camp) hold that Harry's Patronus is a special case because it does not only take magic and the right words to cast it, but the right /emotion/. Someone of very pure heart with a great capacity for happiness would cast a vastly more powerful Patronus. For a matching reverse-example (opposite Harry's goodness shining through into a super-Patronus), take the story of the great historical Dark Wizard who tried to cast a Patronus and ended up producing a fully-corporeal degeneration of the spell that /ate him alive/.
