Well I would say that there is some clear indication of certain people just being more powerful than others. Take Harry for example, it's not that he produces a patronus at thirteen that makes him powerful, as, if given the same learning at that age i'm sure someone like hermione could do it. What makes him powerful is that fact that he used it to drive off over a 100 dementors, which is something fully fledged adults, most likely including trained aurors, have trouble with.

Also as i said my list was brief so no Grindelwald, but he'd probably have to go in one of the top two, as I have no idea how much was power and how much was skill, having never read a description or seen him actually fight, but I'm assuming you have to be damn good to take on Dumbledore.
