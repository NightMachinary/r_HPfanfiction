I feel (and bear in mind this is personal speculation, not stone-hard canon) that while the average wizard (say, Arthur Weasley) of the 20th century is far more capable than the average wizard of the 13th century, the greatest magic has remained stable --- in that usually, what happens is that gifted geniuses are born, gain their own understanding of magic far beyond anything known at the time, create a couple of lasting artifacts, die, and what they created will live on to puzzle future generations. Thanks to Hogwarts spreading knowledge, this scheme is slowly fading away, with the knowledge of modern geniuses being passed on, but the point is that Rowena Ravenclaw could have advanced in some areas to the same stage as Dumbledore (remember no one apparently has any idea how to remake the Diadem or the Room of Requirements) without it lastingly impacting the wider world's magical knowledge. And she may have had a less magical everyday life, ironically lacking in everyday charms and potions, while being largely unhindered when it came to powerful magic.
