Well, most medieval castles we see were built by large groups of people supervised by small numbers of architects and managers. Why not Hogwarts?

As for the Room of Requirement, it's not much "smarter" than a talking portrait or a mirror that gives you fashion advice, and the rest is just lots of conjuration and perhaps a version of Undetectable Extension Charm. For that matter, we don't actually know when it was added. I wouldn't be surprised if recreating it were well within Dumbledore's capabilities, if not necessarily worth his time.
