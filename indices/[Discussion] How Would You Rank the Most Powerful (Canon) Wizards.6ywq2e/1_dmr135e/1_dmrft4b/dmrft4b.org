Just look at some of the magic of Hogwarts itself. The room of requirements, even when toned far down from typical fanon levels, is unlike anything else seen in the series. As far as we are aware, the founders were the ones to build and enchant the entire school. Hogwarts is more impressive than, for example, the Ministry of Magic, even though it was built centuries earlier and by 4 people.
