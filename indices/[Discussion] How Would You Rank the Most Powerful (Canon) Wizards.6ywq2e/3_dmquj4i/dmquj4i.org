I disagree with Lily being more powerful than Sirius and James. No evidence she was while there was evidence they were. What makes you think that? I would rank her just below them in the second category. She was only exceptional at Potions and she couldn't have dueled Voldemort three times and thwarted him. He'd have stomped her like a fly. As for being Head girl: that position isn't just for good grades. It's for decent grades, good leadership abilities and a good personality. There might've been tons of girls more exceptional and outstanding than her but were just socially awkward, downright racists or lazy and couldn't handle responsibility.

Voldemort could've just wanted to recruit Lily for her Potions abilities and not for dueling ones because that wouldn't be strategic. Voldemort can't only have good duelists. I personally believe Lily was only exceptional at Potions and slightly above average in DADA. Other than that I believe her grades were like Harry's.

Sirius and James were outstanding child prodigies.

We have to remember that Lily was dead and people would only rant about how intelligent, selfless, talented, powerful, beautiful, kind etc. she was. A lot of things would've been exaggerated. She was laos a Wizarding icon by then.

Take this brutal example: Hermione (not that I'm comparing Lily to Hermione, Hermione was better) is dead. How would she seem? Much more powerful than Merlin, I think because Harry and Ron would rant on about how amazing she was and exaggerate stuff.
