  We /know/ she /did/.

The thrice defied part of the prophecy is vague. Do you honestly believe that Lily and James, together, fought Voldemort three times and defeated him? Nope. Lily and James were inexperienced teenagers barely out of school so they can't thwart Voldemort, who was in his /fifties/. Voldemort was a child prodigy. He was arguably more powerful than Dumbledore. If /Dumbledore/ had trouble holding off Voldemort then Lily and James certainly did. Let's face it: two teenagers with zero experience compared to one of the most powerful wizards in history aren't going to thwart him. Maybe they were held hostage by the Death Eaters but escaped against Voldemort's wishes. I see thrice defied as this, personally: Joining the Order, refusing Voldemort's offer to join him, and getting /married/.

The thrice defied thing is very vague and left to the imagination. For all we know they could've been cursing his mother at the top of their lungs in a huge battle for the Order or something. Like, all members were involved, the ministry, etc.

If they /did/ duel him (which I highly doubt) then I think it was this huge battle like /The Battle of Hogwarts/ where like, everyone, was holding him off or something. They were kids. Let's face it.

We actually have no evidence of Lily being more serious than Sirius and James. She seems like a mixture of Ginny and Tonks from her descriptions of her personality in canon. Relaxed, a tad too forgiving, extroverted, popular, very funny, goofy, vivacious, cheeky, lively and bubbly.

I'd go as far as to say that Lily didn't even read but would much rather party or take on a dare. She strikes me as someone who wants to live life to fullest. Someone who only focuses on the subjects that they excel at (Potions) and wouldn't care less if she flunked Transfiguration or not. But that's how I interpret her academic level.

I also think that Voldemort wanted to recruit Lily and James because the Potters were filthy rich and well-connected. So they'd give him advantages socially. Just like Lucius and Narcissa, who were incompetent (I'm not saying Lily and James weren't but they were just kids). Or he wanted Lily for her potion skills and James for his duelling ability.

Sirius and James /did/ receive straight 'O's after all. They were child prodigies. They didn't spend effort but were just naturally brilliant.
