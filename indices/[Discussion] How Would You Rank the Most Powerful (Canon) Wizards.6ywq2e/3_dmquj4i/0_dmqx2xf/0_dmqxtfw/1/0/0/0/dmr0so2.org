When did she throw a fireball at Voldemort? Maybe they were just lucky to scrape because they escaped from captivity against Voldemort's wishes or something. Maybe getting married counts. It most likely does. Maybe, as per Rowling's words, they arrested one of his henchmen. I don't see why they need to duel him and escape him if the likes of Amelia Bones, the McKinnons, Dorcas Meadowes, Edgar Bones, Moody,?Dumbledore and Rufus Scrimegour (I'm 100% that's misspelled) couldn't at least escape or thwart him once (except Dumbledore). These people were 99% more powerful than them.
