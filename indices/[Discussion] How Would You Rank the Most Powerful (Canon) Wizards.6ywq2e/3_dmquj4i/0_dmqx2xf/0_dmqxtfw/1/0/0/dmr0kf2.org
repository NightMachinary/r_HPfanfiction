You don't have to be the princess of enchanters to throw a freaking fireball at someone. Harry was seventeen and acted like he knew 1 spell. I'm not saying either of his parents were super powerful or they chased off the big V, but I am saying that they could have been good enough to escape from him 3 times. They weren't the only ones to do so.
