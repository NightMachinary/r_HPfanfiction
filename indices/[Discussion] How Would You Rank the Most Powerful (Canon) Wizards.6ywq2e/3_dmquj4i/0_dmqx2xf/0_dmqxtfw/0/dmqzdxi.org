Hm... After summarily rescrutinizing canon, it is true nothing actually confirms my view of Lily as a "warmer" Hermione, rather than the Ginny/Tonks cross you describe. Then again, neither does anything contradict it. We /don't/ know what marks she got for her NEWTS. Allow me to list the arguments in favour of my interpretation --- though again, none is damning evidence and it could go either way.

- We know she had the same control over underage wandless magic that Tom Riddle had, though to a lesser extent, with the flower-petals thing.

- Petunia says she came home with "singing teapots" and she "turned teacups into rats", showing a proficiency with Charms and Transfiguration. Nothing beyond curriculum, but pretty good. Ollivander also describes her wand as "good for Charms", for what it's worth.

- She could cast the Patronus Charm, which, again, is meant to be pretty advanced (though that might have more to do with ability to focus on happiness than magical ability; canon is undecisive).

- There's the fish-transfiguration anecdote from the movies, too. If you accept it as canon, it also supports a well-roundedly competent Lily (Professor Slughorn unambiguously states that such a transfiguration was a "remarkable" bit of magic, so presumably not something on curriculum --- though I can see how this particular instance could fit into your "she's dead so people put her on a pedestal" interpretation).

- /She was recruited into the Order of the Phoenix/.

(By the way, the folks on the Wiki do hold the 'defying' to have been of a duelling nature.)
