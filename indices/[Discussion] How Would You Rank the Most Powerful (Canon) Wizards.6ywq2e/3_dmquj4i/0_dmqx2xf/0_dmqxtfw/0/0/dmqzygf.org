The wiki tends to poke guesses. Lily can have only been recruited for Potions. Dung was pretty incompetent but he was skilled in one area. The first and foremost requirement was loyalty. I don't consider the movies canon, they tend to glorify her more than the books. She did have control over underage magic but Riddle was using it quite differently and much more powerfully. Besides, we don't know because that was underage so how it actually evolved is unknown.

I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.
