You do make good points. As I said, the order inside that third category was /loose/, not strict. I more or less put here there because Lily was presumably more serious than Sirius, James and Peter, who, while in theory as or more talented than her, were probably spending more time Maraudering than they were studying. But you have a good case too. Anyway, the only thing I don't really agree in your comment:

  she couldn't have dueled Voldemort three times and thwarted him.

...What are you even saying here? We /know/ she /did/. Harry is born to "those" who have thrice defined the Dark Lord. It couldn't have been just James. Personally, I like to believe in at least one of those encounters James and Lily fought Voldemort /together/, allowing them to hold him off until Order reinforcements came in. This accounts for the "defied" him bit without conflicting with the fact that they couldn't have been Dumbledore-level.
