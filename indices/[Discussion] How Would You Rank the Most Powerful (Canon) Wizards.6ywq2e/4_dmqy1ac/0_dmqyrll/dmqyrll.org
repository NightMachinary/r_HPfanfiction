...? Is there any indication in canon he wasn't as good as the other Marauders? He took part in making the Map, /managed the insanely difficult Animagus transformation/, participated in countless elaborate Weasley-Twins-style pranks, was smart enough to cook up a successful way to fake his death in a short time-span (while presumably under incalculable stress, judging from his almost crippling cowardice), cast that advanced explosion curse Sirius was blamed for, and later very successfully helped Voldemort come back to life (first locating him, then successfully brewing the experimental potion that created Voldemort's temporary baby body and finally carrying out an old and powerful Dark Ritual). While he's pathetic in other regards (such as a complete lack of fortitude under threat), I'm really quite convinced Pettigrew was one heck of a wizard, magically speaking, though he may not have been as useful in the field as the other Marauders and DEs because of his fear.
