Pretty much everyone in the books implied Wormtail was dragged to any and every achievement he ever had. Of course, it seems just about everyone dislikes/hates him, so the bias makes it hard to judge. I think he was probably a somewhat above average wizard but nothing extraordinary. He just surrounded himself with the best he could, so he looked lame in comparison and also probably achieved some feats he couldn't have without their help. Which is actually a credit to Peter; attaching yourself to the talented and having them elevate you is a intelligent thing to do.
