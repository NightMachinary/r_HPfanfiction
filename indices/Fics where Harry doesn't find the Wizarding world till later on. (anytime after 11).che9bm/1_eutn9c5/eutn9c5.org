Linkao3(Life skills outside the curriculum by Endrina) is a fic I love. I saw a recommendation for crammer for delinquents because of that fic so, maybe what you're looking for? Crammer for delinquents is on my to read list.

Life skills has homeless!Harry who nonetheless manages to get by and evade capture for years, and is ambivalent when he does find out about the Wizarding world.

The author has a really interesting method of storytelling that's light and fun, and some really hilarious moments in their fics. They also have a long series I recommend on AO3 too.
