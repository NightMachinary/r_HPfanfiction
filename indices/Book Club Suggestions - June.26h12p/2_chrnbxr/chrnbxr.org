  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?

It's AU, and Harry is kind of powerful (but not nearly as powerful as those who are obviously his "betters"). It's extremely atmospheric, has a tiny bit of romance, and a shit ton of mystery. It'll keep you guessing until the end, it sure as hell did for me.
