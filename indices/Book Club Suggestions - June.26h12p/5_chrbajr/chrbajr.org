[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5460511/1/Ambient][Ambient]]? I haven't actually read it since mystery isn't really my thing but this would give me a good excuse.

Also I guess I have to throw [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/Renegade-Cause][Renegade Cause]] into the ring. I ended up really enjoying it but that didn't really start until I was about 200k words in or so which makes me wary of recommending it for the book club.
