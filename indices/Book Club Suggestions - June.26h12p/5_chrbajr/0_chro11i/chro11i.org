  Renegade Cause

Definitely a great mystery, though it is fairly romance heavy. I enjoyed the hell out of it (but then again, I'm a huge Harry/Tonks fan). Honestly, Renegade Cause could be a novel or series of novels all its own, with very little issue.

That said, it's 500k words. Maybe a bit long for the book club?
