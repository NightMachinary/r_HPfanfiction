[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5853767/1/Hunted][Hunted]] by Bex-chan is my recommendation. It's a Dramione story set Post-Hogwarts. The plot and writing were both excellent.

*Description:* Forced to work together when their old schoolmates start dying, Hermione & Draco must overcome their differences to solve the mysterious deaths. The tension in the office is getting rather...heated. Mature themes. 4years PostHogwarts/War. EWE. DMHG. Rated M, 191k words.
