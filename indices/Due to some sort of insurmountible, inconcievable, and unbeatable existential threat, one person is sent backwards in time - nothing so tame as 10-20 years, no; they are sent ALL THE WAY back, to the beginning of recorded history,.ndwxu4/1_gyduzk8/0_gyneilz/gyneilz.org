I haven't read that before, so I did when I saw this recommendation.

I really enjoyed the beginning and I thought it was gonna be one of my faves, when the mutants appeared and Harry became wolverine, I was a bit hesitant but I thought the author would be able to pull it off considering the previous chapters.

But then chapter 11 happened. I have no idea what the hell just happened. I thought it was an April Fools chapter. It wasn't. I got whiplash from how fast the plot became a train wreck. I'm kinda wondering if the author was replaced by somebody else lol. It became so weird I couldn't read the next chapters anymore.

Thanks for the rec though, I liked two-thirds of it!
