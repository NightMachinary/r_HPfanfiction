I like the concept, but the execution is absolute shit. That person should have taken to heart that "show, don't tell" is the golden rule of writing. Just reading about all the cool shit beth did as it's being summarized is... so incredibly disappointing.

Like, it's not even told from a side perspective /as it happens/, it's being summarized by someone who reads about it. Really bad writing.
