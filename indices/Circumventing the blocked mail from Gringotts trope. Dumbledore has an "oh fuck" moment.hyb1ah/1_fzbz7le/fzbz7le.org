"YOU! Old goat, why are you hiding my Gringotts mail from me?"

Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, Supreme Mugwump of the Wizengamot, and several other important titles, looked up from his desk at the first-year student that just walked into the office.

In his memory, he vaguely remembered a release-form from Gringotts disappearing into a stack of paperwork - most young students, especially Muggle-raised ones, happily let the Hogwarts staff tend to their finances while they were students.

A long-suffering sigh escaped the Headmaster's lips at the insult - despite Dumbledore's efforts, Dumbledore had accidentally done him many wrongs, though he'd always try to rectify them immediately. Harry, nevertheless, had taken to calling him "old goat" whenever a lapse of judgment made itself clear.

"Ah, Harry. I was wondering what I'd done to earn that scowl at dinnertime - at my age, one does forget things. Hang on a moment..."

A ten-minute rummage followed, after which a quick signature was placed on a form. Said form was then given to Harry to double-check - indeed, it was a release form for Harry to receive his monthly investment statements.\\
The form even included a request to magically disguise the post and place a Muggle-repelling charm on the envelope, so the Dursleys wouldn't steal it - the Headmaster had learned his lesson from the hundreds of acceptance letters that had to be written for one Harry James Potter.

"I must say, I rarely get students your age interested in their finances. Hogwarts' staff tends to invest for Muggle-raised students, to ensure they have a nest egg to make it through school. We'd done the same for your account, merely to ensure you wouldn't be surprised with an empty vault due to taxation and inflation - I hope we did an adequate job of it?"

Harry, remembering the amount he'd seen in his vault - seemingly never-ending piles of gold coins - deflated in his anger. He'd been quick in his judgement - in this case, it seemed, the Headmaster really was looking out for him.

"On another note, did you ever receive the Muggle-Raised Introductory Package? I recall Hermione Granger being quite cross at having to sift through a thick historical tome to find out about Wizarding Customs, and then having young Justin Finch-Fletchley tell her she should have received a leaflet..."

Meh, I tried. I feel like this one rambles on a bit and Dumbledore is quite out-of-character, but I did my best.
