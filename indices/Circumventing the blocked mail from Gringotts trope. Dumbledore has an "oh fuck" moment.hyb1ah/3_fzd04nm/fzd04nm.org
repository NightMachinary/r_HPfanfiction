I don't have the time to write it in prose at the moment, but here's how I see it going. Feel free to steal.

1. Indy!Harry confronts Dumbledore about blocking his mail. Dumbledore apologises and suggests sending an owl to Gringotts to unblock it.
2. Harry demands to use the floo to speak with them right then. Dumbledore agrees.
3. Harry does some "goblin greeting" (E.g., "May your cash flow like the blood of your foes, and may your galleons be stacked as high as their spleens.") which weirds out the goblin. Harry then demands all the mail that's been blocked. The Goblin agrees.
4. Before Harry leaves, Dumbledore gives him a cryptic warning to stay away from windows.
5. Harry, being his indy self, deliberately sits on the window sill of his Gryffindor tower dorm room.
6. Harry finds himself physically buried in owls carrying the years of accumulated mail.
