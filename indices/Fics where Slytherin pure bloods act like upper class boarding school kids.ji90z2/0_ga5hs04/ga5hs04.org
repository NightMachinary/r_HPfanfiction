This one....The Sacred 28 has a lot of the aristocratic upper class stuff in it. It's like a year after the 7th book so they aren't in school but Malfoy interacts with other Slytherins and you see all the different behaviors compared with Gryffindors/the Weasleys (more formalities, less expressive, not impulsive, more self preservation, emphasis on keeping up appearances) There are scenes were the Slytherin kids ditch parties with the adults to have their own parties and drink and dance. It's a Draco/Ginny fic.
