I'm a big fan of Harry/OC or Harry/Minor character. Some of the stories I enjoy the most are ones where this hypothetical OC or minor character get fleshed out and characterized incredibly well. Its part of why I enjoy the idea of Harry/Daphne, Harry/Katie, and Harry/Susan. The sky is the limit with any of those characters because there is little to no substantive backstory to any of them, but they have plot hooks that have a lot of potential (Slytherin and the sister of Astoria for Daphne, teammate and relatively unexplored Gryffindor for Katie who is also older than Harry, and the Hufflepuff connection for Susan).

EDIT: To add to this, I also enjoy these sort of pairings because they seem to feature less character bashing (at least in my experience). I can enjoy a Harry/Hermione story for sure, but those stories have a tendency to go all out dragging Ginny and Ron through the mud (especially Ginny).
