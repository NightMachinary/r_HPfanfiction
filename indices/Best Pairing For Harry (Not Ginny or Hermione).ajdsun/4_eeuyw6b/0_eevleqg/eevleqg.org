  and the Amelia Bones Hufflepuff connection for Susan
#+end_quote

Please don't write this, it takes so much away from a character if her most important trait is being a useful connection. Susan should be more than just a tool for Harry to get in touch with Amelia, yet I have never read a story where she was not exploited in that regard (outside of some plotless smut). I feel like writing a subversion where Susan does not get along with Amelia every time I come across one of those "Amelia Bones saves the day" type of stories.
