Well, she is a blank. You can write her in any way you want. If you need the DMLE connection, you can have her as a friend without Harry banging her because then you want to tell the story how the DMLE does something, not the character interactions between Harry and Susan.

Like I said above, I often feel like writing a story where Susan is fed up with Umbridge, her Aunt who always follows the rules to the letter and the Ministry as a whole and decides to seduce Harry in some half-cooked teenage rebellion scheme. Because clearly, the best way to stick it to the Ministry is to have their public enemy number one fondle her for a few minutes. Throw in some firewhiskey and the whole thing becomes a cracky, humorous and yet cleansing tale of +"How I met your mother"+ the continued resistance after the DA got disbanded.
