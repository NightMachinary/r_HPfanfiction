Isn't her aunt the only reason author's chose her over say, Hannah? I mean I get that her character should be more than "my aunt is head auror, marry me" but it's the only trait that makes her stand out. The defining reason for choosing Susan was just this. It makes sense that if the author includes Susan he goes down the rabbit hole of Amelia Bones, professional deus ex machina.

Of course any character that appears more than once should be more than a plot devise, and her not being exploited could be interesting.
