Harry/Fleur is my OTP - Hold that

Why - Fleur is at first hard and angry at Harry rather than Star struck and hero worshiping him, Harry's first meeting with Fleur was him handing her food and then staring at Cho, he literally doesn't care or realize she is part Veela. Their biggest problems with finding a mate that isn't entirely there to use them isn't something they have to worry about.

Fleur I feel is very passionate and fiery and stacked With Harry's Passion and Chivalry I think they make a powerful couple one that while having their arguments they would bend but not break. Fleur would most likely be the direction of the pair, leading Harry in how to do the most good. She would likely run a charity with the supposed Potter/Black Wealth setting up events and fundraisers, she would organize with other groups to do the most good and move the money in the needed ways. Harry would be the stoic hero running off to be a Auror when he definitely doesn't need to be. Harry would be able to have his own life while also doing the most good he can with Fleur's Help, Fleur would become more than a Trophy wife/house wife. They would become both nobodies to the general public while to those who know would be able to see the good they do. They end up being well rounded and impressive people and not figures.
