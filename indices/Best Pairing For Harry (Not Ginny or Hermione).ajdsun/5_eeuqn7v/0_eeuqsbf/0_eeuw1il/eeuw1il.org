If someone has an idea how Harry would react to waking up next to Lily, both of them naked and with a massive hangover (Easter holidays in her 6th year, after the Astronomy Tower), I have a plot idea. I just can't figure out how Harry would react.

I mean, Lily is fairly easy, time traveller I banged claims to be my child? Whatever, the "I will be dead in 4 years" part is way more worrying. But how does one write a meeting with the mother you never knew because she died when you were one?
