If we stick to canon, then Luna. But I would argue while she's very good for Harry, he is NOT GOOD for her:

- He never takes her imaginary creatures seriously. He is laughing at her, instead of with her. This is no basis for long term relationship unless he changes.
- He never considers Luna physically attractive. You just don't diss your potential romantic interest having “mad protuberant eyes” in your thoughts!
- He doesn't like girls who don't play Quidditch.

If we venture out in fanfics, then it all depends on the story and writing. I honestly don't care if he's paired with Andromeda, Astoria, Bellatrix, Cho, Daphne, Fleur, Katie, Lavender, Lily Evans, Muggle OC, Narcissa, Patil Twins, Susan, or Tonks.

On the other hand, I absolutely don't want to see that Ice Queen of Slytherin Daphne Greengrass, and pairing with Lily Evans requires some serious work. [[/u/autumnSouls][u/autumnSouls]]?
