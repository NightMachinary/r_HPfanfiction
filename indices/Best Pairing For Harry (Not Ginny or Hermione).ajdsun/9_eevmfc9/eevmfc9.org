For all that the HP series was written by a female author, it still seems to be aimed at the male audience. We don't see many well developed female characters at Hogwarts - it's basically Hermione, Ginny, and Luna. Some have recommended Katie, but isn't she with one of the twins? Just because I don't like the Harry/Ginny pairing doesn't mean I dislike the other canon pairings (Bill/Fleur, etc.). I don't mention any slash pairings mainly because there was no canon basis for him being slash.

I personally prefer for Harry to have a career, maybe take time off to travel and expand his horizons, and then meet some foreign witch to settle down with in his 30's or something.
