I mean I do like the canon pairings, but I can see I wouldn't get anywhere with that.

I can see Harry with a Quidditch girl - Katie, Angelina, Alicia, etc. He bonded with Cho over that, and he seemed to get along very well with the original Quidditch team. I can also see him with Tonks - he seems to find her funny and interesting, and they too bonded over broomsticks. She's just a tad too old for him, so it would have to be well after he left Hogwarts.

I can't see him with Luna because he just finds her too weird and I think he needs someone fairly grounded. I also don't think you can ever be with someone if you don't truly respect them, and he doesn't take any of her theories or conspiracies seriously. People always say they have something in common in both losing parents, but it was in entirely different circumstances and loss alone isn't enough to bond people imo. I also can't see him with any of the other Gryffindor girls as he seems to find them irritating.
