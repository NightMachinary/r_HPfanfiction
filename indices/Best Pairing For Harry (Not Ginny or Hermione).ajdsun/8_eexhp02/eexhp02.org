Ron.

No, seriously, I think Ron's pretty much Harry's ideal love interest. They have more genuine chemistry with each other than with anyone else, including Hermione or Ginny. They tell each other things that they don't tell anyone else, Harry's miserable when Ron isn't there, Ron was picked as "the person Harry would miss the most" in the Triwizard Tournament...

If Harry and Ron had been gay, OR if one of them had been a girl, then that's the pairing I would have gone for. I was marginally disappointed that my favourite Fem!Ron fic series, Weasley Girl, ended up not being Harry/Ronnie... but in that fic, Ronnie is a lesbian anyway.
