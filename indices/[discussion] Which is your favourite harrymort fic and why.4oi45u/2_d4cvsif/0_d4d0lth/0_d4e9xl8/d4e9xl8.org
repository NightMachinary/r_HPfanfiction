For explicit slash: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11538927/1/Mine][Mine]] linkffn(11538927) and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11685657/1/Hauntingly][Hauntingly]] linkffn(11685657) are new favs, even if the explicit slash bits are few and far between. Voldemort is still evil and still sort of insane, and Harry does not have a good time. By the same author, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11972693/1/No-Glory][No Glory]] linkffn(11972693) has only three chapters but looks like it might be what you are looking for too. I haven't read any other works by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6778783/ObsidianPen][ObsidianPen]] but having read your other comments here and those three works, it might be worth you having a look through them.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/658024][Consort]] linkao3(658024) is short but I think has a great evil Voldemort. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1485385][47 Days to Change]] linkao3(1485385) is a time travel where Harry tries to raise Tom right and fails spectacularly, resulting in a just as evil Voldemort in the present (future?), but isn't complete, and the slash so far has only shown up in the oneshot extra [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1850743][47 Days to Change- One-shot]] linkao3(1850743). I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8741238/1/The-Courtesan][The Courtesan]] linkffn(8741238) quite a while ago. From memory it had a reasonably evil Voldemort, but Harry was a bit useless and the writing is OK, but not great. If you can stand over powered Harry, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2378855][Stand Against the Moon]] linkao3(2378855) is worth a look too.

For fics which are not quite what you asked for but worth a look: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10182397/1/The-Nightmare-Man][The Nightmare Man]] linkffn(10182397) might be something like what you want. It doesn't really have a romantic relationship between Harry and Voldemort, and Harry is a very different character then in the books, and rather over the top, which can be a bit silly at times. Epic Solemnity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today][Death of Today]] linkffn(5402147) has a human looking sane Voldemort, so that may not be quite right either, but I tend to like Epic Solemnity's writing, and it is complete, which is always a plus. In the same vein, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7985679/1/To-the-Waters-and-the-Wild][To the waters and the wild]] linkffn(7985679) is an excellent fic, even if it isn't quite what you are after I think.

MPREG warning: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9591343/1/Some-Other-Beginning-s-End][Some other Beginings End]] linkffn(9591343) is good Harry/Voldemort(normal body restored about half way) but is sadly a one shot. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/526351][Je Souhaite]] linkao3(526351) is pretty good too, even if its isn't exactly deep and has a somewhat silly preg story line.

The Fictionist ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2227840/The-Fictionist][FFN link]], [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/The_Fictionist/works][AO3 link]]) does excellent characterization of Voldemort (and Tom too) but doesn't have explicit slash if that is what you were after. I couldn't finish [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/934466][Solace in Shadows]] linkao3(934466), but I have heard excellent things about how dark Tom is, without being an over the top dramatic prat. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2842724][Monster in the mirror]] linkao3(2842724) and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/966896][Love's Loathing]] linkao3(966896) feature Voldemort rather then Tom.
