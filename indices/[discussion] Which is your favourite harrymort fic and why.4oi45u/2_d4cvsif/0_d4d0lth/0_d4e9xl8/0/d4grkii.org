You are absolutely right in recommending me mine & hauntingly. It is so hard to find good harrymort because they are niche to begin with. I though I had read them all. Thank you for leading me to discover these. I think they will be a new fave for me as well. Hauntingly is still incomplete but I don't even care, so many good harrymorts are as well.
