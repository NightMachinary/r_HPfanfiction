  When Harry is kidnapped by a seemingly sixteen year old Tom Riddle at the end of his second year, he's convinced that he would do absolutely anything to escape -- but "anything" can be a dangerous conviction to have, and even heroes can grow tired of fighting without hope. Sometimes, survival means making a home in the dark...

Resigned to a life of servitude as a Courtesan, Harry is instead drawn under the wing of the Dark Lord himself. Between the scheming Order and his powerful benefactor, Harry finds himself steadily drawn deeper into the growing conflict. Eventual LV/HP.

  1) The Cruciatus Harry used in the Department of Mysteries was successful. 2) Voldemort arrived just a little bit early.Two small shifts, that change absolutely everything - and understanding is a more dangerous weapon than even Dumbledore could ever have imagined.

  He opened his mouth to speak, but he was cut off by an icy statement that caused the hairs on his entire body to stand erect. "I know what you are, Harry Potter... Death will never touch you." SLASH, HP/LV. Darkly disturbing and all sorts of twisted- a story of abduction, possession, and manic obsession. SEQUEL posted: Hauntingly

  This is a 'Harry travels back in time to raise Tom' story. An unfortunate tale of one man's failed attempt to mold young Tom into a decent, law-abiding citizen. Instead, as Fate will have it, young Tom grows up to become the same twisted psychopath, who is hell-bent on winning the love of his adoptive father. Harry's consent be damned.
