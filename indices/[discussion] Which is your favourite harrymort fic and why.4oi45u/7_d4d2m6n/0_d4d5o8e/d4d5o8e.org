Don't yuck my yum

Seriously though I don't really romanticize this pairing. The dynamic can be really fascinating though and it takes a certain kind of writer to do it well. I'm into gory morbid stuff. Works for me.

Also, Voldemort is written as being really good with magic but it's seldom demonstrated in other fics. Harrymort fics tend to go into really fantastic magical theory and stuff.
