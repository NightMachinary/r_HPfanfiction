I'm on cellphone so can't find story numbers, only names I'd say brainstorm001's three works, Mirrored, The cave incident and The love incident. All harrymort, no tommary. For me, the most important part is Voldemort won't become a "good" people easily. He's a villain, and he won't change into a tender, caring, moral people in a second. He is also unlikely to fall in love very quick and recognize that immediately. The author gets those right.
