I've never read that (Hit the ground running) before, will give it a try. The only horcrux wake up fic I've read as one that eventually turned into HP/LV/SS. It was interesting... But it wasn't on the big sites like Ao3 or ffn so I can't even remember the name anymore nor find it.

Again and again is great. Is it finished?
