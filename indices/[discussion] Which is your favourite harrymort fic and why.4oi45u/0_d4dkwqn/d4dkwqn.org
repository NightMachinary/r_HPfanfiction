mmm... there's linkffn(Again and Again) but other than that I can't really enjoy any of it.

I will say that I got excited at first because I thought you were talking about where the Horcrux in Harry's head wakes up, like in "Hit the Ground Running", which I love, but the slash normally goes a place I don't want to go. I've tried to read a fair few, too, but usually either the writing or the story logic is bad enough that I nope out of it fairly quickly.
