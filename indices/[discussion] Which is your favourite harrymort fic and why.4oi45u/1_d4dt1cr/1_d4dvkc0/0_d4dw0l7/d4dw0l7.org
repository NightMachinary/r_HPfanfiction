I consider that fic well written from beginning to end, so maybe the author's style just isn't for you. It's been a while since I read it though, so it could be that the beginning is rougher than I remember. It was still readable by my standards, which is pretty high since my tolerance for ick fic is basically zero nowadays.

I'm pretty sure I've read In Somnos Veritas. That's the one where they show up in each other's dreams, right? And Voldemort gives Harry a gift that follows him into reality? And is incomplete?
