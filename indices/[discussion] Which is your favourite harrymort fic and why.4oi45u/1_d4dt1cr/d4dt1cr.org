I'm a bit surprised that linkffn(A Snake Named Voldemort) hasn't come up yet. It's the first Harrymort fic I ever read and the fic that turned me into this pairing in the first place. I've never seen another like it, where Harry isn't inexplicably totally dark, there's no light bashing or dark apologist weeaboo crap, doesn't pretend political airs, where Voldemort is actually redeemed by love and yet still visibly himself.

It's also well written and quite amusing. The author is talented enough to have also written the only mpreg fic (not the one above, but also Harrymort) I've ever liked.
