Harry Potter and the Children of Change, spoilers. I'm just a few chapters in, can I just ignore the abuse of the Dursely's in this or is it central to the plot/development? Because it is slightly over the top, I pretty much lost it at 'breaking a few ribs for waking Vernon up, as was standard practice for Harry's nightmares.'... what? lol
