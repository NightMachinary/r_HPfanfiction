Yeah! That's the one, to be honest I thought the elf plot line was a bit much. It would be better as a main conflict. In the end Jerry and Tom finding out about it as like a final plot twist felt a bit rushed and anticlimactic all the same, with the thing with the mind control virus they had going on.
