Can't decide between the abandoned stories I read and liked despite knowing better, but there is a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2814526/1/All-Through-the-Night][time travel]] story that cries for a sequel and never got one.

If that doesn't count.. hmmm [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1898314/1/Angel-of-Light-I][Angel of Light I]] (It's german, from the time when I hadn't switched over to reading english fanfictions :D - Harry wakes up in a parallel world, where Sirius and Severus are together and adopted him, the Malfoys are his godparents, he is best friends with Draco, Hermione and Ron and together with Draco. He's also the heir of Gryffindor and Slytherin, and Voldemort is already dead. And the "him" from that world is in an "inbetween" world and he can talk to him. It was really great how Harry got the chance for a normal life and adapts to the different persons that look the same as in this world, which leads to a lot of hilarious scenes etc, and damn it, the title is Angel of Light I (ONE. Like in, more parts planned. And the author never even finished the first part)) So yeah, probably that - if I can include "parts 2 to x" into the "is suddenly finished".
