[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5318075/1/A-Magical-World][Surprised noone's said it but A Magical World]] by Miranda Flairgold.

Despite the fact that by chapter 10 it's basically an original work.

EDIT: changed my mind, i's rather read the rip-off [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8491588/1/Snow-Point][Snow Point]]. It's got roughly the same idea but with a more streamlined story, Hermione goes too (the year after iirc) and Harry stays Harry Potter.
