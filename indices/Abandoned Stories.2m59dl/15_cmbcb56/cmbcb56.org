[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5755130/6/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lords-of-Magic-I][Lords of Magic]], by Taure.

We barely see most of it, so maybe that's cheating, but what is seen is a very enthralling transformation of the magical world in a very interesting and believable way. And the googledoc he gave out (which I won't link because it's posted semi-privately, but you can find it near the end of the DLP WBA thread) reveals a really awesome plot, even if the first year or so wouldn't have worked out as well.

I get why he stopped, but I'd love to read the whole thing.
