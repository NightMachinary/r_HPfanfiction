I have no doubt the fics I want finished are going to be posted by other people, so I'mma let them handle those.

Instead I'm going to go for one I don't think is going to get much attention.

[[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600021832][Mad Snorkacks and Englishmen]].

I was so invested in this fic as I read along. I first found it on Quidditch pitch, and then found that there was an additional 12 chapters on AFF. While normally I'm not that into smut in my fanfiction, I actually got very emotionally invested in this fic. Salon really knows how to write, even if her sex scenes can squick me out a bit. At a certain pointed later in the series, I was actually crying.

I've never been tempted to finish anyone's work by myself, because I'm a mediocre writer at best. That said, if I could commission Salon and pay her $1000 to finish this fic, I probably would.

Also, because I don't play by the rules, I'm going to list a second fic.

I think this one really doesn't need much comment. That said however, the author has plenty of his own original fiction published and it's all /really really good/. [[http://joeducie.net/the-reminiscent-exile/][The Reminiscent Exile]] actually reads quite a bit like a spiritual successor to Wastelands & Heartlands. Can't say how happy he'd be to find the books linked next to some smut from AFF, but he's associated DLP in the credits, can't be that bad!
