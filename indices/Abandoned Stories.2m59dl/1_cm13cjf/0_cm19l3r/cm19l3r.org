I imagine by chapter 473 the pair would be going back to the Big Bang to design their own universe from scratch, and by chapter 512 they'd ascend to higher plane of existence thus making the rest of the (infinitely unfolding) story incomprehensible to us.

p.s. When I reached the story's current end it felt like it stopped because it had outgrown its current author---like /willyolioleo/ had no idea what should be a realistic behaviour for an Unspeakable agent, as an example.
