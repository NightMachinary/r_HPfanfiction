As much as I understand and sympathize with this point of view, as someone who recently started writing a long-form piece, it's kind of a bummer, since it seems like many people are on the same page as you.

A big part of the enjoyment of writing for me is feedback, response, audience participation, stuff like that. Kind of a Catch-22 - if zero people paid attention to what I was writing, I'd be much more likely to abandon it.
