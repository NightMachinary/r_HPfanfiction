The comments about surviving non-magical venoms does suggest a higher level of innate resilience, however. Also supported by surviving Quidditch injuries which would be instantly fatal to Muggles and Fantastic Beasts comments about Muggle fragility compared to wizards.

It appears to be a mix of the two: wizards are more physically resilient than Muggles AND where that higher resilience is insufficient, they also have superior medical capabilities.
