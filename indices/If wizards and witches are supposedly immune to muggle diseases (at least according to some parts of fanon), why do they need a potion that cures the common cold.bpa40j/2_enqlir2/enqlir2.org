I we ignore the fanon, I don't think Canon ever said something like that. I always saw it as "Wizard can catch Muggle Illness, but they can magically heal them so quickly even the worst disease is a passing annoyance for them".

Also I guess they don't heal Muggle because they don't care (this is a prime example of "They would annoy us to deal with all their problems"), and giving a potion to a muggle probably count as a breach of the Statute of Secrecy.
