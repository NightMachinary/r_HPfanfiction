Very fun read lol, but isn't Sue Li's name Su Li? Are you implying she's a Sue? :O (Or more like outright saying it lol)

also you missed an 'e' in legume

also "We'd all be so suspicious that he's a spy for the British Government we'd never even suspect him of being a British spy!" is a bit too nonsensical, even for Luna :P
