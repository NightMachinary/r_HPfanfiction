Well, it's a crossover and not that good, but there is one I can think of. Harry ends up in an Age, called the Second Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past...

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Joining of Destinies by Kalistar).

I think the author asserts it is travel to the past, but based off all the clues in the original series, it is definitely the future. Kinda. Wheels man, wheels.
