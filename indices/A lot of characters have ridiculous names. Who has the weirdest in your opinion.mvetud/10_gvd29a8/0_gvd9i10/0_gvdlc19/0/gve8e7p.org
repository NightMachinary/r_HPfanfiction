Argus is most famously known as a monster with a hundred eyes that you could never sneak around because only some of the eyes were sleeping at a time and he had 360 degrees vision. The eyes of Argus usually refers to subjecting someone to extreme scrutiny. Argus is also the builder of the Argos ship and in some myths Odysseus's dog is also called Argus (but most often Argos). Based on other patterns, I think she was thinking of the monster.
