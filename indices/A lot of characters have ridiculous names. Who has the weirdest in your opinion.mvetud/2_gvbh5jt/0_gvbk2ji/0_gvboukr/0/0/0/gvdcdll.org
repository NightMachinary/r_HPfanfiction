I'm so sorry but I don't think I do. It was weird because the werewolf attack was really brutal and violent and then they were like â€˜we'll just obliviate him and he wont be traumatised anymore' so I didn't bookmark it, but I think the premise of them literally taking their name from them when they get bitten is very believable
