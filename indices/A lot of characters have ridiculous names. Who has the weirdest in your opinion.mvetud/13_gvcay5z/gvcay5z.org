Fleamont Potter: But I like JKR's humor, because she even said that this guy became a great duelist since so many made fun of his ridiculous name

Tom Marvolo Riddle is also an anagram for "Mr Tom a Dildo Lover". This guys must have gone through endless repetitions of dildo related names before finally getting to "I am Lord Voldemort"

Malfoy means bad faith in French. The Malfoys thoroughly fucked over Voldemort through their selfish actions. These guys would betray anyone and anything to save their own hides, and I'm actually glad they started out in bad guys' camp

Ginevra is the Italian form of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinevere][Guinevere, wife of king Arthur]]. I find it creepy that Arthur Weasley named his daughter that way. If JKR is determined to name Weasley kids after royalties, Anne, Charlotte, Emma, Elizabeth, and Victoria are decent choices. Or to go really exotic, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86thelfl%C3%A6d][Aethelflaed]] was a great British warrior queen.

Remus Lupin, already mentioned here, is just screaming to be the wolf guy.

I don't think Sirius' middle name is mentioned in canon, but fanon generally calls him Sirius Orion Black, which makes his initial SOB.

"Mione" was only mentioned once in canon, and that was when Ron spoke with a full mouth. Hermione on the other hand is nowhere near that rare, even a member of HBP's production team has it. Her name can be seen in the ending credits. The French do love that name though, as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_ship_Hermione][12 of their warships]] were named Hermione. One of them fought in the American Revolutionary War, and has [[https://www.hermione.com/en/home/][a nice replica built in 2014]]. The British Royal Navy had 4 HMS Hermiones.
