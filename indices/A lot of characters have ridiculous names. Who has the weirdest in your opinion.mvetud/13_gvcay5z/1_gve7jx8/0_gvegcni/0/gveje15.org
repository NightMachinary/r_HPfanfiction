I think the original legend has Agamemnon also uses Menelaus and Helena as an excuse to attack Troy. According to the oath the other kings made, it was Menelaus's right to invoke their help, yet it's Agamemnon that leads the troops. Menelaus and Helena reconcile, but Agamemnon has a pretty brutal end.
