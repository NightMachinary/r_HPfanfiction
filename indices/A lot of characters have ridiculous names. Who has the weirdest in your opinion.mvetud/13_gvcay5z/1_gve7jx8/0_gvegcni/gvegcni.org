Menelaus got bashed into oblivion in 2004 version of [[https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0332452/][Troy]]. He and his scumbag brother Agamemnon were only using Helen as a pretext for their aggression and greed. Unlike in the original Iliad, where Menelaus and Helen had a happy ending together, he was butchered by Hector here.

I like this version a lot better than the original.
