lol, actually, my favourite theory is when Harry and Ginny name Al that just to annoy Snape. Imagine Al being called to Minerva's office and she calls him,

"ALBUS!" And then Dumbledore comes and says (He can't see Al)

"What is it Minerva dear?" Minerva waves him off and continues to shout,

"SEVERUS!" Severus wakes up (he was sleeping) and he bellows,

"What the bloody damn hell is wrong with you woman?!" Minerva again waves him off.

"POTTER!" Then Sev and Albus look at each other, shocked, then, they both say at the same time,

"Potter named his son after me?"

"Harry named his so after me?" I think you can guess who said what.

Of course, Sev says it with disgust and mutters off saying,

"Of course, Potter can't even leave me alone even during death. Stupid Potters"
