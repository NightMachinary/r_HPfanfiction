I meant Albus and Severus. Both of them harmed him grievously and intentionally.

Arguably James and Lily for not fleeing the country when an unstoppable terrorist aimed to kill their kid. I mean, that was damned stupid of them. James was rich; take a freakin' holiday somewhere far away!

And also arguably Sirius for going after the rat rather than taking care of his duty as godfather to an orphaned kid.

The only one who didn't do ANYTHING wrong that Harry named a kid after was Luna. Also oddly enough the only one not dead.
