Dude. Snape's probably the most hate-able character in the HP-verse other than Umbridge. He's worse than Fudge, Voldemort, Malfoy, Dumbledore, or the Dursleys. I don't give half a shit if he was "protecting" Harry to atone for getting his high school crush killed; he was still a miserable shit to not just Harry, but an entire generation of kids from three out of four Houses. And we see it in great detail for six books. Voldemort's a fart in the wind compared to that.
