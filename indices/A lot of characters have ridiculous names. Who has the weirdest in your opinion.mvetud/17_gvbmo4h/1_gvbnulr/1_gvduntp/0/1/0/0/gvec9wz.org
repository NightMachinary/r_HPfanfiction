You have a source on your wild assertions? A poll done by Bloomsbury of over 70.000 people found Snape to be the favorite character, with 13000 votes. Nowhere is there any indication over the type of people who liked Snape. You pulled that out of your ass.

And even /if/ it were true (it isn't), it would still disprove your assertion about Snape being "the second most hate-able character after Umbridge". Tween girls are people too.
