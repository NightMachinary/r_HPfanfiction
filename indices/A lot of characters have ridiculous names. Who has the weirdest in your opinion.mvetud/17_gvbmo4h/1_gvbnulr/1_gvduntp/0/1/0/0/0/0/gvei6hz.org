Are you trolling? Your "source" is the stories that came up when you looked up fanfiction.net? That's the most dubious shit I've ever seen. Do you apply this logic to other types of analysis?

Your assertion was not, in fact, that Snape and Draco where terrible people. It was that Snape was the second most hate-able character in the franchise. If that where true, you would expect him to be terribly unpopular. He isn't. In fact, polls show exactly the opposite. He's the most popular character. So your assertion was false. Unless you can present sufficient evidence to counter mine, this isn't debatable. This isn't literary interpretation, these are empirical claims.

I won't debate Snape's morality with you, as you hate him so much it is impossible to have a serious discussion, as it would not be in good faith. You have unironically stated that Snape is a worse person than Voldemort. You are either intentionally lying, or so deluded as to be completely detached from reality. So there is no point in debating you. You can have the last word.
