Firstly, who the fuck needs "sources" for opinions? What, you think this is worth a dissertation or something? Second, if you think anyone who disagrees with your generally hostile diatribes is "trolling", maybe you should look in the mirror. Finally, you want sources?

Are they randomly found opinions on the internet? Yes. Because so are all the polls and sources that you haven't provided but still use repeatedly as "evidence". You haven't provided even as much as I have, so kindly shut up about "sufficient evidence to counter mine".

I think it's honestly funny that you of all people are talking about good faith debates as if that's what you've been doing. You've spewed bile all over this thread from the get-go, calling anyone who disagreed with you "detached from reality" people who have "abandon[ed] all reading comprehension" and are spreading "wild assertions" and "dubious shit". Oh, wait, "detached from reality" TWICE even, because you lack the creativity to come up with too many new insults within one day. If anyone's a troll on this entire post, it's unambiguously you, so just sit down and be good now, you angry little boy.
