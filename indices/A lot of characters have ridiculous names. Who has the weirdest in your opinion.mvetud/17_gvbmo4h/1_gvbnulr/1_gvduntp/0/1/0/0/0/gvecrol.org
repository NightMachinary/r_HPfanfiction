I "pulled it" out of looking through sites like fanfiction.net and seeing 80% of the stories consisting of the type that I listed. Stories off of that site have even higher preponderance of trashy slash-fics. And tween girls may be people, too, but they have notoriously bad taste for "bad boys" who "need to be saved" or whatever. Both Snape and Draco somehow fall into that category, despite both being objectively terrible people. (Note: I'm not saying that Snape wasn't brave. He was certainly that. But he was also horrible. People don't have to be just one thing, and doing a single noble thing in his life doesn't make up for all the bad things he did or does on a daily basis.)
