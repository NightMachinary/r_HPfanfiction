Is he? Harry's the one who goes after him in Sorceror's Stone, not the other way around. Twice, even. In Chamber of Secrets a device he made decades prior goes after Ginny, and Harry destroys it. Ghost-Riddle's absolutely NOT aiming at Harry, and was in fact surprised to see him in the Chamber; and real-Voldy only find out what happened from Malfoy much later.

The only times he tries to kill Harry without being targeted himself are in book 4, AFTER Harry has attacked him in book 1; in book 5 when Harry attacks his people; and in book 7 when Harry's conducting a guerilla war against him. Most of the aggro comes from Harry, at Dumbledore's urging. Dumbledore's the one who keeps saying how horrible Voldemort is, and targeting Harry at him. If not for that, it's possible that Voldemort would have still targeted him, but probably not until much later. Harry brought most of that down on himself.
