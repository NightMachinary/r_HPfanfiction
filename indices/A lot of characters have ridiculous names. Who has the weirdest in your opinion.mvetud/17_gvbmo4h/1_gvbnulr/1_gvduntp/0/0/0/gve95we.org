To Harry, Snape is a weekly, sometimes daily menace. He's always there, always causing problems. Voldemort is a vague, distant menace most of the time. He killed parents Harry never knew. He possessed a teacher and a student in Harry's first two years. It's only at the end of fourth year that he becomes a real, present danger.

Harry didn't know those countless people he killed, so to Harry Voldemort is just this guy who did a lot of damage in his parents' generation. He's the bin Laden of today's high school graduates. Was he a bad guy? Yeah. Did he hurt people? Yeah. Is he there every single day looming over you personally, fucking with your life and that of your friends and classmates? Nope, not at all.
