Eh, it's toss up really. They're both rare names, that's for sure, however, Dudley was certainly the better known of the two. When Dudley was named Dudley Moore was fairly well known and definitely getting into his stride in films (which is not to mention the nearly two decades he was on TV before that). In contrast the only time most people would have heard of the name Hermione would have been reading Shakespeare in school.

Personally I've know a Dudley, I've never met a Hermione.

As mentioned they're rare names. I wouldn't really call either name actually weird, but of the two Hermione is certainly the most unusual, particularly when coming from non-magical parents.
