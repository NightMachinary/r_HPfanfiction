Honestly, Hermione has probably got the 'weirdest' name, in context. Magicals have a reason for their unusual naming conventions. That being that they're magical, and because of that they have a different historical context to draw from.

Hermione, with her non-magical parents, is an unusual name, in that it's so rare. Her name is the sort of name where if you met a Hermione in real life (at least before that HP books were published anyway), that Hermione would likely be the /only/ Hermione you'd ever meet.

That said though, an explanation of her name at least makes sense.

What doesn't make sense is the amount of seeming nominative determinism there is in the magical world. In Hogwarts alone, there are at least five teachers who have names that directly relate to what they teach (Pomona Sprout, Aurora Sinistra, Bathsheda Babbling, Septima Vector, Sybill Trelawney). Not to mention the dozens of named magicals that have names relating some aspect of themselves, whether they're writers of in universe books, their profession or simply what they are.

While nominative determinism is 'a thing' in reality, it's certainly not so strongly correlated as is depicted in the books.
