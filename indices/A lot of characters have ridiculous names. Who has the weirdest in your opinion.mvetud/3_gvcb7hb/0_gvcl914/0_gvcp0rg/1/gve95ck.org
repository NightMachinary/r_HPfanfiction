He's a parody and protest vote that accurately takes the piss out of and displays what an utter shit-show our politics are. He's awesome, lol.

No matter who you vote for (Conservative or Labour), they're still the same self-serving pricks with a different face.

Green Party? Unrealistic goals and aims and they want you to live in mud huts.

BNP? Literally British Nazi Party.

UKIP? Ineffectual and limp -- and they're the better choice of the lot!

SNP? Led by a deluded cow that even her own people hate. Hell-bent on leaving the UK despite the fact it'd literally destroy Scotland's economy in a month.

That Welsh Party (can't pronounce because it's in fecking Welsh)? Pretty much only cares for Wales. Nothing really wrong about these guys, to be honest?

Liberal Democrats? You're better off trying to fuck a rusty hole full of razors -- they'll fuck you over harder if they ever get in power again.

Independents? Yeah, pretty much the same as an Independent candidate in American politics.

And that's not even getting into Irish politics (North Ireland and Eire).

Frankly, we'd be better off if the Queen had all our politicians (except Count Binface) booted head-first into the Thames at high-tide.
