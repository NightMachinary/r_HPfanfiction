I'm not going to get into an ideological argument, it's quite clear that you have nothing sensible to say and are just parroting whatever you read in the Daily Fail.

I'm lucky enough to have an EU passport and I can't wait to fucking use it, even though my Irish side are struggling massively because of the division Brexit has caused there. Have fun paying Â£70 for the papers to send a parcel abroad, maybe have a look around and see if you can find a flag to fuck, and Farage lives near me if you're looking for an arsehole to lick.
