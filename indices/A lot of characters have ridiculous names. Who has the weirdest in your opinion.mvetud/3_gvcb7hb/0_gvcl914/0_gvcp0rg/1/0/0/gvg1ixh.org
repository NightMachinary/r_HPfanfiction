Best of the worst, basically. And that's saying something smh.

Labour? Antisemitic communists. Corbin can go swallow bleach.

Conservatives? Given how much they about-heel on their word and have constantly betrayed the public every Election? I'd rather trust my bank details to Loki himself.

UKIP are just assholes that started off with a good goal (get out of the EU), but they degraded and then imploded with self-serving greed and lies.

So, yeah. Best of the worst.

Frankly, our entire government structure is corrupt to the core -- not surprising with how long it's been standing for.
