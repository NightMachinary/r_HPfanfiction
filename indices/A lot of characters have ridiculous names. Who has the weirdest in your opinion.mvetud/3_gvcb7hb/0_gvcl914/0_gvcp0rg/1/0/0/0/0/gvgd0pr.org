Oh, please: the "xenophobia" buzzword to something you don't like.

Okay, hotshot -- where exactly have I been xenophobic in my post? Have I called any ethnicity or national from another country anything negative? Have I been antisemitic, or did I call Labour out on being antisemitic? For calling out the various parties' typical MOs every fucking year? That they constantly lie to people and do about heel-turns as soon as they're elected? That's life and the sorry state of our government mate, not "xenophobia".

That Labour isn't disgustingly antisemitic (pro tip: the people at the top are)? That the Conservatives are as trustworthy as someone saying, "Hey kid, you wanna see a dead body?" That the Green Party are so obsessed with "going green" that'd they'd ruin the economy and nation while doing so, due to being completely short-sighted? That the SNP are actually disliked by most Scotts because of how crazy they and their leader are? That the BNP aren't British Nazis? If you want xenophobia mate, go look at the BNP and elements of UKIP.

You just knee-jerk reacted to my saying that UKIP is the best of the worst in my opinion -- and given the state of our political system, that's like saying diving into a septic tank is better than diving into a city sewer.

Or is it because you're a Remoaner and I'm someone who happily voted for Brexit, despite the costs, because the EU is a dumpster fire that won't last another five--ten years unless a) they federalize (not going to happen -- Germany and France giving up sovereignty? Hah!) or b) change Germany's material good export policies towards the rest of the EU, which is benefiting Germany and Germany only at an unsustainable rate and at the expense of the rest of the EU nations, which won't happen because then Germany loses a massive benefit? That it was better to lop an arm off and deal with the trauma then than remain and slowly die of blood poisoning as the EU crumbles over time?

But, xenophobia? Pft. Use those two brain cells of yours for a change. kthxbye.
