You're deluded if you think we're better off out the EU than in. As if being born in Britain makes us superior to anyone else. The economy has fucking tanked because of Brexit and we have literally nothing to offer except a few more fish that we're going to have to export anyway because barely anyone eats them here.

Lorries stacked up to London, restricted movement, poorer security, less investment, insane export prices, risked jobs and business opportunities, for what, sovereignty?

Ironic how you're in a HP subreddit when the whole message of the books is acceptance and fighting to protect the disadvantaged.
