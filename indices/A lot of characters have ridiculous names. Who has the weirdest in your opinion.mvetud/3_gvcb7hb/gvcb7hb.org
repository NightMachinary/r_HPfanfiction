I used to think Cornelius Fudge was a ridiculous name for a politician. Who tf was voting for Mr Fudge?

Then when I got older, I realised that the political use of "fudge" as a verb absolutely sums up Minister Fudge's behaviour:

"present or deal with (something) in a vague or inadequate way, especially so as to conceal the truth or mislead."
