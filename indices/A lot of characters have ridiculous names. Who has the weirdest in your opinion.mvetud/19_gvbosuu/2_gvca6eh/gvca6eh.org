I knew because my mom somehow knew, despite not being a native English speaker (she might have looked it up or something idk) and when I first started the series, I was the age where I couldn't really read on my own, so she read the first two books to me. Once I started reading on my own, I just kept pronouncing it the same way in my head.

I have a friend who I recently learned pronounced it “Her-Mee-Own” until she saw the movies.
