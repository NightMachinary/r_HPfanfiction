A realistic story of how a xenophobic mass murderer manages to woo a stick-up-her-ass bookworm who is of the group that said murderer murders, and not only that but is about twenty to thirty years younger than her. Oh, and they're both heterosexual to begin with.

Also, there needs to be torture and kidnapping elements to it.

If you can manage to write this story, and have it be believable, and well written, I will believe in god and reincarnation , because there is no way that anyone short of Shakespeare could possibly work this into some sort of working plot.
