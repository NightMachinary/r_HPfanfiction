So, it's been a while since I read it, but I vaguely recall enjoying [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7755315/1/Those-Gilded-Chains-We-Wear][Those Gilded Chains We Wear]]. I don't remember whether it's well written or believable, just general outline of the story.

There's no kidnapping or torture per se, but Bella is quite violent towards Hermione and they are forced to stay together.

Little warning: it hasn't been updated since 2012 and sits at ~290k words. You might want to give it a try, there's so little Bella/Hermione fics you are bound to read it someday anyway.

Edit: My bad about state of updates, must have confused it with another fic.
