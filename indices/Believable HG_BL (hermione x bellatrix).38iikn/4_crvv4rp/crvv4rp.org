I'll bite - I thought [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]] was solid. Well-written and relatively believable, in context (assuming you are willing to accept the very AU premise). It's been a while since I read it, but I remember enjoying it well enough. It doesn't have evil!Bellatrix, but there's a solid plot and lots happening.
