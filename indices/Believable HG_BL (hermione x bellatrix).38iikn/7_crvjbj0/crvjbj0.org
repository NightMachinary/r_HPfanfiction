So you want a "believable" version of something ridiculously outrageous??

What would that even look like?? I can see at least three problems with this:

- They're both heterosexual
- There is an enormous age difference
- There is the whole muggleborn vs death eater thing.

Any one of these would be a hard sell by itself and would already qualify as unbelievable, to do all three at the same time would just be impossible whilst still giving a fuck about their characters.

  I'm really looking for something like delende este

"Delenda est" (not "delende este") is not something I would qualify as believable but rather as outrageously AU.
