There's this awesome fic called ''Impossible'' by PerfectPride in FF.Net and it has: torture, violence and a valid reason to bring these two women together (ancient magic and whatnot) - plus, it's well written.\\
I agree that ''Time Heals All Wounds'' by brightsilverkitty is good as well, but... it takes a different approach. It's kind of sweet, cute, sad and amazing and made me cry - it was a fantastic read.
