Well no- the blood magic isn't tied to Dudley either. It is explicitly tied to Petunia and Petunia alone. It is Dumbledore who does some spell we are never privy to - tying Lily's sacrifice to her last remaining blood relative - her sister. Vernon and Dudley could have left and all that would matter is that Harry stayed with Petunia.

Also legally - Marge has no connection to Harry. She's not a blood relative in any way. Our own world would never place Harry in her home.

If the Dursley's died, Dumbledore would've placed Harry in a middling wizarding home. Probably the Longbottoms where Augusta would've been a strict caregiver wont to succumb to the fame of a child.
