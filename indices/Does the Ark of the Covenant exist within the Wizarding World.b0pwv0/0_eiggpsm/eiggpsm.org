WELL in my fanfic, Fight For Rights, Pandora's Box is real - except it doesn't hold vague "evil of the world," it's actually a dimensional prison for all the demons of the world, and that's the explanation for why we have myths about demons, but mysteriously have no demons in modern times. :) And of course, not every demon stuffed into the Box was a criminal, and not even the criminals deserve eternity stuffed into an empty black voidspace. It's itty bitty living space, all cramped together with nothing.
