Are you cool with one shots? I've found the best fem Harry's are one-shots:

“Snaca.” Accidental animagus found by the Malfoys: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10932105]]

“Harriet Potter is....” Honestly one my favorite fanfics ever. Slytherin Harry while still remaining true to his book character. Has excellent literally allegories. Made me cry: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6109822]]

“Charlotte the Great and Powerful”. How all of the men in Charlotte's life made her into the woman she is. Don't let the relationship tags throw you off. It isn't weird smut. Another of my favorite fanfics: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3694820]]

“How Severus Snape Became An Unwilling Maurader”. Self promotion. Silly little story I wrote. Harry/Draco. It isn't my best, but it wasn't meant to be anything serious. Gryffindor Harry. She magically photoshops Draco onto the Backstreet Boys at one point: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22075219]]

There are a few ongoing longer pieces that I am subscribed to if you want them too.
