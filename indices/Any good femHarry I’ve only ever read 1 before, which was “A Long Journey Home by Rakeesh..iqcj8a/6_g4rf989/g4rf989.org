Okay now for the long ones!

[certain dark things ](archiveofourown.org/works/16940712)

Marvolo Gaunt is the Minister of Magic and Tom Slytherin is the History Professor at Hogwarts. (While it hasn't been confirmed yet, I think it's horcruxes running wild and against each other). Muggleborns are placed with magical families, and Hermione is sent to the Malfoys bc of her stellar grades. Harry is a tomboy with a dirty mouth and collects snakes like Mrs Figg collects cats. Sirius Black has a daughter that grew up in a nunnery orphanage and was treated a la Tom Riddle. I know it sounds crazy and busy and ridiculous, but it's really, really good. The characters are multi-faceted, NOT MARY SUES and ACTUALLY ACT THEIR AGE which is rare in fanfics. Currently just started Azkaban.

Harry accidentally time travels to Voldemort's fifth year. Chaos and hilarity ensue. She's the only one who doesn't give a fuck about any of the political bullshit and Tom can't help but admire her for it. Definitely AU but still a good read! Incorporates British mythology more than canon. Harry is a bit Mary Sue here but that's part of the plot. She's trying to figure out wtf happened to her. Suspicious Dumbledore, but no super bashing.

I just started this one but it seems promising. Voldemort figures out that she's a horcrux after fifth year and goes back to find them all.
