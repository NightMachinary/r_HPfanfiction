I am not sure that's the story you are talking about, but I read one a while ago. It's called The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles, and it sounds pretty similar. I don't remember about animagus transformation tho.

Edit: I just checked. He is a magpie, and Dumbledore is bashed. The fanfic is on Archive of Our Own.
