Honestly, Deprived linkffn(7402590). It's filled with cliches (mega-wands, wrong BWL, mega angst etc) the dialogue is dodgy as hell, especially when Harry speaks. Also to add on top of that he has a living emotion called Hate, tames a fucking dragon and gets fealty from some random Japanese woman for no reason because author is a weab. Also the bounty hunter names are just cheesy.

However, up to the parts before the Japanese woman appeared I found that it was an enjoyable read, and though far from a good story, it was like my guilty pleasure.
