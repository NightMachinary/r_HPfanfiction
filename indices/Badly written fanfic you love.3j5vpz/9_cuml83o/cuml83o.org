Not so much badly written grammatically but by age 11 Harry is mentally like 40 with an insane amount of education from a time compressed training session in Japan guided by his ghost future self. Really shows when he goes to Hogwarts with the rest of his stupidly OP year (cause why wouldn't everyone go?) and humiliates Dumbledore on the second day and Voldemort is neutered pretty quick the ...nothing My cause the author realised there's nowhere to go. Then the fics abandoned because the author wanted to write a really creepy sexist harem fic.
