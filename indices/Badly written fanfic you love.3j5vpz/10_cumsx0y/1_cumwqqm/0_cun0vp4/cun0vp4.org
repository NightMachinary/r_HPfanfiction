/Almost/ every fic. If you've ever read any amount of professional literature, most fanfiction hurts to read. It's still fun, but my god if it isn't tough to slog through baby's-first-story just to get my fix of the HP universe.

There are still gems out there, though. Some fanfiction is really, really good, even surprisingly so. Finding those never fail to make a day much brighter.
