I have a few!

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13791684/chapters/31705119][The Care and Keeping of Percival Graves]] by petofi - post 1st FB movie, it's a Jacob and Percival Graves friendship fic, with Queenie/Jacob pairing.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1033038][The Pajama Game]] series by petofi - covers pre and post 1st FB movie, it's a cute (fluffyish) series that focuses on the Percival/Theseus pairing.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8854672/chapters/20304142][Unconsolable]] by Change the Circumstance - post 1st FB, Percival/Theseus, mainly focuses on how Pervical recovers from being held prisoner by Grindelwald. Some angst, but overall sweet.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8770888/chapters/20104951][Mother May I]] by esama - canon divergence during beginning of 1st FB movie, mostly Newt being a good dude and who notices extremely early on that Credence is the obscurial.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8684860/chapters/19909777][The Thirty-Seven Steps]] by writerfan2013 - post 1st FB movie, it ignores CoG (since I think it was written before the film came out), and it focuses on Tina/Newt.
