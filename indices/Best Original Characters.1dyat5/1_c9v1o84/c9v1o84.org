I have quite a few favorites if you don't mind, all from very different kinds of stories :)

- Archibald Penrose from [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=307662][Muggle Studies]]. He's a Muggle Studies professor who engages in much exasperated banter and antics with his students, 100% droll and fun.
- Constance Palmer from [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=288707][With The Devil]], the daughter of a Puritan minister in Salem, Massachusetts in the time of the Witch Trials, and has the most engaging voice for anyone interested in historical fictions.
- June Benard from [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294705][Bathing in Roses]], which is a part-romcom, part-satire of the genre, a plucky down-on-her-luck OC done right, and there are so very few that are.
