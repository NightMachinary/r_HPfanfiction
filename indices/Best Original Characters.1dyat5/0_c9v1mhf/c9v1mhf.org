Very much set in the Harry Potter universe (magic works the same way or is at least interpolated from what the original books suggest), but it is set in the United States some years after Deathly Hallows with all that entails (more schools, more people, tribalism with regards to native peoples and different ideas from various immigrant groups).

Four books so far. They're all very good, the second in particular is incredible. The fifth book is in the works, as far as I know.
