My absolute favorite is Emily Swain from [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=4448][The Knight Errant Chronicles]]. She's a Faery Soldier who's brought in to teach a more hands-on version of Defense Against the Dark Arts during Goblet of Fire. She's got a complex backstory about her involvement with the Faery/Orc wars, a torrid history with Lucius Malfoy, and she's caught the eye of everyone's favorite Potions professor.

It's got all sorts of great stuff...great story, multi-dimensional characters, and a nice dose of smut if that's your sort of thing :).
