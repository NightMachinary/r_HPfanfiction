I like claire and serene from the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/140916/Leila-B][whole again series]] (it's very old) by leila b. It was written after POA (the book) came out and didn't reflect what happened in the rest of the books. I like reading older stories from when people didn't know how things were going to pan out. This author tells a well planned out alternative that spans over four stories, ss/oc, sb/oc and rl/oc. Really worth a read.

Claire is a squib born into a pure blood family who couln't accept that she had no magical abilty. they forced her to attend her first year of hogwarts any way in case her powers were late to bloom. SB played a prank on her that nearly led to her being killed, her family then pulled her out of hogwarts and basically kept her under lock and key and hid her from the world out of shame. She takes over the role as spy for Dumbledor when SS gets found out. she is very brave but doubts herself often and keeps up a facade to hid her weaknesses.

Serene is a muggle born who due to grindlewald war never got a hogwarts letter so had to try and cope living in the muggle world with /weird/ abilities. Her parents put her in a mental hospital when she was a young teenager because doctors decided she had schizophrenia and delusions of grandeur. They left her there and never came back and she had to convince the doctors she was better. She then learnt everything she could about magic independently. She is also very good at divination and has visions she doesn't understand.

** Her and another lady are accepted into hogwarts as mature students.

daniele from /the visitor/ by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7434407/1/The-Visitor][lady sophie of lalaland]] is ok too and it's a good ss story.

A lady who reads the HP books is attacked by her crazy BF and while she's being beaten and falling into unconsciousness she finds herself in hogwarts and tries to rationalise what's happening to her. She then uses her knowledge of the books to try and /fix/ things, which of course doesn't go to plan...

If you've seen Life on Mars it kind of plays out like that.
