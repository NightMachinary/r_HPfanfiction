[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/][Enter the Dragon]] does an excellent job of expanding the world (partly because it's a Shadowrun cross, but also just a good job in general). I love the solid burn that Mrs Weasley delivers to Lucius Malfoy in Diagon Alley, and the development of the goblins is great; they're friendly to Harry, not because they're amiable in general, but because he's a business partner with a potential worth greater than the amount of currency that exists in the wizarding world.

And while opinions on the story and the protagonist are sharply divided, Methods of Rationality does a fair bit of worldbuilding. I recommend the alternate/expanded introduction, linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMoR); if you dislike the story by the end of that, it's probably not for you.
