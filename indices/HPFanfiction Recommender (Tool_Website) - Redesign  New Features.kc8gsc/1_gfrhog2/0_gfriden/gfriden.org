All the filter dropdowns are generated based on the stories. Complete and Completed are there because FF.net calls them complete, and AO3 calls them completed. Anyways, I will fix it somehow.

The duplicate entries are there on the homepage because they are recommended multiple times. I don't think removing that is necessary, but I will look into showing unique stories only after using some filter.

Thanks for the feedback.
