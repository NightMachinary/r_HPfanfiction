You are right. However, like many other characters in the novel, he isn't a black and white character. Rowling highlights this fact throughout. Dumbledore says that Sirius could have treated Kreature much more humanely. Also, his love for Harry should not make us overlook the fact that his treatment of Snape was quite disgusting. And even though I feel that to the larger narrative of the story Sirius is important( for much of the mental strength he imparts to Harry) , however, I don't think we can glorify him as a person.
