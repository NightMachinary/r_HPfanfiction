I read the summaries for the three fics you recommended and I don't think they are for me. I've actually read a bit of the third one before and I really didn't like the characterization of Harry and Tonks. Though I have to admit, I'm turned off by Harry/Tonks in general.

I think if I'm to read a Tonks-focused story, then the main trio should not be major characters. If Tonks is just a side character, then I don't mind the presence of the trio, but any relationships would just feel awkward.
