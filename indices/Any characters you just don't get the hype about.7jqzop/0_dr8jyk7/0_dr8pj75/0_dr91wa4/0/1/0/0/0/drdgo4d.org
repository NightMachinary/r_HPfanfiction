I'm open for no romance as well but good stories are hard to find, especially without pairings since relationships are a fundamental part of our nature.

As for Remus, he ran away from his pregnant wife. There's no excuse for that, especially since broken thrust is hard to heal. He completely ignored Harry, the son of his best friend, his honorary brother. Harry was in desperate need of help, suffering child abuse for over a decade and running into situations no child should experience, and yet he did nothing. Sirius Black, despite facing summary execution, did far more for Harry than Lupin. His anti dementor lessons were also horrible, exposing Harry to the boggart despite him not being able to cast the spell. And the boggart lesson went against every pedagogic method known.

I'm not saying that Lupin is worse than Voldemort but his personal failings are massive and almost always whitewashed or justfied with a sob-story.
