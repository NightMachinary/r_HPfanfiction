Honestly, I wouldn't mind Tonks without the trio as long as Lupin is not in the picture. He was a shitty, cowardly husband, who spat on his friendship with the Potters by staying out of Harry's life and is an overall boring character. Turning him into the good guys is just whitewashing but for Tonks the options seem to be limited to either him or Charlie Weasley. So no Tonks stories for me -. -
