A few great Tonks stories are "Dignity in fear" linkffn(10798339), "Like grains of sand in the hourglass" linkffn(12188150) and "What's a little death between friends" linkffn(12101842).

There are some good short-stories and quite a few fics with good Tonks characterisations (Rune Stone Path, Old Friends, New Friends). Summer of change and the retransmuted series are some classics that didn't age well because they had tropes that became overused over the years.
