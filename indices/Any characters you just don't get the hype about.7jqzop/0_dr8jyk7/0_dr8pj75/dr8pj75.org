Canon Tonks sucks, at least in HBP and DH. There, I said it. Her husband was an utter dick, wallowing in self pity and running away from responsibility, which would have gotten him divorced in real life. Her death only served the "history repeats itself" trope. But early OotP is where she "shines". Everyone is tense due to Voldemort, Molly is her annoying self and then you have the only adult witch, who is not a Weasley, walking around seemingly without giving a fuck with pink hair, daring to bark at Moody and trying to lighten the mood. She is the only woman who starts as a badass, everyone else did not. Molly ignored child abuse, Ginny almost got everyone in Hogwarts killed, Hermione was annoying and Fleur almost became Dragon BBQ. But Tonks is this playful young woman who already got through Auror training, making her the only female Auror we ever get to know IIRC. She was the victim of Rowling's strange delusions about epic love stories that actually are unhealthy relationships.

And Tonks in fanficton is interesting. Outside of smut you rarely find the same characterisation for her. Compared to Daphne, Hermione or Ginny that makes her stand out.
