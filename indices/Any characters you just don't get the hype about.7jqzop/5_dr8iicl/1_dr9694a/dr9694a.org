Harry's a great side character. He's got some interesting backstory, a general talent in Defense and a couple specific signature moves in his Patronus and disarming charm, and he follows the plot without any personal motivations or even significant attachments getting in the way. He's got his sarcastic humor and attitudes toward authority to fill him in.

He's the sort of character you can leave in the mid-ground and pull to the front when you need him specifically. Probably not the sort you'd want to give their own character arc to.
