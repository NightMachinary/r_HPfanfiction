Harry. Yes, I know, he's the main character and all, and he's like the one the reader's supposed to identify with... and judging by all the fics where he becomes super-badass and lives a life of pure wish-fulfiment, I can only conclude that he's a well-realised reader-substitute-character.

Thing is, compared to just about every single other character in the franchise, I find him pretty boring. Especially in fanfics. In canon at least he occasionally displays a dry, sarcastic wit and has some genuinely funny one-liners, but in fanfic he usually doesn't get even that.
