Uh-huh.

Don't get me wrong, I can see why a character like Harry is valuable, narrative-wise. But you get all these people who insist that "if Harry isn't in a story, I won't read it!" and I'm just like... why NOT? Canon Harry wasn't all that interesting, and Fanon-Harry is so inconsistent that he's not even a character, just a long string of OCs that happen to be called Harry Potter and be the super-special Chosen One.
