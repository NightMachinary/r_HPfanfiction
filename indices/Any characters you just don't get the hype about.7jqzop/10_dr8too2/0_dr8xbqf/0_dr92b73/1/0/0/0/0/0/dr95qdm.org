It doesn't really matter if Snape was bullied or not - he willingly chose to join a mass-murdering Nazi bent on killing his best friend. None of those who bullied him were muggleborns, either, so that's no excuse anyway.

Further, even after he betrayed said Nazi, he kept abusing innocent kids. Even those whose parents hadn't bullied him, like Neville.

Snape was scum. Child-abusing scum.
