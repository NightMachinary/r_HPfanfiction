...and okaying a creative project done by somebody else is obviously different than things you say yourself, and denying that is being obtuse. rowling has never even commented on anything specific in cursed child. and where does anything she's said about snape and the marauders contradict canon, other than your commitment to their fanon characterisations?

and when has she called it rivalry? when she first said the 'consequences' quote, that was before the series was even finished.

as for 'paying lip-service', lol. she's maintained that she thinks snape is a cruel bully, and a horrible person. she's also always maintained that he's tragic, and a victim, and heroic, throughout the entire series.
