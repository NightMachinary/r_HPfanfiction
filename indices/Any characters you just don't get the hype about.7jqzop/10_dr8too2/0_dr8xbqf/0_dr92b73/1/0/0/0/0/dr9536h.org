  But it does put into question the veracity of her recent additions to the fandom.

i mean, it doesn't. i'm judging by /her/ additions, not what others wrote.

  Firstly, they helped Peter become an animagus; something that is very rare and very dangerous, and they wouldn't have trusted a useless tagalong with their greatest secret. Peter came across as a closer friend in the books than in that article.
#+end_quote

to you, i guess. there are thousands of fanfics. where peter isn't even there, and when he is he's treated like dirt. how they treat him in SWM doesn't say good things. it's entirely possible for him to be an unquestioned part of the group...and still looked down upon. they trust him because he openly worships them, and they're egotistical. why would they think he'd betray them?

  So why should we disregard this for that half-arsed article that she probably made because of the Snape hype a few years back? Who knows whether she even looked upon it like that when she wrote book 5 and 7...

again, who says it's because of 'snape hype', besides you, and your dedication to fanon!marauders and fanon!snape? and how is it half-arsed? how does it contradict canon? you desperately trying to argue that lily was exaggerating and that they weren't that bad is marauder!hype
