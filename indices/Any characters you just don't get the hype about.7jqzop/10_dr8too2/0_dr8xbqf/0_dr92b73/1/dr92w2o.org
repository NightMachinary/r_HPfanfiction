nope. you have no evidence of that. they were, absolutely, bullies. to random people, and to their friend.

#+begin_quote
  I.e. he isn't exaclty a good source of what counts as bullying and what doesn't, and he's like 90% of our canonical source from that era.
#+end_quote

i agree! so let's say that snape, sirius, lupin, and every character involved is biased and therefore not a good source. so, that leaves the author, who creates and frames this dynamic, as the only objective source on this. so what does she say?

  “James could certainly have been kinder to this boy who was a bit of an outcast. And he wasn't. *And these actions have consequences. And we know what they were.*”

  Remus functioned as the conscience of this group, but it was an occasionally faulty conscience. He did not approve of their *relentless bullying of Severus Snape*, but he loved James and Sirius so much, and was so grateful for their acceptance, that he did not always stand up to them as much as he knew he should.
#+end_quote

she didn't say what they did was 'casual pranking', or a 'mutual back-and-forth', she describes their behaviour as 'relentless bullying', a term she never uses to describe fred and george, anywhere. and remus has to be their conscience, why would he be their conscience if they weren't doing unconscionable things. we know he doesn't object to harmless pranking- he makes fun of snape to make neville feel better, yet even he was uncomfortable with how they treated snape

what does she have to say about how they regard their friend?

#+begin_quote
  He was unhinged. Yes, he laughed. He knew what he'd lost. It was a humorless laugh. Pettigrew, *who they, in a slightly patronizing way, James and Sirius at least, who they allowed to hang round with them*, it turned out that he was a better wizard than they knew. Turned out he was better at hiding secrets than they knew.
#+end_quote

wow, so they befriended him in a patronising way, and 'let' him hang around with them

i've said it before, and i'll say it again, that 'relentless bullying' quote, by *j.k. rowling*, should be stickied
