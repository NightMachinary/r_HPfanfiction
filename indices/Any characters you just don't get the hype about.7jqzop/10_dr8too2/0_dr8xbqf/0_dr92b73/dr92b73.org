And then there are people who makes them out as those unscrupulous bullies that everyone secretly hated all along. They were probably arrogant prats, sure, but I'm pretty sure that Lily exaggarated, and that they weren't by any means worse than Fred and George, whose practical jokes may have gone too far at times, but mostly they just loved to put on a show.

They're probably those class clowns that most people just forgot about after school. And they probably weren't widely known as The Marauders in-universe; the twins wouldn't have known of them if it weren't for the map. (In canon, only Ron referred to MWPP as such in book 6.)

Snape, who often get glorified whenever they were vilified, never hesitated to use the M-word to any muggleborn but Lily, and called what future Death Eater Mulciber did to Mary Macdonald - actual bullying (or something worse) by the sound of it -, 'an innocent prank' without any hint of sarcasm. I.e. he isn't exaclty a good source of what counts as bullying and what doesn't, and he's like 90% of our canonical source from that era.

The only one of them I like is Sirius, though. The werewolf incident coincides pretty well with his escape from home, so he probably wasn't by his right mind at the time (maybe some DE-related pressure from family), something that Snape probably used to get the secret of the willow out of him. James is just a dick who probably had to grow up really fast, Remus is like a male Hermione just without any of her zeal and Peter... he's like bashfic!tag-along!Ron.

EDIT: Animagus names seemed to refer to a body part though, and were made up by /fifteen year olds/.
