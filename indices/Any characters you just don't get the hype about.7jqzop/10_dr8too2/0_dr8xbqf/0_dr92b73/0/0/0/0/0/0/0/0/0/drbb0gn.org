...which was said by lupin, his friend, whose flaw that's consistently pointed out in the series was his cowardice in calling his friends out.

  "Relentless bullying", you say? Clearly, you have a very different definition of the words. "Relentless bullying" is what Snape did to Neville.

i'm not the one who said it, lol. that was jkr. prove to me why we should trust lupin's words over that of the author, and prove to me how it doesn't fit canon, other than you desperately not wanting it to be so. i really want you to answer this one

and by the way, if snape and his friends ganged up on neville and bullied him, and neville, as a consequence, hexed snape any time he got, i'd still say neville was relentlessly bullied by him and his friends
