...she said dumbledore is gay because she thinks of him as gay. nothing in the books suggest that he's straight. you're right, she's pandering to the highly vocal 'grindelwald is a seer' fandom. nothing in canon contradicts him being a seer. right, so your entire argument is still racial representation, and you can't seem to understand that she has no problem with people portraying her characters as whatever race they want, because to her that doesn't affect their characterisation. i'll ask you one more time- give me an example of her altering characterisations and dynamics

#+begin_quote
  because Rowling said it so she's correct, right?
#+end_quote

when it aligns with canon? yeah, why not. we have direct evidence of snape using slurs. her saying he never did directly contradicts that. we also have evidence of james and sirius attacking him unprovoked while remus sits uncomfortable.

  Being bullied is not an excuse nor does it give you zero accountability for being an asshole, something so simple that you can't seem to understand.
#+end_quote

wow! it's amazing where i never claimed otherwise. what you're doing is denying that he was relentlessly bullied at all.

#+begin_quote
  that Snape was not a total victim
#+end_quote

i don't know how this is difficult for you to understand, but a victim retaliating against his bullies...doesn't change that dynamic. if you want to say that snape's actions against his bullies were over the top- go for it! first you have to admit that they bullied him though

...remus does not disprove it. one, his comment about snape 'never missing an opportunity' was said in the context of after fifth year. that doesn't negate all the others years he spent bullying him. two, hexing your bully in retaliation means you're hexing your bully in retaliation.

#+begin_quote
  That Snape's reaction (even though he drew his wand first) was somehow justified in your eyes.
#+end_quote

wow. it's almost as if he was expecting an attack and attempting to defend himself. which harry realises immediately

#+begin_quote
  an instigator as well
#+end_quote

...they repeatedly attacked him, and other students, unprovoked. unless they directly go up to him and apologise, everything he does is getting even
