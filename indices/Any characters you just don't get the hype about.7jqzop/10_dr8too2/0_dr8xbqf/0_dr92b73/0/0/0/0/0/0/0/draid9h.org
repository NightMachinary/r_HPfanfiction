  Sirius did it with the intent of murder
#+end_quote

nope. i've never said any such thing

  The instruction from Sirius was obviously a challenge - they both knew that there's a werewolf in the Shack and they both knew that only an idiot would go venture there
#+end_quote

none of that is obvious, just your headcanon. nothing suggests he ever made it known to the marauders what he knew.

  Also, I can't seem to remember anyone in the books mentioning that Snape was relentlessly bullied. Was it an interview with Rowling? I won't trust what she says after the books were published as she usually just pander to her fans and she'd been repeatedly caught contradicting herself before.

it was on pottermore. and when has she contradicted herself? or pandered? how does that contradict canon? regardless, your memories are straight up wrong, so. nowhere in the books is the phrase 'gave as good as he got' ever mentioned. i don't doubt that snape hexed james. good for him, he should retaliate against his bullies.

if snape went around sectusempra'ing people on the reg. at hogwarts and wasn't expelled, then i'm blaming dumbledore
