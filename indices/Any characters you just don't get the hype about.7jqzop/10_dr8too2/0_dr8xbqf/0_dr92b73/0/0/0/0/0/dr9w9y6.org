or, snape was acting under the assumption that sirius /wouldn't/ send him somewhere that would cause any serious harm to him or his friend, so he was curious to see what /was/ there. snape thought he was a bully, but only started thinking he was a potential murderer after the incident

  Clearly, Snape's unreasonable desire to find evidence to get the Marauders expelled overrode his common sense. That and he's evidently a nosy little shit.

...his desire to get the people who bullied him expelled, who probably would have been expelled anyway for breaking the law and endangering innocent people. or reprimanded, who knows

#+begin_quote
  Well, and this is just my assumption
#+end_quote

yeah, it is. remus never mentions being face to face with him

  Well, of course, Snape tried it --- *if he'd got as far as this house, he'd have met a fully grown werewolf* --- but your father, who'd heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at great risk to his life ... *Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the tunnel.* He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that time on he knew what I was. ...‚Äù

nothing in the passage suggests that james ever got close enough to manhandle remus, or snape to be in any actual danger, or him frozen in fear. just that he pulled him back before snape got to the end of the tunnel...which snape could have easily done himself. james being there at all seems pretty unnecessary.

how i likely think it happened:

snape is going down the tunnel, at the exact same moment he sees remus, says 'what the fuck', james says 'get out of there, you git' and pulls him back. lily wasn't there, and just repeats what she's told, and you can justify snape being too flustered by the incident/it happening to quickly for him to refute it, just focusing on the narrative that was already established

though, to be honest, the whole incident is poorly written
