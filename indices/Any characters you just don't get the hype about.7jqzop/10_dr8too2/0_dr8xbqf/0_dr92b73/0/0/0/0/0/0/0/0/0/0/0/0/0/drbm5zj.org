  And no, what is written outside of the books are purely pandering and fan service -- I don't understand how you're not seeing something this obvious.

hooow? how is it that obvious? how does it contradict canon? how do you know her thought process? i can say that denying that they did relentlessly bully snape is pandering to delusional marauder fans, like you. explain to me how her publishing it in a novel is any different than putting it online. does the feel of the paper against her fingers influence her so much that she alters her ideas that she's maintained forever? you still haven't given me an example of her pandering, or contradicting herself. the articles aren't meant to be a cohesive story anyway- they're her legendarium

anyway, the fact is this. i base my thoughts on the world on what the author has written on it, and what coherently fits into it. you...don't, and prefer to cling your personal headcanons and fanon. that's fine, but i don't see any point in continuing this discussion in that case
