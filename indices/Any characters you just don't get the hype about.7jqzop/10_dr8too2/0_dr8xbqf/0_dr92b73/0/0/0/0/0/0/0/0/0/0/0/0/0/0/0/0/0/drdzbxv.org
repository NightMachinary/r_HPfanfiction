your only evidence for her 'pandering' is her saying that she has no problem with hermione being black, and neville being black. it is entirely about racial representation, because that's what she's open with fans to re-imagine, because to her, it's irrelevant to their characterisations. what she hasn't been inconsistent on are character dynamics, and specific aspects of their characterisations. equating her saying 'you can imagine my characters as any race you want' and anything else...is false equivalency.

and by the way, it isn't an 'established canon fact' that hermione is white. the most you can get from canon is that she's light skinned.

....such as? and yet, she hasn't changed her stance on this, and has maintained it before the series finished, during the series, and after it

there are no established canon facts that disprove it. remus, himself, says he made james and sirius feel ashamed for how they treated him. he said they hexed people for no reason. harry challenges sirius to say they attacked snape because he was into the dark arts or w.e., which he considered, and sirius doesn't defend himself when harry countered him

i'll ask you again, then. give me direct evidence of jkr, in her own words, editing entire aspects of characterisation to pander to fans. explain to me how her comment contradicts canon, when /your/ arguments rests on the assumption of taking remus' words at face value
