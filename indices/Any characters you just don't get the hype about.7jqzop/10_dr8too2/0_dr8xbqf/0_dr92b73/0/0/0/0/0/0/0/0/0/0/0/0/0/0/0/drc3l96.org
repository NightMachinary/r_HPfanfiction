oh my god. because issues of racial representation are entirely the same as altering entire characterisations and dynamics. jkr has always maintained that she has no problem with readers imagining the characters, physically, like however they want. since 2000, before the series was finished. because their skin colour, for her, was irrelevant to their character and how they interacted in the world. you really can't be this obtuse mate

  Ms. ROWLING: It's my belief, you know, people who have stayed with Harry for four years now, I doubt that seeing the movie could harm their imagined Harry or Hogwarts. But I know what you mean. I mean, I think a lot of people are going to feel that. They really want to see it. I met a really clever reader the other day, and this is what's wonderful about books; she said to me, =I really know what Neville looks like.' And I said,=Describe Neville for me.' And she said, `Well, he's short and he's black, and he's got dreadlocks.' Now, to me, Neville's short and plump and blond, but that's what's great about books. You know, she's just seeing something different. People bring their own imagination to it. They have to collaborate with the author on creating the world.
