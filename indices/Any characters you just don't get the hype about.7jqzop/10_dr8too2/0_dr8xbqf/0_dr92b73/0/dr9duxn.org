  The werewolf incident
#+end_quote

was entirely Snape's fault. If I show you how to disable the landmines surrounding an army base and the guards there shoot you on sight, who is responsible? I mean, it was a dick move towards Lupin but in the end, Snape made the decision to confront a werewolf, not Sirius (I am fairly certain Snape had his suspicions at this point).
