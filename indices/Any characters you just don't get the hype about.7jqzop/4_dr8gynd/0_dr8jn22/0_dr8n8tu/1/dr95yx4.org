I'm not so sure. While it's true that intelligence and study are key to being a powerful wizard within the HP universe, the top tier wizards all have a "secret ingredient" element which elevates them to that level. It's hard to define but nonetheless I think most readers know it when they see it - a kind of combination of instinct, character, force of will... the ability to turn everything up to 11 when the situation calls for it.

What prevents Harry from being a great wizard is the study/academic elements, but he seems to have that "secret ingredient" which can't be taught.

Hermione, on the other hand, has the study/intelligence side of things, but lacks that element of true magicalness about her.

For me it's easier to imagine Harry being more studious than it is to imagine Hermione as fundamentally more magical in her ways of thinking and viewing the world.
