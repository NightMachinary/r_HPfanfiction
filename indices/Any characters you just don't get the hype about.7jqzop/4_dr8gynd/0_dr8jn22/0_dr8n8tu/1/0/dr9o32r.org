To add to this, for AU's I think it's important to consider the impact of environment on developing intelligence and therefore magical ability.

Hermione grew up in an upper middle class family as an only child with loving and supportive parents, pretty close to an ideal environment. Canon Hermione is peak Hermione, which is a notch or two below the truly great wizards like Dumbledore.

While the Dursley's abuse in fanfiction is often overblown, Harry clearly did not grow up in anything close to an ideal environment, which is why I find a more skilled Harry perfectly believable in AU's that change his childhood (such as The Santi's fic). Even small changes that cause the Dursleys to treat him better could believably have a large impact on his potential.
