Yeah, I feel like Hermione is too dedicated to Rules and Logic to be a true great wizard, you know? It's magic, it's not supposed to make sense. And Harry doesn't worry about things making sense, he just worries about things working. To be a buttkicker wizard you gotta know when and how to deal with abstract concepts and connections and feelings, which is not Hermione at all.
