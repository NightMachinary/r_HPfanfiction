I completely agree with you in the sense that Harry as a powerful wizard makes more sense than Hermione, and exactly for the reason you suggest. Not to bring the other discussion here, but that intangible that other people can "feel" is a large part of what I think makes Hermione look to Harry for leadership.

That said, most OP!Hermione characters I've read don't need intangibles because she can't be wrong and in the unimaginable case she is, she's got some ridiculous invented spell to save the day. She (and whoever she happens to be friends with) don't really struggle. Writers who write powerful characters that still struggle believably are pretty rare.

EDIT: Or, she doesn't need to think magically because she can apply muggle concepts to magic and voila, instant power because no one on the planet has ever done it before.
