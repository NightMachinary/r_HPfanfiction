Hermione has an interesting issue in that she's an easier character for wish fulfillment than Harry. It makes more sense for her to be an educated, powerful witch that acts with purpose than it does for Harry, who (literally, Felix) relies on luck a grand majority of the time. If Harry accomplished some of the things fanon!Hermione does, it would feel even cheaper than it already does.

Even so, I love Hermione. I figure the authors that make her a huge Mary Sue or otherwise one dimensional would do that to whatever character they picked; it just happens to be Hermione because she's the easiest. Being a lightning rod for bad writing isn't any character's fault and I try not to hold it against them.

See my other post in this thread about Luna. >_>
