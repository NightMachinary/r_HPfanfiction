Tangentially related wall of text below, for no other reason than I've been thinking about it for character arc within a story:

Hermione's desire for authority figures is one of her most interesting traits that could be (but doesn't have to be) interpreted as flaw.

In canon, she obviously starts with McGonagall since it's likely that McGonagall introduced her to magic and then became her Head of House. Combined with her guidance of the first years through the sorting and her aura of general competence and rule following, it makes sense.

Over time, I think McGonagall lets Hermione down. Hermione perceives (perhaps erroneously) that she ignored the threat to the stone, is powerless against the basilisk, and continues to be a non player in keeping her and her friends safe.

Hermione's attention then shifts to the next natural place, Dumbledore. Through the middle books Hermione consistently has the opinion that Dumbledore will know everything, can fix everything, and that everything he does is correct and for good reasons. It frustrates Harry and Ron because they don't understand her basic need for authority to be her guidance and safety net.

Then, particularly after Dumbledore's death, her ultimate authority shifts to Harry. Canon!Harry would probably argue with me, but no matter how intelligent, resourceful, and bossy Hermione gets, she's dedicated to making what Harry wants happen. Her character has matured and she's not afraid to stand up to her authority figure, but ultimately she needs him because when she /doesn't/ have the answer, he keeps her from a downward emotional spiral.

Perhaps this is why I find Harmony so disconcerting. Not that Harry and Hermione wouldn't work, but I feel like Hermione would be happier with someone who can deflect her intensity with simplicity and humor while leaving Harry to be her authority. Ultimately this is why I like her with Ron. After Deathly Hallows, he's the most likely person to understand her relationship with Harry and be comfortable with it.

Anyway, not sure why any of this is relevant but I started thinking and writing and here we are.
