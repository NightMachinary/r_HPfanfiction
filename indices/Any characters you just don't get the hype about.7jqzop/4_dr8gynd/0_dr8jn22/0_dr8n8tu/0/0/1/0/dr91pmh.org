I agree that versions of Hermione that look to authority figures first aren't particularly consistent with her mature canon character, but not because she doesn't want them. Mature Hermione appeals to authority not as a first instinct, but as a last resort. In the back of her mind she identifies someone who can take over if she falls, which is important because she struggles with fear of failure and not being good enough.

A trusted authority also provides a way to admit she's wrong without losing confidence, which helps with her stubbornness.
