  and right about forcing others to support her in this.

That is not in any way right. It's like if you ate chips, and I took your chips(and possibly money so you wouldn't buy more) because it's bad for you. Basically, you're giving her the right to *ENFORSE HER WILL* upon others because she thinks it's right. No ones will/opinion matters because clearly, they're wrong.

By that logic, your opinion does not matter, because I think you're wrong.
