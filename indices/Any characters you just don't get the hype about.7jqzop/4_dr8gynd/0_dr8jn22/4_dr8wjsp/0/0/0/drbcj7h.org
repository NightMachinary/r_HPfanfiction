It's a little depressing that a predominant view of fanon!Hermione is becoming a cardboard cutout who has to rely on Harry for everything and just can't /quite/ manage anything by herself, although /doesn't she try hard and nearly get there?/ and that any Hermiones that deviate from this model of clear inferiority are somehow unrealistic.

Not to even mention how such a portrayal really damages some of the key themes of the story.
