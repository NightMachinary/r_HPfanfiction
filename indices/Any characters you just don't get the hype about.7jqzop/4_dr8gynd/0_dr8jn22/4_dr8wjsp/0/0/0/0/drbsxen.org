Yeah. Some peoploe really can't stand the idea of a strong female muggleborn character but will happily tolerate an OP Harry. And few, if any, ever say anything about Dumbledore being a Mary Sue, even if he has far more power than most "Mary Sue Hermiones". So, it's not about a character being too powerful - it's about a female muggleborn swot being too powerful.
