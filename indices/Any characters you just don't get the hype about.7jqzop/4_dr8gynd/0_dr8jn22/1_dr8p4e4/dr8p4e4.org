Well, at least Hemione HAS a character. Daphne does not. She's literally just a name in canon, she gets no dialogue, no chacterisation and we don't even knoe what she looks like. So whereas Hermione in fanfics can at least still be Hermione, there's no way to write Daphne as anything BUT an OC with a canon name.
