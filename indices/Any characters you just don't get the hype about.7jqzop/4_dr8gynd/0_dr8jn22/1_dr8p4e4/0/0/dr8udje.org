Hey, I don't mind OCs....

You could even argue that the fic I'm currently writing is MOSTLY OCs with canon names, since it takes place in a very thorough AU where everything's very different (and 90% of the magical population is female, hence a lot of gender-flipping is going on!).

But, I think I can see where Starfox is coming from here. Daphne is treated as being this big important canon character, but really she's not even a character. And her fanon characterisation as the "Ice Queen of Slytherin" is... to be honest... kind of dull.
