She makes searching easier, if I want a story that focuses (Protag or love interest) on a female slytherin, and don't mind OC, being able to rely on 90% of the OC ones being named Daphne Greengrass is great. "fem!Slytherin" Doesn't usually give very useful results.

Considering that we have pretty much nothing on her except for her name, it's not like there's any cannon!daphne fics being buried under the oc!daphne ones.

She's essentially the equivalent of a * wildcard, with the constraint that the wildcard is female, and slytherin. She also nicely filters out the fangirl self inserts who come up with "original" names so they can have a Harry - Draco threesome.
