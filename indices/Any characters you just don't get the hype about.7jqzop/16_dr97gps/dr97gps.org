Hermione. Don't get me wrong I like her character well enough, but I don't know. I've never been fascinated by Hermione, canon or fanon Hermione. There are admittedly some well done stories with Hermione, but overall I just kind of find her to be a bit much. I don't hate her or anything, I do like her character, but I highly doubt she's in my top 5 favorite characters.
