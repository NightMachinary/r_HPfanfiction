Not any character in particular but just the general obsessions and/or hate towards a pairing or character in fandoms in general. I don't get why people love Olicity (from CW Arrow) so much they send send /death threats/ to the actors and their families.

Oh you love Hinny? Good for you. You hate Hinny? Congratulations. It doesn't mean that there aren't any good stories where Harry ends up with someone else, if anyone.
