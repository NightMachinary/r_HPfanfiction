Luna. The sacred child of fanfiction. IRL I'd find her extremely awkward to be around, I'd politely avoid her whenever possible. Its strange how crucial she can become or how many fics place importance on becoming friends with her. It sometimes comes across as a character's ability to be friends with Luna defines if you're a good person or a bad person.
