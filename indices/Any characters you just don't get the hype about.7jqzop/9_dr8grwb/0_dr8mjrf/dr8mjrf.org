I agree that fanon!Luna drives me absolutely bonkers most of the time, but there is one snippet of Deathly Hallows that makes canon!Luna interesting to me.

  After a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna.

  “I'd want some peace and quiet, if it were me,” she said.

  “I'd love some,” he replied.

  “I'll distract them all,” she said. “Use your Cloak.”

  And before he could say a word she had cried, “Oooh, look, a Blibbering Humdinger!” and pointed out of the window. Everyone who heard looked around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over himself, and got to his feet.

  Now he could move through the Hall without interference.

That snippet says so much about what Luna's grasp on reality, and most importantly, her grasp on how other people see her.

In my headcanon, Luna came to Hogwarts with a tenuous grasp on reality due to her mother's death and her father's eccentricity, as well as a lack of people her own age to connect with. Her friendship with Ginny, her inclusion in the DA, and then the resulting friendships from that gave her something to stand on.

However, those things happened when she'd already gone through a lot of her formative years. Rather than change her personality entirely, Luna still finds comfort in her imaginary creatures and allows her weirdness to remain a wall between herself and others. Those willing to see through the weirdness (her protection against bullying) will find a Ravenclaw mind and a Gryffindor heart underneath.

Thus, we arrive at a Luna that mostly knows how others see her and manipulates that to her own and her friends' advantage. I imagine her adult life being a fusion of Slughorn's party and the Ravenclaw common room door. The Rotfang conspiracy at once amused Harry enough to get him to snort mead, distracted multiple Hogwarts professors, and said something eerily accurate about how the Ministry is being infiltrated by dark wizards. I don't think it's an accident that we see this side of Luna directly after Harry lit her up with happiness with the invitation.
