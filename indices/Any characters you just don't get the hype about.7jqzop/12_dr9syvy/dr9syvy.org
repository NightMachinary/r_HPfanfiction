Fred & George.

They seem to have been put on the same pedestal that Luna has been put on. That and the fact that they're always written the exact same in pretty much every fic I've read that had them as major characters really kind of bores me.

There does seem to be an overall love of pranksters/pranking in fanfiction, so I might not be getting it or something.
