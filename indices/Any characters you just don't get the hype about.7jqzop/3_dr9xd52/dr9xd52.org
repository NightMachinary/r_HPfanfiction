I don't get why people love Sirius Black so much. I'm sympathetic to his conviction without a trial and wrongful imprisonment backstory, but nothing about how his character, as portrayed in Goblet and Phoenix, seemed at all endearing to me. Most fic writers seem to gloss over, forget about, or use his imprisonment as an excuse for his negative character traits and paint him as a fun ladies man (after they make sure that he gets out of Azkaban and gets pardoned as soon as possible, whether it helps move the plot of their fic along or not).

I also don't get the love for Draco. Throughout cannon Draco is the biggest bully in Harry's year, he's basically a slightly smarter, skinny, version of Dudley. He's lucky that Harry can't let anyone die in front of him without trying to help them, and that Narcissa lied to Voldemort's face. He wouldn't be a free citizen, or alive, in the epilogue if it wasn't for those two decisions.

It also boggles my mind how many hoops people are willing to jump through in order to paint him as a good person in their fics, or pair him up with Hermione or Harry romantically. I'm sorry, it's like I'm a HP/GW shipper (technically I am, but this is an apt metaphor for my feelings on this ) and HP/DM and HP/HG are my Harmonians.

I...I just can't, with all the fics tagged DM/HP and DM/HG that I have to scroll passed in order to find something to read. Every time I find a promising fic summery I curse Draco's existence as soon as I see DM/HP or DM/HG at the end of it. It's even worse to find a fic that I'm liking, then suddenly, DM/HP or DM/HG pops up out of nowhere (whether it's in the background or foreground) and I just can't continue reading it.

Seriously though, if there wasn't so much fan love for Draco, I wouldn't hate him so much. He would just get the pity that I felt for him while reading cannon.
