Lily is said to have "dark red" hair at least twice in the books, along with green eyes, while Ginny is described more as a ginger, along with brown eyes, and is implied to have freckles. It is also repeatedly emphasized in the books that Ginny in terms of height is rather small, while that has not happened with regards to Lily.
