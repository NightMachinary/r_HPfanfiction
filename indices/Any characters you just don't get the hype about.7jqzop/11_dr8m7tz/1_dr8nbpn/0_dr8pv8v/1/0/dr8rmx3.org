Well, my own mother has red hair. Maybe that has something to do with it... Idk lol, I know it doesn't really make sense but it just has always bothered me.

But it is true that other than my mother I don't know any other people with red hair( at least while I was growing up). Maybe I just automatically associate that with her, and thus the dislike of Harry/Ginny is born. RIP tho because it is such a popular pairing
