Maybe you live in a place where red haired people are very rare?

You obviously don't have the same issue if Lily and Ginny have blonde or black hairs.

Well, In Britain, as many as [[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/country-with-the-most-redheads-gingers/][10% of the population]] can have red hairs.

BTW, Dumbledore and Susan Bones are two more known redheads in the story.
