Ginny, only when it comes to Harry/Ginny though. I cannot stand the whole Oedipus complex thing. I remember thinking when I was like 10 how creepy that was and I still hold that view. (No offense to anyone who likes this pairing! I certainly read worse, but nothing seems to bother me as much as this.)

I much prefer Ginny as a surrogate sister for Harry, but hey, that's just me.
