Well... if you say Ginny's not a good romatic match for Harry or their romance wasn't very well-written, I can see that... but I'd argue that there's no Oedipus complex involved. There's never been any moment in any canon where Ginny was compared to Lily, or where Harry saw his mother in her.

Yes, both Ginny and Lily had red hair and were talented with magic, but that's pretty much it. Even from what little we get to see of Lily, they were really different people.
