Here's my problem: Harry looks like his father and ginny kinda looks like his mother. That always, always bothered me and it was definitely deliberate on JK's part. I dunno, it just always bothered me. Maybe Oedipus Complex is the wrong word, but the similarity to Harry's dead parents always turned me off to the pairing /shrugs/ No hate if you like the pairing though, it's just always bothered me. Doesn't mean it's a logical reason tho haha
