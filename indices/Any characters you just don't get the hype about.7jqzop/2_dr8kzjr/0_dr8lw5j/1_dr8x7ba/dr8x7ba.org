  Because his motivation was love for a married woman who perished fifteen years ago due his actions, which has to be a very strange kind of necrophilia, he was declared a hero in the end. How? His only good action was delivering a magical sword, which honestly could have been hidden somewhere by Dumbledore or delivered by phoenix. Talking a teenager (=child soldier) into taking a killing curse for the team does not count as good act. There was no reason for him to die. If Harry was the last horcrux Voldemort would stay a wraith for as long as Harry lived (Is 1/64 even enough to anchor a soul? )

This is not in the series I read. Or rather, it's a personal black-and-white morality version of a semi-redemptive narrative arc. Snape loved Lily long before she married; it wasn't "his love for a married woman," it was his love for someone he'd known since he was nine. Lily doesn't cease to be her own person, a person worthy of love, simply because she got married. Their friendship ended /before/ she changed her mind about James and long before Lily and James married. All the evidence supports the fact that, after the conversation outside the Gryffindor common room, Snape complied with Lily's wishes and left her alone. It wasn't a sudden lust for a married woman that compelled him, and it wasn't a desire to "have" Lily. The fact that he still loved her - and love isn't only about wanting to fuck her, as so many Snape-haters imply; Snape clearly idealized her, which is a problem in itself, but he loved the person who had been his friend growing up - the fact that he loved her is /a good thing./ He wasn't stalking her, bothering her, or interfering with her marriage. He only breaks his silence about Lily to beg Dumbledore to save her life.

Also, he didn't know who the prophecy pointed to. That doesn't absolve him of his indifference to the fact that someone, somewhere was going to become a target for murder; he obviously didn't care about that, which is the low point from which he has to struggle upward to the understanding that other people's lives matter. If this had been a book about Snape, we would have seen more of that struggle. As it is, by the time we get to the line "Lately, only those whom I could not save," it's right there on the page that Snape finally gives a fuck and has actually made attempts to save people who are not Lily. Hate him as much as you like, but in fiction this is considered moral growth and is part of his redemption arc.

And the whole point of "Talking a teenager (=child soldier) into taking a killing curse for the team" is a very curious reinterpretation of that particular plot point. That was entirely Dumbledore's scheme, and Snape actually has one morally transcendent moment when he recognizes how horrible it is and is shocked by Dumbledore's manipulation and apparent cynicism. He goes along with it because, by that point, he's not /only/ doing this for Lily. He clearly understands that defeating Voldemort is the thing that must happen at all costs, even if that cost includes his own death. If you hate that plot point so much, blame Dumbledore and JKR. It's pretty apparent that Dumbledore assumed Voldemort would live on and find a way to possess Harry - or kill Harry and possess his body - if the horcrux wasn't destroyed. It's never simply stated in the books, but the whole motivating force for the complicated shenanigans around Harry not dying (or Harry returning from death) involves the extreme danger of even one horcrux remaining in the world - a danger compelling enough to "excuse" the potential sacrifice of a 17-year-old boy.

You're transposing a fantastical world with a convoluted salvation narrative (Harry's, not Snape's) into the real world and judging everyone based on that. Which warps the story beyond the framework the author obviously intends. I mean, feel free to do that. But it makes your summary sound like a weird literal-minded parody of HP and makes me wonder what in the world you find to /like/ in the series at all.
