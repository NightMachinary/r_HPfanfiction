...and vader still willingly chose to murder children, force choke his wife in his paranoia, and serve the sith. he showed authoritarian leanings even before that. he chose to prioritise saving padme over the galaxy. saying anakin /didn't/ choose his fate not only misses the point, but degrades him as a character

throughout his entire life, we see exactly zero [0] supportive, positive adult figures take an interest in snape, a circumstance repeated only with merope gaunt. how this doesn't fit your qualification for a tragic character is beyond me
