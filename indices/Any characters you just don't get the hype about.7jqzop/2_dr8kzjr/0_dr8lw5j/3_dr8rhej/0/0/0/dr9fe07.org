In the end (Windu vs Palpatine) it came down to Anakin seeing both sides as equal (Windu repeating Palpatine's Sith dogma) and one offers to save his wife while the other would punish him for having a wife in the first place. Anakin does everything to save Padme, that's what makes it tragic (and RotS my favourite Star Wars Movie) while Snape joined the Death Eaters despite knowing that Lily was one of their targets.

Anakin committed horrible atrocities out of misguided love, Snape did because he was butthurt.
