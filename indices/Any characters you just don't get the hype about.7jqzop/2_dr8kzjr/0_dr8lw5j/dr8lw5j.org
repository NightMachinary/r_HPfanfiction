I agree. Snape was not a tragic character, he was a man who joined the magical Waffen-SS AFTER driving his best friend away with his ideology. He only "turned" when the same friend, now married woman he was lusting after, was threatened and even then only wanted to save her, not her husband and child. He maybe even hoped to profit from her family getting torn apart. He then spent the next decade being an absolute dick and dooming an entire generation by keeping people from going into health care and civil service. Snape proceeded to be an arse to his love's son, try to get an innocent man executed, helped with child endangerment (Protection of the Stone). While being a double agent for a illegitimate paramilitary group he covered Death Eater Crimes.

Because his motivation was love for a married woman who perished fifteen years ago due his actions, which has to be a very strange kind of necrophilia, he was declared a hero in the end. How? His only good action was delivering a magical sword, which honestly could have been hidden somewhere by Dumbledore or delivered by phoenix. Talking a teenager (=child soldier) into taking a killing curse for the team does not count as good act. There was no reason for him to die. If Harry was the last horcrux Voldemort would stay a wraith for as long as Harry lived (Is 1/64 even enough to anchor a soul? )
