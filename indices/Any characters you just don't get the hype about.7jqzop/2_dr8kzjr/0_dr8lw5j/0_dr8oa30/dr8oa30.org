I think you're exaggerating slightly, especially of the "dooming an entire generation by keeping people from going into health care and civil service." Yes, he only wanted to take NEWT students who were O-level, but if we judge by Harry's sixth year there were ten students who had managed to get top marks in Potions. (Four Slytherins including Malfoy, four Ravenclaws, Ernie Macmillan from Hufflepuff and of course Hermione.) If we assume this is an average number of top students, that's still ten per year. And Snape taught Potions for fourteen years, so that should make it... a hundred and forty people with the necessary schooling to join the Aurors or become Healers. That is if Healers even need NEWT-level Potions; far as I know the books never say.

You're right that Snape was a small-minded, petty man who by all acounts was a horrible person... but I'd argue that this is a big part of WHY he was a tragic character. If he'd been noble and heroic and good, his death would have been tragic. As it was, the tragedy was the person he'd let himself become. Or that's my take on him, anyway.
