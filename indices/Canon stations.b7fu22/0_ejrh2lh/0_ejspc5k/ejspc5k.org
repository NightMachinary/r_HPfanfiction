This. The letter itself is just repeating canon. But how do your characters feel about it? How do they react to the revelation of magic, to the bizarre shopping list, to the fact that someone thought the letter would be sufficient to tell a muggle-born witch or wizard everything they need to know? Do they laugh? Gape? Are they afraid? Excited? Skeptical? The people are what give life to the events.
