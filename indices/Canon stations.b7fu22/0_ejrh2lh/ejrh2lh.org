I think the presence of the letter, or not, in a fic depends about what character receive it. People a reading a fanfiction, they know HP and the letter, so only how the character would react matter.

For a "wizard raised" child, like Ron, Draco or even Harry in a "the Potters survive" scenario, I don't think it should be shown. The owl arrives, and once the child see the letter, it's over, everyone already knows what it is about.

Yet, for a Muggleraised child (like Hermione), I think the scene become a lot more important, and should be shown. The child can wonder if it's a prank or not, can try to analyze the wording (considering Hermione character, just Dumbledore titles should make her crazy), or just show it to the parents.

So yes, if one of the character is Hermione, I think you should include it (and if the other character have different uprisings, it can be a good way to show the differents reactions of the parents).
