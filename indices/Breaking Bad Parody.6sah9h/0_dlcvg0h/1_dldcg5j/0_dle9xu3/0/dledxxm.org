He's the main character only in canon and even then only because Voldemort chose him to be the main character and so the whole setting is written around him. For a fanfic that, at least on its face, has nothing to do with Voldemort, Harry's just another somewhat impulsive, academically above-average bloke bound for the Quiddich league. Hermione, on the other hand, is intrinsically driven to excel, to scheme, to change the world whether the world wants it or not, and has a ruthless streak a mile wide.

A Harry-centric fic without Voldemort and related prophecy either has to rewrite Harry's personality and talents from scratch or create some other set of extrinsic circumstances to effectively force him to be the protagonist. Hermione, on the other hand, would make plenty of trouble in any setting without extrinsic pressure.
