... It doesn't matter. What you're talking about, that is. You'd have to rewrite Hermorgorermione's personality, too. She's not a drug dealer/cooker. All in all, it's whoever the author chooses. Sure, Hemanermione is smart, but her parents are dentists. You'd have to change them to change her, along with changing her peers and other things. Harry, on the other hand, would be easier. Just up the abuse from the Durshits, have Sirius-eerieus find Harpy (who ran away from the Fursleys) and, like, have a situation where they both see how much money they can make from meth (selling to fuggles and wizards) and they learn meth, then make meths. E-z.
