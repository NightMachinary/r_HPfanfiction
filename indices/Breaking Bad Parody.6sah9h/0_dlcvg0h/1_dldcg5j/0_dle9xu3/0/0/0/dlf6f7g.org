Sure it matters. Whereas you do need to change Harry (by making Dursleys worse) or give him a sane-yet-mischevious Sirius, there's no need to change Hermione or her upbringing. If Hermione can be convinced that the cause is just, there is basically no rule or moral principle she won't break.

In this case, just give her a reason to need to make a lot of money in a few months quickly, and make sure that it's for a very good cause. Her dentist parents are a plus, not a minus: she'd grow up overhearing a lot about break-in attempts at the practice and other drug-seeking behavior.

Or, Sort her into Ravenclaw or Slytherin, and have her discover that with their academic hypercompetitiveness, use and abuse of mind-enhancing potions is ubiquitous; and as the best in her year in Potions, people keep asking her to help them with that. At first, she does it as a favor. Then, something happens and she really needs the money...

And that's without even taking her out of Hogwarts.
