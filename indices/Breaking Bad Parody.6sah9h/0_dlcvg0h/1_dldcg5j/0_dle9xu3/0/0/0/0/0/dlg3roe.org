There are AUs, and then there are AUs. [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6i0ab8/how_many_deviations_from_canon_before_you_consider_a_fic_youre_reading_a_ba/dj2nllh?context=3][I wrote a whole philosophical post on it earlier.]]. The short of it, consistency with canon in fanfics is a bit like realism in "original" stories: if you break it, there needs to be a good reason for it.

Break-ins don't happen very often, but drug-seeking behavior certainly does, and it doesn't have to be at their practices for them to talk about it.
