Well that's still cool. I'd read it. A change from Lily worshipping is always nice. So would Harry be friends with Regulus, Snape and Crouch? That's the trend I've seen in Time travel fics. Not really a Snape fan. The guy is just bad in my opinion, but others are entitled to theirs. Generally when Snape is written they make him misunderstood and OOC, when in reality he wasn't a very nice person to begin with.
