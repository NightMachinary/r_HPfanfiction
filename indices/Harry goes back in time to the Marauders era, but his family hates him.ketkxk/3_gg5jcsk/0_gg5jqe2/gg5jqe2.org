There wouldn't really be any bashing (because I love Lily) but they definitely won't be 100% perfect as they are usually portrayed. And the Slytherins aren't going to be protagonists. Harry would have to disguise himself as muggleborn and I just don't see any Slytherins being friends with him. That being said, I still have plenty of stuff to work out.
