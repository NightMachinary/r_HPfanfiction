I probably should have just said "Harry takes Voldemort out of the picture" instead of kill. That way, it could be petrifying, Draught of Living Death, magical contract, Obliviating him like your example, removing his limbs and locking him up, throwing him so far into space that once his body finally dies, he'll either have no idea how to travel back to Earth or it'll just take forever, etc etc.
