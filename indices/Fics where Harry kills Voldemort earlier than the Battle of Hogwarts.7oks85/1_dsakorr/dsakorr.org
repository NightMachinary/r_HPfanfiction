It's too AU to count, but in When In Doubt, Obliviate, Gilderoy Lockhart successfully over-obliviates both Quirrel & Voldemort at the end of first year, leaving them catatonic and easily kept in custody.

Heck, it could be earlier; Quirrel might be spotted or otherwise identified during his break-in at Gringotts, leading to Aurors apprehending him and Voldemort's pre-Quirrel vessel.

Aside from that, without making the Horcruxes work differently, I can't think of a way for Voldemort to just be killed early, only apprehended, without an AU possibly involving time travel. Or maybe he could be petrified by his own basilisk after he gets the idea of raising one of his own (after all, the one in the Chamber did alright).
