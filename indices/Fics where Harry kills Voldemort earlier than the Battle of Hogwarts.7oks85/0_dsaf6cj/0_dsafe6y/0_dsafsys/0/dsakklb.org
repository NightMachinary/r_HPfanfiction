I don't want it to be AU before that divergence point in Voldemort's death. Horcruxes don't really affect the story before the 6th book, so if Voldemort's early death happened before then, it wouldn't really make a difference in the first five books. Suppose there's the fact that Voldemort survived the Killing Curse rebounding, but that can just be ignored as do many fics started before Half-Blood Prince came out.
