We're talking about two different things, I feel. Because it has "universe" in the title, I see the term AU as referring to changing the fundamental nature of the world --- so that a single-point-of-departure like "Petunia never married Vernon Dursley" wouldn't really be an AU, but a world where Goblins have wands or magic can create food out of nothing or Magical Britain is a kingdom /would/ be.

And so fundamentally changing the backstory of Voldemort and the way magic works is very AUish for me, even if the narrative of the first five books remains unchanged. Like... like how in a sci-fi story, you would still call a dimension where Mars was an inhabited planet, /but/ Earth history was exactly the same, an alternate universe.
