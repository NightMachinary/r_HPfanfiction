How is it an extremely AU? Just don't go over the explanations? Leave it like the books left it before Half Blood Prince came out. It doesn't need an explanation. Harry kills Voldemort before or right as the war breaks out, go to the aftermath. Who cares about the details in Voldemort's death? Plenty of fanfiction skips over Horcruxes and it goes just fine.

Having the details of the explanation behind his survival and death ignored is not creating an extreme AU. That's absurd. You're looking into this far too much. JK Rowling leaves out plenty of explanations for things. So can anyone else, and so they have many times in fanfiction.
