The only one I can think of off the top of my head, although I am sure there are better ones out there.

He is older than his brother, really popular, good at Quidditch, and receives tutelage from Merlin I think.

This story has the same generic forgotten Harry shtick as so many of them do. From what I can remember the angst is actually not awful and overdone. I just mean that he doesn't straight up hate everyone and acts like a big bag of butts.

His three main friends are OC's or one of them is...an unspecified amount of his close friends may or may not be OC's. I don't remember them being particularly bad.

Also, standard disclaimer, this fic is most likely dead.
