Not quite the office, but the best adaptation I've seen of this is olivieblake's "Hogwarts: The Real World" series. It's posted as part of linkao3(7183676) her Amortentia "fic", Hogwarts: The Real World starts on chapter 26, and the spin off (?) The Ministry of Magic: The Real World starts on chapter 76! Both absolutely hilarious and they definitely include some funny moments with Professors as well.
