I loved the first chapter so much! It actually got me excited and motivated (somehow) and I got my shit together (for a day). Although, I felt like it got progressively worse. I kind of struggled through the 2nd chapter and the 3rd one only became good again closer to the end.

The fic was interesting, though. So thanks for the rec. I am thinking of checking out more stuff by this author.
