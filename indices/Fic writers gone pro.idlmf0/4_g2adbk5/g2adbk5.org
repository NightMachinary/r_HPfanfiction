Sarah Rees Brennan and Naomi Novik both wrote Harry/Draco fic. Of course, Novik has written for a ton of fandoms and is one of the founders of Archive of Our Own, so she's a bit of a powerhouse. Her novel /Spinning Silver/ was nominated for several fantasy genre awards, and at one point Peter Jackson optioned /Temeraire/, her "dragons during the Napoleonic Wars" series for a possible movie.
