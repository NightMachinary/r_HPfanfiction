Cassandra Clare and her “[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Draco_Trilogy][Draco Trilogy]]” are certainly the big one. Eliezer Yudkowsky of /HPMoR/ fame has also published some original fiction, I believe, but he had already published /non/fiction before he started /HPMoR/, and all in all /HPMoR/ is more one aspect of his overall idiosyncratic career than what launched it.

[[https://jspotter.fandom.com/wiki/G._Norman_Lippert][G. Norman Lippert]]'s fame was certainly bolstered by the well-regarded oddities that are his /James Potter/ books, also.

Also... /tips hat shyly/ I have a story in [[https://www.arcbeatlepress.com/probe.html][this book]]. What feels like a lifetime ago, I was writing the moderately-well-regarded /Parselmouth of Gryffindor/. Which I still plan on picking up again at some point, but if any reader of mine was wondering where I'd been, that is more or less where. (That, and more stuff that hasn't been announced yet.)
