Copyright/trademark infringement, anyway --- I'm not sure if the exact charge would be "plagiarism". But OP isn't asking about fanfic writers who tried to publish /their fanfic/ for money; rather, they're asking about fanfic writers who later wrote original fiction commercially, drawing to one extent or another on the /experience/ they racked up in the fanfic world.

(Although there's always the trusty option of keeping a lot of the structure and characterization of your AU fic while changing the names and designs; depending on how far your original fic was from canon, the result can be pretty hard to recognize as fanfic-based, and it's certainly not illegal. Would you guess [[https://www.deviantart.com/twisted-wind/art/Oz-Abraham-Van-Helsing-838756151][this]] is a rebrand of a character from a /Mickey Mouse/ fancomic?)
