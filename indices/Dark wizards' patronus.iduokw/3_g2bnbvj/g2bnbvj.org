My headcanon is that the Patronus spell requires a memory of /love/, not a memory of happiness. Trying to use a hateful but technically happy memory causes the infamous backfiring we've seen on Pottermore and similar and is the reason the myth of Dark Wizards being unable to cast one.

I do believe, for example, that Lucius would be able to fuel a Patronus using happy loving memories of his family (no matter his faults, he always loved his family legitimately). This is also why I consider Snape's love for Lily legitimate (but very unhealthy!) and not pure obsession alone.

Harry fails to fuel a Patronus using happy memories of flying on a broom, which is almost certainly a memory fueled by pure joy. He succeeds using thoughts of his family -- a memory that is bittersweet more than happy, but very much loving.

This also explains why the Patronus is infamous for being difficult, yet Harry managed it just fine at thirteen. The reason is that people think the spell needs happiness, since that's what everyone else says about it, and when they try to use joyful but not loving memories without any effect whatsoever, they chalk it up to the spell being too hard for them. It also explains Hermione's issues with it, she has happy memories but gets too stuck on the happiness part that she picks the Most Happy(TM) memory she has, but one who doesn't happen to be very loving. While everyone else just decides to try different memories, she is utterly sure that she picked the right one and is frustrated by the lack of results.
