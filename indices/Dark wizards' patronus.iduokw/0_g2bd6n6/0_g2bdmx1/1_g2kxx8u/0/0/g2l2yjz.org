Technically everybody should be able, but If you are sadistic monster (Lestrange, Greyback, carrow, so on) it would be harder, that and the fact that Is considered a "light spell" is the reason why no one does use it in the Dark side, except for Umbridge, which I'm pretty sure only thinks about "protecting the purity of the Wizarding World" when casting it.
