It's all turning around [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/i9h9at/the_character_of_hp_magic/g1flpsp/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][the nature of Dark Magic]]. Most contrarian teenagers reading and authoring fanfiction stories love the idea that the wrong is right, and that only nasty old codgers like Dumbledore stops people from using wonderful Dark Magic. I don't agree (as seen from the linked comment) and yes I am an old codger myself. I really think that Dark Magic taints your soul and yes inability to produce the super-light magic like Patronus may be one of (many) costs.
