Okay so your comment was about dark magic being magic that takes from others while light magic is giving for others in a sense. Or atleast that's what I understood from it.

In that case, what do you gain from casting the cruciatus? Next, and I'm sure this has come up before, wouldn't intent be more important? Like it is possible to kill using a basic levitation charm, so would it have no effect? Also, suppose someone was about to kill other people, and you kill him to protect the others, does it taint you? How many times can you cast dark magic before the taint is permanent?
