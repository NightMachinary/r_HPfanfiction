BTW, I am afraid, one of the reasons why people are so willing to accept Dark Magic, is that JKR books were PG-13 and we haven't seen some truly horrendous parts of the Dark Magic (nothing sexual in nature, no real human sacrifice, not much real torture; e.g., the tortured child in linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50)), so it doesn't look as horrible as it could/should.
