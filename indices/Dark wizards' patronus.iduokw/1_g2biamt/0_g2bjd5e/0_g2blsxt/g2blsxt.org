That was just my basic very general premise. There are many details where it gets muddy and where the theory needs a lot of development.

So, Cruciatus is certainly one such case. I am not sure how does it work. I could try something about energy for the torture coming from the tortured, so they are effectively made to torture themselves, but it doesn't for Muggles, who can quite certainly be tortured as well. (BTW, concerning this curse, I was working for some time for a professor of pathophysiology who was researching pain; there are medicinal situations where part of the nervous system is intentionally so overwhelmed with pain, that it stops working, and so it allows some horrible surgery, e.g. amputation, be done; I wonder whether Cruciatus was originally meant as something like this; the same goes for some variant of Imperio ... it could be deadly useful for medicinal purposes).

Concerning intent. Yes, that's another question. With my theory, Dark Magic would certainly not cover all bad magical actions. Mrs Weasley with her enchanted knives (normally, chopping vegetables) can certainly make a lot of damage if she wishes, and that certainly falls into the original Neolithic magic.

Concerning righteous killing. Yes, certainly it can happen (soldiers in war, self-defence), but I don't think even in such situations Dark Magic would be allowed. If I understand Bellatrix Lestrange correctly, you have to want cause pain for the joy of causing pain, not out of the righteous anger (how did Harry manage to curse Alecto Carrow? I have no idea, but it was just one bout of magic, effectively rather painful Stunner, not sure; or we will rather silently ignore it as one of many inconsistencies of Mrs Rowling). The same goes for the Killing Curse ... you cannot use it for good reasons, in Self-Defence. You have to have your soul tainted, you have to want to have somebody killed just for the Death itself. Yes, Snape could do it as the former Death Eater, but that's probably the only one from the anti-Riddle side. Soliders in war just have to use some other curse ... Reducto/Expulso/Confringo (I still have problem to distinguish which is which) to your head would do just nicely.

Notice, that for example we never saw Umbridge using Cruciatus. She was rather slowly making up her mind to curse Harry, and we don't know if she could manage to do it.
