  The same goes for the Killing Curse ... you cannot use it for good reasons, in Self-Defence. You have to have your soul tainted, you have to want to have somebody killed just for the Death itself. Yes, Snape could do it as the former Death Eater, but that's probably the only one from the anti-Riddle side.

  (Sirius:) The Aurors were given new powers---powers to kill rather than capture, for instance. And I wasn't the only one who was handed straight to the Dementors without trial. Crouch fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects.

That said, I also disagree on various levels outside of Canon objections. On the most technical level, this ignores -- or presents a too simplistic version of -- human psychology. Not everyone who wants to kill is necessarily evil. And not everyone who doesn't kill isn't evil. If a requirement of the Killing Curse /were/ a desire to kill, then, given the right circumstances, most people should be able to. People can be one thing thing one minute and something completely different the next. Yes, some people operate on absolute principles. And some of /them/ might even remain unwavering in adversity and temptation. But they'd be the exception, not the norm. Darkness is in all of us. And it is this darkness that would fuel dark magic.

But I don't think I agree that that is how dark magic works. I'm inclined to go with the phenomenological explanation Rowling gave us: Dark magic is intrinsically different in that its spells, used for harm, are difficult or impossible to heal or reverse. But they do not require different dispositions in the caster; nor (the Cruciatus curse aside, if Bellatrix wasn't lying) a special motivation, nor a specific mindset. The most striking example is Sectumsempra, which Harry uses without even knowing what it does, beyond it being "for enemies".

So, it seems to me that dark magic isn't metaphysically different. This also has the positive effect that it's not the arbiter over good and evil. It allows for the obvious truth of being able to do evil without dark magic, and also for the possibility of conflicted natures like Snape, whose actions cannot be compressed into a single bottom line of good /or/ evil.
