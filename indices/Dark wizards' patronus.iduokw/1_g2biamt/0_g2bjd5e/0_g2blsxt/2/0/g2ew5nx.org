  Not everyone who wants to kill is necessarily evil.

I have never said that. I have said that according to my theory using Killing Curse is necessarily evil.

Crouch Sr. allowing use of Unforgivables. When Sirius talked about it, he was specifically saying that Aurors (I guess, those who followed this order) were getting really close to being as evil as Death Eaters. Or I would just put it among JKR's internal inconsistencies.

The same goes for Harry using /Sectumsempra/ without knowing what it is. It is just such world-building disaster, I would rather not talk about it at all. Whole seven books we are told (heck, that's whole purpose of Hogwarts as a school), that doing magic is much more complicated than just random waving your wand and saying random weird incantations. Heck, even with study most students don't manage even the most simple spells (/Lumos/, /Wingardium Leviosa/) on their first try. And that is not to mention whole theories about intent being significant (I am not sure whether it is or it isn't, but it certainly makes more sense than this scene). Here we have spell without any diagram for wand movement, without Harry even knowing what it does (so, whole intent goes out of the window), and it on the first try makes significant damage to Malfoy. It just doesn't compute for me.
