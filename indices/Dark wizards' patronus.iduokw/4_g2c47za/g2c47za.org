Given that "Dark Wizard" isn't defined, you'd first have to clarify what that is.

And in the likely event that that definition ends up such that Umbridge and/or Snape is included, then as per Canon, they /can/ produce Patronuses.

As a corollary, and more interesting answer to your question, here's something Rowling said in a chat:

#+begin_quote
  Samantha: Was snape the only death eater who could produce a full patronus

  J.K. Rowling: Yes, because a Patronus is used against things that the Death Eaters generally generate, or fight alongside. They would not need Patronuses.
#+end_quote

So, the "why" is meaningless, because they don't /need/ to. In other words, being a Death Eater (or a Dark Wizard, probably synonyms in the black/white world of HP) makes you impervious to Dementors.
