First of all, creating a Patronus (especially a corporal one) is supposed to be an amazing feat of Magic. The people using them in Canon are very talented wizard, usually in respected position like Auror (or at least, it should be the case if Harry had not managed to "teach" the spell to pretty much all the DA).

Then, the idea was that the Patronus is an incarnation of happiness, which attract dementors despite them being unable to consume it. The fanon idea is that the Dark Wizards are "corrupted" by the Dark Art and are unable to feel this "pure" happiness that is needed for the spell.

Of course, this is probably a fanon idea. Snape use the Patronus in canon and while he is on the good side, he is definitively a Dark Wizard. I think canon Death Eater never used the Patronus, despite some of them being able to, because they never had to. The Dementors are on their sides and they have other means of communication (the 2 use of the Patronus in canon).

PS : now that I think about it, the wizards being sent to Azkaban are probably unable to use the Patronus because all of their good memories (which could have been used to fuel the spell) have been consumed by the Dementors, and I doubt most of them have been able to create new one strong enough after their evasion. Did Sirius ever used the Patronus in canon?
