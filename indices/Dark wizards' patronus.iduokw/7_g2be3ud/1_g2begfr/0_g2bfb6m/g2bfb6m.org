I am not a big fan of this trope as well, so I'll waste no time defending it.

  Also would it be possible to cast a patronus if a cheering charm was overpowered?

That's a good question and one, given the lack of informations from canon, that is open to interpretation.\\
Personally, I would say no. Just like a love potion cannot truly create "love", I don't think the "Cheering Charm" can truly create happiness, but just an illusion of it. Such an illusion would probably not be strong enough to power the spell. You could probably try to use the memory of someone casting the cheering on you for a Patronus, but if it was to work, it would probably be thanks to the circunstances surrounding the spell, and not the spell itself (the good memory of a happier time when you could just mess around with your friends . . .).
