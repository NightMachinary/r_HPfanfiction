While I can't remember if the spell is ever called a "Compulsion Charm", Canon has several instance where a wizard use magic to manipulate a Muggle:

- The Leaky Cauldron is enchanted so Muggle don't pay it any attention
- The Ministry enchanted the land around the Stadium for the final of the World Cup, any muggle coming near to it would remember he had to be somewhere else for a very important reason
- Dumbledore enchanted Mrs Cole when he went to visit Tom Riddle. She thought a blank page he gave her was an official document from a legitimate school.
- In the Epilogue, Ron admitted to Harry that he had to enchant his examiner during his driving test so he didn't dock him points for not checking the mirror.

Thanks to all these example, we know that the Compulsion charm, or at least a charm very similar to it, exists in canon (though the Leaky Cauldron one can also be called a "Notice Me Not" charm). But we don't know if the Charm works on magical (all the canon examples were on Muggles), and we don't know how strong it is. An Imperiused person could murder his family before killing himself, while (from what we saw) the Compulsion charm is more of a nudge in the good direction. It is unknown if you could use it to make someone do something he wowuld really not do.\\
Also, calling it a "bootleg imperio" may be a bit too strong. The "Diffindo" hex and the "Sectumsempra" Curse are both used to cut thing, but they are not considered the same spell at all.
