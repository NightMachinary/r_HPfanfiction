I don't think it's a trope tho. I think it's canon that you get eaten by worms from inside-out if you are a 'dark' wizard and try to cast a Patronus.

Which, imho, it is incredibly idiotic, as there could have been a way more complex and interesting story about 'light' and 'dark' magic than just /hhhhhh evil go brrrrr/. But then again, I am quite against black-white morality, so maybe I'm projecting.
