“Interesting.” Riddle looked at him, still pointing Ginny's wand, but now smiling. “You know, when I first heard of how you defeated Voldemort, I thought I'd lure you down here and kill you. Now seeing you face to face, I understand.”

Harry looked down at Ginny, keenly aware that with each passing minute, she crept closer and closer to death. But what could he do? I've got to keep him talking, wait for an opening.

“Why would you care? Voldemort was after your time?”

Tom laughed at this, “You don't get it? It's an anagram.”

Harry looked down at the map where letters were now rearranging, “Overt Mold?”

“No, No, LORD Voldemort. Is that parchment a magical anagram solver?”

“Something like that. Odd Mover Troll? Mr. Old Dot Lover?”

“What? No. Ok, fine maybe it doesn't work so well in that direction. It's ‘I am Lord Voldemort'. It's an anagram of Tom Marvolo Riddle.”

“Oh, I don't suppose Tom is short for Thomas?”

“Well, yes. Why?”

/Lord volt's airhead mom, Admiral Voldemort's Ho,/ “No reason.”
