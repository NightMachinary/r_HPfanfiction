Why would Harry know what a Dildo is? He's got an abusive family, and we don't know if Hogwarts has Sex Ed. And if they did, we don't know WHEN or how...comprehensive it is. Harry has less of a chance knowing what one is than Ginny, who has a loving family that would actually teach her.

He'll be stuck with two very confused preteens (both a boy and a girl, at that) asking what a Dildo is!
