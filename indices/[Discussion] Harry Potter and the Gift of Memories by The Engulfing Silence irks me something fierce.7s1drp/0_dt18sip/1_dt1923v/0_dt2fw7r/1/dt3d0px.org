Does /Untitled Tome/ get a central conflict? I read maybe fifteen chapters (maybe three chapters after Harry joins a dueling team), and while there were allusions to conflicts in the world, it didn't look like Harry would get involved in them before graduation. Which seemed like it would be around chapter 220, barring major time skips.
