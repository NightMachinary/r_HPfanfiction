I've already read those fics. I was simply bored and picked randomly from my to-read list. The premise sounded palatable, and I thought I'd take a chance. It just got disturbing and was a failure too fast. At this point, I'd say I'm at stage III or even stage IV, having read almost all of the well-known good fics that I search around for lesser known fics and stumble with fair frequency across mediocre or downright terrible fics.
