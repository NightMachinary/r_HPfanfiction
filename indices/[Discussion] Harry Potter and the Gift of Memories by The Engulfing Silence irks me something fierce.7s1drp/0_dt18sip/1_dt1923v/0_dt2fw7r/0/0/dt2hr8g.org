That was when I started branching into crossovers and other fandoms entirely. I've been crushing Naruto fanfics the last 6-7 months.

No better feeling than when you find a fandom with it's own share of gems waiting to be read.

Side note: try going through the DLP almost recommended if you're truly out of fics. They're not bad.
