I've skimmed all the stories in this universe so far. With all the over the top, ridiculous things that happen in this, it would've been a very fun story if the author had the slightest hint of self-awareness. A tiny infusion of crack and/or self-mockery would've made this a SoTerribleIt'sAwesome!fic. Instead, the author treats it likes he's writing encyclopedia Britannica. So on top of the all the WTF happenings, the writing is actually dry (though technically competent), as if the author is writing a Jesus biography that has to maintain a somber tone throughout.
