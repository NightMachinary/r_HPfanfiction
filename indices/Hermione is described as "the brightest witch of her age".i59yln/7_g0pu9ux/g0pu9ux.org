We have the movies to blame for this, in part. In book 3, Sirius's last words (to Harry) after being rescued are "you really are your father's son." But in the movie, instead his last words are to Hermione instead - "you really are the brightest witch of your age". Like, this guy has spent the whole year as a dog and living in an actual cave, how would he know shit about anything, let alone the other witches at Hogwarts?
