Lupin said "You're the cleverest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione." That's it. Stans have taken to making this "brightest witch of her age" for no reason other than to prop up the self-insert. No one would deny that Hermione's smart, well-read and hardworking, but she also needs to be some sort of OP!MarySue goddess as well. By now the phase has been altered for well over a decade so I doubt anyone will change it to what it originally was.
