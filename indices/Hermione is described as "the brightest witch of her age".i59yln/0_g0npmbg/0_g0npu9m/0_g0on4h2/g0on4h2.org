A number of fanfiction authors out there do in fact make much more of this statement than it deserves. So your milage may vary. I would not necessarily abandon a work just because it uses that sentence, you need to take a deeper look at the context. In the actual cannon books it is a fairly harmless complement, and some works will use it that way. Other works will make her out to be a genius, and in some of those she really is (like linkao3(14281440) and its sequels) while in others she is only thinks she is (I do not think linkao3(14271909) uses that line, but if it did, it would fall in that category) and everything in between.
