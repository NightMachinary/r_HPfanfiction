Well, Lupin isn't qualified to say Herms is the brightest with of the ERA, and it's also very weird to say "You're the brightest witch of the late 20th century I've ever met", it's clearly "you're the brightest 13 year old I ever met", and Hermione is definitely very bright and more importantly, curious and self-driven, but she's not a super-genius, so yeah.
