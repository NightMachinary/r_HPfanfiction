That's exactly what I wanted to say. In many fan fictions this sentence that in the books is a normal compliment is exaggerated. The author implies that Hermione is the smartest witch of the 20th century, literally. I also found fics where it was explicitly written that Hermione is "the smartest witch if the century".
