I never thought about it from this point of view, but in this case you're right. But this doesn't change that when I read a sentence like these, they just put me off. I've read few fics where these kind of descriptions are not made objectively, meaning that I don't read them as "you're the brightest witch that I know of" but as "you're the brightest witch of the entire wizarding world".

Maybe I always misunderstood while readingthem, but they just put me off and I usually stop reading that fic.

Sorry if there are mistakes, English is not my first language.
