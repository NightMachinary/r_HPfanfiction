It's Lupin that says it. It's not a blanket "I R HERMIONE SUPER GOD" statement that people tend to write it as, it's "I'm a bit of a recluse, but you're the brightest 14 year old witch I've met" but people, real or fictional make sweeping statements when that's not what they actually mean.

Hermione could be outclassed by a Wizarding version of AKB48 that attend Mahoutokoro, but Lupin would have never met or heard of them, so the sweeping "Brightest witch of her age" is personal bias due to not knowing others, and compliments usually lack quantifiers, as they're less of a compliment "You're the brightest witch of your age, that i know of... though you're probably beaten by dozens of people that I've never met sorry" is less of a compliment or a boast about your favourite female student.

As for the Voldemort one, people who lived through suffering from one Dark Lord will think that's the worst due to personal experience. You can't tell someone that they didn't suffer because someone in the past suffered worse and add quantifying arguments, that just makes you a dick. If you didn't live through Grindelwald, but your relatives were tortured, murdered and reanimated as Inferi by Voldemort and you had to burn your own little sister's body so she didn't kill you, it wouldn't matter if Grindelwald or Gengis fucking Khan was "Worse" statistically to others, to you, Voldemort was the worst Dark Lord of all time
