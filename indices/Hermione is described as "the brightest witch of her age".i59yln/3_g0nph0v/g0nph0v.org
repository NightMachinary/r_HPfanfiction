  I think it would have made more sense to describe her as the "brightest witch of her school year".

In Prisoner of Azkaban this is exactly what Lupin says:- â€˜You're the cleverest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione.'

Also the context is Lupin has just revealed his collaboration with Sirius and is trying to convince the trio of his good intentions, so it would make sense to flatter Hermione.
