Yeah, it's silly. Lupin's just complimenting her when he says it in the book, but it's not like he endows her with a title that everyone in the world knows about. I don't mind if people write her as a genius, but she should have to prove that, to the reader and to the other characters. Aside from getting good grades, most of the especially clever things that Hermione does are things only Harry and Ron know about.
