Killing curse - Where the hell do you get the killing curse can't be silently cast from? Fanfics? Besides literally no mention of a restriction on silent casting, we see Voldemort cast a killing curse silently in OoTP. Yes, your opponent can see a spell coming. That said, it's the most effective spell in combat. No magical methods of protection can stop it. This means no magical shield or protective enchantment (such as that on clothing) can save you. Yeah, your opponent can conjure (difficult magic by the way and not taught to most people with the exception of bird and snake conjurations) but that stops the spells besides killing curses as well.

By the way, Moody said "I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed". Along with the rest of the passage, the implication isn't that a weak, ineffective spell would be cast like Harry's weak cruciatus but rather that /no/ spell would be cast.

Cruciatus - Not only do you have to muster up a particular emotion to cast it, you have to actively focus on it to maintain the spell and keep your wand pointed at the target. This leaves you vulnerable to, oh say, a killing curse to the chest. It's also interesting that Harry is combat capable immediately after /Voldemort/'s cruciatus curse ends. He feels aches and pain but can dodge curses cast by Voldemort. You can block a cruciatus as well, something impossible with a killing curse. Frankly, I would be unsurprised if an occlumens could remain combat-capable under a cruciatus, especially a weakened one.

Imperius - some people can fight it. Bit of a risk but I'll concede it's a viable combat option. I wouldn't use it myself as a primary as I'd prefer a spell with perfect stopping power and a success rate far beyond the imperius (such as the killing curse). I also find it interesting that your creativity with the spell doesn't extend past rape. I would suspect, given the cruciatus and the unique status of the killing curse, that the imperius can be blocked as well.

Edit: Another point about the imperius. You commit to a spell where resistance builds up over time. When the imperius ends, victims regain their memories. So imperiusing a classmate to do homework means that you've committed. There's no going back. Eventually, their resistance is going to build and you're going to lose control.
