  The only spells I consider more combat-effective in canon are the killing curse

I always considered the Killing Curse as the less usefull Unforgivable Spell. Sure it's a sure kill shot, but it's a spell that's can't be used non verbally (as other Unforgivables I think?) with a long formula. I find it hard to use during a fight :

- In a duel situation, your opponent has the time to see the spell coming and can act in consequence (summon a physical shield to block it, go behind a protection or just spam spells the time you finish to prononce the long ass formula). Sure sometimes it work, but I'm pretty sure other spells would also have reached your opponent and finished the duel a little faster.
- In a battle situation, it's a little more usefull because your opponent can't only focus on your, but also your allies. So the spell has more chance to touch an unsuspecting target but there is the risk of friendly fire added to the mix.

The Killing Curse seem to be the most usefull as an execution spell (the enemy is already neutralized and you finish him) and as a symbol to terrify the masses.\\
In comparaison, the Cruciatus Curse seem to be more usefull all around :

- Shorter formula, so faster to use for similar effect (the guy that just felt the worst imaginable pain is on the ground for at least several second, you can use any spell you want to finish him)
- His "failed form" is more effectives than the Killing Curse's (fail a Killing Curse and you can't even "make someone's nose bleed" (according to Barty Jr as Moody) while Harry failed Cruciatus still put Bellatrix on the floor.
- Torturing people to get intels

As for the Imperius, just the best spell either. You fight a 1V3 duel? A little "/Imperio/" and bam it's a 2V2.\\
Don't want to do your homeworks? "/Imperio/" and your "friend" will do it for you.\\
Nice girl won't give your any intention? "/Imperio/" and . . . yeah this is the most dangerous spell of all.
