If you have no safe alternative, using lethal force against an imperiused enemy would be justified. But with magic, there are a lot more safe and effective alternatives to lethal force than there are in the real world. If you're fighting an imperiused wizard that's blocking stunners and other non-lethal spells, sure, switch to lethal spells, but you should try non-lethal force first.
