Harry's outlook on use of non-lethal spells is commendable, but it's an unrealistic mentality to have in a war. Like you said, there were so many cases of people being freed of the imperius curse after the war, because death eaters used them as an expendable army. The imperius isn't easy to break, and victims become cognisant over a long period of time - if the OTP members were unwilling to fight against an imperius victim lethally, death eaters would exploit that fact and weaponise it even further. Someone under the imperius is no longer themselves, they're an extension of the enemy and need to be treated as such or you're risking your life. Morality in war-time is blurred; it's kill or be killed.
