My take on it is this: Ask yourself, "Would I rather die than be used to commit horrible acts against innocent people?". Sure, capturing is generally better than killing even without mind control or other coercion in the mix, but when you can't hold the prisoners you take and most capture-oriented spells can be easily undone by the target's allies, the only truly viable option is aiming to maim or kill.
