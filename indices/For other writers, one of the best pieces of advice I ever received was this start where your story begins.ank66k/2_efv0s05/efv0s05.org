Totally agree, it's 100% boring to read from year 1 when the real plot starts at year 4.

On the subject of flashbacks, it annoys me to get a screen-size separator with "FLASHBACK" written in the middle. Shouldn't the author be able to make the reader understand it's a flashback without that indicator?
