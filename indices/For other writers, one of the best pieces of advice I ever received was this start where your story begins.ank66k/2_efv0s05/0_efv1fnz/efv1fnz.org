People on FFN don't know how to use the line breaks to separate scenes or delineate PoV switches.

One of the hallmarks of oldschool HP fanfics is the weird combinations of oOoOoOOOo or X-X-X-X instead of line breaks. I remember that it was fashionable at one time to use an acronym of the story's name like, =-=-H-P-a-t-P-S-=-= if the fic's name was "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone".
