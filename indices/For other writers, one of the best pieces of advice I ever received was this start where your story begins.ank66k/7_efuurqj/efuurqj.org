This is something I agonised over with Victoria Potter, where I considered starting the series at the beginning of fourth year. Ultimately I decided against it.

An important element of the story is witnessing Victoria's progression from magical novice to powerful witch; had the story started at fourth year, without having witnessed a major part of that progression, the reader would be presented with someone who comes off as a Mary Sue. On top of that, the way she progresses in magic is supposed to tell the reader important things about how magic works and therefore guides the reader in their understanding of magic for the rest of the series.

The other major barrier to starting in 4th year would be the supporting cast. By 4th year, they will all have significant amounts of history with each other. Indeed, one of the major themes of 4th year is dealing with the fallout of an event at the end of 3rd year which shifts the dynamic of some of the relationships. While this definitely can be dealt with in a "in medias res" way, with the reader being drip-fed information about what had occurred in 3rd year and why, the reader would essentially have entered into a conversation mid-way through, surrounded by strangers who have all these unknown backstories.

So I decided to start at first year and take the "snowball effect" route to building everything up. I continue to feel that it was the correct decision, but I do sympathise with the criticism that chapters 1-6 are all laying the groundwork for the later story rather than telling an interesting story in themselves (though of course, if someone were reading VP without ever having read the HP series, then chapters 1-6 would be an integral part of the story - another reason why I like to have them). Even though they cover much the same ground as canon, there are too many things in those chapters that I feel the story needs - for example, Victoria's pre-Hogwarts ability with magic, which is the first and most fundamental indicator of true talent; or her different relationship with the Dursleys than canon Harry, where she is treated better in material terms but still starved of affection and praise, which forms the basis of one of her character traits (vanity).
