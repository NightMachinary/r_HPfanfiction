I don't really agree with this. I tend to prefer full seven-year stories, even if the divergence only gets clearer later on. It feels more complete. But of course, that doesn't mean canon rehash doesn't get old very quickly; so my solution is to make First and Second Year arbitrarily short, with lots of skipping and ellipsis, only showing us what's changed and leaving the rest to your memory. So for example, if we're imagining an Animagus Harry for whom the real difference starts in Second Year plot-wise, you'd still have First-Year to show all his introductions to the various characters, but the extent of the Broomstick Scene or the Troll Scene would be that we'd get to see the conversation in the aftermath of those scenes (which unlike the scenes themselves /would/ change as a result of what's changed with Harry).
