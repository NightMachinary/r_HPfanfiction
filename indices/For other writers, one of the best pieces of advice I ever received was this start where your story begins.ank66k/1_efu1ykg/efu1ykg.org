I'm going to second this.

Every time I open a story that has an interesting premise and Harry is on the train or a day away from opening his letter or /whatever/, I have to restrain myself from closing the tab. I know I have to give it a chance, but I usually end up skimming the first few chapters or /years/ trying to do so.

Please---write where the story starts, or as close as you can to it.
