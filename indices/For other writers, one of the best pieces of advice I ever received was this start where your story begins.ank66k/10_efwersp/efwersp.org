I agree with this, you can have your story be as AU as possible, but just show stuff happening through a different way; whenever it's important to do so. Otherwise, yeah; just start as close as you possibly can to where your story actually starts.

So many stories start at year one, and they're nothing but rehashing, except for a few minor changes here and there, but even that gets boring/annoying after a while. So if your story really starts in I don't know, year 5 where the story picks up for you, start there.

That's really great advice.
