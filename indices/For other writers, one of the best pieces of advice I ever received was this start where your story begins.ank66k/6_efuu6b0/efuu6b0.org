Completely agree. Way too often, I find myself reading a fic that starts out interesting, then dully meanders along for ages before /finally/ getting back to the point. If the author just skipped all that useless fluff, summarizing the important points and maybe stopping to flesh out a couple of the more pivotal ones, I might not skip ahead so much. (Because I do that. More than I should, probably, but I have little tolerance for slice-of-life stuff after encountering so much of the boring kind.)

So, if there's something vitally important that happens before the meat of the story begins, use timeskips. Use flashbacks sparingly. Long or frequent flashbacks are annoying (imo) for the same reason I hate prequels; I already know the state of things in the present, so reading about the past holds no mystery or tension.

If you really want to start in media res and then go back to explain how they got there, do so at a point /not far from the beginning./ If you start at the end of fourth year and then go all the way back to first year, yeah, I'm going to either lose interest or skip ahead. Instead, I'd recommend--in most cases--going back no more than a couple of weeks. Gives you a hook, but keeps you from losing the fish.

^{Upon re-reading it, I don't know how that metaphor's supposed to work. I just had plot hooks in mind and it somehow turned into a line that doesn't make logical sense. Sorry. XD}
