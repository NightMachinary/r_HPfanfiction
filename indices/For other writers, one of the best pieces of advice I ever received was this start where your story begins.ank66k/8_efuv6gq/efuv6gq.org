I can vaguely remember a story that had an interesting premise in the summary and decent opening chapters and then spend 600k words on pre Hogwarts stuff because the author wanted to present things from everyone's viewpoint. If I recall correctly most of those words were even spent on a chunk of about 10 days. I skipped forward to the last posted chapter to see if it was completed already and found that the author still hadn't moved on to Hogwarts stuff so I stopped reading
