As a storytelling tool, objectively I know that flashbacks as a narrative device can be used in an effective way to forward the plot without spending time rehashing things we already know.

But when I'm starting new fics that use flashbacks, I must be picking the wrong ones or something, because reading fanfic flashback sequences, they're neither used to show /or/ tell relevant information, but rather used to bait and switch.
