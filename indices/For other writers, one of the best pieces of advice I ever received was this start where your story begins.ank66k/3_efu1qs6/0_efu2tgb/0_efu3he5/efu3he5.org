I've been reading a non-linear fic and it's driving me bonkers.

It does the exact opposite of the typical Year One canon rehash which is thousands of words of pointless exposition of things we already know (and some additional rehashed fanon, like the Gringotts inheritance tests.) Instead, it starts right in the thick of the story, with Snape and Lupin being respectful colleagues, and flashes back to "Several years earlier". What's making me so angry is that each present-time chapter sets up mysteries, and each flashback scene carefully avoids answering the questions that the reader wants to know.

To me, it seems like a contrived method of perpetuating mystery and tension, by depriving the reader of information that is known by the characters in-story... instead of creating genuine conflicts.
