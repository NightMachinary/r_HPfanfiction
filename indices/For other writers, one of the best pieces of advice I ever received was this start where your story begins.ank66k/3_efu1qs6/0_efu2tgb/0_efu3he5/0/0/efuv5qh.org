One way to keep flashbacks in check is to only use them as part of the action. Pensieves, Dementors, people getting knocked out, etc can be a good way to say: "Hang on a second, there's some background information you need." They feel more natural than just dropping into a 10,000 word explanation of why certain things are the way they are.

One thing JKR is really good at, in my opinion, is structure. For all the idiot-ball carrying characters and minor plot issues, she does structure /really/ well, revealing information at key points to nudge the audience along without spelling anything out until the big reveal.

Structurally, flashbacks should rarely be the "big reveal" section of the story or scene, until it is at the climax of said story or scene. Flashbacks to add mystery are all over the place in canon, while giving necessary context to current-time characters, but they should reveal /something/. Playing with /where/ the flashback takes place in the story or scene can completely alter it from being tiresome and boring, to a gripping revelation.

But yeah, hard to pull off.
