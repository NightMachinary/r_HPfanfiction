  What's making me so angry is that each present-time chapter sets up mysteries, and each flashback scene carefully avoids answering the questions that the reader wants to know.

This is exactly how I view flashbacks, most of the time. They can be done well, but so often even published authors with professional editors behind them can't pull it off. It's a big ask for fanfiction authors.
