The opposite of the canon rehash is starting /after/ the story begins, and splicing in random flashback scenes to fill in the gaps of "How We Got Here". Eg, Harry facing the dragon challenge from the Triwizard Tournament as the first chapter of book one. I understand that non-linear narrative is a stylistic choice, but when it's written off-the-cuff and chapter-by-chapter as most fanfics are, none of it comes off as cohesive. Just random scenes that don't provide any sort of continuous flow to a story.

...Or maybe I'm too stupid and plebeian to "get" artistic/stylistic writing.
