I really enjoyed [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18634393/chapters/44188591][Notes on a Resurrection]] by newleaves. It has a lot of jumps and an unreliable narrator however that's the beauty of it because the author pulls all the strands together. Its Drarry and also Wolfstar. The friendship between Ron and Draco is lovely. And Luna and Draco. There is a sequel but I think I prefer the first to the second but that's because I think Draco is a funnier narrator than Harry. Harry is a bit too OoTP Harry for me.
