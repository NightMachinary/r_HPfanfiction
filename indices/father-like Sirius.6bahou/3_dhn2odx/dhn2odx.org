May not be your cup of tea if you aren't interested in reading about a Harry that becomes a girl after some accidental magic and how he deals with it. Also imo Harry's girl name is really stupid but if you can look past that it has a nice relationship between harry and Sirius. Girl Harry doesn't immediately come out to the world as being Harry Potter so she is adopted by Sirius under the guise of being a distant Black relative who's parents recently died. Gradually we learn about a relationship between Sirius and lily prior to lily and James so there's a nice surrogate dad/child bond thing. Also Harry doesn't all of a sudden start liking guys so we get a cute budding relationship between him/her and Susan.
