Boom. Sirius escapes Azkaban, takes Harry with him, begins to attempt to prove Sirius' innocence. There's 3 full books and a prequel book that ties in with it. Semi Regularly updated, follows similar major plot lines as the books, and honestly is as equally enjoyable as the actual books from JK. Can't recommend it enough!
