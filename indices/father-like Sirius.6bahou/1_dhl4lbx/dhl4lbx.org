In linkffn(The Wise One: Book One: Becoming by FarenMaddox) (I linked the first part of a trilogy), Sirius escapes from Azkaban, steals Harry and they hide to live together. :) But he spends less time in Azbakan, he escapes when Harry is 8 years old.

It also has great world-building outside of the wizarding Britain, and a lot of well-developed OCs.

In my view, the first part and the (very-very-very long) epilogue to the third part are the best, with the second part being a little bit "meh".
