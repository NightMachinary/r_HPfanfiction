Can't think of a long fic that's decent but not that well known. Long fics are either masterpieces or completely unreadable in my experience.

I'd try linkffn (Saving Connor), if you haven't read it before. Including the sequels I think it's 1 million words or so. I can confirm quality writing, but I've only read through the first two.
