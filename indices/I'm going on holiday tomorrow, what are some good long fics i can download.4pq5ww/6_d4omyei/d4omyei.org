I highly recommend the Albus Potter series by noahphantom. The series is canon compliant. I've always been drawn to fics that explore in-depth what magic is capable of and this series does an awesome job of it. The series hasn't been updated in awhile but the beta says it should be updating soon. Here's the first in the series: linkffn(8417562)
