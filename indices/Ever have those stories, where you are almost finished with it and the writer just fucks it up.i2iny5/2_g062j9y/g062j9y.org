This happened to me. The fic was A Second Chance and, on paper and to start with, was primarily about Sirius getting freed early from Azkaban and rebuilding his life, which included reuniting with Remus, adopting Harry, and all that jazz. And Sirius is one of my favorite characters so this seemed right up my alley. He even gets engaged to an OC eventually. Good stuff, things are looking up for my man here.

But then stations of the canon happened and he /still/ fell through the damn veil.

To be clear, this was more a "last straw" kind of situation -- the rest of the fic is quite sexually explicit despite not being labeled as a smut fic, enough to be rather off-putting if you're not expecting it. (And I mean this in both a sexytimes way and a sexual violence way.) But that was the moment I dropped it for good.
