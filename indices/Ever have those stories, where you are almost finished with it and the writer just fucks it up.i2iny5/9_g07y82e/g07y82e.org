HPMOR was one of the first fanfics I ever read, and I really loved it... at first. Then the tone and premise kept shifting further and further away from what I'd originally enjoyed, to the point that I felt bait-and-switched.

There was a Naruto fic ("People Lie") from Less Wrong's Favorites list on ffnet that I also initially liked, only for it to suddenly veer from "dark (and occasionally darkly comedic) story about a traumatized borderline-sociopath Naruto" to "Naruto is a master vampire powered by the fox that's actually an eldritch horror".

Bait-and-switch is definitely one of my biggest pet peeves, along with obnoxious forced visits to the stations of canon (getting well into a fic that's wildly AU only for Sirius to still fall through the Veil is disgustingly common), divergences that are complete /non sequiturs,/ and killing off certain characters (especially Neville or Luna).
