One of my least favourite cliches is when Harry isn't his real name. Or in dimension/time travel fics, where he changes his name and just becomes this new OC.

Hadrian seems specifically popular for Lord Potter stories, because Harry is /too much a commoners name/. I remember reading a HPxLotR fic where the author basically said something like "I hate the name Harry so I'm changing it".
