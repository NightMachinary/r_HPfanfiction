True that. But then again, that's normal for humans; we are all Pavlovian dogs, so to say. So that people form biases is not exactly surprising.

On that note, “pup” is kind of wrong since Sirius had a hard time seeing Harry as Harry rather than James, so any pet names of that sort are really unlikely (and a bad pun); though personally I've yet to stop reading a story because of that alone, anything that I do stop reading has a plethora of other problems in the text.
