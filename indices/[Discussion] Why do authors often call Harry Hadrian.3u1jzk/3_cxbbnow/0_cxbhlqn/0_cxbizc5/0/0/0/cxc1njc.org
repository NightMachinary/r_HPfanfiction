Don't want to be an arse, but it really would be better for you to just stop trying to defend yourself as far as that issue goes.

I mean, I do get your point, but it's also clear that you do have a bias; how much that bias influences your ability to judge this particular story objectively matters not, for what matters is the fact that people will dismiss your claims of being able to do so due to the bias regardless of whether they are right or you.

On that note, I haven't read that story so I can't say whether I consider you to be right or wrong here. But I will say this: for me what matters is whether the name change, any name change, makes sense or not. So if there is a reason, an actual sensible reason, for the name change that is presented in the story, then I can accept Harry being named Henry, Hadrian, Jean-Jaques, or even Zulu the First. Of course, if there's no reason for the name being changed then it'll just make me roll my eyes or groan, but oh well.
