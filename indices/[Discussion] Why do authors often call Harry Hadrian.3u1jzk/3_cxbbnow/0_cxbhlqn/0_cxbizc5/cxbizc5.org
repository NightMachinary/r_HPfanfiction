Everyone has that /one/ fic that they turn a blind eye to, in which they consider it to be the one that disproves the point. The problem is, that I can view things objectively, I have read (rather, tried to, and ended up skimming it) that story, and it's just not good at all. This isn't the first time someone has brought that story up as an example, and I just roll my eyes every time.
