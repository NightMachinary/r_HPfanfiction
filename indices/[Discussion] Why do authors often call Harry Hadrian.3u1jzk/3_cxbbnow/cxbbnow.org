I can't actually read a story that uses "Hadrian". Someone, people have gotten it into their heads that when they're writing a "political" or "pureblood society" story, that they need to mark off a bunch of checkboxes to do it, and having Harry's name be something ridiculous is enough to get the point across? It's usually accompanied by a hyphenated name, because apparently you can't be an upstanding member of society without one. It's all paint-by-numbers bullshit that doesn't actually matter at all.
