Because he's the character whose story elevates Harry Potter from YA fiction to literature. Through this character, JKR explores many issues themes I already cared about in a truly spectacular and original way, and I was also introduced to issues I never really thought about.

Because he's hilarious, his story is fascinating, he's a hero, he steals every scene he is in, and he is crucial to the story - it starts and ends with him, in way. Love him, and from a fanfiction writer's perspective, trying to write him in a way that replicate his wit and gift for conveying different meanings at the same time is just the best time ever.
