I love him as a character but hate him as a person haha.

I love the dimensionality and he's quite an interesting character to read down to the dialogue. He makes the perfect antagonist that has been made that way due to his past experiences and not just because "he's just evil there's nothing more to it."

Though as a person, I wouldn't like him at all. I understand why he became so bitter and mean but at the same time everyone has to take responsibility for the way they act and how they treat others. It doesn't matter if you've been bullied as a child, it doesn't make bullying kids okay. And I don't get how people can obsess over him and pretend like he's an absolute hero whilst ignoring the many more terrible things he did.
