If I was to meet him, as described I wouldn't like him but I think that as a character he is deeply interesting and one of the few dynamic characters we meet. Dumbledore is set up as a foil, I believe. Except, the DH plot never really has that much time to ponder Dumbledore - not with a conclusion. In my opinion, Cursed Child shows that Harry never really came to understand Dumbledore and his actions.

When it comes to the adults in the Harry Potter series, there is little in the way of complex characters. Snape, I think fulfils an interesting premise for fanfiction because his actions are so closely guided by the shitty hand he was dealt so you can potentially interrupt that by changing some things.

Note: I am in no way suggesting that all, or even most, people with his experiences would have followed his path.
