Because he's a sardonic jerk.

Gotta remember this was built around the viewpoint of kids. Our first view of him is reminding ppl fame isn't everything, so stop treating him differently. Harry doesn't know anything just like you lot (which lesson goes awry by Hermione lol).

Afterwards... JKR kinda deteriorates his character more trying to keep with that sardonic and jaded character. He could have been so much more, and you see that with fanfiction, than she wrote.
