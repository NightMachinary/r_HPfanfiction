Snape is my favorite character precisely because he's a fucked-up, grudge-holding, ugly, morally grey character trapped in a nightmare of his own making who, for /whatever/ reasons, does the right thing.

He's a great foil and secondary antagonist, he energizes every scene he's in, and he sacrifices his ambitions (the only thing besides Lily that seemed to give him hope as a child) and then his life. The fact that he's responsible for Harry's terrible circumstances because he gave Voldemort the prophecy in the first place -- and then is ultimately and agonizingly responsible for passing Harry the information he needs to die "properly" in order to survive Voldemort -- is satisfying on a narrative level. He's a fabulous ambiguous character, a wiry, watchful, intense bugger with huge amounts of poorly controlled anger simmering beneath the surface and a very active sense of malice. His hatred is practically a living thing. He's immensely talented and trapped by his own mistakes. He's been stewing in guilt for years, even if he can't be bothered to care about what he did to James and Harry. He's obsessive, and that all becomes focused on Harry and Voldemort. He's not a tall man, and in his youth he was weedy and not very articulate, but by the time Harry meets him, he's learned how to be intimidating. Certain painful reminders will make him explode into half-deranged tantrums. He's brave, and he's very open about his emotions (which leads me to wonder how he could be such a successful spy), and there are hints that Dumbledore's opinion meant more to him than the headmaster ever realized.

While the series was in progress, there were various mysteries and questions concerning his motives and loyalties. He was bullied and precocious, working class, brilliant, a potions prodigy and adolescent inventor of spells, a duellist, an Occlumens and Legilimens, a double agent, Dumbledore's murderer, a vicious abuser of his position, a terrible excuse for an adult -- and he could fly without a broom. Plus he died painfully and tragically, driven by a combination of grief and guilt, while remaining an arsehole to the bitter end.

Rather pointedly, he's the middle part of the morality spectrum that includes Harry and Tom Riddle, the three lost boys of Hogwarts, all halfbloods, all damaged by their childhoods.

Perception of Snape's character has changed radically over the last few years, but the little working-class weirdo from the divided Muggle/magical household, with his boiling resentments, his obsessions, his utter lack of emotional maturity, his myriad gifts, his courage, his self-loathing, his darkness, his viciousness, and his fatal mistakes makes him a gift to hundreds of fic-writers. Greasy hair, hooked nose, habitual cruelty, and all, he's a mess of contradictions and a moral basket case whom I still enjoy more than any other character in the canon.
