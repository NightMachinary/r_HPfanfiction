  He isnt Spiderman or Superman, and he sure as hell isnt going to save a baby. To some extent hes on his own side, just trying to survive.
#+end_quote

There are much more compelling hero figures in literature who aren't superheroes, you should look it up. In any case, Snape has perhaps not saved any particular baby, but that's a weird criteria, really - neither did any other character. The only characters who had died to save a baby were James and Lily who had a vested interest in said baby. It was the only baby Voldemort had targeted, so...

Snape risked his life constantly and demonstrated a complete lack of self-interest to the point that you could argue he never got over the suicidal mood he was in after Lily died. He tried not to die, yes, so that he could complete his mission. In any case, "trying to survive" makes one human, not heroic or an anti-hero or a villain.

  However I hate when people justify him becoming a bad guy because he was bullied, it doesnt work.
#+end_quote

They don't justify it. They explain it, and some of them highlight that even at his worst he was not as bad as some. In any case, bullying has long term consequences for victims, these consequences include undesirable behaviors, so that's exactly how it works, psychologically if not "ethically".

  The Marauders didnt bully Snape, bullying means one sided. And we know for a fact that Snape fought back, even sought them out as stated in cannon. So dont give me that tripe.
#+end_quote

Wow. First of all, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/eq77qs/the_marauders_vs_snape_was_bullying_not_a_rivalry/][this]]. But to your specific argument, Snape fighting back does not make the relationship any less one-sided. We don't even know for a fact that he /did/ fight back, we know for a fact that Lupin says he did. When is it stated in canon that he /sought them out/? The text and the author clarify that it was completely one-sided. The argument "Snape was a victim" is supported by Pensieve memories, which are better than video evidence; the argument "it was a rivalry" is supported by a second hand account from a biased source, and even that - only if you choose to read it very selectively.

  Hes a character who isnt portrayed realistically in fanfiction which makes me angry. He isnt a "dad" or anything like that, his life goals are towards one mission. Saving Harry.
#+end_quote

Until Dumbledore tells him Harry must die, at which point Snape protests, but ultimately delivers that piece of intel to Harry and causes Harry to sacrifice himself. I personally believe that off-page, Dumbledore told Snape the truth - that self-sacrifice was Harry's best chance of survival - but his survival was certainly not guarantedd.

  But saving Harry has a lot if different methods, you put a kid down and he works twice as hard even if it fails. At least that's what I did.

Good for you, really!
