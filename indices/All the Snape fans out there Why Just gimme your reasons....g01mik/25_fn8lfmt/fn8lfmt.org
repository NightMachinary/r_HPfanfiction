I'm a fan of Snape for being the anti-hero.

He isnt Spiderman or Superman, and he sure as hell isnt going to save a baby. To some extent hes on his own side, just trying to survive. Personally I prefer him being a spy for Dumbledore.

However I hate when people justify him becoming a bad guy because he was bullied, it doesnt work.

The Marauders didnt bully Snape, bullying means one sided. And we know for a fact that Snape fought back, even sought them out as stated in cannon. So dont give me that tripe.

Hes a character who isnt portrayed realistically in fanfiction which makes me angry. He isnt a "dad" or anything like that, his life goals are towards one mission. Saving Harry.

But saving Harry has a lot if different methods, you put a kid down and he works twice as hard even if it fails. At least that's what I did.

So Snape is a dickhead, general prick and a spy. But hes interesting and his first three questions in PS make me tear up when you look at what the plants symbolize.
