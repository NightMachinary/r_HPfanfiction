Goody, I get to copy/paste this again.

Let's end this obsession theory forever.

We have three interactions between Snape and Lily from the time they're not children. In one, he says they're "supposed to be friends", and she confirms. Interestingly, she does accuse him of obsessing - over Potter and his mates, so not over her. In interaction 2, he calls her a mudblood, in interaction 3, he attempts to apologize. At no point does he ask her out or say she owes him anything or act entitled to her, unless apologizing is an act of entitlement. Further, Harry goes through his potions book with a fine tooth comb, and nowhere does he find a scribble of her initials or anything like that.

Sirius and Lupin, meanwhile, as adults, never say Snape tried to pursue Lily or stalked her, or that they ever spoke, including in the context of listing reasons why Snape was jealous of James. You KNOW they would have. When she asked him to, he left her alone.

Then she is put in the crossfire. Well, wanting someone not to die is not obsessive. I know people read a lot into Dumbledore's "you disgust me" comment, but that comment only proves that Dumbles is manipulative.

Then she dies anyway. Snape is feeling expressly suicidal, as many non-obsessive people do when someone they love dies and it's their fault. Dumbledore leverages his guilt into recruiting him to spy. He proceeds to keep his love/"obsession" a secret from everyone but Dumbles for 17 years, and in fact talks a lot about James, so it still looks like his obsessions are toward those he hates.

People say the "always" line is obsessive. Nope. If Dumbles had to ask "after all this time", then clearly Snape very much shut up about Lily even when speaking to him. People say it's obsessive that he stole the letter and the picture. Having one lousy souvenir of a dead loved one isn't obsessive. As for tearing the photo up, ofc he won't walk around with a picture of James. Ofc he won't carry a letter that says "dear Padfoot." So in summation, no evidence of obsession in his behavior, only of love, remorse, guilt, and grief.

Magical evidence: the Patronus is a symbol of positive feelings, not obsession, unless Harry was obsessed with his dead dad and wanted to bang him. Further: he managed to hide his "obsession" from a mindreader, Voldemort. Obsessions are something you can't control by definition. You /KNOW/ Voldy questioned him about that, probably in a way that involved torture, since Snape asked him to spare her, thus directly causing his first downfall. When Harry occludes Voldy successfully for the first time, it is at a moment of grief, and love - over Dobby. Was Harry obsessed with Dobby? No. He felt responsible for the little guy's death though. Snape's unequalled talent for occlumency should prove that he loved and grieved Lily which is precisely the thing Voldy can't access and understand.

The author herself denied that Snape was obsessive, but frankly, even if she had said he was, what she wrote is very different. It also makes no sense that the big reveal and Voldy's downfall is because of some obsessive incel who wanted to bang Lily, in a CHILDREN'S BOOK about the power of love.

Let's stop talking about the supposed obsession forever and instead wonder why fans cannot wrap their heads around any explanation of anything that isn't gross and irrelevant.
