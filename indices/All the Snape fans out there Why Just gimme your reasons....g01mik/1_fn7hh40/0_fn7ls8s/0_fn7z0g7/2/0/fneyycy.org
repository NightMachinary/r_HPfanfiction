How does he teach? In potions, one of the most dangerous classes in Hogwarts. A class where one person's mistakes can endanger EVERYONE in the classroom. Does he teach properly? Fuck no. "Instructions are on the board. Begin." And then he stalks around the classroom, and stands behind people he doesn't like until they mess up (most often caused by him doing that) and screaming at them. Which often makes the mistake even bigger. Then, you have the kids from HIS OWN GODDAMN HOUSE throwing shit everywhere, which can set off an explosive reaction. Does he do anything to change this? Fuck no. He blames a completely irrelevant person.

In fact, Snape has endangered more kids in his tenure as a Potions "Professor" than Dumbledore ever did with his harebrained schemes.

Then there's the whole Slytherin vs Gryffindor thing in which Snape is there handing out free gasoline and matches to his own house members.

You do realize Neville is in his classes, right? He's went overboard on Neville so much he became Neville's goddamned Boggart.
