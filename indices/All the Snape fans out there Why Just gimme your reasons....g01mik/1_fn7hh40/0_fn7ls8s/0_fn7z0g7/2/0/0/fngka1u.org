  /he doesn't threaten a visibly traumatised child with more torture/

  You do realize Neville is in his classes, right? He's went overboard on Neville so much he became Neville's goddamned Boggart.
#+end_quote

Oh, God, not the Boggart nonsense again. Dean's Boggart is a hand, which confirms hands went overboard with Dean! Hermione's Boggart is failing her exam, which proves she's a sociopath who cares more about exams than she does about the deaths of her family. And Ron is more afraid of spiders, despite the fact that, just a few months prior, his little sister had almost been murdered by Voldemort's spirit - what a jerk!

No.

In-universe explanation: the Boggart turns into whatever is on that person's mind at that moment; Snape had just told Neville he is an incompetent student, so Neville's thinking of Snape. This also explains why not a single child has a serious fear - they're told to think of scary things, and their minds jump to normal, ridiculous fears (a mean teacher, a banshee, something from a horror movies, and so on).

Neville, who is a poor student, defeats his Boggart on the first try... because he's not actually afraid. Harry struggles with his the entire year, and Molly can't defeat hers in OotP.

Out-of-universe explanation: the whole point of that scene is that Harry is a marked child, who, unlike everyone else (including Neville), has a mature, very serious fear, because of the way his destiny is intertwined with Voldemort's. And, of course, Snape-in-drag was obviously supposed to be comedic relief, not a call to arms for kids who think being told they're shit students is "abusive".

Boggarts also represent deeper issues - Hermione's fear is failure and being proven as unworthy of being in the magical world (failing one's exams leads to expulsion and having your wand broken), Harry's fear is fear, and Neville's fear is being inadequate (which can be represented by any teacher, since he's stated to fear all, except Sprout, in GoF), because of his family - his grandmother constantly compares him, negatively, to his father (and even forces him to use his wand), and his uncle risked dropping him out of the window rather than having a Squib nephew.

In any case, if you want actual cases of Neville being ~tortured~:

  Harry didn't sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn't think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they'd done? [...] the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years. From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated.

  [...]

  They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted. [...] Well, think again, boy---it's into the forest you're going and I'm much mistaken if you'll all come out in one piece.” At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks. [...] Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry's robe and made a choking noise

  Neville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall was so furious with him she had banned him from all future Hogsmeade visits, given him a detention, and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower. Poor Neville was forced to wait outside the common room every night for somebody to let him in, while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him.

Compare it to:

#+begin_quote
  Neville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to help him, then said, in barely more than a whisper, “Professor Snape.”

  Nearly everyone laughed. Even Neville grinned apologetically.
#+end_quote

Neville's classmates and Neville himself think fearing Snape is ridiculous, and list him among such fears as:

#+begin_quote
  “Did you see me take that banshee?” shouted Seamus.

  “And the hand!” said Dean, waving his own around.

  “And Snape in that hat!”

  “And my mummy!”
#+end_quote

The more disturbing thing is that Lupin had everyone face a Boggart in public, despite the truly horrendous things that could have popped out, if the children had realistic fears, like a relative who molested them. And having Neville engage in a public humiliation of Snape shows a lack of professional ethics, and is a great way to put a target on Neville's back.
