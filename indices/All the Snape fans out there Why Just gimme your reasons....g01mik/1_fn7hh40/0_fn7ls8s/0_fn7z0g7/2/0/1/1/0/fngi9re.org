  And then he stalks around the classroom, and stands behind people he doesn't like until they mess up (most often caused by him doing that) [...]

  /He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like./ PS: ch8 page 100/221
#+end_quote

Your own quote proves that Snape /doesn't/ stand behind people, and *that he actually gives them individual instructions and feedback*. Compare it to Slughorn, for example, who doesn't even comment on Ron's poorly made potion, just praises Harry for his.

#+begin_quote
  /“Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. “I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?”/ PS: ch12 page 101/221 Snarled/screamed. Still intimidating.
#+end_quote

Once again, you prove that Snape goes around teaching students what to do, and that he /doesn't/ scream at them to provoke them into making a mistake. He makes a sound of anger *after* Neville makes a mistake that endangers everyone. Here's an actual example of screaming and physical violence:

#+begin_quote
  Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear. “Detention!” she shouted. “And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you---” “You don't understand, Professor. Harry Potter's coming---he's got a dragon!” “What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on---I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!” (PS, Ch.14)
#+end_quote

(Does she apologise when it turns out he wasn't lying? Nope.)

#+begin_quote
  If a student from any other house did that, Snape would have been on top of them trying to get them expelled for "endangering everybody yadda yadda yadda".
#+end_quote

Setting aside that Draco was doing it behind Snape's back (who, at that moment, was "prowling" and instructing students), it's disingenous to compare it with the disaster that follows, and which Snape /doesn't/ punish the Trio for.

#+begin_quote
  Goyle's potion exploded, showering the whole class. People shrieked as splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them. Malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his hands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate. [...]Harry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward, his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. As half the class lumbered up to Snape's desk, some weighted down with arms like clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffed up lips
#+end_quote

And, no, actually, Snape would not ask for them to be expelled:

#+begin_quote
  Ron finally cracked and flung a large, slippery crocodile heart at Malfoy, which hit him in the face and caused Snape to take fifty points from Gryffindor.
#+end_quote

Ron throwing a large, likely expensive ingredient straight at Draco's face is more visible /and/ more dangerous than Draco flicking puffer-fish eyes.

#+begin_quote
  There's a difference between gross negligence, a class having necessary/accidental risks, and a teacher being overwhelmed by the student population.
#+end_quote

You're right, and Snape would fall, at most, in the last category - the two incidents happen because he goes around the classroom, giving individual instructions, so he can't keep an eye on everyone at the same time.

On the other hand, McGonagall and Hagrid actively endanger students, by knowingly placing them in potentially lethal situations (PS-OotP). And here's a bit of Hagrid's classes (these are 2 different days):

#+begin_quote
  “Look like they're havin' fun, don' they?” Hagrid said happily. Harry assumed he was talking about the skrewts, because his classmates certainly weren't; every now and then, with an alarming bang, one of the skrewts' ends would explode, causing it to shoot forward several yards, and more than one person was being dragged along on their stomach, trying desperately to get back on their feet.

  [...] Harry noticed her eyes travel over Dean (who had a nasty cut across one cheek), Lavender (whose robes were badly singed), Seamus (who was nursing several burnt fingers), and then to the cabin windows, where most of the class stood, their noses pressed against the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear. (GoF)
#+end_quote

​

#+begin_quote
  /Then there's the whole Slytherin vs Gryffindor thing in which Snape is there handing out free gasoline and matches to his own house members./

  Do I even need proof for this? Every time Malfoy said mudblood, walked right up to them and instigated, threw the first spell, etc. Even in full view of Snape, he doesn't do anything.
#+end_quote

You said Snape instigates these incidents, so yes, you need to back that claim up. Funnily enough, Malfoy /tries/ to throw the first spell once, in GoF, and the consequence is that he gets *tortured* by Moody, until he's crying in pain, then McGonagall lets Moody drag him away for more punishing.

McGonagall does absolutely nothing about the Gryffindors' behaviour, which includes drugging and impersonating Slytherins (CoS), attacking them repeatedly (Ron physically attacks Draco in PS, and Snape docks 5 points, then he /tries to do it again in CoS, right under Snape's nose, and Snape doesn't even deduct any points, probably because Draco had just been talking badly about Hermione/), and even attempted murder (Fred and George lock Montague in the Vanishing Cabinet and tell nobody about it).

#+begin_quote
  Not to mention the simply obscene ways he deducts points for the most asinine of reasons.
#+end_quote

They're actually quite normal reasons - being late to class, being outright disrespectful (up to and including screaming at Snape and calling him names), reading a magazine in class, attacking other students, etc. And he usually docks relatively small amounts (5/10 pts). Compare it to McGonagall docking Angelina 5 points for yelling at Harry during recess.

#+begin_quote
  Here's one directly in Potions class that directly effected Harry's grade.
#+end_quote

That is, indeed, the one time Snape spoils Harry's grade. Considering it happened immediately after Harry had grossly violated Snape's privacy and endangered his life by sticking his head in the Pensieve (everything Harry sees, Voldemort sees), I... struggle to care. It's childish, absolutely, but not any more than Hagrid guilt-tripping the Trio, in HBP, for dropping his class. Other than that, considering Harry expected an E for that potion, it means Snape usually assigns him fair grades (Hermione even comments, in OotP, on one incident where Snape was "unfair" to Harry, suggesting that he otherwise is).

#+begin_quote
  Again, this is a "pick on Snape" thread. The other teachers are bad too.
#+end_quote

There only are "pick on Snape" threads. If you apply the same standard uniformly, Hagrid and McGonagall are monsters, yet you never see posts criticising them - they're used as positive examples, and their abuses get downplayed. I agree that Sprout is one of the nice professors, but just for the fun of applying the same Outrage Standard to her - she has young children raise, then butcher sentient, anthropomorphic plants, which seems emotionally abusive; she also ignores students getting physically hurt:

#+begin_quote
  “You're lagging behind, everybody else has started, and Neville's already got his first pod!” They looked around; sure enough, there sat Neville with a bloody lip and several nasty scratches along the side of his face, but clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit. (HBP, Ch.14)
#+end_quote

​

#+begin_quote
  That he wasn't in the room at all, and the examiners not allowing any of the usual petty crap that goes on in class stands out more.
#+end_quote

Knowledge of potions does not suddenly pop up in their heads in his absence. Accustoming students to working under pressure seems to produce results, though. At least 10/28 students get an O, and Harry and Ron, who are not brilliant students, manage to get Es. Why? Because Snape, with his harsh and demanding manner, has them overachieving. Even the classroom slackers get dragged forward, which is why his students are "advanced for their level".

Snape gets the students studying and paying enough attention, that there are zero serious incidents (outside of the one intentionally provoked by Harry), and he's the only one who seems to care about the students' safety.
