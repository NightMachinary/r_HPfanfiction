I think you need to calm down and not begin your posts with "Did you even read the books?", when all of your "arguments" are completely made up.

#+begin_quote
  A class where one person's mistakes can endanger EVERYONE in the classroom. Does he teach properly? Fuck no.
#+end_quote

Actually, yes, considering there are exactly zero serious incidents, over 5 years, despite his class containing hopeless students like Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle. There are 2 incidents that involve someone getting hurt, but I'll get to those later.

#+begin_quote
  "Instructions are on the board. Begin." And then he stalks around the classroom, and stands behind people he doesn't like until they mess up (most often caused by him doing that) and screaming at them. Which often makes the mistake even bigger.
#+end_quote

Do you have any source for that? Other than Tumblr/Twitter posts? Because in the official version of the books, Snape doesn't go around screaming at students, he speaks "softer"/"quieter" the angrier he gets (and the reason behind that would make for an interesting topic of discussion, but not with people who are still stuck in the "Snape is a big meanie because 11 y.o. Harry thought so" phase). You might be confusing him with McGonagall, she does a lot of yelling. He also doesn't "stand behind people until they mess up."

Also, do I need to explain third person, subjective narration? That's not how Snape teaches, that's how Harry, perceives it. /I/ actually have sources for that statement: in CoS, Hermione mentions that Snape explained the brewing of Polyjuice Potion to them, and Harry and Ron literally say they "have better things to do than listen to Snape". Similarly, Snape says "did I not explain that you have to..."

And the fact that his students get excellent results on their OWLs speaks for itself.

#+begin_quote
  Then, you have the kids from HIS OWN GODDAMN HOUSE throwing shit everywhere, which can set off an explosive reaction.
#+end_quote

You realise that posting a false statement in caps doesn't make it true, yes? Or are you genuinely worked up about something that you invented yourself?

As I mentioned earlier, there are 2 incidents where someone is hurt in Potions class: during the first lesson, when /Neville/ hurts himself, and potentially others, by not paying attention, and during the second year, /when Harry himself blows up a Slytherin's cauldron/ in order to create a diversion for Hermione, so she can steal the ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion. /Harry's little stunt gets several Slytherin students hurt./

Should Snape have punished the Trio severely for that entire incident, especially after he found out they did it in order to brew an illegal potion? Absolutely, but then Snape's lenient like that. He docks Ron five points for physically attacking Draco, and he only assigns cleaning or office work as detention, even when the crime includes publicly insulting and yelling at him, or /butchering Draco/.

If you think he should have taken a page from McGonagall's book, and sent them to find an evil monster... sure, why not. Sadly, Snape is too concerned with student safety, as evidenced by the fact that he's usually the first on the scene when someone cries out for help (as seen, for example, in OotP).

#+begin_quote
  In fact, Snape has endangered more kids in his tenure as a Potions "Professor" than Dumbledore ever did with his harebrained schemes.
#+end_quote

Once again, I'll have to ask for a legitimate source. Meanwhile, I'll point you to the fact that Charms class is repeatedly described as a chaotic disaster, where the professor himself ends up being used as target practice, and Transfiguration class, which involves mutilating animals, also involves students practising spells /on themselves/. Harry messes up his face, in HBP, and McGonagall doesn't even notice.

#+begin_quote
  Then there's the whole Slytherin vs Gryffindor thing in which Snape is there handing out free gasoline and matches to his own house members.
#+end_quote

You know I'll ask for a source for that, too. Other than Malfoy making snide comments behind Snape's back, the same as Harry and Ron, the Slytherins don't cause any problems during Potions class. Meanwhile, Harry and Ron, in addition to exploding the Slytherins' cauldrons, injuring them in the process, also throw expensive ingredients at their face, risking another potions disaster (PoA).

I can provide exact page numbers for each and every statement. I expect you to provide, at the very least, the book where you claim each incident happened, and details of the scene, so I can search for it.
