Okay, I submitted this whole thing without intending to. The first part was something I was going to put /s after it or remove altogether. Since that is what pass for the norm here in this subreddit. I apologize for that.

Please note I'm going off of the PDF version, so page numbers could be unreliable. I'm giving chapters too.

  "Instructions are on the board. Begin." And then he stalks around the classroom, and stands behind people he doesn't like until they mess up (most often caused by him doing that) and screaming at them. Which often makes the mistake even bigger.

/He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like./ PS: ch8 page 100/221

/“Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. “I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?”/ PS: ch12 page 101/221

Snarled/screamed. Still intimidating. The instructions on the board thing is fanon though, I'll admit that. This still isn't conducive for a learning environment.

/Draco Malfoy, who was Snape's favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron and Harry, who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say “Unfair.” CoS: ch11 page 175/338/

If a student from any other house did that, Snape would have been on top of them trying to get them expelled for "endangering everybody yadda yadda yadda".

  In fact, Snape has endangered more kids in his tenure as a Potions "Professor" than Dumbledore ever did with his harebrained schemes.

There's a difference between gross negligence, a class having necessary/accidental risks, and a teacher being overwhelmed by the student population.

  Then there's the whole Slytherin vs Gryffindor thing in which Snape is there handing out free gasoline and matches to his own house members.
#+end_quote

Do I even need proof for this? Every time Malfoy said mudblood, walked right up to them and instigated, threw the first spell, etc. Even in full view of Snape, he doesn't do anything. If anything, he'll punish the Gryffindors and leave it at that. Not to mention the simply obscene ways he deducts points for the most asinine of reasons. This further ignites the house rivalry. It says "Hey, do whatever the hell you want, I'll cover you!"

Here's one directly in Potions class that directly effected Harry's grade.

/He had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise; Malfoy gave a gleeful yell of laughter. Harry whipped around again. His potion sample lay in pieces on the floor, and Snape was watching him with a look of gloating pleasure. “Whoops,” he said softly. “Another zero, then, Potter . . .” OoTF: ch29 page 661/

Again, this is a "pick on Snape" thread. The other teachers are bad too. Except for Sprout. She was one of the best teachers in my opinion. McGonagal was bad to EVERYONE and overreacts, Flitwick couldn't even spot his own students collectively bullying one of his own. Sprout? The only really "bad" thing I remember was her being "slightly colder" to him after his name came out of the goblet.

On another note:

#+begin_quote
  And the fact that his students get excellent results on their OWLs speaks for itself.
#+end_quote

That he wasn't in the room at all, and the examiners not allowing any of the usual petty crap that goes on in class stands out more.
