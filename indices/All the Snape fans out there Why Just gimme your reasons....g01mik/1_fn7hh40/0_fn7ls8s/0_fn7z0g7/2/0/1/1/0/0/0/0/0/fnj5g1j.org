  In these situations by showing his own housemembers that he will do nothing, he is enabling them. By enabling them, he is instigating them to go further. And an adult explanation to disprove this wouldn't work, school full of kids, remember?
#+end_quote

By that logic, all heads of house /and/ Dumbledore instigate bullying and abuse. Dumbledore more than anyone else, considering he should be impartial.

And yet, if you compare the actions of the Gryffindors with those of the Slytherins, Gryffindors are actually the more aggressive and dangerous ones (find one instance of a Slytherin student casually and intentionally endangering someone else's life; HBP Draco excluded, because at that point Draco's story is no longer about being the token jerk and Harry's nemesis). And while intra-house bullying is a big issue in Gryffindor and Ravenclaw (the main thing that a head of house should be working to prevent, yet in Gryffindor is actively encouraged by McGonagall), we see no cases of bullying among Slytherins.

So Snape actually seems to have the tightest hold on his house, together with Sprout. Even Hufflepuffs aren't saints, considering they take part in bullying Harry in PS, they're very vocal about suspecting Harry in CoS, they (and Sprout) treat him nastily in GoF, etc.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, like a group of kids will understand that. That just screams "I'm docking you points because you are Potter and Company and not Slytherin."
#+end_quote

So... they shouldn't have been punished at all? 14 is the age of criminal responsibility in a large part of the world, "I didn't know it's bad to curse and yell at my teacher" doesn't work as a defence. If anything, the truly disturbing part in that whole scene is Harry's reaction:

#+begin_quote
  Harry's ears were ringing. The injustice of it made him want to curse Snape into a thousand slimy pieces. [...] Harry sat there staring at Snape as the lesson began, picturing horrific things happening to him... If only he knew how to do the Cruciatus Curse... he'd have Snape flat on his back like that spider, jerking and twitching...
#+end_quote

These thoughts border on sociopathy, but are honestly one of the few cases where you can see the damage inflicted on him by the Dursleys. So, at least they're realistic.

#+begin_quote
  But savoring the fact that you get to do it, snarling it at them like they are lower than a bug?
#+end_quote

Yeah, Snape really sounds like he has fun around Neville. No, he's obviously frustrated by Neville's incompetency, the same way McGonagall is, and a snarl is an expression of anger, not of disdain. The only time he seems to enjoy himself is when he puts Harry in his place, since in his mind, Harry deserves it, and he also thinks his words don't affect Harry at all (as per Snape's discussion with Sirius in OotP).

#+begin_quote
  “Longbottom, kindly do not reveal that you can't even perform a simple Switching Spell in front of anyone from Durmstrang!” Professor McGonagall barked at the end of one particularly difficult lesson, during which Neville had accidentally transplanted his own ears onto a cactus.
#+end_quote

McG does the exact same thing, down to being described using an animal sound, but Harry likes her and actually agrees that Neville is a disaster, so he doesn't focus on it, or the effect of that comment on Neville. If Snape had said that, we would have gotten a detailed description of Neville turning red, shaking, etc.

#+begin_quote
  Please, you are using Slughorn of all people to prove your point? He's the exact same and opposite of Snape. Except instead of anger, he treats kids he doesn't like with indifference.
#+end_quote

Yes, because he's the only other Potions professor and Slytherin head of house... Under him, Tom Riddle flourishes, children are groomed for the Death Eaters, a nepotism scheme that excludes Muggle-borns (and the "wrong" kind of pure-blood) from important positions is in place, and good Potions students like Hermione and Draco languish.

Under Snape, who actually has to maintain the illusion of directly working for Voldemort, no Slytherin children are drafted into the Death Eaters, except the ones whose parents are DEs themselves, we don't hear of Slytherins attacking other students, a Muggle-born has the highest grades and receives no criticism regarding her work, and students overachieve.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, because it's not like it showcases the fact that he shouldn't be teaching at all. I mean, they don't remove certifications for that in the real world, do they? Oh wait, they do.
#+end_quote

Are there many teachers who act as triple spies and who have to deal, on a daily basis, with a walking trigger? In any case, if we're suddenly applying real life standards to a children's book about magic...I have never heard of a teacher getting sacked for losing a student's homework. McGonagall and Hagrid would be rotting in jail, though, for sending children in a forest, alone, or for setting wild animals on them.

#+begin_quote
  Harry was Told (that capital T denotes how little choice he had in the matter) he was doing the lessons.
#+end_quote

By Dumbledore. Snape was also Told this. So, at most, you can argue that Dumbledore violated their privacy. Except, if Harry hadn't thought he knew better, and had actually tried to learn (which he didn't, because he didn't want to lose the connection to Voldemort), Sirius wouldn't have died.

#+begin_quote
  And if you can seriously say that Snape was doing his best to teach Harry Occlumency and not cause him pain and dig around for dirt? You are mistaken. OotF ch37 Dumbledore apology.
#+end_quote

Snape definitely wasn't trying to cause pain or "dig around for dirt". In fact, during the Occlumency lessons, he is at his most serious and open with Harry, and displays a certain level of contentment at Harry managing to defend himself. Still, the lessons were doomed to fail because of the bad blood between the two, and because of Harry's desire to keep the connection to Voldemort open. /That's/ what Dumbledore apologises for - if he'd taught Harry personally, Harry would have been much more receptive.

#+begin_quote
  He looked up at Snape, who had lowered his wand and was rubbing his wrist. There was an angry weal there, like a scorch mark.

  “Did you mean to produce a Stinging Hex?” asked Snape coolly.

  “No,” said Harry bitterly, getting up from the floor.

  “I thought not,” said Snape, watching him closely. “You let me get in too far. You lost control.” [...] “Well, for a first attempt that was not as poor as it might have been,” said Snape, raising his wand once more. “You managed to stop me eventually, though you wasted time and energy shouting. You must remain focused. Repel me with your brain and you will not need to resort to your wand.”

  “I'm trying,” said Harry angrily, “but you're not telling me how!”

  “Manners, Potter,” said Snape dangerously. “Now, I want you to close your eyes.”

  Harry threw him a filthy look before doing as he was told. He did not like the idea of standing there with his eyes shut while Snape faced him, carrying a wand.

  “Clear your mind, Potter,” said Snape's cold voice. “Let go of all emotion...”

  But Harry's anger at Snape continued to pound through his veins like venom. Let go of his anger? He could as easily detach his legs...

  “You're not doing it, Potter... you will need more discipline than this... focus, now...”

  Harry tried to empty his mind, tried not to think, or remember, or feel...

  “Let's go again... on the count of three... one---two---three---Legilimens!”
#+end_quote

Snape isn't bothered by Harry hurting him, and even says he didn't do terribly, then he explains exactly what Harry should do. But Harry is filled with anger (it's his main feeling in OotP, after all) and hatred towards Snape, so he can't clear his mind. Funnily enough, if the lessons had continued after SWM, I think Harry would have actually been more receptive. But no way would Snape have trusted him anymore, at that point.

#+begin_quote
  And last, I'm done arguing over Snape. I don't even like Canon. I had to suspend my disbelief while reading it.
#+end_quote

Honestly, I think the problem is that you're reading canon from a very biased perspective. You should try re-reading the books while having the context in mind (children's series+coming-of-age story, which automatically implies incompetent adults; mystery series, which means there has to be a red herring in every book; boarding school in the 90s, which actually meant caning and rape, etc.), which should greatly enhance your enjoyment.
