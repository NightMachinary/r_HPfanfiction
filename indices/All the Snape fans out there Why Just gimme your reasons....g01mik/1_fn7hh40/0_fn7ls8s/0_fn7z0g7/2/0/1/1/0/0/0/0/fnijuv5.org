  First of all, you need to learn the difference between not doing anything, and instigating.
#+end_quote

In these situations by showing his own housemembers that he will do nothing, he is enabling them. By enabling them, he is instigating them to go further. And an adult explanation to disprove this wouldn't work, school full of kids, remember?

#+begin_quote
  The points he docks are for Harry and Ron screaming and cursing at him, and he only docks 25 points each.
#+end_quote

Yes, like a group of kids will understand that. That just screams "I'm docking you points because you are Potter and Company and not Slytherin."

#+begin_quote
  But this weird notion that criticism is bad
#+end_quote

No. I did not say this. Criticism is a good thing. But savoring the fact that you get to do it, snarling it at them like they are lower than a bug? That's not criticism anymore. That's destructive criticism. And that has no place in a classroom. It's not conducive to a learning environment.

  Slowly, Slughorn moved around the room
#+end_quote

Please, you are using Slughorn of all people to prove your point? He's the exact same and opposite of Snape. Except instead of anger, he treats kids he doesn't like with indifference.

#+begin_quote
  "Academic sabotage"? Get a grip. But it's interesting that you're more incensed by Harry's grade (which is irrelevant, since jobs are based on OWLs, where Harry gets a good score thanks to Snape's usual exigency), than by the outright abuses going on. That's totally not hypocritical at all!
#+end_quote

Yes, because it's not like it showcases the fact that he shouldn't be teaching at all. I mean, they don't remove certifications for that in the real world, do they? Oh wait, they do.

#+begin_quote
  Since Harry agreed to the lessons, Snape wasn't violating anything.
#+end_quote

First off, consent is the wrong word here. Harry was Told (that capital T denotes how little choice he had in the matter) he was doing the lessons. And if you can seriously say that Snape was doing his best to teach Harry Occlumency and not cause him pain and dig around for dirt? You are mistaken. OotF ch37 Dumbledore apology.

And in fact, outside of Sprout, none of the other adults should be in that school. McGonnagal and Flitwick can't even do their Head of House job properly, Hagrid can't understand that students aren't sturdy like he is, Filch is redundant in a school full of elves, Trelawney is the definition of Asperger's, and Dumbledore can't not think of children of chess pieces. Or hire correctly. Or call the Aurors when necessary.

And last, I'm done arguing over Snape. I don't even like Canon. I had to suspend my disbelief while reading it.
