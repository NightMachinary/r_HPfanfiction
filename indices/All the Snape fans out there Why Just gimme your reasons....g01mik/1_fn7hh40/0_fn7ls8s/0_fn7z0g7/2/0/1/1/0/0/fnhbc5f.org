  Once again, you prove that Snape goes around teaching students what to do, and that he /doesn't/ scream at them to provoke them into making a mistake. He makes a sound of anger *after* Neville makes a mistake that endangers everyone. Here's an actual example of screaming and physical violence:
#+end_quote

Ummmm... He knew exactly where it went wrong. Like he was watching for a mistake to happen. And then didn't he punish someone else for not stopping him? What was his job and function again? Teaching and keeping students safe.

  They're actually quite normal reasons
#+end_quote

“That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger,” said Snape coolly. “Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.” /CoS ch9 page 172/

Ummmm, isn't he the head of house for the cunning? "You broke a social rule, so I'm deducting points because I'm a cunt!" Sure, that might have been a somewhat maybe valid reason to deduct points, but then he deducts points for something stupid. If they actually challenged the point deduction it would get retracted. Why is he the leader of the cunning again? Oh right, he got his job because he's a spy and not because of his qualifications.

/“Library books are not to be taken outside the school,” said Snape. “Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.”/\\
/“He's just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. “Wonder what's wrong with his leg?” PS ch11 page 132/221/

Intentionally misinterpreting a rule to use it against them. I can see that actually being a rule, but used that way? They were still on the school grounds. Otherwise the rule would be "leave the castle".

  you said Snape instigates these incidents
#+end_quote

/“Let's see,” he said, in his silkiest voice. “Fifty points from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley. Now get inside, or it'll be a week's worth of detentions.” GoF ch18 page 300/ Right after he insults Hermione and Harry AND Malfoy curse each other.

By him not putting a stopper to it, he is in fact instigating it. You have the Slytherin Quidditch Team who cheats so badly it's actually a health liability to play against them. Slytherin members cursing people. Slytherin members instigating loudly in plain view of everyone. And then when someone says something back, Snape swoops in and deducts points, punishments, etc.

​

This is enabling, and it instigated them to continue this route.

  Considering it happened immediately after Harry had grossly violated Snape's privacy and endangered his life by sticking his head in the Pensieve (everything Harry sees, Voldemort sees), I... struggle to care.
#+end_quote

Yes, because academic sabotage is okay because Harry violated his privacy after Snape violated his for weeks in that sham of what he called "Occlumency Lessons". And if his life was so important, he would have taken the care to actually store it properly.

/They had Potions that afternoon, which was an unqualified disaster. Try as Harry might, he couldn't get his Confusing Concoction to thicken, and Snape, standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure, scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before moving away./ PoA ch16 page 318

Yes, because that clearly deserves a zero. It's like there aren't any other grades between a zero and a pass... Weird, that.

#+begin_quote
  Knowledge of potions does not suddenly pop up in their heads in his absence.
#+end_quote

No, but being able to actually work without his Greasiness stalking around, criticizing, and whatnot does. And actually being graded fairly.

You keep bringing up other teachers. Yet they aren't displaying the blatant favoritism for their own house members. Or enabling a dangerous house rivalry.

TL;DR: Hogwarts is fucked.
