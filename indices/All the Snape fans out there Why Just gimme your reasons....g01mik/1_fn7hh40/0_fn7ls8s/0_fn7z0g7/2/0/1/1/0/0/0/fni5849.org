  Ummmm... He knew exactly where it went wrong. Like he was watching for a mistake to happen.
#+end_quote

Ummmm it's established, repeatedly, that Snape can tell what went wrong with a potion, based on its colour, consistency, and so on. You know, on account of being a potions genius. Which is why he also knew that Neville's potion wouldn't harm Trevor, for example.

Docking Harry 1 point was petty, absolutely.

#+begin_quote
  Ummmm, isn't he the head of house for the cunning? "You broke a social rule, so I'm deducting points because I'm a cunt!"
#+end_quote

Ummmm, docking points from a student who spoke out of turn /three times/, after being repeatedly told to settle down, is absolutely normal. Teaching children to follow social rules is... one of the most important duties of parents, primarily, and teachers, secondarily. I wish someone had taught you not to use gendered insults, for example.

Being a "know-it-all" is not a good thing - it means a person who thinks they know more than anyone, and flaunt it. Which was exactly Hermione's behaviour in that scene - the others argue that they haven't studied the subject yet, but she starts speaking, despite being told to shut up twice, because she's desperate to show she's smarter than everyone.

#+begin_quote
  Intentionally misinterpreting a rule to use it against them. I can see that actually being a rule, but used that way? They were still on the school grounds. Otherwise the rule would be "leave the castle".
#+end_quote

This is pure speculation. Still less ridiculous than McGonagall docking Harry points for losing his temper with Umbridge, then losing her temper with Umbridge.

#+begin_quote
  By him not putting a stopper to it, he is in fact instigating it. You have the Slytherin Quidditch Team who cheats so badly it's actually a health liability to play against them. Slytherin members cursing people. Slytherin members instigating loudly in plain view of everyone. And then when someone says something back, Snape swoops in and deducts points, punishments, etc.
#+end_quote

First of all, you need to learn the difference between not doing anything, and instigating. Unless you're arguing that McGonagall is instigating the twins to test experimental substances on 11 y.o. kids, and to murder Slytherins. In fact, the worst behaviour, as far as we're shown, comes from Gryffindor, from the Marauders to Ginny and Harry randomly hexing people.

Second of all, please provide some examples of Snape swooping in and deducting points, assigning punishments, etc.

Third of all, he literally stops it:

#+begin_quote
  “And what is all this noise about?” said a soft, deadly voice. Snape had arrived. The Slytherins clamored to give their explanations; Snape pointed a long yellow finger at Malfoy and said, Explain.”
#+end_quote

And he /doesn't/ dock points from anyone for the duel. He would have actually let Harry get away with mutilating Goyle. The points he docks are for Harry and Ron screaming and cursing at him, and he only docks 25 points each.

Also, the Slytherin girls laugh at Hermione behind Snape's back, and in PoA, Draco makes sure to taunt Harry and Ron when Snape isn't looking, so they expect some sort of punishment for doing so.

And since you bring up Quidditch - McGonagall breaks school rules to put Harry on the team and buy him the fastest broom, she disregards his safety, in PoA, specifically because she wants to win the Quidditch Cup, and she does absolutely nothing about Lee Jordan's completely inappropriate commentary.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, because academic sabotage is okay because Harry violated his privacy after Snape violated his for weeks in that sham of what he called "Occlumency Lessons". And if his life was so important, he would have taken the care to actually store it properly.
#+end_quote

"Academic sabotage"? Get a grip. But it's interesting that you're more incensed by Harry's grade (which is irrelevant, since jobs are based on OWLs, where Harry gets a good score thanks to Snape's usual exigency), than by the outright abuses going on. That's totally not hypocritical at all!

And the idea that Snape violated Harry's privacy, when Harry consented to the lessons, is... amazing. Snape was forced into giving him Occlumency lessons (which was a terrible idea anyway, because he couldn't have justified the success of the lessons to Voldemort), had to let his trigger rummage around his mind, and wasn't even angry about Harry seeing Snape's mother getting beaten by his father, or about Harry physically harming him. Since Harry agreed to the lessons, Snape wasn't violating anything. Harry sticking his nose in the Pensieve, knowing that it contained memories Snape wanted to keep private is a tremendous violation of Snape's privacy.

And what the hell are you even arguing anymore? That Snape was suicidal, so he left out the Pensieve on purpose? That Harry was justified to stick his nose in it? I hope you never accidentally forget a window open, and some criminal comes in through it and murders you. It would obviously be your fault, no?

#+begin_quote
  Yes, because that clearly deserves a zero. It's like there aren't any other grades between a zero and a pass... Weird, that.
#+end_quote

Except he didn't give him a zero, since Harry finished the year with no issues. Or, if he did give him a zero, he must have also given him very high grades, that ended up compensating for it. And Harry also thinks Snape looks disappointed that he couldn't murder/expel him, because, remember, third person subjective. In any case, the fact that this is the level of "evidence" you have to resort to should make it clear you're not right.

#+begin_quote
  At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask, corked it and took it up to Snape's desk for marking, feeling that he might at last have scraped an “E.”
#+end_quote

Harry expects a very good grade when he turns in a decent potion.

#+begin_quote
  No, but being able to actually work without his Greasiness stalking around, criticizing, and whatnot does. And actually being graded fairly.
#+end_quote

"His Greasiness"? Really? I thought it couldn't get worse than unsubstantiated statements and gendered insults, but...

In HBP, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are left to brew with zero criticism, and in Harry's case, with excessive praise. Harry can't do anything without Snape's instructions, Ron is disastrous, and Hermione, for the first time ever, can't successfully complete a potions. Draco, who is a competent brewer, also suffers.

#+begin_quote
  Slowly, Slughorn moved around the room, examining the various antidotes. Nobody had finished the task, although Hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before Slughorn reached her. Ron had given up completely, and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron. Harry stood there waiting, the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand. Slughorn reached their table last. He sniffed Ernie's potion and passed on to Ron's with a grimace. He did not linger over Ron's cauldron, but backed away swiftly, retching slightly. [...] Hermione, who was sweaty-faced and had soot on her nose, looked livid. Her half-finished antidote, comprising fifty-two ingredients including a chunk of her own hair, bubbled sluggishly behind Slughorn, who had eyes for nobody but Harry. [...] The only person in the room looking angrier than Hermione was Malfoy, who, Harry was pleased to see, had spilled something that looked like cat sick over himself.
#+end_quote

But this weird notion that criticism is bad must explain why some western countries are reduced to importing brainpower from countries where children aren't allowed to insult teachers and slap their own parents around.

#+begin_quote
  You keep bringing up other teachers. Yet they aren't displaying the blatant favoritism for their own house members. Or enabling a dangerous house rivalry.
#+end_quote

Lmao, no, they just directly and intentionally put students in mortal danger. What is your values scales??? Other than "Snape bad! Stalin good, because he oppressed and murdered his own people, he didn't favour them!"

That's setting aside the fact that... you have yet to produce an actual example of Snape seriously favouring the Slytherins.

Also, heads of houses favouring their own students, to a certain extent, is reasonable, considering that they're supposed to be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housemaster][parental stand-ins]]. McGonagall sociopathically punishing the children in her care is not something praise-worthy, it's a reason for the parents to lynch her.
