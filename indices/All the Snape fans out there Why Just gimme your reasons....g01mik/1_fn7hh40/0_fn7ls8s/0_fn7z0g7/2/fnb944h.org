So... because of double standards and poor reading comprehension?

Unlike McGonagall, Snape doesn't drag a student around by the ear while screaming at him (PS), he doesn't repeatedly endanger students' lives and turn them into targets of bullying (PS, PoA), and he doesn't allow a kid who's just been tortured to be dragged away by his torturer (GoF).

Unlike Hagrid, he doesn't repeatedly put children in mortal danger for his own benefit (PS,CoS, GoF, OotP), he doesn't threaten a visibly traumatised child with more torture (GoF), he doesn't laugh while watching students get hurt (GoF), or blame 11 y.o. children for getting hurt by his beasts (PS).

Yet you only ever see "McGonagall is such a Queen, Yaaaas" posts, calling her a ~lioness who protects her cubs, when she's actually the Gryffindors' #1 enemy. And of course, people think Harry should have named his child Rubeus, calling him a father figure, when Harry was the one who had to constantly clean up after him. By PoA, Hermione seems to like Hagrid more than Harry does.

As for the second part - yes, Snape went to Dumbledore (which was a prison/death sentence) for Lily. By the end of the books his main motivation is to save as many people as possible, and he risks his cover and his life for that purpose (which is why the idea that he was "playing both sides" is embarrassing).

Yet you never see posts whinging about Dumbledore giving up his desire to be a tyrant solely because he possibly killed his sister while he was shooting lethal spells /at his own brother/ (and because his boyfriend dumped him and ran away; if he'd stayed behind, it's possible Grindelwald might have convinced Dumbledore to carry on).
