I was a fan before the 7th book came out because I've always enjoyed morally gray characters and I really liked the idea that he was a jerk but ultimately good. Wasn't a big fan of the whole Lily thing but I wasn't going to let that ruin the more interesting and less pathetic character I and some fanfic writers had imagined.
