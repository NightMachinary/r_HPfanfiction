Ok, not defending him. Terrible, horrible person. Still makes him intriguing and whether the character is morally good or not doesn't really influence my liking of the character(not the person)

I think it all depends on context. If you are reading a great book where all main characters are assassins and you end up liking them, you easily forget they were capable of murdering lots of people and doing terrible things and usually just ignore it cause they are so great and (whatever positive adjective you want). And that is not even what we are doing with Snape, we acknowledge that he is a terrible self serving arsehole, but a self serving arsehole we like to read about.
