  I want you to think.
#+end_quote

OK!

#+begin_quote
  You are a orphan your whole life you have been told you are a freak and possibly have even been hit (since Harry once casually mentions that his aunt tries to hit him with the frying pan if the good takes too long we can assume he gets hit at home or atleast was before hogwarts) starved and not loved.
#+end_quote

If you read my post again you'll see that I've acknowledged that Harry /was/ abused at home, by the Dursleys. My argument is that this is why he reacts so strongly to Snape - trauma will indeed make you react disproportionately to certain things despite the fact that these things aren't actually dangerous.

#+begin_quote
  Then you get to a school where a teacher is constantly belittling you making you feel worthless and telling you how worthless your dead parent is.
#+end_quote

Snape does not mention James once in PS or in COS. He mentions James to harry twice in POA, not once during GOF, once in OOTP, and twice in HBP. Except the one time in OOTP, James and his various flaws were relevant to what was going on. Harry never felt worthless because of Snape, he felt like Snape was unfair to him, and hated him. Ideally, Snape wouldn't have been teaching walking trigger Harry James Potter, but protecting walking trigger Harry James Potter required him to. I'm not denying that this was highly unpleasant for Harry, I'm saying Snape wasn't abusive and that their relationship was doomed because of each one's respective traumas; keep up.

#+begin_quote
  He is constantly blaming everything on you telling you you are a failure and whenever he sees you he insults you.... Yes Snape is definitely a good person and should be around children.... Snape is not a good person. Snape should not be around children. I have a friend who is a psychologist and she has the same opinion.
#+end_quote

Ask your psychologist friend what she thinks about McGonagall, Hagrid, Lupin, Dumbledore, Trelawney, and Slughorn, who between them have committed multiple acts of emotional abuse, neglect, physical abuse, and exploitation.

Again, I never denied that Snape hurts Harry. I argued that his behavior, unkind and unpleasant as it is, is not abusive, and /if/ Harry (and Neville) experience it as such, it's because of previous abuse they've suffered at the hands of people who should have loved them unconditionally.

#+begin_quote
  [...] but what Snape did is just horrible I mean sure other teachers were bad too constantly comparing him to his parents can't be healthy either
#+end_quote

I agree, the way McGonagall strong-arms Harry into playing Quidditch without asking him if he'd like to play, and just assumes he'll love it because James did, is horrible! The way Dumbledore manipulates Harry using his parents' memory into sacrificing himself is outright evil (except that it was actually Harry's best chance of survival, but whatever, Harry certainly didn't know it at the time of walking willingly toward certain death)! The way Slughorn whines to Harry about how bad it was for /Slughorn/ to lose Lily was pathetic!

#+begin_quote
  but Snape with his constant belittling and insulting is definitely worse
#+end_quote

Harry, whether you like it or not, named his child after Severus Snape, so if you ask the victim of this horrendous abuse, the victim will probably laugh in your face, because the victim grew up and understood why Snape was the way that he was.

#+begin_quote
  and If you say yes but that's just Harry we'll okay moving on from Harry...
#+end_quote

I am loving this intellectual chess game.

#+begin_quote
  Nevilles biggest fear is professor Snape. A student is straight up AFRAID of him.
#+end_quote

Neville's boggart is meaningless. Lupin singles Harry out as a student with a serious fear that needs to be addressed individually and with extreme caution, not Neville. Neville defeats his boggart on his first try, just like the others, who fear nonsensical things.

#+begin_quote
  And he dosent care if people try to kill each other in his class because malfoy and his friends often throw ingredients into Harrys coulson and that shit is EXPLOSIVE AND COULD KILL THEM ALL.
#+end_quote

When?

#+begin_quote
  So yes sure continue your small minded idiotic believe
#+end_quote

By your own standards, you're being abusive toward me

#+begin_quote
  that Severus Snape is a good person just because he spied for the "light side"
#+end_quote

Yes, he is a good person just for that, because "he worked for the light side" is the /only/ good thing that can be said about characters like Sirius; unlike Sirius and most members of the Order, Snape was indispensable and extremely capable, he had the hardest, most dangerous job of anyone, and he sacrificed the most.

#+begin_quote
  and that even ignored that he probably wasn't on either side but did just enough to come out as the hero no matter who wins.
#+end_quote

This one is one of my favorite arguments, it's just so stupid.

Snape did not know he will be Dumbledore's killer before the summer between OOTP and HBP. By this point he had already risked himself to protect Harry multiple times. When Dumbledore summoned Snape after he had gotten /himself/ nearly killed, Snape could have simply done nothing and taken credit for finishing Dumbledore off. When he did find out he'll have to kill Dumbledore, he didn't want to. But even if this was somehow part of some grand scheme, he was only playing both sides from the moment he killed Dumbledore. Except even this is ridiculous.

A) Why send Harry the Silver Doe and lead him to the real sword of Gryffindor?

He could have simply done nothing.

B) Why follow Dumbledore's plan to the letter? In case you've forgotten, Dumbledore's plan was as follows:

#+begin_quote
  There will come a time when *Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake.*”\\
  “For Nagini?” Snape looked astonished.\\
  “Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection, *then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.*”\\
  [...]\\
  “So the boy . . . the boy must die?” asked Snape quite calmly.\\
  “*And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus*. That is essential.”
#+end_quote

Snape prevents others from killing Harry:

#+begin_quote
  “*No!” roared Snape's voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it had started*; Harry lay curled on the dark grass, clutching his wand and panting; somewhere overhead Snape was shouting, “Have you forgotten our orders? *Potter belongs to the Dark Lord --- we are to leave him! Go! Go!”*
#+end_quote

Snape must have fed Voldemort that line, or at least manipulated Voldemort's arrogance so that he'll continue to insist on killing Harry himself, even though he is the one person who /cannot/ kill Harry. Preventing them from torturing Harry was just a cover-blowing moment, though.

Voldemort himself:

#+begin_quote
  “I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.”
#+end_quote

Snape follows Dumbledore's plan exactly:

#+begin_quote
  “I have thought long and hard, Severus. . . . Do you know why I have called you back from the battle?”

  And for a moment Harry saw Snape's profile: *His eyes were fixed upon the coiling snake in its enchanted cage.*“No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. *Let me find Potter.*”
#+end_quote

He also did not tell Voldemort that he is /not/ the master of the Elder Wand; we know how that worked out for him (not very well). But, say he hadn't died. Say he hadn't died, and Harry hadn't returned from the dead to clear his name. In this scenario, Snape looks like #1 Death Eater, Dumbledore's killer, who opened the Gates of Hogwarts to let Voldemort in. Rather than playing both sides, that's how you buy yourself a Dementor's kiss, or if you're lucky, death by raging mob.

Had he chosen to simply do none of that after killing Dumbledore, Voldemort would have won, and Snape would have had a very nice life.
