Are you familiar with the logical fallacy "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question][begging the question]]"? It means your argument is assuming what you're trying to prove. I think this is what's going on here, with your response - you're assuming Snape mistreated Neville to the point that he feared Snape more than he feared the Death Eaters who had tortured his parents into insanity, more than he feared his life-threateningly abusive relatives. We see Snape being unpleasant to Neville, sure, but we don't see him torturing anybody or endangering anybody's life, so that needs to be proven rather than asserted. Neville himself compares his fear of Snape to the fear of his grandmother - except that his grandmother should have loved him unconditionally, and Snape was his teacher, whose job it was to tell Neville when he was doing poorly (even if he could have gone about it in a kinder way). If you /must/ attribute a deeper meaning to this boggart, it might mean that Neville fears his own inadequacy, which is constantly brought up by both Snape and his grandmother.

Alternatively, you're assuming that the boggart necessarily reflects one's truest, deepest, darkest fear, and not what's just at the front of one's mind at the time, and this is also false, because accepting that conclusion would mean accepting that Ron fears spiders more than he fears dying or losing his family, and the same goes for every other student. It would also make Lupin a fucking monster, to be honest - he sees that a boggart turns into Snape and doesn't immediately stop the lesson and do something about the horrible abuse Neville is surely suffering at his hands? He thinks it's a good idea in the first place to make 13 year olds face their deepest darkest fears in public with less than five minutes of preparation?

I'm not saying Snape didn't trigger a physiological fear response in Neville, I am saying that the same is true for Ron's spiders, Dean's severed hand, etc. There is already a creature in canon that actually reveals one's true, deepest, darkest, trauma - the dementors. Another one would have been redundant - and indeed, Lupin, who isn't a monster, /didn't/ confront children with those, but with the boggart. You've said Harry needed to learn how to cast the patronus because "plot device" - so you do acknowledge the existence of plot devices. Since you do, here's another explanation why Snape is Neville's boggart: Snape's true motives and allegiance are a secret until the end of the series. He was angry at Lupin and taught the class about werewolves after Sirius Black broke into the castle on Halloween, but of course there was a need to make this look petty and vindictive, so JKR needed to give Snape something to appear to be petty and vindictive about. The twist is that he wasn't petty or vindictive at all, he was protective (even if he was wrong in the sense that Sirius wasn't out to get Harry). Another explanation for this might be, of course, that Neville's story was only formed in JKR's mind when she wrote book 4.
