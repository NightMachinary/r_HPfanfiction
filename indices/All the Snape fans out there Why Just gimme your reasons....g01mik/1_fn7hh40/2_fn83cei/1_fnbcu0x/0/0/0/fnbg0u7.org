I want you to think. You are a orphan your whole life you have been told you are a freak and possibly have even been hit (since Harry once casually mentions that his aunt tries to hit him with the frying pan if the good takes too long we can assume he gets hit at home or atleast was before hogwarts) starved and not loved. Then you get to a school where a teacher is constantly belittling you making you feel worthless and telling you how worthless your dead parent is. He is constantly blaming everything on you telling you you are a failure and whenever he sees you he insults you.... Yes Snape is definitely a good person and should be around children.... Snape is not a good person. Snape should not be around children. I have a friend who is a psychologist and she has the same opinion. It's honestly a miracle that Harry is as kind as he is of course he is no saint either he just straight out hates an entire school house because his fist and only friend at the time told him they are evil so yea but I think that's kind of understandable someone with that childhood would do everything in order to not loose his first friend but what Snape did is just horrible I mean sure other teachers were bad too constantly comparing him to his parents can't be healthy either but Snape with his constant belittling and insulting is definitely worse and If you say yes but that's just Harry we'll okay moving on from Harry... Nevilles biggest fear is professor Snape. A student is straight up AFRAID of him. And he dosent care if people try to kill each other in his class because malfoy and his friends often throw ingredients into Harrys coulson and that shit is EXPLOSIVE AND COULD KILL THEM ALL. So yes sure continue your small minded idiotic believe that Severus Snape is a good person just because he spied for the "light side" and that even ignored that he probably wasn't on either side but did just enough to come out as the hero no matter who wins.
