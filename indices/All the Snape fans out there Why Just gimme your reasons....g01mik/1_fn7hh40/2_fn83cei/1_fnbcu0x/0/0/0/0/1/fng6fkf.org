I just wanna address one of your points- I'm too tired to do the rest:

#+begin_quote
  Neville's boggart is meaningless. Lupin singles Harry out as a student with a serious fear that needs to be addressed individually and with extreme caution, not Neville. Neville defeats his boggart on his first try, just like the others, who fear nonsensical things.
#+end_quote

1. Lupin singled out Harry because his Boggart could actually inflict physical damage to him. Harry's Bogart- the Dementor, could not be repelled by the Ridiculous Charm because he had Dementoric effects on Harry. Also, Harry needed to know how to cast the Patronus because plot device. Also, don't you think the fact that Lupin was one of Harry's parents' best friends may be a factor in the attention he gave Harry's Bogart?\
2. Just because Neville's fear was less dangerous overall, does not mean that it was a less fearful experience for him. My greatest fear, for example, is a bomb blast in Yemen. Lupin probably wouldn't take any interest in that, but for me, it's a very real fear- my mom works in a bunker in YemYou en three months a year. Anyway, Lupin probably wouldn't have cared about that, because there was no way for me to make the real thing go away, just like Neville can't spell the real Snape away. Harry can spell Dementors away. So even if Lupin wanted to do something- he couldn't. Also, can you imagine what it must mean seeing your greatest fear every day and having him belittle you in front of people that already bully you? Snape was HORRIBLE to Neville and there was nothing he could do about it. You cannot say it is meaningless because it has meaning to him. And even if Snape wasn't that much of an immediate threat to Neville, he was still there, in his head. You could say that since Dementor's tried to suck Harry's soul out, and Snape didn't do that to Neville, his fear was meaningless, but if you look a little closer, you'll find that their heartrates would have increased at the same rate, they would be the same level of frightened.
3. The fact that you are able to call Neville's fear meaningless is also a testament to how terrible Snape is: Neville had a VERY tragic life, perhaps even more tragic than Harry. His parents were tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange, his family thought he was a squib until he was 8 and threw him off roofs to confirm that- can you imagine how that must have felt to an eight-year-old? He lived with a grandmother who was constantly disappointed in him for not living up to his parents, and oh yeah HIS PARENTS WERE TORTURED BY THE EVILEST WITCH ALIVE AND HE HAD TO GO VISIT THEM EVERY WEEK DURING THE HOLIDAYS AND WATCH THEM IN THAT VEGETATIVE STATE AND COULD DO NOTHING ABOUT IT EXCEPT TAKE CANDY WRAPPERS FROM HIS MUM AND HIS GREATEST FEAR WAS NOT ANY OF THAT OR BELLATRIX AND THE OTHERS BREAKING OUT BUT HIS *MOTHERFUCKING SCHOOL TEACHER!!!*

I will reply to the rest soon. Goodbye.
