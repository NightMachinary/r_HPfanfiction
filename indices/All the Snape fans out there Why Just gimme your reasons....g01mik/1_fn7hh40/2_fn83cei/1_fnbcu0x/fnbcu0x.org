Mental abuse is a much more serious issue and so is teen suicide; Harry was never close to being suicidal and if he was it was never because of Snape. Mental abuse consists of more than sarcastic remarks and mild punishments, there are people in life who won't like you for reasons that have nothing to do with you. Not kissing Harry's ass isn't abusive in and of itself.

It's not Snape fault that in Harry's life, adults have either abused him or fawned over him to the point that it was hard for him to tell abuse apart from general and non-criminal, non-evil dislike. It's indirectly Snape's fault, of course, that Harry is not just a kid but also a symbol which means that people fawned over Harry from the moment he set foot in the wizarding world and so any adult who disliked him could be presumed to want him dead and be evil. In actual fact, disliking Harry is perfectly understandable even if you're not Snape, who also has his own reasons.
