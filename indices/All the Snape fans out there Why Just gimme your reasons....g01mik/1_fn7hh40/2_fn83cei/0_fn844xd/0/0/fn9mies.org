Yes, also agree. If Voldemort won and Snape survived with his cover intact, I dare say not much would have changed. However, I don't really like how many of the people that are on the "Snape is bad" club(not saying you tho) dehumanize to such a degree that he ends up worse than voldemort. No one would that didn't care at least a little bit would have done what he did. Some that cared a lot wouldn't. People forget he helped Harry and in the end walked to his own death knowingly, after Dumbledore was dead and he owed no satisfaction to no one(but a flimsy portrait). So that's why I think that even if he's a terrible excuse of a human being, that his sacrifice should not be overlooked(likewise, people shouldn't forget he is an asshat just because he sacrificed himself)
