But that's the thing, I really don't think is that morally complex of a character, he is just an emotional sludge of a man whose only motivations seem to be negative emotions, he is against Voldemort because of hate, he mistreats Harry because of spite and protects him because of regret. I really don't find what is there to like or even what is so "interesting" it just so happens that his motivations put him in the "good guys" camp but I never thought of him being a "good guy"
