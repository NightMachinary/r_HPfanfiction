Okay? He's a fictional character and I'm not condoning his actions.

I'll rephrase: he's an asshole, but I was very invested for this asshole to ultimately be on the "good" side. It's way more fun than having all the nice people be good guys and the mean people be bad guys, hence why his character was so interesting.

Edit: On a separate note, Walter White is a horrible person and most people love his character.
