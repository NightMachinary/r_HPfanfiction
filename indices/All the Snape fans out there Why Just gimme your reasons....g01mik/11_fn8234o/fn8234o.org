Snape is interesting because he's one of the more morally grey characters in the series, and has a lot of potential. He's a sarcastic, jaded asshole who is managing to betray one of the darkest, most insane wizards in history while still being one of his most trusted underlings - what's /not/ to like about that? :P

In fanfics, I find that he can work very well as a mentor of sorts, if set up correctly. There's some fics that have adjusted large or small details in a fairly natural way to make that happen or make him a bit /less/ of an asshole to students, which is nice - though, of course, it's just one way to handle him.

But in general, he's a pretty unique character in the universe, and his potion brewing abilities and just general skills are also quite interesting to play with as a character!
