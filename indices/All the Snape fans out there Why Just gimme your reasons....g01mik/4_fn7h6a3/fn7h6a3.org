Because fanfiction took a limited, but still intriguing character, and fleshed him out to such a degree I feel that he's the most dynamic character in the series (or should have been). Fanfiction has really developed him and rounded him out in a very compelling way that I feel JKR could have done, but failed to follow through on the potential she set up.
