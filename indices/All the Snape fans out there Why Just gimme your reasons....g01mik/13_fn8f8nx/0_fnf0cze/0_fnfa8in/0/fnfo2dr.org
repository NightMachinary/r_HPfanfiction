I see physical appearance as a gate before Charisma even works.

Any matter of state? Nobody would take him seriously, he can't handle his own hygiene. Seedy bar? Yes, this makes him fit right in. Village that has heard rumors about a plague/sickness? His pale sallow skin wouldn't make it past the gate.

Sure, it would be good for ability score, but socially? Snape is one of the more antisocial people. He can threaten, intimidate, and negotiate from a position of power. But he needs to have that power first. In canon, that position was from Voldemort/Dumbledore.

EDIT: Crap, forgot location is a factor too.
