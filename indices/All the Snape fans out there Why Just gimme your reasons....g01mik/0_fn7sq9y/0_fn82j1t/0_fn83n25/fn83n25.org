He's a huge jerk who hates his job and pettily bullies children, and is therefore basically the perfect character for me to read a story about. I'm tired of people twisting themselves into knots to justify anything about this.

For similar reasons, I like reading stories about Voldemort (where none of his actions are absolved by the narrative).
