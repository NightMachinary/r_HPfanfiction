I wouldn't call myself a "Snape-fan" but he is a very interesting character. We get a lot of backstory from him, and overall in the books we never quite knew which side he was on. His motives are very mysterious. He spied for the Order returning to Voldemort again and again, a feat not many would've been able to do and a very dangerous job indeed. Snape wasn't a nice person, he was very bitter and he had many bad things happen to him in his life, partly through circumstances of his surroundings and partly through his own choices and yet in the end he did the right thing.\\
I think his character is very fleshed out and he is an intriguing person. He was very intelligent and capable as well as well versed in the dark arts. And he was 20 when he overheard the Prophecy. It is no excuse of course but a fact to be considered. There is a lot you can work with in fanfiction if you use him . I can see why people dislike him and I can also relate to people who like him.

Overall I think he was not a pleasant person when we got to know him in the books but nonetheless he was not bad per se. Just bitter and hardened by life. The only thing that can't be justified in my opinion is how he treated Harry because he reminded him of James. His grudge against Sirius is understandable and they both weren't very mature in that regard. That being said Snape was the only DADA teacher who didn't try to torture or kill Harry. Which is ironic in it's own way

PS: In the books Snape never entered Godrics Hollow to cry over Lilys dead body and ignore Harry completely so I think we can ignore that being used as an argument against Snape.
