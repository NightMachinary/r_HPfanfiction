I think it's fair to say Snape would never mean to cause any serious harm to Harry no matter what... True he didn't like Harry much bcoz of James, but he also couldn't hate him bcoz of Lily...

So he was essentially protective of Harry while mistreating him at every chance if that makes sense lol ðŸ˜‚
