I don't like Snape, but stories with a good Snape are okay.

However, he did a realistically horrible job pretending to be a spy. Voldemort and Dumbledore both had him spying on the other, yet if Voldemort had any logic he could easily see Snape as a spy because unless Dumbledore had some ulterior motive for him his behavior would have him fired after his first month.
