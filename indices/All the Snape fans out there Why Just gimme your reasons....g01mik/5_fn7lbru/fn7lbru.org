1- the best fics I read were Snape-centred and he is such an interesting character in canon that allows you to take him wherever you want and still make the changes believable because canon never gave us his insight

2- Snape is a F* arsehole. There is no other way to put it. Still a hero tho. He's just a terrible person who did something really really good and really sacrificed himself(no matter his motivations). The thing is, he is completely morally grey: his great actions should not be diminished by the fact he was an arsehole; and him being an arsehole should not be overlooked because of his great actions.

I love complex characters and just cause I love a character does not mean he is a great person. I love his complexity and the grey area he walks in.

I could go on and on about justifications for his behaviour and why he did this or acted like that(believe me, I spent a lot of time thinking of them for fanfics and personally think they are plausible), but at the end of the day I don't really think it matters that much. Why can't he be both a bad and a good person? Characters in general are usually way more complex than the little "hero" and "villain" boxes people try to shove them on.
