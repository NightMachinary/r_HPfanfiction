I‘m not a fan of Snape, because he's introduced as a bully and stays as such, but i would say that most fans are from fanfictions that give him more character. Because ultimately that's what makes him such a more or less bad (?) character. We don't really have any information about him. Maybe he had at least some regrets about joining the DEs. Considering that Dumbledore or the ministry didn't do much to stop Moldyshorts is it really that unthinkable to be able to say that Lily‘s death was the only thing that turned him around. The problem ultimately lies with JKR. But at the core of the characters i would draw a comparison with Doofenshmirtz (of Phineas and Ferb). I know wild comparison but hear me out. Both Doffenshmirtz and Snape have been abused to some degree in there childhood\\
Both tried to proof themselves to a darker being\\
I could draw more proof, but its shortly after midnight and I am tired so it stays with those to points that already are half of a characterdesing. The only reason why Heinz Doofenshmirtz is more liked and accepted than snape is because we have more background to him than snape. Yes Snape bullied students, but do you really think he liked his job at Hogwarts with the first years (he doesn't have his record as youngest potions master for nothing for christ‘ sake). He was at the start of the second year just out of his 20s (or something). Yes he's a horrible teacher but if you were in his position (bullied for nearly his whole childhood and shoolyears, only having one or two childhood friends, abused in his childhood, etc.) would you say you wouldn't be the same?! He is a horrible human being because he didn't really learn different. His "Love" for Lily may have been one reason to leave the DEs but maybe he had some doubts. We are missing a lot of his characterdesign to really know. And that's why the fandom of Harry Potter is so spilt about opinions of Snape. If you want to have someone to blame for shitty Character design blame JKR. But try to see some points that make sense because nobody is evil just because they were born that way. On an emotional level with Physics Logic there is no pure hate only absence of love. Think about what makes a character that way in their story, then draw conclusions that make him dislikeable/likeable. I hope that was good as i wrote it. If not blame it on my tired mind (it's now 1 am).
