That being my point exactly. So what if he's a jerk and not rly a good person? There are people who just like villains in general and they don't get nearly as much hate as Snape fans do. Sure some Snape fans justify his every action and love making excuses, but I find that generally that happens mostly in fanfics where they can adapt and change everything to their liking. I personally adore him as a complex caracter who is more than just a "good hero" or a "total villain"; does not mean I adore him as a person tho. Morally grey characters are my favorites.
