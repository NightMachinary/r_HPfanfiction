I'm somewhat confused here, I was just answering from my perspective about whether he can be seen as good of you take a general view of Snape. I like villains, and morally gray characters are typically interesting to me. I don't find Snape to be interesting though, because... what is gray about him? He was a bad guy. Having a checkered past isn't really what "morally gray" is about. He didn't choose to be good for anything that typically makes a character gray and thus interesting to me (i.e. picking a different side on morally debatable questions that blur the lines, or horrid tactics used in service of a goal that seems good). He was very bad, up until it directly hurt what he cared about most, so he just becomes a generally unpleasant guy who does good things grudgingly and without really seeming to have a belief about the relevant issues one way or another. It's not that he was plain bad all the time, but that I think he was just written poorly in terms of his motivations (if he wanted to help Harry, trying to get him expelled, and therefore killed, isn't sensible).

Though, I don't think pointing to fanfic where people do things differently really matters to me when talking about liking or disliking Snape. Fanfic versions of characters are all over the place, to be honest.
