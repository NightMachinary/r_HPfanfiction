Exactly. Honestly, Snape's not my fav because his particular variety of terrible isn't one that appeals to me. I don't dislike him but I don't have any particular interest in him on a fandom level. It's just funny to me when people are baffled/judge-y regarding villainous characters. There's far worse than Snape who have fans and that's totally fine.
