Eh, different strokes. With very few exceptions, I generally don't understand being judgemental about anyone's fictional taste. There's ships, characters, and tropes I don't enjoy, but the fact that other people do doesn't bother me or cause me to question their preferences. I assume that what they get out of it is different than how I see it.

In terms of villains, fiction can be a way to explore feelings and unpleasant aspects of humanity in an exaggerated (and largely harmless) way. This is part of the reason that stories about redemption or character change can be meaningful. Those characters are able to cross lines and still come back from them in a way that wouldn't be realistic in a real-world context.
