There's a difference between liking something for entertainment value and liking what bad things a character did from a moral perspective (which is what I was talking about). Especially if their change in their side ends up being (even viewed in-series) as a selfish reason.

And this is why I say his motivations were not written well! His past is supposed to inform how he was later as a Death Eater, yet we see from even before he was 10 that he understood Muggleborns weren't lesser than other wizards, yet he still became a DE. This is a hypocrisy even Lily pointed out, Snape couldn't have really disagreed with pureblood supremacy and was evidently quite firm in that belief based on Lily knowing he used slurs against Muggleborns quite liberally. As far as I can tell, his main defining belief is that he loved Lily... I dunno, I just can't get behind him as a character, I don't get it
