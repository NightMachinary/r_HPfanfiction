See, I don't consider that overly disturbing. There's plenty of reasons why people enjoy villains and their humanity or tragedy is only part of that. People can find entertainment in the horrible actions of a villain without it having any implications on their preferences or what they believe in a real-world context.

Besides that, though, I also think that Snape as a character himself is informed by that negative childhood and past. His experiences are part of what makes him the jaded turncoat we see in the series. So, people who want to dig into that are going to find it a relevant aspect and it can be part of their interest.
