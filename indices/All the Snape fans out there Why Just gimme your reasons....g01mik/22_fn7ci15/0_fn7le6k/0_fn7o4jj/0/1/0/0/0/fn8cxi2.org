The funny thing about this conversation is that I honestly don't care much about Snape as a character. I don't dislike him but I agree that his backstory is pretty thin. Though, of course, fandom has certainly found ways to fill it in which can be compelling or sympathetic.

My comment was really more general commentary on the idea that people couldn't or shouldn't find Snape interesting or enjoy the character, or that the only reason to do so would be Rickman.
