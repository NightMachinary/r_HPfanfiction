Sure, and it seems somewhat hard to actually do that for Snape. Villains are usually interesting because there's something about them that people can empathize with or agree to, up to a point. For Snape it's... his bad childhood? It's nothing that we actually experience, because it's all 20 years in the past and only barely connects with the Snape we actually read about (the one who simply hated the protagonist for absurd reasons). In any case, if it's about liking the bad things Snape did or finding a character who changed sides fascinating in and of themselves, that seems quite different (and in the former case, kind of disturbing). It's the difference between liking Voldemort's moral character and liking Grindelwald's, if you catch my meaning.
