Snape is my favourite because

1. Alan Rickman portrays him so well. I still think he was far too old for the role but his voice.....

2. He's morally ambiguous. You're not really sure where he stands until the very end

3. He's unashamedly awful and gives zero fucks. Severus Snape is not a nice person, you love to hate him but he helps out anyway. He makes Wolfbane for Lupin even though it's a long and unpleasant process. He watches out for Harry even though he loathes him

4. He's brilliant and creative with his magic. His potions book, his spell crafting are good examples

5. He's incredibly brave. The scene at the end of GOF where Dumbledore asks him if he's ready still gives me chills

6. He tried to redeem himself. He made a bad decision as a very young man (joining the Death Eaters) with horrible consequences (the death of Lily) and spent the rest of his life trying to atone for it. He very obviously lived with tremendous guilt and it's my head canon that he's profoundly depressed

He's a very human character. That's why I like him so much. I can see the possible reasons for him being the way he is
