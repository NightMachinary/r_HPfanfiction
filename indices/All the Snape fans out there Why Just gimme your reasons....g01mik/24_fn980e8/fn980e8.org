I'm a fan of Snape because he's an asshole but a nuanced asshole. I disagree with people that believe fanfiction fleshed him out. I think that Dumbledore and Snape are the most complex characters in a world with simplified unidimensional adult characters. Fanfiction tends to simplify Snape down to his redemption arc or the fact that he was a piece of shit. It always leaves out the complexities of his motivations. In short, I hate the man but he makes a story interesting. It's just the story is only canon because I've yet to find a story where Snape's character is true to the books or better.
