In /Dangerous/ by Black Lotus (unfortunately down with GrangerEnchanged, but there are copies out there), Harry settles down in South America, though Hermione sticks around in England and ends up leading an uprising against the backsliding Ministry.

  Bonus points if you find a story where Hermione runs away with Harry (since they have that whole shared background of being raised by Muggles) and they start a new life together.

More generally, that strikes me as very un-Hermione. Harry we know --- he's been famous since 1, and hated every minute of it that wasn't related to Quiddich. To Hermione, though, it'd be more of a "Finally! People are actually listening when I tell them things!" reaction, IMO.
