I don't know if this exists, but the best Dumbledore bashing would be one where he is not evil.

When you are in a story Dumbledore is clearly an evil manipulator, it is just an author rant and a clear instance of tell not show. I don't know if this is what you are looking for, but that is the stuff I dislike the most. It would be like Harry stopping and monologuing Voldemort in their final battle. Ideally, the reader is already there with you at that point.

Now, a character taking a piece out of Dumbledore where it is clear he doesn't entirely deserve it? Now you have an interesting character interaction.
