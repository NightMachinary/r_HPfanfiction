100% agreed. I'm indian too and I can't tell you how much I would've loved to have international books with Indian protagonists growing up, but shoehorning my entire culture into a place and character it doesn't belong for the “woke points” is cringeworthy. To clarify - I don't have any issues with the character being portrayed by a Desi actor on stage for example - thats just who is best for the role and that's great. But that doesn't make the character indian. That's also how I feel about black Hermione, but I'm not sure if that should be something I can be outraged about because it's not my culture being co-opted and I don't know the nuances. But cmon. Potter, that exceptionally indian surname. Fleamont and Euphemia?? Oh that's just the neighbour uncle down the road and I know soooo many people with that name. It's just silly.
