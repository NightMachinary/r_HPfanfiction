People are looking to be more inclusive, but they also want to write stories about the main characters instead of side characters. So they look and see James has black hair and brown eyes, and could that be a sign of some different ancestry? Hermione has that "bushy" brown hair and brown eyes too. So they just run with it. It's not always a bad thing in my view, of course anything can be bad if it's badly written, just like a good author can make even the worst tropes fun again.
