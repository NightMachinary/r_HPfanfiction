That doesn't make sense.

James is a Pureblood from Britain, meaning his family is mostly from Britain. Lily has red hair, red hair is mostly found in the British isles.

Why? I mean there are other characters that are brown but why characters that are shown in both the books and films that are white?

It just doesn't makes sense to me.
