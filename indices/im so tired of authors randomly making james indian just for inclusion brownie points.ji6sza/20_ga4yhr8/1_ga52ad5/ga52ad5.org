  James is a Pureblood from Britain, meaning his family is mostly from Britain.

But there is the argument that we actually don't know hardly anything about the makeup of wizarding Britain, the international links, movement of wizards around the world, magical Britain's links to colonialism and the British empire etc., because JKR never details it.

It's thus an assumption that just because the majority of muggle Britain in the 1980s and 90s was white, that the wizarding Britain would be the same.

For a community of people where teleportation is routine and commonplace, and where explicitly the only social divides come from blood quality, rather than skin color, it's not too out of the ordinary that a lot of migration between countries may have taken place. The fact that Pureblood wizards openly look down on muggles, to me only supports the idea that wizards would be unlikely to be racist.

For another example, the Weasleys have no issue with Fred (and then George) dating a black woman, although they show other prejudices through the series.
