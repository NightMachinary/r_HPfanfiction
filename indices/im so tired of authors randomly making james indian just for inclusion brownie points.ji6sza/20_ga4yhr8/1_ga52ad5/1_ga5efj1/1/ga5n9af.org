So, the Weasleys show a fair bit of positive prejudice against muggles. This is commonplace in their society (e.g. 'muggle studies' being seen as a joke subject, muggle inferiority and 'wackiness' assumed, although muggle/born magicals/ are accepted as fine and not troubling by magnanimous Purebloods like themselves) and reflected in how they have no issue with assault of muggles (Dudley's tongue, memory charms) if done for what they see as 'justified' reasons rather than just for wizard entertainment.

The Weasleys also canonically have a Squib cousin who they don't talk about and who we never see invited to family events or referenced. Additionally, one could make the argument that the Weasleys are prejudiced against all Slytherins, based on some bad experiences the family has had with certain Slytherins. And then, Mrs Weasley is also prejudiced against the French!
