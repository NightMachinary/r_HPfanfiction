Britain as a whole was not nearly as focused on skin colour as for example the US because there were almost no black people in England. Less than 20k even in 1950 according to Wikipedia. And while most black people had a crappy life in poverty, they weren't that different than the average poor white person in that regard. The inhumane conditions of 19th century Britain were almost universal unless you were rich. And given that England had overseas possessions for centuries, is certainly possible for his family to have been in Britain for generations.

What's a little confusing about this whole thing is that the shacklebolts are considered part of the 28, meaning that they have been around for longer than the SoS or Britains overseas possessions, so my best guess would be that his family originally came from the Moorish lands and ended up in England through Aquitaine.
