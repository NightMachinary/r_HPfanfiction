To be fair the Sacred 28 don't necessarily have to have been in Britain for centuries - some of them could be much more recent additions who were able to prove a 'pureblood pedigree' and so were included in the book because of that. It's also possible that the Shacklebolts aren't a 'black family', but instead a family with a black or mixed race branch. And it's also possible that they've been here for over a thousand years and are just one part of a black wizarding subculture.

We just don't have a lot of information about most things in Harry Potter which can be fun for fanfiction because it gives some space to play.
