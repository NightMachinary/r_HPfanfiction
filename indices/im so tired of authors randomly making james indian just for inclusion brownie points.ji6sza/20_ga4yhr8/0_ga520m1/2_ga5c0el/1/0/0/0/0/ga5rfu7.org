  If you assume that the sacred 28 were originally based on nobility, which isn't an unreasonable assumption before the SoS and the overall decline of nobility during the industrial revolution, it would be kinda hard to accept a random newcomer to the club.

I'm not sure what point you're trying to make. Shacklebolt is part of the 28 , which makes the above argument useless.
