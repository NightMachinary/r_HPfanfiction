1) Which means that Britain was even whiter back then and closer to the times of a more influential nobility, which was exclusively white. Hell, being Irish or Scottish was already considered foreign until Victorian times.

2) The point of contention is that the Shacklebolt family were probably not black when they were founded, but rather that them being black is a more recent development, which would be in line with the demography of England

Wikipedia is clear that even in 1950, there were less than 20k black people in the UK.

  You do realise that Romans ruled Britannia for about 400 years so there is a STRONG possibility that POC existed there at the time, and made a kid or two.

Why would Romans mean PoC? Romans enslaved everyone and I bet that 99% of the Roman slaves in Britain were white. They would have no incentive to move slaves from Africa to England when they could get their supply from the Germanic Frontier. After all, shorter transport = lower price.

Arabic is way easier to explain since Spain used to be Arabic. As I already outlined in this thread, the route of Africa - Spain - Aquintaine - Service to an important figure - High position as reward - Moving to England when France won the 100 y war. And if Shafiq were already nobles in Moorish Spain, you can cut a few corners in that route.
