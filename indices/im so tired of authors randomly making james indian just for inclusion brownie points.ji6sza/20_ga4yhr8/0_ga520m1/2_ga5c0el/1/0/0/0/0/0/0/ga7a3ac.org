........you are really trying to run with this.

1) The Sacred 28 list didn't appear until the 1930's.

2) In HP canon, pure-blood status was referenced by the following (NOT a genetic family tree):

"onset of magical ability before the age of three, early (before aged seven) prowess on a broomstick, dislike or fear of pigs and those who tend them (the pig is often considered a particularly non-magical animal and is notoriously difficult to charm), resistance to common childhood illnesses, outstanding physical attractiveness and an aversion to Muggles".

  the only black people in England at the time the magical community seemed to form (1000-1500) would have been Moorish traders, and trade was not seen as a noble occupation.

I'm gonna say or one more time: This. Is. Fiction.

And wouldn't you know it, the family name Shafiq is also one of the 28, so do please attempt to explain how they were white as well until the 11th century or however you want to spin it.

.....why is it so hard to accept? Seriously? What do you gain by fighting this so aggressively? You do realise that Romans ruled Britannia for about 400 years so there is a STRONG possibility that POC existed there at the time, and made a kid or two.

Y'all will do and say anything to deny black people any sort of existence and its nauseating.
