If you assume that the sacred 28 were originally based on nobility, which isn't an unreasonable assumption before the SoS and the overall decline of nobility during the industrial revolution, it would be kinda hard to accept a random newcomer to the club.

There are ways to justify that, but the Shacklebolt family moving from Africa to Moorish Spain to Aquitaine to England would be a bit far out there. Certainly possible, but unlikely. Of course, you can certainly come up with a backstory where a Moorish trader helped the English king in the 100year war and was ennobled for his deeds, but colonial marriage is simply more likely.
