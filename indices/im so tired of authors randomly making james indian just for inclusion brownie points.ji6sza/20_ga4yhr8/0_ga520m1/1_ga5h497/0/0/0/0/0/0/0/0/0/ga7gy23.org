  You're shoehorning it into random schoolyard insults at a British magical school

Shoehorning: "to force to be included or admitted"

No force required here, move along.

"Random schoolyard insults" are seldom random, actually. Whether those children are magical or otherwise, schoolyard insults are intended to be offensive, and are usually reference to aspects of another person's appearance, especially if it's something out of the norm.

Hair styles and textures of Afro-Caribbean people are often singled out for ridicule by some white Brits, for disparaging remarks, fetishisation, or just as a "difference".

It's very clear to anyone who ever went to a multi-racial school (in the UK) that Pansy is mocking Angelina's hair, which is almost certainly styled in a way that suits her hair, but gives the appearance of distinct cords (e.g. braids, corn rows, dreadlocks), which Pansy so derisively calls "worms".

I have explained this as clearly as it is possible to, and any further argument that there is no racial element to Pansy's insults is clearly an argument made in bad faith to try and dismiss casual racism, or its existence in the UK. Therefore, I will not engage any further with this.

Edited to add: a sadly necessary "some", to avoid further ridiculousness.
