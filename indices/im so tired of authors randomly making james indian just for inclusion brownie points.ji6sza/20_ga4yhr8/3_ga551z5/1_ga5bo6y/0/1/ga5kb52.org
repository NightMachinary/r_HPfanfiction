Because it would make absolutely no difference in Harry's case. There isn't some magical cultural memory, Harry was raised by a white middle class family in Surrey. Likewise even if Hermione was black, she is the daughter of two doctors. Which is upper middle class at the very least. So her experience growing up would have been completely different to what is usually associated with black, especially from American readers.
