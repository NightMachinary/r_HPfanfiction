TBF, Cho Chang sounds like something a racist would call some random asian person (Ching Chong Chinaman was very popular in my homevillage) . Maybe thats why? Cho in general comes across as not very fleshed out. She could have been interesting with her being the only female seeker during Harrys time, but unfortunately, she got stuck with being Harrys first crush and Cedrics girlfriend rather than something of her own. That's what annoyed me at the very least.

It has been a while since I read fanfictions but I think I really enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11920554/1/The-Flower-Shop][this one]] It's quite unique with Hermione being a Mediwitch and working for a Quidditch team. Sadly my boy doesn't get much attention and having to wade through writing leaves only a couple good ones. But I definitely remember this one being good.
