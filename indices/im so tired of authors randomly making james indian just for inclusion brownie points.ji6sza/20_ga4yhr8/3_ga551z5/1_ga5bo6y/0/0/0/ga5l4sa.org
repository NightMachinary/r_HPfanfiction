Yeah I'm starting to get the geographical differences aha. I did spend a year in East London, so of course my perspective is massively skewed, and I've spent years with lots of POC friends who are really passionate about BME representation.

Briefly on playing with side characters, totally agree that that's a good option to play with race in fandom too. But coming from an East Asian background, characters like Cho Chang just don't interest me to explore my culture. Totally get this is a â€˜me' problem, but I do think there's a place for playing with ethnic backgrounds of /main characters/ rather than just letting the POC character always be relegated to a fun side character. Even if a fic blows up their side character to star in the fic, it still feels a tad tokenistic to me (and I'm happy to not fight about this and agree that different people have tons of different opinions on this).
