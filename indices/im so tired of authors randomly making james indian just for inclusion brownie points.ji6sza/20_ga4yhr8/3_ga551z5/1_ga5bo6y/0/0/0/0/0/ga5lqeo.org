Link me your fav Viktor Krum stories if you have the time! I do quite like quidditch fics, would love to dip my toes into some Krum fandom :)

Ok, tbh, you've convinced me on the potential for a Patil twins exploration too. Maybe I am coming around on the secondary characters thing. Or maybe I just don't like Cho (and ngl feels a little like Yellow Fever to me sometimes, but maybe I'm just sensitive).
