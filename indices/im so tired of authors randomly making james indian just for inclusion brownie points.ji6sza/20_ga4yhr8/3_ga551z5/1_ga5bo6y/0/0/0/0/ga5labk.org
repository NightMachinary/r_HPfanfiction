Yea maybe. Personally I like reading Viktor Krum stories, because he is my favourite character, but I get not everyone has a side character as their favourite character.

Though I do have to say I'd love to know more about the Patil twins. They are vaguely described as being different but I'd like to know why they are so different that they got placed in almost opposite houses.
