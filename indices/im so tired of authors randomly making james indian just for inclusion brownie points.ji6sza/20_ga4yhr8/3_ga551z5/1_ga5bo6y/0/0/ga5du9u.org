Personally I don't disagree with fanon playing around with race but I'd rather shine a light on the already present POC, of which there are quite a few. I get that people would rather play around with the Main Characters, but personally I find some of the side characters just as interesting.

I also get the misconception if you live in a highly POC populated area. I was the opposite as a kid, grew up in an all white village and until I was in my twenties and moved away for work, I saw exactly 1 black person and 1 half black kid.
