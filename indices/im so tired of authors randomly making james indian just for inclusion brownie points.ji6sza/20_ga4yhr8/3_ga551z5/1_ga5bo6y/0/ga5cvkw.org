I'm not saying it's unreasonable for some people to assume that, but it's just /also/ reasonable for fanon to include some representation of Harry as a person of colour. Just as it is reasonable that fanon sometimes plays with characters' sexualities. These are traits not explicitly stated in the novels, and yet can be deeply personal and important to a character's motivation (even if just in a fic rather than in canon as a whole).

The parent comment was about the plausibility of a non-white British main character. My point is that just because this character was traditionally portrayed by white actors does not mean it can be assumed.

Btw thanks for pointing to the 2011 census stats! It's true that it's not a huge population of Indians and South Asians in the UK, percentage wise. The New Statesman does a deeper dive that suggests the population tends to be geographically concentrated, which probably explains why I'm over-estimating based on coming from a more ethnically diverse city in the UK. I do still maintain that it's not unlikely for a main character to be of South Asian descent, but I acknowledge your point that the stats are not as heavily skewed as I initially portrayed.
