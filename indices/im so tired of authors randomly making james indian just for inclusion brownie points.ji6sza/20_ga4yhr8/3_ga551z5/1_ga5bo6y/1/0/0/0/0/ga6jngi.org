I agree, some of the posts ITT are absolutely /wild/.

Inserting random Veela characters? Werewolf fics where one of the Golden Trio was bit in third year? Everybody LGBTQ? Harry literally has a relationship with human!Hedwig?

I thought the purpose of fan fiction was to subvert canon in interesting ways. Why do people protest so hard about race when the same people never question any wildly OOC or AU takes?

I understand wanting a discussion around tokenism and how authors should approach race in a sensitive and accurate manner. I absolutely do not understand the objection to ever making Harry anything other than the palest white dude simply because “canon” or “history”.
