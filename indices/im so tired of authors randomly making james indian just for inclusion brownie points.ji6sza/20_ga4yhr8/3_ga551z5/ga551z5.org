British people can be Indian / South Asian. Colonisation started a long time ago. Take it from someone who's lived in the UK for a few years, it is a disservice and unrepresentative for the main characters of a British novel to be so largely white / assumed to be white.

I broadly agree with some of the comments here that fics having Harry to be Indian feel tokenistic rather than a genuine in-depth attempt at representation. But there is an argument to be made about normalisation of non-white skin colours that suggest it could be good to mention Harry having darker skin in passing even if not as a main plot point (it would be awful if the only time Harry is presumed to be not-white is for plot services, people's ethnicities are not just a convenient plot device). But this discussion should not be premised on whether the cast and characters have traditionally been white, because then the norm of â€œof course someone is white unless explicitly stated otherwise just ends up exoticising non-white skin tones more.
