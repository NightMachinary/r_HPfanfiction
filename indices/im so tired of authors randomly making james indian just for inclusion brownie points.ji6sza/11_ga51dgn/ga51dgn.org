Some people think that the colorful lights James makes for Harry that we see from the window from Voldemort's perspective in Deathly Hallows could be celebrating Diwali (the Diwali date in 1981 is October 27, it's feasible) and there's an idea that maybe Parseltongue is a family trait based off the snake charmer stereotype. I know the stereotype is untrue and often offensive but it's still a stereotype that a lot of people buy into. Also, India was imperialized by Britain and it wouldn't be unreasonable for an Indian family to have moved to Britain during that time.

I don't buy into it, but that's some of the biggest reasons behind James specifically being Indian.

I do like to imagine that Harry is biracial for a few reasons, but not necessarily Indian, but also I am white so I write Harry as white because I don't want to disrespect a culture that is not my own, intentional or not, so I play on the safe side and don't touch what isn't mine.
