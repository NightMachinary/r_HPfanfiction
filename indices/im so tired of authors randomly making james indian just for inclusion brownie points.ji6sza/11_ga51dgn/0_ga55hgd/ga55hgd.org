I haven't heard of that Diwali theory, that's very cool!!! I come from a country that does have Diwali celebrations, but things never clicked until I read your comment. It does make so much sense though!!

And the Parseltongue thing could work, even though that would also involve Slytherins and possibly Voldemort himself also being embedded in Indian culture hmmm.....

Can't speak for other people, but as an Asian (though not specifically South Asian) person myself, I would welcome people to write about my culture or include characters from my culture even if the author does not have personal experience, as long as it's done respectfully and with research. There are always alternatives such as mirroring your own uncertainty through how a white character interacts and stumbles around how to not say the wrong thing to a POC character, or looking for beta readers who can better represent that community and make sure you're being accurate and non-offensive. There's just too much of a fight for representation to say writers can only write about their own cultures, otherwise we'd get far far less representation in books and fictional worlds while we're still fighting for our dues IRL.
