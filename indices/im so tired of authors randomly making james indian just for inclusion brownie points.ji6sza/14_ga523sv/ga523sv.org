If I had to guess, I'd say it's expanding on the Black Hermione bit, trying for more diversity, and Indians are the most prominent non-white ethnicity in modern Britain. Ao3 usually calls it Desi!Harry, but yeah, he's typically from India even then.

I don't mind it too much as a bit of backstory, and it gives a bit of spin on James that's somewhat novel, but when it starts getting into the wikipedia knowledge of India it gets irritating. I feel like I've seen one or two Pakistani-Fem!Harry, where she wore a headscarf, but I found those annoying, TBH, because you know there's no way in hell the Dursley's are going to tolerate someone wearing a headscarf under their roof, and it felt like the authors were inserting this heritage without thinking about how it would actually work in the setting.

All in all, I still find it less grating than when fics go whole-horse tokenism and make *everyone* some kind of minority. I'll take a million Indian Harry fics over any of those fics where Autistic Furry Harry rubs shoulders with Paraplegic Celiac Disease Ron and Black-Chinese Spider-person Hermione.
