Are you Indian? Or are you of Indian descent, with the family having lived in Britain for at least several generations? Because the latter sort of people are not going to display genuine Indian culture, but rather they'll just hold on to a few things while being mostly culturally British. And this isn't a cop out, because there are tons of people with that background in Britain in reality.
