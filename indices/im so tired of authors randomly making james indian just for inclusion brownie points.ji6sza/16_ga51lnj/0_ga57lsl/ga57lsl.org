I think it's because although they announce that James/Harry is Indian, they don't really give him any trait other than “brown skin”. Like OP pointed out, the information looks to be the generic and copy-pasted straight from Wikipedia. As an Indian myself, it's culturally degrading, especially since every state in India has an entirely different identity but foreign authors who haven't done enough research tend to make all the Indian characters alike and stereotypical.
