I do acknowledge that non-observant Hindus exist but cows are worshiped and are extremely sacred in this religion and eating a cow is considered a sin.

In fact, when my country was invaded by the British, they forced the Indian soldiers to use Enfield rifles, whose cartridges were greased with cow and pig fat which cause an uproar in the Hindu and Muslim communities since cow is sacred and pig is dirty. This was also the immediate cause for the revolt of 1857. So, yes, a Hindu Harry eating beef is insulting and you cannot convince me otherwise.

And yes, you do have the right to disagree. Feel free to continue using it :)
