I write fan fictions. I spent nearly a month talking to people who have DID so I can accurately represent them in a fan fiction I am planning on writing. Similarly, I spoke to a therapist and consulted nearly six people who have been diagnosed with depression to write a character who had it. If I hadn't, then wouldn't it have been insulting to misrepresent them?

Like that, if you are going to write about a person from another race, then won't it be nice to actually speak to people who are a part of that race or maybe do proper research on them -whether it be for a fan fiction or an essay-? It is simply not okay to ignorantly write communities. If by accident you get a few details wrong, that is alright; but going ahead with writing a whole character/story centred around a race without doing basic research or talking to people who are part of it isn't. Like somebody else said, it's just for earning brownie points, not because you care. That's all.
