  I write fan fictions. I spent nearly a month talking to people who have DID so I can accurately represent them in a fan fiction I am planning on writing. Similarly, I spoke to a therapist and consulted nearly six people who have been diagnosed with depression to write a character who had it.

Even if that was actually true and not some kinda moral panic, it wouldn't be actually bad, but at worst silly, unlike actually racist depictions or something in that vein.
