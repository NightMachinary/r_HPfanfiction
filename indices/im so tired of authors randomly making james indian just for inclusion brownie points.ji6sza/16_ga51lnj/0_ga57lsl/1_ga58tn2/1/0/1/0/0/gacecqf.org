Maybe, but sometimes, when people haven't done proper research, they do write about something that they /think/ is part of that culture but it actually isn't. For e.g., while I was reading one of the Hindu Harry ff's, harry over there ate beef wellington. Beef is a *big* no no in the religion, and hence, why I was offended on why the author wouldn't take a few minutes out and just read about the culture they are writing about.
