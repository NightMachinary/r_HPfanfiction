Reasons why being sexy pocahontas is gross

1. That is cultural appropriation though? Like, that's just blatantly obvious. [[https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/1/17924088/halloween-costume-yandy-sexy-native-american-backlash-handmaids-tale][this explains it better]]

   You make it sound like a 5-year old wanting to be a Disney character.

2. */Do you really want to dress up as a sexualized version of a teenage kidnapping/rape/trafficking victim, who was forced overseas to be used as an pawn and died there?/* [[https://www.niwrc.org/who-was-pocahontas][here]] [[https://www.nps.gov/jame/learn/historyculture/pocahontas-her-life-and-legend.htm][here]] [[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/12/nyregion/coming-to-classrooms-the-real-pocahontas-story.html][here]] [[https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5a1d6615e4b0e2ddcbb2942c][here]]

It's not being a spoilsport, it's being a decent person.
