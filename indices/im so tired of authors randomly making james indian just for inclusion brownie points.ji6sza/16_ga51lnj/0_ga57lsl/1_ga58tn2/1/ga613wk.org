It can be. If you don't even do the basic research into the culture before writing about it, you are only doing it for brownie points, not because you actually care.

I'm writing a fic that takes place in a modern magical ottoman empire and the amount of books I've read is insane. Let alone talking to actual turkish people AND visiting the country for a whole month. Yeah, I take it to the extreme but people should do basic research at least.
