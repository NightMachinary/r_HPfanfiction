My half brother is half-Indian, growing up he was the only kid I knew who looked more like Harry Potter than Harry Potter did... Black hair, green eyes, relatively pale skin.

For me, it made complete sense that Harry could be mixed heritage, but I never got hung up on it or developed a strong attachment to the idea. I just never spent much time thinking about Harry's ethnic identity.
