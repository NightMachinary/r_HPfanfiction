I fully agree with that. They never would have taught him a thing.

I've written a series where Harry is Indian and, though there are several other tropes that are major players in the series and definitely aren't for everyone, it is an important feature and connection to the Potters. That the Potters held on to that part of their history is something that makes them the Potters, so Harry spends a fair amount of the story learning about his culture. It's a bit slow developing, but it starts when he's 11 and I've only gotten to midway through third year, and he still has to learn about the Wizarding world, too, so I'm giving myself an out, there.

As someone who is white, I spend a fairly hefty amount of time for that fic doing research. I include the information I found and why I had Harry do/wear a certain thing in my notes and always include the disclaimer that if I got something wrong, I'd appreciate it being pointed out to me so I can correct it. I, personally, have no link to Indian culture and no one in my life who does, either, so I'm trying to be as accurate and polite about it as possible. I want it to be a part of his story and eventually a part of Harry, but I don't want it to be something that overwhelms the story in a distracting way.

Sorry for the self plug, but: the series is From the Dungeons beginning with From the Cupboard on AO3. My disclaimers are: this is a Slytherin!Harry fic including politics, Harry as the Lord of, like, six houses (mostly for comedy and ridiculousness), and Harry as Headmaster (see above).
