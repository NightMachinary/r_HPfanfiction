I haven't actually read any but I kinda like the idea of snakey magic being from India, and Harry is a parselmouth so the idea is he got it from the Indian lineage of magic. I agree that just saying lol James is Indian sounds lame but making him Indian and then having Harry learn Indian folklore related magic sounds pretty cool.
