I've only found 1 story that changed Harry's race (and by extension, James) like this. While I'm all for diversity, I just can't picture Harry in any way other than the way JRK originally described him in the book, or at the very least, Daniel Radcliffe. Describing him in any other way just breaks the immersion. It's the same reason why I don't like to read femme!Harry or any gender-bender fanfics. I like the characters as they're originally described in canon. Unless, like Blaise Zabini, the character wasn't really properly described in the beginning. Then, feel free to describe him/her however you want.
