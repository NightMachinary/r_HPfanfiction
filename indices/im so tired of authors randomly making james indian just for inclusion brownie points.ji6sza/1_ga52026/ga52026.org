For everyone who haven't seen fics of this, there's a lot more fanart of it than fanfiction. Bi-racial!Harry is all over tumblr. I've only seen one fic where Harry being bi-racial was major plot point and it wasn't very good and I'd link it but I don't remember the name or where I read it.

Also, I think the reason people consistently make him indian is because everyone else made him indian so they have to as well lol
