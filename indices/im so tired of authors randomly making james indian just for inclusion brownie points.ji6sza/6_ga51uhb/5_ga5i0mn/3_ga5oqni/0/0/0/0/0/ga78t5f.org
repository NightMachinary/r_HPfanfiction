We're not talking about James.

We're talking about the idea of Anglicising immigrant names.

I'm telling you that /idea/ should really be called Americanisation *because* it has no association with immigration to the UK. That when people think of the idea, what they think about is a particularly American experience of immigration.

So... now we bring this to James. Say his parents or grandparents or whatever are really Patars. Is it likely they would have been Anglicised to Potter? No. Is it a reasonable suspicion? Not really. Conclusion?

  If "Patar" is really how this began, it's strange
