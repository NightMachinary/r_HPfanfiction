The changing of names to something more "anglophone" happens in the UK too. I have two friends with Polish heritage and they both have names that are an English-friendly version of the Polish. It's very common amongst people with Eastern European heritage, and also people with Jewish heritage. It isn't common /any longer,/ but for people whos families settled in the UK generations ago, it happened. It is, however, not massively common among Indian or Pakistani immigrants and never was, but it did happen. Although in my experience people from those cultures were more likely to Anglicise their given name not surname.
