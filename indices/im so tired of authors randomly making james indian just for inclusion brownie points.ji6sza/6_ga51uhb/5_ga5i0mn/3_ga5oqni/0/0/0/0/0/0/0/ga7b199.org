  Why would the ANGLICISATION of Patar not be likely? Why is this not a reasonable assumption? Don't tell me, prove it.

Because the idea it's drawing on isn't associated with immigration to the UK (but IS associated with immigration to the US). Because you'll struggle to find examples of it. Because Anglicisation of Indian surnames isn't really a Thing.

You've spent this entire conversation not bothering to listen to what I'm saying and we've literally come back to where we were before I even met you. Life is too short for this shit. Stop wasting my time.
