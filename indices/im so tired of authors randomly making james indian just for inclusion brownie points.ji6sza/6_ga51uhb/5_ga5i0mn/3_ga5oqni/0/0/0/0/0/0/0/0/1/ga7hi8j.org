Go on... search it.

Try and find the examples. [[https://historum.com/threads/angelized-indian-surnames.112909/][I got this.]] And the claim there is mostly Europeanisation. And one other link which this computer isn't turning up that was about, basically, "secret Indian ancestors". [[https://engrave.in/blog/naming-matters-indian-surnames-starting-with-b-and-their-meanings/][On this computer you also find this.]] Notice how none of these are about /immigration/?

Now... what happens when you try to see where the idea of Anglicising immigrant names comes up? Well, firstly, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicisation_of_names#Immigration_to_English-speaking_countries][you get Wikipedia.]] What do we notice? Bach and a reference to the UK... before the article immediately talks about the US. And it's only Bach and that US context which have citations. The rest of the links that come up here are, again, mostly centred in the US (and Canada, interestingly enough). I'd also argue there's a bias towards first names which is a completely different story (just ask our friend Bach).

You're too lazy to do any work yourself, that's the only problem here.
