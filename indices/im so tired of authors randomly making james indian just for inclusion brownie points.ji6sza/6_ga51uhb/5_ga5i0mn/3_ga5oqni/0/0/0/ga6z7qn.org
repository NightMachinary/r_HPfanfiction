Are you serious?

The Anglicisation of immigrant names is a massive trope (with surprisingly limited evidence) of immigration to the United States. The association is very real... in a way that isn't for immigration to the UK... even if the factual basis is murkier.

If you want to look at an Anglicisation of "Patar" becoming "Potter" as a likely origin of the Indian James Hypothesis, it'd be useful if it could be established that this kind of Anglicisation (i.e. for Indian names of Indian immigrants to the UK) was common. It isn't. It barely even appears to be rare. The wider concept (Anglicising immigrant names for British immigrants) similarly doesn't appear to be common. There's even limited evidence of the Anglicisation of Indian names for people (cf places) under Company Rule and the Raj. Hence:

  If "Patar" is really how this began, it's strange.

You don't have to say:

Because that's what we're already talking about to start with.
