Jesus, guys, this was laid out in no uncertain terms:

#+begin_quote
  Secondly, the Anglicisation of immigrant names is, in my experience, probably better called the Americanisation of names.
#+end_quote

i.e. the whole process you're thinking of, in my experience, isn't associated with immigration in general... but, instead, with a very, very specific kind of immigration.

You're not even talking about immigration:

#+begin_quote
  As someone who's own name is spelt inconsistently because of British colonialists
#+end_quote

whereas I... and the suggestion I was investigating... are.

What happened to your name in a different context isn't really a guide to the context we're talking about (because it's different); although, I suspect the two examples I found of Anglicising (technically one was only claimed to be Europeanisation) Indian peoples' names (as opposed to place names) were rooted in emigration of others than immigration. Similarly, Romanisation (the conversion of words from non Latin to Latin scripts) /isn't/ the same as Anglicisation.
