Why is it Americanisation rather than Anglicisation when this would have happened in an Anglo context? I don't get it, Americans aren't the only ones that have erased culture and acted awfully in the past. As someone who's own name is spelt inconsistently because of British colonialists (no Americans here!), it is VERY real that names get Anglicised. Regardless of whether you can recognise it as Anglicised, or if it's simply been accepted as the norm by now, doesn't negate the fact that people's own identities were made to fix boxes (sometimes literally, when the Brits came by to conduct a census of their empire and wanted to translate a spoken name into neat Latin alphabets so they could write it in their convenient forms and boxes).
