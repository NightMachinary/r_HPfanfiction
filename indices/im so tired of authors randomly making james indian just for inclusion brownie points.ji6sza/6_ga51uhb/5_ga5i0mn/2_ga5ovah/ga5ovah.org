So, I think this may partly be a difference between editions causing our different views. The books I originally read actively didn't point out race, whereas the US editions took pains to specify that e.g. Angelina and Dean were Black children. (I actually headcanoned Angelina otherwise as a kid!)

Similarly on Anglicisation vs Americanisation - the American settlers were the same group of colonisers with the same approach. Anglicizing things in other languages or assigning new names was endemic in the British empire - and likewise for other empires, to own and standardize. Some examples of Indian names specifically on wiki: [[https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_surnames_from_India]]. Anglicization would include bringing nonstandard spellings down to one single standard. For a prominent and well-known example...the characters from the Bible. 'Mary' and 'Joseph' weren't running around on the other side of the planet from Europe 2k years ago; those are revisionings of their names to suit an English-language audience.

Fair point about Marge, but my intention was to explain the history, rather than to passionately advocate for it. In my view the entire appeal of fanfiction is that there is no 'one truth', and everything's up for interpretation. Maybe Marge was herself dating a POC and so had a single exception in her prejudice box. Maybe the Dursleys had an Indian or South Asian relative and Vernon didn't know, or knew and was ashamed, which manifested in him as prejudice and not in Marge. Etc. Once we get into hypotheticals which are up for explanation either way, you really can go all out with where you take how it's explained, without necessarily contradicting canon where it itself hasn't specified.

Which kinda brings me to the main thrust that as others have mentioned in the thread, the driving force behind fanfiction for a lot of authors is 'filling in the blanks', or exploring 'what if'. For an increasing number of people, that what if is questioning /why/ so many characters in so much of what we consume are not-white, or not-majority, /only/ when it's directly relevant to the story, or as a token character. And the entry point is 'what if' that wasn't the case - because it has no need to be. And especially in fandoms like this where there's not much new canon info coming - and where the creator is in hot water - I think as a fresh approach that has a lot of appeal.
