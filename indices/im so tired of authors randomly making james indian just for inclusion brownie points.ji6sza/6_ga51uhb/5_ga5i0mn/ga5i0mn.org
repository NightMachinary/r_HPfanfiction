  In my experience I've seen it stemming from the headcanon (prior to Pottermore releasing etc.) that 'Potter' could be an Anglicisation of 'Pata

That's a weird one.

Firstly, in my personal experience, the Anglicisation of Indian names just isn't a Thing.

Secondly, the Anglicisation of immigrant names is, in my experience, probably better called the Americanisation of names.

Thirdly, it was very difficult to find evidence counter to my anecdotes. It doesn't seem commonplace.Don't get me wrong... it's out there but it doesn't seem common.

Fourthly, you'd think it'd come up in a series about a character obsessed with his father, with relatives (and relative adjacent characters, i.e. Marge) that appear to take every opportunity to belittle Harry's parents /and/ where some of the very, very few pupils Harry deigns to notice are (of) Indian (extraction) that Harry's background is mixed. Also, I'd personally go as far as to argue that canon is at pains to point out skin colours and other markers of difference.

If "Patar" is really how this began, it's strange. But, then again, I must admit I thought this was basically a fanart exclusive trope whereas apparently it's common in fanfiction too.
