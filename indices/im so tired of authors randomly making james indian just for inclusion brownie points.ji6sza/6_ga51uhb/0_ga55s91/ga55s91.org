100% agree with you, and your understanding of fanon history aligns with what I've heard and seen from tumblr communities etc as well.

To add, I think it also caught on more in the fan art domain because there, it IS a conscious choice to decide what colour and tone to paint someone's skin. And I appreciate that artists, when confronted with that choice in literally every work they produce, do take a step back and think hold on, why is the usual range of skin tones so limited? Was this ever stated in Canon, or has everyone just been assuming? The “default” colour being a white-presenting skin tone is harmful in itself, and it's good people who most directly interact with that have also been critical of such assumptions.

It's understandable of course that we're having a different discussion now about whether it's okay to port over those lines of questioning to fanfic, and whether doing so dilutes the intention behind fan artists making Harry not-white because it may be less an active subversive choice and more an instance of tokenism or virtue signalling.
