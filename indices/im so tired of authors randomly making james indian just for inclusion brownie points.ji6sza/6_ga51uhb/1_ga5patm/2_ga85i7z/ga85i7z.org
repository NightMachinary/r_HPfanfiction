I love love love diversity in fanfic, but it's starting to get painful when it is /badly written/ rep. As someone who is Indian, I really don't like reading a fanfic and feeling like this is a fun gimmick for someone. I think the Gordon Ramsey fic and Of a Linear circle are good examples of integrating diversity done well, where as fics like Survival is a skill are.... a bit more rough (In my opinion! I'm sure other Tamil people would disagree, but I found that part painful).
