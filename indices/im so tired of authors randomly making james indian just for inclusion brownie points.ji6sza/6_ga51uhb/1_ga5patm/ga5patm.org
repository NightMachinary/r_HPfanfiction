i don't get why people hate characters having different races or sexualities on this sub. like sorry can't people enjoy diversity. Crammers is one of my favourites of all time and we have desi and bi harry, black hermione, gay draco, and lesbian ocs (the greatest ocs to ever exist by the way) and you cannot fault the story for any of it.
