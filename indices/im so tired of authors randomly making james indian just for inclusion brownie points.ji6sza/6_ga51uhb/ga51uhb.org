Boy, I sure do love when race and gender are brought up on this sub!

In my experience I've seen it stemming from the headcanon (prior to Pottermore releasing etc.) that 'Potter' could be an Anglicisation of 'Patar', as well as the fact that British Indians are one of the largest minority ethnic groups in the UK. Iirc it also cropped up in some stories as an explanation for why the Dursleys were /actually/ embarrassed by and ashamed of Harry and why there were no pictures of him in the house/why Petunia was ashamed of Lily, for marrying 'outside of normality but also /outside her race/.

Since the headcanon first came up, this spurred a lot of fanart, and since then JKR (before her latest turn to extremity), who was still broadly popular with fans, openly came out in favor of colorblind casting with the casting of a black actress as Hermione in the Cursed Child play, and as such her kids being biracial.

That along with the fact there's no concrete evidence in the books of Harry being a white child; along with people in general liking to imagine diversity into books where it's not there, especially in the fanfiction community (this was literally one of the key purposes and appeals of fanfiction back in the day, when published fiction was limited in what could be shown by gatekeeping publishers), led to the creation of a lot more stories and fanworks (art, poems etc.) in which that was Harry's background.

As with many things in fanfiction and fanon in general, when something becomes popular it cascades out to inspire a lot of supporting works. This is just one way that one person, or a group of people's headcanons went, and others were inspired by it. I don't really agree with you, OP, that authors are going out of their way to artificially insert a brown character into their works that they are doing for free, for their own entertainment and the entertainment of others, in order to do some virtue signalling or whatever. I can see where you might be reading that in, because it is done in a lot of media where there's profit involved etc., but I can't personally see the benefit here for authors and so I think it's more likely to be innocent, or to come from authors who have joined the fandom through a path in which they thought that portrayal was the default.

E: Are we really downvoting an informative history post, folks?
