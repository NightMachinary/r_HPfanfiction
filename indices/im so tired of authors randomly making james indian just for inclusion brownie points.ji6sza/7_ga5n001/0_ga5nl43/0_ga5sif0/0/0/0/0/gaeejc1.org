His family is said to be old and pureblood.

Look, if Harry had Indian heritage, JK would've commented, canonically, he's from an old British family and his mother is a green eyed red head.

He's white. A Britsh white.

If people want to change that in their stories, then that's ok, that's what fanfiction is for, but canon Harry is white, he has a pale face and green eyes. Like Tom Hiddleston.
