I've seen this complaint before, even if I've never seen it myself in fics (I avoid Jily fics, which is like 90% of fics with a major James focus, so...).

My assumption is that this is much less a matter of forced inclusivity (which I agree is bad), but more of a general fanon thing that some adopt. Maybe there was once a really popular fic that had this, and others adopted it into their own headcanon, ultimately affecting things they write? Of course, it's entirely possible that the /original/ source material for this idea did it for the purpose of forced inclusivity, but I highly doubt others that took after it did the same.

I think a better approach to this is to, instead of complaining about it on Reddit (which is unlikely to have much of an effect), add comments on the fics themselves explaining your issues with the portrayal. I don't think authors mean anything bad with it, they're just lacking in knowledge.
