Some of it is definitely the large presence of brown Asians in the UK, along with a very loose understanding of British colonialism lol. I don't necessarily mind it, I did a whole improv explanation on why Ferdinand Kingsley was my fancast for a post-war movie. I /would/ think it was a little weird if they dropped in that Harry was a little bit Chinese and then continuing on with their story so I get your trepidation. I would also hasten to say that it's not cool to say it's just for brownie points. Most fanfiction is self-insert, after all, so it's likely brown/part-brown authors/artists folding it in after basically giving the go-ahead after black Hermione.

That being said, I think I've only ever seen it in fanart and I haven't come across Pakistani Harry yet lol.
