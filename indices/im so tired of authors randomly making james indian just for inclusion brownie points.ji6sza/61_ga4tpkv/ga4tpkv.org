Or you could just not read it. There are 825k HP fanfics on fanfiction.com alone, I don't believe there are more than 1000 where James Potter is Indian. Why complain about fanfics that can easily be ignored? If some people want to be more included let them be.

I don't care about Indian James one way or another, but I find it silly to complain about the existence of such a niche trope.
