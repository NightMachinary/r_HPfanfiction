On the same note, there's recently been a Muslim Lily and James fandom going around, and as a Muslim, it's obviously /not/ being written by people who know the religion. There's just no way in hell that Harry had a godfather and yet had Muslim parents. No such thing as godparents in Islam. Not a single mention of it. I also cringe whenever I see James getting his Eidi....from Sirius? Man that's just for the elders to give, like please do your research before you try to earn some diversity points. It just doesn't fit into the story and I'd rather see your typical white Lily and James rather than just a very skewed perception of Muslims in general. Also religion just doesn't fit into the Harry Potter universe, whether it be Islam or Christianity or Judaism.

On the same note, the Shafiq family could be either Arab or maybe of Desi origin, maybe somebody could toy with that rather than making Lily and James brown so Harry could be exotic. But all I see is Margot Robbie being cast in a Shafiq role...this is Seraphina Shafiq and she's German -
