Not sure about the Indian Harry, though I personally like the trope. Each to their own, though, I suppose.\\
But for my own fic, I have black Hermione and am contemplating making Harry something else other than the technically canon white.\\
I do, however, have reasons for this. It's a muggle fic(sue me, the idea was fun and I think I'll enjoy writing it when I get around to it) and deals with hate crimes. Tommy R. is a gang leader who goes by the street name of Voldemort. James was investigating Voldie, so he and his family were attacked. Lily, unfortunately, died from her injuries. James, however, was saved, and instead is in a coma. Has been for 15 years(again, fucking sue me). Harry lives with Sirius and Remus who are dating. And, here's a spoiler which I can't help but write. Read at your own risk. Sirius suffers from cancer and is dying, he dies around the begining if third act, ending of second act, Iâ€˜m not exactly sure how it'll pan out when it's written, you know how it is.
