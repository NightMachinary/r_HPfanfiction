To my knowledge it's because of a post about Indian!Harry made by a South Asian fan that blew up on tumblr a while back and the subsequent fanart that was attached to the post. Some more popular users made fanart, and so the headcanon spread. But yeah, I wish white fans wouldn't be... Like That about it. It's like, they want to get the progressive points for writing about a character of color, but they don't actually care about canon characters of color, so they split the difference and throw in some stereotypes and mention brown skin in one description. As a Persian, I do enjoy seeing thoughtful fics/art that explore the possibility of Harry being mixed race, though. He was always my favorite character and when it's written well, it's a nice point of connection.
