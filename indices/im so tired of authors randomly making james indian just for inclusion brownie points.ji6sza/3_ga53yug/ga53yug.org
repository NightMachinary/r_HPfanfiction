Why Indian? Idk. Why Daphne Greengrass? I think it probably developed like any trope: someone wrote an Indian James Potter at some point, people read it and liked the idea, so they used it themselves, and it spread within a subsection of the fandom, so the idea of an Indian James Potter becomes widespread and unsurprising if incorporated.

While POC James isn't /literally/ always Indian, he practically is. I've seen a whole one fic with a black James Potter. That's part of why I think it's a trope/headcanon that people see used and use themselves, rather than authors just including a POC character to "be seen as progressive." I think we'd see a lot more diversity if that was the case.

I'm a firm believer that tropes in general aren't inherently bad or uncreative. I'm also a firm believer that there shouldn't need to be a /reason/ for a character to be a certain ethnicity, or for an author to make a change to canon. But whether a character's ethnicity being changed (or just not assumed to be white; is James's race explicitly stated in the text of the books?) being a /trope/ is a good or bad thing...I don't feel qualified to answer.

As for the shit research? At least in the case of white US authors, I'm not surprised, considering our typical level of education about and interest in literally anyone besides white people in America. That sucks. I'm sorry.
