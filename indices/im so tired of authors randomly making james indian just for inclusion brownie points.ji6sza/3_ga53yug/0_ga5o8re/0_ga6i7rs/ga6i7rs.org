  That I don't like with diversity!fic is that they erased the likely experience of characters.

This is such a fine line to walk, IMO. I'm white but a woman and LGBTQ, and I never want to read about anti-gay rhetoric, bigotry, or violence. I also never want to read about sexual violence against women (or men, but I relate to that far less, for obvious reasons). I /know/ that these things exist in the real world, to a frightening degree. I don't want to read about them or watch them happen on tv in my spare time, I just don't - especially in fic, where these things often aren't written with the most care.

So I can 1000% understand other people not wanting to include racial violence in their fics, esp when all signs point to very little or no racism in the wizarding world in canon. There is a good argument that this is erasure of an important part of being a nonwhite or non cishet person, though.
