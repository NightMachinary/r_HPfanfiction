The thing is, it feels like erasure to have characters (especially POC muggleborn characters) be dealing with bigotry in the wizarding world and not bring in their experiences outside the wizatding world. It doesn't have to be violence, but like -- do we really think a black Hermione would have been unaware of bigotry and slurs, etc until she came to Hogwarts. If you want to write a POC character and have a plot that interacts with these themes, you have to do the work. Not just let the characterization be skin deep.
