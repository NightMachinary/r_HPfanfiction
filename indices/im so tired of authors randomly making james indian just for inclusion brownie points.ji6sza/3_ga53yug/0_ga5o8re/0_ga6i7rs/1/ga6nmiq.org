I do understand that you want to be free of all those worries when you go to your hobby and relax to read fanfiction. And really, to be more nuanced, it's a case-on-case basis.

There's fanfiction with no bigotry and everything is perfect (at least on that part), and I'm fine with it. I

There's other fanfictions where it doesn't feel right. The story and the characterization didn't fit in a world with 0 bigotry. Especially when author use characters to make some needed points. But how a character would be so (rightfully) angry about racism in a world where racism doesn't exist ?

Unfortunately, I encounter more of the second kind than the first. And this is why as a whole, I don't like the genre/trope or whatever you want to call it. Of course there's gems. Bigotery-free fanfictions that avoid to have their characters influenced by being victims of racism. And some with bigotry that impact the characters.
