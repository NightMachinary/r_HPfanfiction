That I don't like with diversity!fic is that they erased the likely experience of characters.

That is true for races, sexual orientations, transgenderism and everything else.

I know people want to read fluff and comforting stuff, but I can believe a non cishet or non white character in the 80s and 90s in a predominant white country did not face some bigotry at some point.

And even in slash fanfictions, you rarely see it.
