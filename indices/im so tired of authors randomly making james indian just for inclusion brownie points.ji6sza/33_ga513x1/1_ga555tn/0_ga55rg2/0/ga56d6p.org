I don't want to dismiss your experience and perspective on British POC cultures, especially because I'm not necessarily the expert here and I've just spent a short few years in London (which I admit is more diverse and multicultural than the rest of the UK). So I'm happy to agree to disagree here, and don't mean to be combative ðŸ˜…

However, from my experience with black and biracial friends (and maybe this is a skewed sample size here lol), I have seen a lot of concern and community mobilisation against racism in the UK, and specifically a lot of revival of Black history (including Black History Month which was a big thing in Uni). There's tons of community solidarity and affirmative action with regards to the BME/BAME communities (Black and Minority Ethnicities, and Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnicities respectively).

I defo agree with you it can be lazy writing to have Hermione's primary motivation behind the House Elves issue to come from her racial background. 100%! People can be such complex and moral beings, and I'd far prefer an exploration into Hermione's own character and morals, rather than just generalise on the basis of colour. That said, I do think IRL that minority communities can /sometimes/ be more primed to notice or read into such situations, and perhaps it might provide context for why Hermione even as a young child so quickly jumps to the conclusion that this is really terrible oppression regardless of what the Elves themselves say. I just wish authors would use this to add to the richness of her background and perspective, rather than use lazy generalisations to simplify and dilute her character.

Good discussion though, sorry this got too long! I'm having a lot of fun dissecting this up and down the thread haha.
