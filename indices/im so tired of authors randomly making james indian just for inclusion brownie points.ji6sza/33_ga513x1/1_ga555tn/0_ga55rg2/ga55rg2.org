Indian Lily is adopted from what I usually see. I don't think I've ever seen a biracial Lily, it seems people just give up on the hair. Black Hermione and House Elf rights is actually what I'd usually consider an example of poor writing, because it shows very heavy-handed Americanisms and a lack of research. Historically, Britain hasn't had a huge amount of racism against blacks, especially not the kind that US faces. I'm not saying that there isn't any, there certainly has been a hatred against Afro-Carribeans in particular since the 1950s, but that shared connection to slavery is much weaker. To justify Hermione's empathy with House Elves as a result of being black seems very tenuous, I think her just being a naturally moral person is much better writing.
