I guess I should clarify what I mean by "meaningful". I just want it to affect the story or his character in some way, even if it's tiny. There's loads of POC!Harry stories where I don't even realise they're POC until a single line mentioning skin colour, and then back to nothing different. At that point it seems like just checking off boxes for brownie points. The implication that everything else will be just the same, that it's just a palette swap, breaks my SoD.
