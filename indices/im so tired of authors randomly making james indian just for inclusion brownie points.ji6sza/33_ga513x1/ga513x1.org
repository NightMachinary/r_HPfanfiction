I've seen some Indian Lilys too. I don't really mind if people change the ethnicity of a character, but it has to be meaningful. Indian Harry that has nothing different is so meaningless. At least Black Hermione authors tie it in with House Elf rights, even if it's hilariously off the mark in regards to the racism occuring at that time.
