There's also the drawings she did of the students on her private webpage, with Dean Thomas being very clearly black and Hermione very clearly not being black. Honestly I heard the black actress killed her Hermione part and I find that awesome, but we all know JKR didn't envision Hermione as black and her pretending to say she could have been black is what really gets me.
