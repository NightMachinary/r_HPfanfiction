I'm from the UK too, and you're absolutely right.

It would have been mentioned at the very least.

Although that's why I read fan-fiction, for twists, or new plots on the Harry Potter world.

If I can read a fan fic where Hedwig gets off with the giant squid, then I can read and enjoy a fic where the Potters are Indian.
