On the other hand, careless racism from Vernon would be the extra special awful sprinkles on top of Dursley general awfulness.

Petunia takes Harry in because Dumbledore scared the bejesus out of her. Vernon is...Vernon, but this is the one thing where she stands her ground and insists the kid stay rather than letting him bluster and have his own way. Harry never knows she does this, as she never actually *stops* Vernon from vomiting up whatever he's thinking where Harry can hear her, but Petunia holds her ground.

It has the potential to be interesting, at least. In the right hands.
