I have stumble accross a fanfiction where Harry wasn't white, and Vernon had some nasty stuff to say about it.

I quit that fanfiction because it wasn't good, otherwise. But they made an effort to include how it would have been for a non-white kid to grow up in a very white very "normal" neighborhood in the 80s.
