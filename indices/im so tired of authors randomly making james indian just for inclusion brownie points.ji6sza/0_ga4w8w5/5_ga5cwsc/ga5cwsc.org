I didn't like the idea at first but after thinking about it some more and reading these fics I've come to really love it.

This one has an indian Harry as far as I remember it's a Drarry Dimension Travel AU. Harry meets his father and learns more about his heritage and stuff. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6854605][The Devil's White Knight]]

This is quite long (like 367 k so I'm not done yet) and also Drarry. In here Harry wears Indian clothing to the Yule ball because the Patil twins ask him to. He also starts to learn Tamil together with his friends because he wants to be closer to his roots. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12006417/chapters/27167826][survival is a talent]]
