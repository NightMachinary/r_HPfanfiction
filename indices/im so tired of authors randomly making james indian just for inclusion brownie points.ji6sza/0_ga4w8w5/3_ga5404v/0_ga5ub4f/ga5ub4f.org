That was the first time I've seen Indian Harry. I liked the idea! It's not like it takes away from the story to have Harry be Indian and adding representation is nice. Maybe I'm a little biased because my husband is Indian and we'll have half Indian kiddos someday, and it's nice to think that they'll have characters who look like them in books, movies, etc. 🤷‍♀️
