It seems to be a big deal on Ao3, though I never saw it at all on ff.net. Im working through the top rated fics on Ao3 right now and atleast 30% of stories have harry as indian. No explanation or AU reason, just characters mentioning "his brown skin" and nothing else changing because of it. Sometimes a throwaway line is used to mention his family actually being from india and then its forgotten.

Did read one fic where bloodlines were intergral to the plot and his ancestors were from India.

Edit: recc for those who asked
