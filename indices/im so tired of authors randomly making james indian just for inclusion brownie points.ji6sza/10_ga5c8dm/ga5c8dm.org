I doubt anyone is getting inclusion brownie points for making any character in Harry Potter a different race considering the amount of hate I always see in the comments of a POC!Harry or POC!Hermione fic. I know of one writer that explicitly makes Hermione black and the writer is black themselves, I believe that this is the case for most writers that give the characters a non-white background to be honest. Just a wish to support their own communities in the little way they can. I've seen Harry being black, indian, pakistani, bengali and chinese so indian is definitely not the default background.

I would love to see some more care around writing of course, but to dismiss real brown writers with stereotyping is dangerous considering they're most likely drawing from lived experience. I am a terrible writer so I am still waiting for someone to write a fic centered around Beauxbatons that doesn't have just blonde white girls as their students (considering my background is from one of the plethora of countries that France has colonized). I would love to see a shift away from eurocentricism anyway and have other forms of magic be the focus in a story. Even how colonialism played a role in international wizarding relations. Or how the divide of dark magic and light magic is cultural and maybe how certain forms of magic are more prized in other places. Even about other genealogical abilities, like parseltongue in Britain.
