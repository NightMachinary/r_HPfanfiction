I've read a quite well-written fic in which Draco was Black, I've been searching in my bookmarks for it for the past 20 minutes but I think it might be deleted I'm not sure :(

I don't read a lot of ron-centric stories so I'm not sure if it is a thing to change his race in fic

As for Voldemort I've never found a fic in which he was non-white.
