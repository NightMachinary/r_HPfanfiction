Personally I don't find it that interesting, but that's mostly because I think there's then a way cooler story in there than the retelling of Harry Potter, for instance if James is half Indian the story of how his parents met would interest me. I'd see it as one of them is visiting India and seeing all sorts of different magic and culture as well as time, basically a whole new setting to explore and seeing how someone would approach magical India would actually be intriguing.

Is it the same as the muggle world? Is it different in that it never got colonised? What are the magical creatures like there? I'd picture it as one of them being an explorer and meeting the other, having adventures and falling in love.
