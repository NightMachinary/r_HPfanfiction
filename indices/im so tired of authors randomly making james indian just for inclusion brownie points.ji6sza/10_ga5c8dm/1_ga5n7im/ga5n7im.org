  Even how colonialism played a role in international wizarding relations. Or how the divide of dark magic and light magic is cultural and maybe how certain forms of magic are more prized in other places. Even about other genealogical abilities, like parseltongue in Britain.

This!! Inverarity did an incredible job with his Alexandra Quick series in creating a believable American society of wizards. He included a history of Native American wizards as well, and several ethnic communities known to live in America in the muggle world.

I really feel that this is something the original Harry Potter lacks.\\
Setting a fic in a different country or exploring international relationships would be a great opportunity to explore new and layered topics.

There are a few ethnically black, Chinese and Indian purebloods in Britain during Harry Potters time, but nothing is explained about their heritage at all.
