I highly recommend it. Inverarity is great at world building, and mirrors aspects of American society in his later stories well.

It's incredibly difficult to achieve this in a fantasy setting, especially one based on a real country. I personally don't think I'd be able to do it for my own country.

It doesn't just take a good world builder and writer, but also a perspective on society at large and its workings.
