"Yes, it's nice to be 'progressive' and 'inclusive'. Good on them. But it's annoying when it becomes forced and spills over into sensationalism -- which often leads to what people eventually call Social Justice Warriors (SJW).

There's also a fine line between being genuinely inclusive/progressive and just doing it for 'brownie points' as you said, or using different ethnicities, etc. as token characters to attract attention.

Some people might even accuse others of using progressivism and inclusivity to shield the work from criticism (this extends beyond fanfiction), as it may allow the defenders to hurl slurs like 'racist', 'sexist', 'misogynist', etc. at the critic."
