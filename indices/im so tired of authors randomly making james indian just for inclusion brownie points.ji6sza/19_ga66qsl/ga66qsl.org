I don't see any issue whatsoever with a creator of a fanwork wanting to change the race, gender, sexual orientation, etc in order to fit what they want to write, as long as they don't insist that their imagining of the character is canon.

In the Harry Potter series, the fact that Harry is canonically white is not intrinsic to his character.

As for why Indian, it's several things. One is that people with Indian (and the parts of Asia in the vicinity of India) ancestry are a visible minority in the UK, with an estimated little over 4% of the population. To put that in perspective for those the USA, the percentage of Black people in the US is estimated be around 13%, which is about three times larger than 4%.

Another is that many authors like to bring more diversity to their stories. There's nothing wrong with this as long as, as I said before, they don't try to claim that a character in canon is indubitably a specific race without clear textual evidence. Someone interpreting a character in a different way is totally fine, and believe me, Harry Potter fandom would be much more stuffy without the wonderful deluge of headcanons that people like to share.
