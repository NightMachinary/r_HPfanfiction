I haven't come across it in fanfic only art. But I do remember this headcanon getting big on Tumblr. Indian was just because Britain happens to have a large Indian population. Idk if the person who made that headcanon was Indian or not. But tbh apart from maybe when he's with the Durselys it changes 0% of the story if James was Indian for the fancomics ive seen. So I mean its fine by me. I'd be more frustrated if I saw them include Indian stereotypes to be like look I did a Indian character guys ( am also indian)
