I have a morbid curiosity about the bad ones lol. I see a fair amount of black Hermione, especially in fan art, which I do enjoy. I am a black woman myself, so maybe we're just more drawn to things we see ourselves in. I've never seen any really questionable portrayals though, it's usually just a minor detail.
