Depends on what you read. One of the current top fics by kudos involves it. I think it's 7th? It's not every fic, but it's becoming its own trope.

It might also just be more obtrusive to those of us of desi background lol. Even small mentions are like flashing neon lights bc the good rep is lovely but the not great is.... not great.

Happy to link a couple.
