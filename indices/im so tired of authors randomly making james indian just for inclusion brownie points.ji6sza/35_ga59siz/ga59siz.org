I don't see what the problem is. Nobody actually cares about "inclusiveness brownie points" except batshit conservatives who see "white genocide" behind every corner.

So what if Harry is biracial? So what if Hermione is black? Why does it matter if it's not explicitly racist? It would be one thing if Harry were described as a stereotypical indian despite living in england all his life, but the fact that you're offended by stories that just... change that single fact is concerning.

Like, humanity aren't just all white people with a few underprivileged minorities present in the background. It might seem like that in american and european media, but that's not actually what populations are like, in britain especially, on account of the former british empire.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with being inclusive in stories.
