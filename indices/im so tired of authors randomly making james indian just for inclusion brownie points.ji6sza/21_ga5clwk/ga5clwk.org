I /think/ making Harry Indian was based on an off-hand comment by J.K. Rowling, where she said something along the lines of "Harry's background was mostly meant as a blank slate, you can give him Indian heritage if that's what you identify with as a reader". Can't find the quote anymore, though, so I'm not entirely sure.

This would have obviously been before Pottermore and associated lore-dumps fleshed things out a lot (sometimes unnecessarily or poorly so - hello wizards shitting on the floor and Vanishing the evidence).
