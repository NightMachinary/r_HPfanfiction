Pakistan and India didn't really exist until Independence. The subcontinent is better compared to Europe than to France, Spain or Poland. I guess Italy and Germany make fair comparisons too. Which is to say... there were periods where different polities were in ascendancy, with fluctuating sizes and various predecessor states before the East India Company took over (and was then relieved of command after the Mutiny and thus began the Raj).

But the simple answer is... yes, that is correct. Partition and Independence happened in the 1940s.
