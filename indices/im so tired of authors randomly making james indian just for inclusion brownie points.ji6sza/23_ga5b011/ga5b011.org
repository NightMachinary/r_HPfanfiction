I've...never actually seen this. I find the concept interesting though if done right. You got any decent stories about this. Doesn't have to be Indian, i'm happy with any ethnicity really. It'd be interesting to see how a predominantly white, magical race in the 90's stuck back in the 1880's(at least fashion, and Government wise) would react to their saviour being African American/Australian/Europeon/etc, Asian, African, Indian, etc...
