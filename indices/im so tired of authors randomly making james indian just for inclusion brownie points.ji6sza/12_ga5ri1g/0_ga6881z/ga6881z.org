I mean people explore and travel, if you're writing the potters as a whole as an adventurous family with members going around the world discovering and seeing things then Harry having some mixed heritage makes perfect sense. My main problem with that would then be i'd want to read the cool stories from around the world!

The time his grandparents were honeymooning and attacked by a Nundu or something you know? The Magic of the rest of the world just seems more interesting to me than Harry in Hogwarts because well I suppose we've already seen that but there's a whole lot more out there.

Your version of Fleamont and Euphemia sound pretty cool!
