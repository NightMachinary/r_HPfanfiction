That sounds awesome. I'd read that story. I'd imagine them working out how to try and get him out would bring them closer together? With her doing a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of keeping him safe and clever thinking to aid this while everything is going on actually seems like an appealing setting. Wizarding adventures aplenty to be had!
