I originally settled on Euphemia being born in Singapore (Fleamont is solidly English stock, the Potters have been in England *forever*) because the two of them are about the right age for the Second World War. They were on the older side when James was born in the late 50s/early 60s, so imagining twenty years before works out. The fall of Singapore in 1942 marked a sudden, abrupt collapse of what had, until then, seemed like an unassailable British fortress in the East. Rock solid, until it suddenly wasn't.

I know wizards generally ignore whatever the Muggles are up to, but I'm not sure even wizards are insular enough to ignore a *literal invading army*!

How would the British ministry have coped with the collapse of British presence there in general, a hurried evacuation which they'd somehow have to get any resident British wizards into without letting on they were wizards (a white dude left behind in Singapore would not have a good time after that, wizard or no) or all the rest of it?

That's *fascinating*. So I imagined someone there to see it.
