I have a version of James in my head who is partially Chinese. I had fun imagining Fleamont and Euphemia (maiden name, Euphemia Lau) bumming around Singapore in the 30s, so I ran with it. I'm not so attached to the idea that I can't write him any other way - I can and have written him differently - but I enjoy playing with it.

The British Empire was so big, for so long...they had half the world at one point, and it's fun imagining what wizards might have done in it or how they interacted with it. Whether that's a wizarding enclave in Hong Kong or Singapore, or Anglo-Indian Ministry attach√© shenanigans in the Raj government before independence/partition, or a witness to the Balfour thing in the Middle East...

That's fun. It makes the world feel a bit bigger, and I like that.

If I was going to do Indian James, it's totally [[https://c8.alamy.com/comp/HH2PPJ/jan-10-2017-ferdinand-kingsley-attending-cirque-du-soleil-amaluna-HH2PPJ.jpg][this guy]]. Ben Kingsley's son Ferdinand.
