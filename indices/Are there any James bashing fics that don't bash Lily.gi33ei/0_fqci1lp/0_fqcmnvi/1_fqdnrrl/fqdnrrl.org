WBWL and Indy!Harry fics typically has worse opinions on James than on Lily. Usually she doesn't really feature in the fic at all, but that'd probably be your best bet if looking for strictly James bashing as a non-Snily fan.

(Note that there does exist a couple of WBWL Snily, but just avoid those).

As I actually like the ship, I'm unable to give you any recommendations for specific fics. Sorry.
