In linkffn(The Fall of the House of Potter by Bobmin356), they both come under fire, but Lily is portrayed as a more sympathetic character than James.

I also remember reading a story in which Lily was upset because James was more-or-less giving the Potter fortune to Dumbledore to fund the Order of the Phoenix. I don't remember if she left him, or the title of the story, unfortunately.
