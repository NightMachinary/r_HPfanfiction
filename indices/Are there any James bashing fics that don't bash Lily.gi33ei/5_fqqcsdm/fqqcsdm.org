You'll find these sometimes in the WBWL trope. One of these is the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin series]] by sunmoonandstars (now orphaned/abandoned halfway through the 5th year fic), in which Lily isn't bashed because she didn't survive the attack.

Also often found in time-travel fics, because school-age James is canonically a jerk. One I read recently was The Scars of Time ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7007114/1/][Les Cicatrices du Temps]]) by ellana-san. I will warn you that it was written in French, and Google Translate is absolutely *horrid,* especially when it comes to male vs female pronouns.
