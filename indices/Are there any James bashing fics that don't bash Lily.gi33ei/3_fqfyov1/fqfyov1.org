Yup. There's some serious bashing of James in the one I'm gonna recommend. It's a really good one which truly develops and fleshes out known characters from the books (aka Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Frank Longbottom, Alice Longbottom, and Peter Pettigrew. They also give Regulus Black a really good redemption). Make sure to read "Forgive Me" first.
