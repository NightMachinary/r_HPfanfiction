Weekend with the Professor - [[http://www.ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=9160]]

Vanity - [[http://www.ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=12541]]

Everything listed above is COMPLETE! Some are funny, some are serious, most all are smutty. Yet Everything Stays the Same is amazing. I'm not ashamed to say I may have cried at the end. Vanity is also fantastic. It's basically HBP from Hermione's point of view. I will give you a heads up that For the Potion Master's Amusement is a BDSM heavy fic, but it is very well written. I know not everyone is into that sort of thing. I can also link fics that are in progress that are being updated frequently if anyone is interested. I know most prefer to find completed fics, I know I do!! =)

I will add more and links when I get to work!! All of these can be found on Ashwinder.sycophanthex.com.
