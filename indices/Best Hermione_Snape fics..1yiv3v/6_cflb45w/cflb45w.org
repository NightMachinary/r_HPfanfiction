This is my ship!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6578435/1/Post-Tenebras-Lux][Post Tenebras Lux]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7413926/1/Chasing-The-Sun][Chasing the Sun]] both by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1807393/Loten][Loten]] are amazing. PTL is 10 years post-DH and is a very believable Snape/Hermione more mature relationship.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374460/Aurette][Aurette]] has some good ones, especially [Hermione Granger and the Crystal of Time]. ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7948797/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Crystal-of-Time]])

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewuser.php?uid=89884][Teddy Radiator]] especially her story, Lay Me Low.

The Phoenix Trilogy by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1760628/grangerous][Grangerous]]. This series starts with the Half-Blood Prince and follows the canon story closely until the end of DH where she branches off with her own story.

Other favorite authors:

[[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewuser.php?uid=216][Subversa]] especially her stories This Time, and For Hogwarts: A Regency Gamble

[[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewuser.php?uid=4896][Little Beloved]] especially her story, Denial.

[[http://thepetulantpoetess.com/viewuser.php?uid=31031][Proulxes]] especially her story, Anima Mea.

There are tons more, but this is what I can remember off the top of my head! Also check out [[http://thepetulantpoetess.com/index.php][The Petulant Poetess]] and [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/][Ashwinder]] for more HG/SS stories.
