Noticed this the other day while looking for new stories to read and I sort of dismissed it because it seemed too AU, but after reading it I am highly intrigued and can't wait for the next chapter.

The only thing that I dislike is use of language in it, I hardly get the feeling it is set in Britain. It may be a minor thing but in the first chapter when Hermione said "fucking" I nearly stopped reading it because no matter how AU a story is I doubt she would ever curse so casually.
