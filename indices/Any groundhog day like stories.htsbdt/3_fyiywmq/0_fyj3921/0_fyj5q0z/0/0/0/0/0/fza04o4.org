Errr ya I should have been more clear. I meant any type of fanfiction, and any type of genre in said fanfiction. One that comes to mind is buffys (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) transaction from hell for the mummy hand.

But my main thought was hp content because that's most of the fanfiction I personally read.
