I agree that genre is normally what you say. I think I kind of short-circuited my thought process in my last response.

Personally, I don't differentiate between one-shots and longer stories as necessarily different types (short stories, novellas, and novels are, to some extent, arbitrary distinctions), and I don't run across poems and songfics often enough in fanfiction for me to think of them, normally.
