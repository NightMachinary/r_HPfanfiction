If you happen to be able to read in french, I have something for you. Now that you mention it, it's the only fic where I've seen elemental bending... But damn, Theodore Nott destroying a vampire via friction-induced lightning strike might have been the best fight scene I've ever read !

linkffn(Le clan Talos)

Fair warning : all Slytherins are pretty ooc, and I just slipped every romance/sex scene because I couldn't stand the pairings. But the fiiiiiights... And the worldbuilding...
