linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) and sequels have Gryffindor Draco who hangs out with Golden Trio to the chagrin of Lucius. But its also incredibly stupid, with writer introducing plot devices then ignoring their existence when they should come in play, also forcing plot into rehashing canon even when this makes zero sense.
