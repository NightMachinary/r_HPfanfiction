It would likely come down to Dumbledore. If, for whatever reason, he felt it was better for Harry to go back to the muggle world during summers to get away from the insanity that happens in the WW, I could see Harry being handled by child services.

However, you'd imagine if Hermione found out that Harry was to be shipped off to a group home or something, she'd beg her parents to take him in for summers, especially considering he could pay them for expenses and they seem to be fairly well off anyway. Hermione would want to do it for Harry, but also for herself, since having him there would mean she would feel less isolated from the WW during summers.

This situation could cause conflict between Harry and Hermione, Harry and Ron, or both. Hermione because they'd be spending all their time together, and the things they find annoying about each other would become more apparent. This could ultimately strengthen their friendship as they're forced to be mature and accept their differences and blah blah blah. It would also mean that, for the first time, Harry and Hermione are sharing moments that Ron isn't part off. Cue jealousy.

I think Augusta Longbottom is a good choice. Potential conflict with Neville, Harry learning what it's like to live in the WW outside of Hogwarts, exploration of Neville's childhood, etc. Only problem I can see is I can't see any motivation for Augusta to take him in. She doesn't seem like one who would care that much about having the prestige of being guardian to the BWL,
