I think Ted and Andromeda make the most legal sense. If you go with the Longbottoms there'd have to be a pretty convincing reason why the Tonks get knocked out of the running. Not only would Andromeda be Sirius' first choice blood relative, there's the additional bonus of Ted being a muggle; they'd be able to demonstrate cultural stability for Harry to courts. On top of that, their daughter is an auror. Assuming she still lives at home, that's an additional measure of protection and ministry ties for Harry.

Obviously the Malfoys would be doing their damndest to get their hands on him too, having just as equal a blood claim and even more money--I'd think this would also be a natural plot point.

So if you go with Augusta you'd have to overthrow these considerations to make it believable IMO.
