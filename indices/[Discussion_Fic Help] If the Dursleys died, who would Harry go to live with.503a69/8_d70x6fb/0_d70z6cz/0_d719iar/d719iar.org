  Besides the fact that half of that is fanon
#+end_quote

This is a post...about a fanfic...in a forum about fan fiction...it's all fan fiction. I'm talking about fan fiction. Not canon.

You might have had a hint because the original post started with "I've got a fic" and proceeded to ask for advice about how to proceed with that fic, which diverges from canon. You might have had a hint because this subreddit has "fanfiction" in the title.

So why are you complaining about a suggestion violating canon? Do you automatically hate all stories with any canon divergence and want to force everyone else to hate them too?

Besides, none of that was fanon. It was an idea I had that could lead to a one-shot. It's no more fanon than my story about Harry having the official Tri-Wizard Tournament switched to an gobstones competition completed within ten minutes of his selection. It's no more fanon than my story about Voldemort wearing the Diadem of Ravenclaw instead of immediately turning it into a horcrux. An example of fanon would be Severus Snape being Draco Malfoy's godfather, or the existence of magical guardians -- things that are persistently believed or widely used in the fandom or fan fiction.

I don't have much personal fanon or headcanon. Any two stories I write might have widely diverging precepts about how the world works. In this idea, there are strict requirements about the red tape and requirements for where to live, if you're living in a mundane community. In another story I write or think of, there might not be enough people in the magical world to enforce such laws, so they've never been crafted. In another, Arthur Weasley managed to craft laws carefully to allow much greater integration than you might expect. In another, the government might have explicitly forbidden magical persons from living in mundane areas.

That's because it's fan fiction, and while I must be consistent within a story, I don't need to be consistent between stories. And none of it needs to be consistent with canon.

Since you seem not to understand this, maybe [[/r/hpfanfiction]] isn't the right place for you to hang out.

  all that needs the magical world to give a crap about Muggle laws and statuses

Did you even read what I wrote? It was about /magical Britain's/ laws about adults choosing their place of residence.

The only things it requires are the magical world recognizing Harry's emancipation and someone finding a reason to let Harry board there over the summer when he's only fourteen. Since Dumbledore arranged for Harry's original adoption, it's reasonable to assume that either the adoption / guardianship systems are in some way integrated (likely with the help of the Obliviators), or Harry's placement is primarily in the purview of the magical world. In either of these cases, Harry would be emancipated in the eyes of the magical government, and he would possibly be emancipated with the Muggle government.

But that's about canon. A fanfic author can choose the type and nature of legal integration between the magical world's legal system and the mundane government. They could choose where Harry's emancipation takes place. Similarly, if you object about magical guardians, even if that were a canon concept, a work of fan fiction could include it or not according to the author's preference.

As for convincing a hostel owner to let Harry board there when he's just a kid, there are a half dozen simple ways to handle it, and a half dozen obvious alternatives that might not involve hostels but still get Harry living with people who aren't his relatives and therefore aren't cleared to be around magic.
