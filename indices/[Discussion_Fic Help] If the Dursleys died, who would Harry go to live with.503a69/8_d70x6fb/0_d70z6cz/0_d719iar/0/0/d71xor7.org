You're so focused on portraying my idea as terrible that, as soon as you come up with a potential objection, you rush to tell me about it without considering whether the objection is insuperable, or even vaguely reasonable.

- Economics are off: I gave some numbers off the top of my head, and I'd come up with a specific value of the galleon before writing the story. Canon economics are horribly inconsistent anyway.
- Muggle minimum emancipation age: magic-only works, or move the events to around Harry's sixteenth birthday.
- Disconnect between muggle and magical emancipation: again, move it forward a couple years. Or magical government officials use their magic to run rough-shod over their muggle counterparts. You can't argue that that's violating the spirit or letter of canon.
- Someone would explain to Harry the laws: what world are you living in? Seriously. What percentage of the law did you have to learn by your sixteenth birthday?
- This is obviously the setup for a crack/humor fic. Why are you trying to apply strict logic to it?
