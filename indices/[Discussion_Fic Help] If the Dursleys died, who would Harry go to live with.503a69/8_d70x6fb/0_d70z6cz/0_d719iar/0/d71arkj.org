  This is a post...about a fanfic...in a forum about fan fiction...it's all fan fiction. I'm talking about fan fiction. Not canon.

  blah blah blah
#+end_quote

See, if you'd stopped to think for two seconds you'd realize that the point is not everyone would agree with you on your idea, seeing as it's not canon, one of them flat-out contradicts canon, the economics of it is wildly off, etc. But rant some more, please.

  Did you even read what I wrote? It was about /magical Britain's/ laws about adults choosing their place of residence.

  The only things it requires are *the magical world recognizing Harry's emancipation*
#+end_quote

See, again if you'd stopped to think for more than two seconds you'd realize there are two ways for this to go. Either Harry gets emancipated via Muggle channels (which he legally can't in the UK, being under the age of sixteen here, but let's entertain the thought), in which case there is zero indication that the magical world would recognize that he's been emancipated since they operate via different laws and a different system of majority - in other words, as he's still a magical minor he's not the one being slapped with all your fines. Or he gets emancipated via magical channels, in which case during the process of emancipation he would be informed of what he's supposed to file and what he's supposed to do (and in fact, if you're building off real world emancipation he would have to first demonstrate that he has a suitable abode before he can be emancipated). Like, how do you think the law even works?

But again, feel free to rant.
