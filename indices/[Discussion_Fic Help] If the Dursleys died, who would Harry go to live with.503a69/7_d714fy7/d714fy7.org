Well first of all you have to consider how public you want to make the Dursley's deaths. Who even knows that Harry lives with them? Does the Ministry know? Is it common knowledge or did Dumbledore keep it a secret?

Depending on that answer i can see several outcomes. Either you have some kind of Ministry Department making the decision, which would probably put him to his closest family which if you go with fanon and have Dora Black as Harry's grandmother would be either the Tonks family or the Malfoys, or maybe with a godmother that you can make up on the spot.

I can't really see Dumbledore ever letting Lucius Malfoy get custody even if he wanted it (which i don't think he would [i mean he would have probably wanted it just after James and Lily died but not when he's already 13]) so that's out. I don't think Dumbledore would have a problem with Andromeda taking custody and you could make Tonks an older sister to Harry which is always awesome.

Now if you go with the secrecy route, Harry would probably just end up with the Weasley's and that's it. I don't think either canon Harry or anyone else would have a problem with that.

I can't see canon Harry pushing for emancipation at age 13. He's a follower and would probably just do what DUmbledore tells him to and therefore end up with the Weasleys.

Edit: As for Remus: Nope for several reasons. Remus himself wouldn't trust himself around Harry and neither would the Ministry.
