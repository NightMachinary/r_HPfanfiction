The Ministry would surely know; they sent him owls, after all. Wiz. society isn't fully explored, but I believe they at least have something along the lines of a national census and registered addresses, etc, for all the wizards in Britain. General public wouldn't know initially, but a classic Skeeter Article^{TM} at the end of third year makes the Dursley deaths public and might prompt a sudden rush of "We'll look after him!" from people that just want to be able to say they're guardian to the BWL.

I agree with your thoughts on Lucius and Remus. I know the Weasleys are the most obvious and likely option that's canon compliant, and would be Harry's first choice, but I'm reluctant. Not toally sure why except that it maybe feels too easy--he knows them and fits in, it feels a bit "happily ever after" (even if this isn't the end), no conflict of "am I going to like living here? are my new guardian's nice?" etc.
