I am starting to lean towards the Longbottoms. I've already got a point of conflict between Harry and Neville so I can build on and then deal with that more than planned. Augusta definitely doesn't seem to be the best parental figure, but in different ways to the Dursleys so it could be interesting to explore those differences. (I'm also curious now as to what kind of person Frank was; wonder if there are any good fics focused on him...)

I'm opposed to marriage contract fics in general, but it's definitely not something I'd throw into this. It'd be completely out of the blue and unfitting.
