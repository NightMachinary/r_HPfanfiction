I don't really see that sort of conflict happening unless you put him with the Malfoy's or some random family.

My personal choice would be the Tonks family if you don't want the Weasley's simply because i always enjoy Harry and Tonks interacting.

The only other option that could potentially create some sort of conflict would be putting him with Augusta Longbottom. It would make him closer to Neville and Augusta isn't someone i would consider a loving motherfigure so that might prove interesting. You could make Alice Longbottom Harry's godmother, that should be sufficient reason for him to end up there.

Of course you could always go the Marriage Contract route and put Harry with his betrothed. The Bones and Greengrass family are the most popular options for that afaik.
