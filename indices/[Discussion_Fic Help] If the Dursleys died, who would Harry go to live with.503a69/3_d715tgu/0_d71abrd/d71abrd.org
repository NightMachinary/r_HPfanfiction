It's very easy for adults to ignore children as individuals with autonomy. It seems odd to me for an established politician to fear the political clout of a third year student.

If this story's Harry had already demonstrated political power, that attitude wouldn't seem out of place to me. I'd sooner write it from a perspective of avarice than fear: give the kid his cookie today and tomorrow he'll publicly support your rule.
