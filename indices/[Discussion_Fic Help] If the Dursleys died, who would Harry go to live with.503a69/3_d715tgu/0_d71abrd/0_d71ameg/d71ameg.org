Yeah, that's more or less what I ment. I mean, if Fudge just ignores Harry's wishes and forces him to do something he doesn't want, Harry might speak about it, the news spread, and suddenly Fudge is the guy that's siding against the saviour of wizardkind. OF course there's several ways you could spin this, you can have fudge take control of the DP earlier and try to turn the public opinion against harry earlier (Sure, there's no dead Cedric or mistrious Tri Wizard cup win, but the Chamber incident just happened, so you can use that), you cna have Fudge try to manipulate Harry (or at least, having him order someone to do it, since I believe he lacks the savoir-faire to do so himself), I think there's lots of possibilities.
