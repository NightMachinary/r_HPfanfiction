Funilly enough, I was debating on this just yesterday, with the diference that in my scenario this happens when he's still a baby.

Now here's something, I didn't found clear, does Dudley survive the attack? If he does, DUmbledore would want to keep them together, since he's now the only person able to keep the blood protection. If he also dies, then the protection is broken.

If you ask me, Muggle protection services or authorities are a non issue. Due to Harry's "status", I'm sure the ministry would just take no problem in obliviating as necessary to keep him in the magical world.

The decision would likely fall legally onto fudge. Fudge who, as you may recall, can't really make a decision on his own. It's the third year, so he'll still be listening to everything Dumbledore has to say, but he'll also be receiving money from Lucius Malfoy. And I'm sure Harry woul have a say on it too, it's not like Fudge can just decree "You're goinna live with Malfoys now" and he'd have no say in the matter. You don't want to stay on the wrong side of the boy who lives, not when he's adored by the entire magical britain.

Also remember that on third year, Harry would be more than willing to trust Dumbledore almost implicity. If he were to tell Harry this place would be the best for him, he'd accept, even if begrudgingly. So overall. Id say wherever you think Dumbledore would want him, it's msot likely where he'd end up staying.

ALTHOUGH, I have to say if the blood protection is gone, Dumbledore might just not be to bothered where he stays, within reason. So anywhere Harry would chose that wouldn't make Dumbledore go "oh shit not there you idiot" is a reasonable place.

The weasleys being the obvious candidates. Can't see Harry willingly want to stay with Hermione over Ron (unless you're changing the world so that they're madly in love or something), not can I see Dumbledore favouring a Muggle family over a wizard one. Lupin comes to mind, sure, but... AS much as Dumbledore trusts him, I'm not sure he'd trust him enough for this. An accident could happen. And Lupin defintely doesn't trust himself.

If Sirius is ilibated, then he'd be the natural candidate. With you making him available, I'd say it's perfectly plausible for his closest family to do it, by which I mean Tonks and her parents (I'm not sure if TOnks would be living by herself at this point, if you want to make it so, either her or her parents could be a possibility).

And then there's of course just out of the box ideas. You could make it so an extremely wealthy family with no clear connections to the dark side wants to take the boy who lived in. Harry kinda likes them, Dumbledore sees no problems, it could happen.

As for emancipation... I don't know. It does kinda feel in character, but then you also just turned your fic into one of the thousands "indy!harry" that already exist. Why not do something mildly diferent, since that's not the main point of the story anyway?

Anyway, those are my 2 cents on the subject. Actually, that's probably more than 2 cents. I kinda got excited midway.
