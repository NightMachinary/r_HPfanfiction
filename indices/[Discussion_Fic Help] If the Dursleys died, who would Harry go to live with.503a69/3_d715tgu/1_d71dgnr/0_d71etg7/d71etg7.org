You could do it through a potter-black relationship, I was just trying to keep it as canon compliant as possible, but hey, most people are still using Dorea and Charles potter anyway, I'm sure no one would bat an eye if you did so. But If Sirius get Ilibated, as Harry's natural guardian, he'd have to have a say on where he's staying too, that's why I was thinking of the Tonks family in general, and Tonks herself in particular. Like you said, interesting, since I don't think I've seen it before.

Quite frankly, I don't care much for OC's either. I just mentioned for the sake of argument, since that seemed like a possibility in-universe.
