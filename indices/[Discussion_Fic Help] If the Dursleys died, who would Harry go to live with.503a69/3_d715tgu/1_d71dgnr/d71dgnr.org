Dudley does die, so the protection is gone.

I do want Harry to have some say in his placement. His decision would probably be the Weasleys, but I would like a bit more conflict out of the situation than it being:

#+begin_quote
  "Harry, who would you like to live with?"

  "Weasleys."

  "Okay then, have fun!"
#+end_quote

I hadn't considered the option of the Tonks taking them because of the connection through Sirius (I was thinking more along the lines of fanon "the Blacks are distantly related to the Potters" so they get custody). Tonks living alone and taking Harry in could be... interesting.

I considered an OC, but it feels like it'd be a bit of stretch, plus I risk alienating readers who dislike (unnecessary) OCs. If I did use OC, I'd probably go for a Muggle who's Lily and Petunia's cousin, rather than a wizard, so I can at least argue that it's for the blood protection.

I'd like to say that it wouldn't be even if I did go for emancipation. Most of those seem to include suave!Harry who can charm all the ladies and out-politic all the politicians and goblins. I think canon-Harry, and certainly the Harry I'm writing, would just find somewhere to live and the nearest grocery store and that's it. Maybe set up a fireplace with floo access so he can visit the Weasleys, but certainly none of the other trapfalls of indy!Harry stories.

Your 2 cents (and more) is appreciated!
