If Sirius has a say, then he would probably ask for either the Tonks family (as the only relatives of his that he actually likes) or the Weasleys (for their existing relationship with Harry).

If the ministry is deciding, things could go very weird. The Malfoys would have sway, and would want him quite unprotected. Fudge would want him with someone loyal to the Ministry. His guardian would definitely be about politics then, not about any real suitability. Dawlish comes to mind as a ministry loyalist, so Fudge might consider him.
