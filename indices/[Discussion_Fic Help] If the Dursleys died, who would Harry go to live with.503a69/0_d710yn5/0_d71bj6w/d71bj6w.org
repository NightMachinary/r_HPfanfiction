It could be amusing, or potentially disastrous, but both her and Dudley are dead so unfortunately not an option. Also, personally, I can't see her doing it. She clearly loathes Harry and short of magical coercion I can't see her agreeing to take Harry in. Which I suppose could be an option if I went that route; I believe the blood protection needs willing agreement to live together and it's Dudley who'd need to agree, not Marge.

I did consider a random OC who's Lily and Petunia's cousin or something, but that feels like a cop out. Minimal chance of conflict and risk of losing readers who dislike OCs.
