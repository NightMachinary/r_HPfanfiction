I would love to see you explore the idea of the Foster system in the Wizarding World. Is there an explanation for why Wizarding Social Services hadn't made an appearance for Harry, a very obvious, very famous orphan? What would the Foster system look like? Would the Weasleys be eligible to foster him? Would the Malfoys or maybe Madame Bones? The Diggorys? What would be the criteria and would Harry's opinion count at all? Personally, I would read your story for the Foster system politics alone.
