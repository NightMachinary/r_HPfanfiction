My issue with McGonagall is that she wouldn't be the first choice of the Ministry, if they have veto power, and if it was entirely up to Harry then he'd pick the Weasleys over her. But it could be interesting to deal with the awkwardness of "my teacher is now my mum". (Not that he'd call or even of think of her as that exactly, but you get the idea.)
