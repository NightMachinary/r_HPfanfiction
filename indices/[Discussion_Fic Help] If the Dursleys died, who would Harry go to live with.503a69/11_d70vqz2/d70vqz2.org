Remus wouldn't be allowed for the simple fact he's a werewolf. The public would go nuts.

Andromeda would be a no as well. She's a Black. Suspect. (That made me feel racist)

The Grangers could be likely.

The Weasleys would be likely but Malfoy would likely point out how poor they are and how it looks like they're after Harry's money, possibly suggesting himself instead.

Longbottoms are pretty likely if you go fanon convention that Alice was Harry's godmom.

I think, with what i got from skimming the text, that his staying at Hogwarts over the summer would be the best choice and probably one that Harry would jump at, potentially annoying Hermione which would then lead Harry to frustration as he becomes her research mule as he has to look up things for her in the library she can't access but he can. (this could be a pretty funny short story, in fact, where owl after owl arrives with Hermione in the alley, looking at the book list of the school and the books in the stores there, making notes of things she absolutely must learn immediately(then harry realizes the house-elves can copy the books with a literal snap and soon he has an assembly line of a hundred house-elves copying the info Hermione wants while he lazes in a hammock with a drink with an umbrella in it. Then Albus is all "Have you seen any house elves, Harry? I had to go to the village to get dinner" and Harry is guilty looking))
