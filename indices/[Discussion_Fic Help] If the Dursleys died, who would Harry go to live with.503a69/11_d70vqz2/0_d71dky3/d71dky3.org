  his staying at Hogwarts over the summer
#+end_quote

I hadn't even considered that, unless he was made the ward of one of the teachers who chose to spend the summer there instead of going home; it's pretty clear students at Hogwarts in the summer is a big no-no.

You present an amusing scenario, though. You gonna write that one-shot?
