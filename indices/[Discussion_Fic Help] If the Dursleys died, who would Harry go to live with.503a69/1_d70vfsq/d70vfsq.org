Emancipation would definitely be appealing to the Harry you are describing but, it takes away the potential conflict and intrigue you would be able to include if he went to live with someone with dubious or mysterious intentions. I also personally think it's taking the easy way out, unoriginal, and quite boring to read. I would be more interested if Harry /tried/ to get emancipated and live on his own, then ultimately fails.

I doubt the wizarding world would allow Harry out of their grasp again. He's a celebrity, even more so now that he's in the public eye (school). Many wizarding families would want the prestige of raising The Boy Who Lived and would likely petition to adopt him when the news of his relatives travels. Dark families would obviously want to snare him as well, and his placement could become a political conflict between them and Dumbledore. The Headmaster would want to place Harry somewhere close at hand where he can ensure he remains on the "good" side. Him having the authority to do so is doubtful. It would likely be up to the Ministry, hence the struggle between the dark, light, and strangers to persuade the magical government to give Harry to them to raise "the right way".

That being said, what about Augusta Longbottom taking him in? I don't think I've read that before and it certainly makes sense. She's well off and likely has enough sway with the Ministry and other powerful families to convince them she's the best choice. She is "good", so Dumbledore would be satisfied with her as Harry's guardian. She is also a pureblood, which is the type of person the "dark" and older families ultimately would want caring for Harry in order to teach him their history and beliefs.
