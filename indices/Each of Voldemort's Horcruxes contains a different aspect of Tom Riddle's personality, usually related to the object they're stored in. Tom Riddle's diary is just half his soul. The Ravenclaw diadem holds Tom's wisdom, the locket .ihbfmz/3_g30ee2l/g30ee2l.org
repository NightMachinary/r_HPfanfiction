Oh I wrote a story like this once ! Where each horcrux was a virtue and the moment he cut off a piece of his soul the lacking virtue would reveal the sin. So the first goal of my main characters was to put his soul back together so that he would repent bc his true punishment would be his guilt and self hatred over all that he had done

I have to note though that this was only being set up, and I was leaving hints at it throughout the story, but it's now somewhat discontinued. I'll come back to it eventually!
