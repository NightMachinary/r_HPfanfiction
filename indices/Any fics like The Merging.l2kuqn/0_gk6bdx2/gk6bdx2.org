linkffn(The Second String) Starts from the same premise of being kissed by a Dementor. The consequent time travel and mystery is creatively explored. There is no gallivanting with Mauraders or any such clich√© tropes. The characters and the world feels real in a way that most fics fail to depict. There is a reasonable explanation for the time travel. Must-read even if you are discouraged by the summary/pairing or the initial pretending-to-be-a-squib subplot.
