The second String is hands down, the absolute best fic I've ever read. It was brilliant. Tense and funny and scary and heartbreakingly sad. It's so well paced, so many cool twists and tops. Honest, you'd be mad not to read it.

It's has a slash pairing but it's not a slash fic. There's no romance or pining. Gideon isn't even in half the fic. And when he does come in, he really balances Harry's stern character. It adds so much tension with the secret and it's genuinely adorable.

I'm not overly fond of slash either but this story uses the relationship as a plot device. It's barely a focus of the story at all and in the few times it is, it is used to develop character. Please dont let such a small part of the story stop you from enjoying the rest.

Again, Gideon doesn't show up till half way through and there no slash up till that point. Id recommend reading even just the first half and if the pairing really ruins it for you then, fine. But this story is so so worth the read I cannot express it enough. It was brilliant.
