linkffn(The Life and Times by Jewels5) is a well written fic that I really enjoyed? I thought the characters and drama were honestly great I had a really fun time!

linkao3(All The Young Dudes by MissKingBean89) is also absolutely fantastic but a Wolfstar fic so probably not your thing. Worth the read though.

Everything by TheDivineComedian is brilliant, they are truly an incredible writer. They do a lot of Black family stories. All of which are fantastic. This has the best Regulus so I'll link this one but rlseriously, read all of them linkao3(They're Hiding Inside Me by TheDivineComedian). Edit:: I've checked and apperently this is tagged RL/SB but there's no slash in it I don't know why that's there... Sure their other work isn't slash anyway so check out their other work!

linkao3(Manacled by senlinyu) was also veeery well done. Very very well written but jesus it's quite dark. It's a Handmaid's tale esque story so mind yourself reading it it gets dark. The characters are quite OOC I thought but it really worked for the world they were in. Good stuff ðŸ˜Š

linkao3(The Practical Applications of Arithmancy by JanuaryGrey) is a oneshot about Sirius and Orion Black and it's absolutely fantastic. Orion is terrifying. Really worth the read.

I'm like you, I'm picky about what I read, it has to be good. These are all brilliant. I don't feel bad about reccing them.

The Second String and recommended before is also completely worth it ðŸ˜Š but if you are really antislash then the above are all slash free (bar ATYD but read that anyway ðŸ˜‹)
