Vera Rozalsky's Amends has Slytherin reprisals and an alcoholic, vengeful Ginny being played by Gryffindor auror death squads, as well as Hermione running a truth and reconciliation process. Probably my favorite fic. There's a Dramione (not sure by whom) where Hermione plays "Lady of the Lake" character with a Slytherin takeover cabal after breaking up with Ron and getting bounced from the Order as they indulged in the fruits of victory (Harry knocking up Astoria, Percy and Kingsley taking kickbacks, Ron sleeping around on his fame.) I'll find it.

edit: it's called "Lady of the Lake." convenient.
