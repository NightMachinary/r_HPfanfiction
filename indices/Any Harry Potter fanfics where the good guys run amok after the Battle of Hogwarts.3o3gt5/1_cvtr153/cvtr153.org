It's actually to be expected, given what they had suffered and the scope of their victory. Most people are NOT as forgiving as Harry Potter, and Harry went to a long slumber after the victory so they had all the time in the world to exact their retributions.

I think the DA kids and many other Hogwarts students would thoroughly "work" on the Carrows after the battle. War-hardened teenagers would definitely be a cruel bunch after seeing their comrades murdered and themselves being tortured. Testimonials and biographies from real-life war veterans can all attest to that. The one paragraph in E.B Sledge's 'With The Old Breed' about how a young American Marine "worked" on a wounded Japanese soldier after the Battle of Tarawa was really stomach turning.

In fact, there was foreshadowing in HBP, when Dumbledore had a brief exchange with the Carrows about their fates on top of the Astronomy Tower. Also, J.K Rowling announced a book named 'Dumbledore's Army: The Dark Side of Demob' that was supposed to show some light on their nefarious deeds.

There was also the monetary incentives in going after the old pure-blood oligarchy. Battle of the Hogwarts offered one golden opportunity to solve the financial problems of many families once and for all, especially the Weasleys. Just as love is a powerful emotion, so do greed and vengeance.
