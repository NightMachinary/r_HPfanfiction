Just to clarify - the Dark Side of Demob is a fictional Rita Skeeter title referenced in Rowling's where-are-they-now short piece released in July 2014; there are no indications, so far as I'm aware, that it's a real book she's working on. Also random trivia demob is short for demobilization in British English, it's not just a pun implying the DA was a mob.
