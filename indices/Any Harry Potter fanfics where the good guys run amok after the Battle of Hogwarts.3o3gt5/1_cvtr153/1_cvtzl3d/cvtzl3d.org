On the monetary incentives point:

One thing I've noticed is very common in a lot of post-war fics I've read is that any time the Malfoys are brought up, it's almost always stated that they sort of /paid out the ass/ as punishment/reparation for their allegiances since none of them go to Azkaban. Whether or not the sums they had to pay cripples them financially or not varies by author, though.
