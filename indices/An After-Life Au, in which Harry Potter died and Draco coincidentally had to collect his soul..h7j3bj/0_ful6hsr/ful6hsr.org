  Harry Potter died, but that won't stop the Wizarding World to fight. Now that he's dead, with all his memories erased, he will now enter a new world with strange commodities. He was also very much stuck with his Soul Fetcher (though he still prefers using the term grim reaper), Davos, and claimed to help him collect his memories. Together, not only did they fill Harry's thoughts with memories he never knew existed, but also tries to find out the identity of Davos. A story about redemption, discovering oneself, and a little bit of love. Currently on-going, updated weekly.
