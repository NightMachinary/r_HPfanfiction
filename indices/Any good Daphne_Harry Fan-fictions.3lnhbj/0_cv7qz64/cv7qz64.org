There are some good ones:

linkffn(Song of the Trees): Minor Harry/Daphne, but excellent story. Probably the best mystery fic in the fandom.

linkffn(Unatoned): Has issues with Harry's characterization and improbability of the setting, but it is a wonderfully written and executed femme fatale.

link(Lost Time): Excellent, but abandoned. Minor Harry/Daphne.

[[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=15341][Intoxication]]: Excellent story all round.

linkffn(The Game is Afoot): Decent one-shot, if a bit long-winded.

linkffn(Death before Dishonor by SuperNova26): Just started, has promise. Too bad it barely updates once in six months.

linkffn(Uncle Harry by R-Dude): Fun oneshot

linkffn(A Game of Style and Brutality): Readable, but I see it as more of a disappointment than a success. The Quidditch scenes are good, everything else is /dull/.

linkffn(The Uprising by Captain Cranium): Readable, but not much to write home about. Oh, and Ron bashing. Ugh. Still, it updates, and the author's finished it beforehand, so it will definitely be complete.

There are a few others that I don't care for (Snakecharmer, Perfect Situations, Traitorous) but you might like them. Also, if you see Daphne and Tracey as identical (I see no difference, but it's a thing apparently), then you might want to look at linkffn(What Lies Beneath by Master Slytherin) and linkffn(Tequila by Johnny Farrar).
