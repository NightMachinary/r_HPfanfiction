I mean there is also Canon Harry wakes up in a WBWLed AU. Ok Harry lets make a pros and cons list pros my parents are alive and I have a brother. Cons they are dicks to me or abandoned me to the Dursleys anyway. Also I am in Slytherin that sucks but I seem to have some new friends who are not assholes so that is nice plus Hermione is still friends with me so that is good. Also I don't have to be the BWL great! Now if only I can find a way to have my parents and brother act like a real family this could work out really nice. 5 minutes later when it is revealed that Harry is the BWL well this isn't going to get any better for me is it...
