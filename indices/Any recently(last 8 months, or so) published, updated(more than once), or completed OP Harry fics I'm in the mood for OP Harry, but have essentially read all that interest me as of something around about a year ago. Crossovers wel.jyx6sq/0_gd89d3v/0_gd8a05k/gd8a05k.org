#+begin_quote
  The Fates of the MCU have written for Harry Potter to die during a failed Obscurial Transformation. A drunken conversation between the heads of the Marvel verse has changed that and Harry has ended up with Gamer powers among other things. Watch Harry go through Hogwarts, Kamar-Taj, and Xavier's institute as he learns to use his powers and level up. Contains a Flerken. Harem by Arc3

  Third in series, read prequels or be confused. Harry had spent his whole life wishing for magic to be more abundant, and that was precisely what he got. He wasn't even particularly upset about the many serious dangers inherent in such a thing, for what was life without challenge? The irony of ending up in Azeroth after all the references was a bit on the nose, though.
