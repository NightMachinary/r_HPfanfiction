Itachi is that a baby([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11634921/1/Itachi-Is-That-A-Baby]]) is one of my all time favourites. It's got a Dumbledore who's given up, and goes along with the crazy. A Byakugan using Harry raised by the Akatsuki(with the results you'd expect), and can't forget GIRL-TOBI.

A few by Clell65619 like Sun Source, and the Bewitched one is also great.

Seventh Horcrux linkffn(10677106) gets mentioned here all the time, but in case you haven't read it.

Here's a DxD cross with him being literally God linkffn(12098778).

That's the few I can think of off the top of my head. There's also stuff like Core Threads, and anything, and I mean anything written by stargatesg1fan1. I don't read his stuff anymore since I saw him write a lemon scene between a mentally hundreds(or at least like 50+, I can't remember) of years old Harry, and an mentally, and physically 8 year old Tonks. I mean his stories were already having lemons of an uncomfortable nature for me, but that was the final straw. If you ignore that one story though(the 1 million+ word story), the others have an OP Harry. Lots of lemons though.
