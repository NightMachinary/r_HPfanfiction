How would that tie into Harry though, assuming he loves Harry as much as I think he does, and how Mama Zabini would feel to him. Assuming Countess Zabini knows either how much Sirius was bound to love Harry, or just knowing because of letters (I have no idea how that would work in the time line cause I'm not doing the math). It could be a fun play with the Countess seducing Vernon to get to Harry after finding him, or Blaise getting to Hogwarts and finding Harry before Ron does and how that would play into their Hogwarts experience.
