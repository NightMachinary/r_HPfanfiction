IF I was brave enough to write it myself, I'd like the son Zabini to eventually catch on to his mom's shit. And maybe end up talking to Harry somehow because of the fact EVERYONE KNOWS SIRIUS BLACK IS HARRY'S GODFATHER. There'd be a very weird, uncertain allies sort of rep between the Boy-Who-Lived and his godfather's /technically/ illegitimate mystery son that would honestly be an interesting way to change up the Golden Trio + DA friends dynamic. Blaise wants to hear about his absent-and-unfortunately-imprisoned-for-a-long-time dad, and Harry's feeling very uncertain about a possible connection between arrogant Blaise and Sirius. And it'd also be entertaining? Blaise isn't a bad guy, but it's pretty vain and he does have some anti-muggleborn feels. It'd give people a chance to better develop Blaise and maybe have some really interesting character growth/interaction. Maybe Blaise can be written to be a decent Slytherin and not give into that Slytherins-are-evil trope.

*/Bonus points/* */if all of this starts happening post-Book five when Sirius is dead!/* Like Countess Zambini is now especially fucking upset that her favorite lover, who went through so much horrid shit, is now dead because of Dumbledore's bullshit about not really helping Harry with his issues. And maybe she's a little upset at Harry too, cuz he was kinda an emotional dumbass (but shit, he's a teen and teens do dumb shit). Everything starts to really hit the fan, Blaise the Slytherin actually proves to be a super useful member of the Crewâ„¢ that reluctantly respects Hermione and tries not to engage Ron (because I just can't envision them getting along very well), Harry and Blaise bond in an unexpected way, Voldemort hears about and hates this developing friendship tons, Countess Zambini is actually a super cool DADA professor, and I'm absolutely here for some calculated murking of Dumbledore by Countess Zambini that completely throws Draco's whole assassination plan into the trash. Would that mean the Malfoys would lose value/face in front of the Dark Lord and just all get Killing Curse'd out of the story? Or what?

I'm fucking here for creative ways of subverting canon.
