Most people I know use ff.net most of the time. It's hard to get noticed in the sea of fanfic, but if you post a link here, you'll get some traction. I'm interested enough at least.

You might want to post your 15k words in a few separate chapters, especially if you're going to be posting the rest of your fic in smaller bits.
