Do not list any main canon characters then, just use *OC*.\\
If you list any /canon/ character people will expect them to be the lead and will punish you with reviews or PMs if they find this is not the case.\\
And please put in the summary that the story is driven by OCs as well so people looking for Jilly or Marauder slash won't be disappointed.
