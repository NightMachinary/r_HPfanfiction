If your story has multiple chapters for the 15-20K, maybe try putting it out one chapter at a time on ffnet. Like have a schedule that you release a new chapter every Friday. That way it'll appear in the recent stories more often than if you upload it all at once. A story like that could easily get lost, especially since it's OC heavy and people won't be looking for it when they use search filters.
