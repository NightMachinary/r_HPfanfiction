There's a possibility that a normal shield charm might not recognize a bright light and a loud noise as a danger it should block, so a normal flashbang could be quite useful against wizards. A second of disorientation is all it takes to hit someone with a serious curse. Flashbang, then attack curses could be a very good strategy.
