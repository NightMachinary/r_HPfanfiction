The flashbang thing is just a comparison of effect time, nothing more. Imagine I'd said grenade instead. Essentially, I'm looking for opinions on what a grenade that knocked out magic in a small area for between a few seconds and an hour would affect in the setting. Would it cause a war, would it stop a war, etc.
