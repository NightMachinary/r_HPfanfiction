If you are in the same room (and not wearing hearing/eye protection rated for this), you are guarantied to be temporarily blinded, and deafened. This has a good chance to disturb the fluid in the ear, which messes your balance. Add it all together, and you get someone stumbling around, not knowing what the hell just happened.

This opens up accidental magic, or people panicking and dropping their own stuff. Add in some anti-magic effects, and you remove that possibility.

There's even a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockSilence][trope for this]], which is based on the truth. Call of Duty has the Shellshocked condition which is similar to this too.
