1. Don't worry about not knowing flashbangs from the personal experience. Give it couple of years and I am afraid (I have friends in Belfast, so I am really afraid) IRA or UVF will make you live presentations. And ask your parents.

2. There was some story where Hermione developed a magical version of a flashbang: version of /Lumos/ of such intensity, that it worked like the one. Not sure where it was.
