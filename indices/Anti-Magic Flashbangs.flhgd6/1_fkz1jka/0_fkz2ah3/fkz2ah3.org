Heh. Quite possible. We in England are certainly doing our best to piss off everyone else we can these days - really taking pointers from the US and all that.

I have, but my English side are all unexperienced in that sort of thing and my Irish relatives haven't responded to anything all day. It's not really the point of my post though, I'm more focusing on the anti-magic part than the flashbang part. Essentially, I'm wondering what would happen if an anti-magic grenade was invented that had a similar boom-flash and effect time as a flashbang. Not a magical flashbang, but an anti-magic flashbang, basically.
