I don't have a British version to check, but the only relation between "dumbledore" and "ninepin bowling" that Google can find is a single tumblr blog that posted some HP chapters and has "ninepin bowling" instead of "ten-pin bowling". I believe that if the British version did say "ninepin bowling" then there would be some more evidence of that online.
