  It's fifteen years after The-Girl-Who-Lived became the Girl-Who-Vanquished-The-Dark-Lord, and Viktor Krum has a favor to ask of the Head Auror. Or: Harry is accidentally sentimental in a business meeting and her wife, the one secretary who can always be counted on to eavesdrop and not be fired for it, has feelings about it. Serious. Feelings. --- Fem!Harry/Fem!Draco. One-Shot.
