  Are people going to stop reading halfway through even though they ostensibly liked the plot to get that far just because of a NOTP? Am I going to alienate readers by writing an unpopular ship, even if I feel that the character dynamics are worth writing about?

Yes to all of those. And each Reader has different thresholds of what sets them off. You cannot satisfy everyone, or even a majority since tastes are individual.
