I think that this sub is not very representative of the wider HP fic community.

I write female Harry, and that is definitely not popular around here (I get downvoted every time I post a self promotion post).

But in general, people have their preferences. You won't get everyone with every fic. There will be people who won't click on it for whatever reason. And that's okay.

The important part is that you're writing what you want to write.

Sometimes you'll get hateful reviews (I do), the best thing you can do is share them with someone you trust, laugh about them, and delete them.
