There is a lot of reasons why I (or someone else in this sub) would nope out of a fic, then there is a lot of reasons why someone will stick to it. It does not worth getting riled up about it, write what you feel... and I think for most of us it's not just a yes/no. For example I'm not particualrly fond of M/M as a main pairing, but I dont mind sidecharacters being that... unless it starts to take over the plot. Just like with pretty much everything the delivery is the key. (But don't get anxious about that either, as long as you reread the story and feel content with it, you have accomplished what you had to accomplish and the love of the fandom will hopefully follow ;) )
