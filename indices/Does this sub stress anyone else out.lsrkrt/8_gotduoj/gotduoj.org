Try to not think about /everyone/. You write for yourself and that is great.

I can only speak for myself: Pairings are not that important for me, although I have some I prefer over others and some I don't like. If a story is well written and has an interesting plot, I will definitely continue reading it, even if it includes a pairing I don't like. (I have only one notp, which is extremely niche fortunately)
