I've noticed that too, and yet a large majority of stories that make up HP fanfiction world are generally written by women, but they are all still wildly popular (if you go by favs/kudos/comments and follows).

I always see the same stories being recommended here (like Prince of Slytherin, Methods of Rationality(??) etc) which I don't quite understand, cause there are literally thousands of other stories that are as good, or better, but rarely get the same attention.

So, I guess regardless that this sub may majorly be comprised of a certain demographic, OP should just write what they want because chances are, it'll probably do well regardless of ship.
