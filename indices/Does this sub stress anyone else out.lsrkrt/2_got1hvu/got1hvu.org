This sub is mostly straight guys. I used to think the users here just hated slash, but het pairings or anything unconventional (unless it involves Harry with an older woman) get downvoted too. Even Harmony seems to set everyone here off.

The safest pairings (or harems) here seem to be Harry or Neville paired off with most female characters. Hermione getting paired off with anyone seems to get downvoted too since it's not from a guy's perspective.
