Babe ignore anyone them. Write what you want to write and we can stay salty. By the way I love slash (I don't read fics without diversity) and hate Haphne. So you're good. Are you going to alienate readers by writing something unpopular? Yes but this sub is not representative of the whole fanfiction community. I've been here for a year and I've been reading no fanfics for about 8. You'll be fine love. Put it out there. /Someone/ is guaranteed to like it.
