Dude, there are millions of readers out there. Even if most people don't like your fic, there will be some who will. There's audience for Filch/Mrs Norris, Harry/Umbridge, Hogwarts/Giant Squid, Snape/anyone, Fudge harems... Everything.

You'll get readers. More if you write well. If your ship is niche or you suck at summaries... It's up to you to make a good writing or enjoyable to keep those who click... Who might recommend your fic.

I personally had never clicked on young Tom fics but right now I'm hooked on this hilarity one of him teaching DADA at Hogwarts.
