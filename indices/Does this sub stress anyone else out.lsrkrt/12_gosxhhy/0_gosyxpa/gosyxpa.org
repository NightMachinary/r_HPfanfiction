I am quite an anxious person in general, so it tends to make me overthink sometimes (okay, a lot of the time).

Obviously, writing for yourself is important! Otherwise I'd just pick a bunch of popular tropes to turn into a story, but that wouldn't be much fun. I'm not expecting to have the next popular fic at all. I'm a very self-absorbed writer; that's why some of the conversations on this sub were so surprising to me.

I don't think most people are going to like what I write and I've never thought that. I had just never considered before that someone who found the plot and writing style borderline tolerable would abandon ship because they didn't like a ship (pun intended).
