If you're going to stress out for some people not liking what you write or say or do you'll be stressed everywhere, not just in here.

This is coming from a guy who just doesn't click on M/M... I think I might enjoy some long complex stories where the MC happens to be LGTB, but fanfic is so full of smut everywhere that chances are I may end up clicking on M/M sex scenes without actual plot, so I just don't click on those.

There are thousands of people like me.

There are thousands of others who won't click on an otherwise good story for a gazillion reasons, even nitpicks.

There are many more who would click and go out for whatever reason.

You are not writing for me or those people. You are writing for yourself and the people who may actually like what you write.

Not everyone is going to like what you write. Accept it.

Still, you are free to write the stuff you like however you like. People like me might not like it. Others might criticize it. Whatever. You aren't writing for them.

You can do anything you like and should be able to. Unless, it's illegal, then yeah... In that case, don't.
