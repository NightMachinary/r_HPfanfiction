I think you shouldn't worry about this sub and write what you want. This sub's tastes, criticisms, etc are almost in sharp contrast to the majority of fan fiction readers, writers, and the fandom as a whole.

HP/ DM, HP/HG, & HG/DM are still fan fiction favs. SS/HP, SS/HG, HP/TMR, and RL/SB is still vv popular. I won't get into individual characters, but you get the gist.

Those of us who have you stressed are a vocal minority, probably even on this sub.

And if you're after slash fic advice, I'm sure [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]] would be happy to help.
