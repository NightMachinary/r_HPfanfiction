People view Harry (or whichever character they identify with) as their avatar in the HP world; the decision of who to pair that character with is nothing less than the decision of who the reader themselves would want as their romantic partner.

So encountering a pairing you dislike is like having an unwanted romantic partner thrust upon you. If I read Draco Malfoy and Harry kissing, I am not observing this as a third party. Rather, the reading experience is one of Draco Malfoy kissing /me/. Which, since I am not gay, I do not like.

This is not limited to romance, of course. You will find that you alienate readers any time your main character does something that the reader would not aspire to do themselves.
