I'm willing to read whatever (even haphne and hinny) of the romance stays a subplot and the plot is strong. Actually that's a lie. I can't read a fic if Harry is the main character and has multiple girlfriends. The only trio I like is /the trio/. Best throuple in existence and we need more fics with them.
