Thanks :)

I guess it's just surprising to hear that ships are so divisive, since I don't usually spend that much time in reader-focused spaces. Even outside of this sub, people still tend strongly prefer certain ships.

And I'm legitimately curious why ships are such a big deal in general, since I spend so much time messing with my draft and outline, but mostly left ships to the side as something to add later because they wouldn't affect the plot that much. To me, it was an afterthought.

But yeah, it does not take much to send me into an overthinking spiral. ðŸŒª
