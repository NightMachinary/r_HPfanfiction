  Are people going to stop reading halfway through even though they ostensibly liked the plot to get that far just because of a NOTP? Am I going to alienate readers by writing an unpopular ship, even if I feel that the character dynamics are worth writing about?

Yes, and Yes.

You're not overthinking it. Harry Potter is a blank slate with the minimum characterization necessary for the plot, to make it easy for young readers to project themselves onto him. You aren't shipping Harry Potter, you're shipping whoever the reader projected onto Harry Potter (usually themselves) with your romantic partner.
