Holy shit, this is just what I've been looking for?! I fucking love Diary Tom, and I've just read through all Obscurus!Harry tagged stories on AO3 and I was bemoaning the lack of them.

Aah omg I've just skimmed the start of the first chapter and it's incredible, I'm so excited to read it! Tom smoking is such a vibe.
