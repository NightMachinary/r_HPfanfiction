It's not just here. It's why you can sort by pairings on various fanfic sites. It's why there are sites dedicated to specific fics. I don't mind OC's. In fact I've been reading a lot of them and self inserts lately. I just don't like them in romantic relationships with canon characters. Well unless you get inserted into a married couple of course. May I ask who the main characters are?
