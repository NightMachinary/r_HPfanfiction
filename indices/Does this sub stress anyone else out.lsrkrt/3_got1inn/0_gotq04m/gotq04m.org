Thanks for your advice :)

Yeah, if I really cared that much about appealing to the masses, I wouldn't have an OC as one of the three main characters. I do take concrit but if people try to tell me what pairings they want there is a 99.9% chance of me completely ignoring them.

I had just never really considered a pairing (especially if it's a subplot) one of the most divisive things in a fic. So this sub is a bit of a culture shock for me.
