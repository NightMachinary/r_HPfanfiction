  Are people going to stop reading halfway through even though they ostensibly liked the plot to get that far just because of a NOTP? Am I going to alienate readers by writing an unpopular ship, even if I feel that the character dynamics are worth writing about?

Yes to both. People are also going to stop reading (or disregard it before reading) for a whole variety of other reasons. But you're not going to alienate /all/ readers.

It's impossible to write something that will appeal to everyone, and very difficult to write something that appeals to the majority. But you can still get a lot of readers who will enjoy your work.

If you try to please everyone, you'll end up pleasing no one. And the quality of the work will go tremendously downhill. Just do your best to write your vision for your story. You can listen to feedback and constructive criticism, of course, but use your own judgement on whether to actually implement it: Would it really improve the story you want to tell, or is it trying to change the story to something else? Would implementing it reduce/destroy your own enjoyment in writing the story (which is the most important thing in terms of writing quality and actually completing the fic)? Things like that.

And remember that even if one review is all you get, it's still only one person's opinion. It's not 100% of opinions. You don't have to take what it says as any more important than if it were surrounded by 100 other opinions. For a hobby like fanfiction (something you do for enjoyment), your own opinion is very much the most important thing.
