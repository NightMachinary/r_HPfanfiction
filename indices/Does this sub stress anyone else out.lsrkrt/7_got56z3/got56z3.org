I know how you feel, I had the same problem when i thought about posting my story. It is a comedy fanfic in my native language and i didnt got much hate. I got comments like "i find this and this ship weird" and so they stopped reading, but most people still read because it is funny. As long the story is enjoyable people will continue to read. At least in my case. One of my favourite fanfics as an example has one of my notps in it (not one of the top, but i dont like it). Sorry for misspellings
