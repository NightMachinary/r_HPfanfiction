I wouldn't worry. This sub can feel like an authority but it isn't - there are some people with very strong opinions and some stories that are seen as the ideal, but the sub itself is it's own niche audience. For example, this sub skews quite heavily male when fanfic in general skews female.

I do empathise with you. I had a similar issue a few years ago and ended up drifting away from this sub and the discord channel, now I only lurk here and comment occasionally. I'm a canon compliant author who prefers to receive constructive criticism when I solicit it from people I trust, and I prefer character work to massive epics. None of that exactly makes me an outcast here in itself, but I'm definitely in the minority, and the way some people spoke about things I liked and even my own stories sometimes ended up making me feel pretty miserable. I moved to other, smaller communities and felt a bit more secure in my work.

I found that there is always an audience, even if it's not a mass one. Likewise, there is always some arsehole with an opinion.
