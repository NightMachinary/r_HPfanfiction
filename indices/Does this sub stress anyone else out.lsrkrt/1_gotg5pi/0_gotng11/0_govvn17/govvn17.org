I would recommend this. I recently found this sub and started dabbling in it, and I'm shocked at how little it represents “my” corner of the HP fandom, which dates back to a very active livejournal community in the early ‘00s, very very heavily dominated by women and heavily slash positive; there was also a strong contingent of academics. My strong belief is that the reader-as-character-avatar approach described in comments here did/does not resonate at all with that community, for example. I'm also shocked by the profound lack of tolerance or understanding of slash, the absolutist approach toward characters, and various other attitudes that are entirely foreign to my experience.

I don't say this to claim that my tastes or experience represents “true” HP fandom - just to illustrate that there's a whole world of HP fandom out there that isn't this sub. But do take a look at the most popular HP stories on AO3 - the ones with the most kudos or bookmarks over the past year or two. Most of these certainly don't reflect the tastes of this sub.

All of which is to say, write what you want, and don't look to this sub as if it reflects the views or tastes of the majority of the audience for your work.
