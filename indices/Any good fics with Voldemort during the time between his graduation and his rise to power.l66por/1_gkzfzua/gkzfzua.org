There's an odd one called 'Rebirth' on fanfic.net, iirc. It features an OC who grew up in the orphanage with Tom Riddle, they grow up and go to Hogwarts together and such. They end up in a relationship together, and the OC and Tom both die, but because they became immortal together come back as children. The OC comes back as Harry Potter, and the story is abandoned shortly after that But before that there's quite a bit of story about Tom's time after hogwarts but before trying to get the DADA position.
