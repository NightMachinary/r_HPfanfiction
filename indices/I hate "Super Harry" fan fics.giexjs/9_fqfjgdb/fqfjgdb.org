It is my firm belief that badass is something that happens in spite of power level.

God mode Harry wiping the floor with Death Eaters while reading the news paper and getting dressed? Not badass.

Squib/Muggle/barely trained Harry killing death eaters with brillient plans in spite of lack of power? Badass.

Or, you know, competent Death Eaters will make Harry badass.
