That was a pretty tame story, Harry was a healer, and that's it. He almost gets taken out several times in the story. Snape was a bit OP, but meh

In some stories the challenges are not powerlevel related.

I agree on the stories where 11 year old Harry can beat grown wizards easily, but this is not one of them.
