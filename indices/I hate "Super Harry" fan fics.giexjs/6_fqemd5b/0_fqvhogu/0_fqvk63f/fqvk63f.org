In terms of powerful Harry's, I think AngelaStarCat does so really well - linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings) definitely hits those tiles, and linkffn(Blindness) is well done too.

Otherwise, I'd also put linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) in the category of managing a powerful Harry well. Two more that tangentially fit would be linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) and its sequels, and linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) and its sequels (though that last one is a crossover).
