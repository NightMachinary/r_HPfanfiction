Super!Harry is boring, agreed - to me, it's because it doesn't feel earned and reduces all the challenge.

That being said, powerful Harry fics /can/ be good - but what is important there is that you need to have buildup to it (having it in his backstory is almost impossible to make work, for instance) and it needs to adjust his challenge. If the main challenge for such a powerful Harry is still Voldemort, than Voldemort - or his followers - need to be made into a bigger threat (eg, making them more strategically smart). Otherwise, a powered up Harry might just roll over them. If the challenge is something else, one way to make it work is to make it not dependent on his magical power - where it does nothing to help him.

I've read some fics that manage to make powerful Harry work like that - by making the powering up take a while, be at a real cost, and with either alternate goals that aren't helped by that power (or hindered), and/or a more powerful Voldemort.
