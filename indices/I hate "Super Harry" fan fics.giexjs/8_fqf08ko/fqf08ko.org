My absolute least favorite thing in fics is when writers deify the protagonist, and personally I just don't find Harry-wizard-Jesus in any way a compelling character. Furthermore seeing the hero struggle through genuine hardship is an important staple for character growth, which many of these OP Harry fics tend to miss.
