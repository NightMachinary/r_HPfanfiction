Same. However, there are some authors who back the super powers up, write in the effort behind the achievements, world build so there's a logical framework for the superness. Right now I'm reaing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/20/Blindness][Blindness]] and the author has sold me on a very psychodelic Super!Harry by tossing a lot of the OS primary characters and handing the storyline over to some of the more interesting secondaries. Scrimgeour as Minister, Nice Dursleys - its working.
