I feel this one did a good job of it as well. I like super!harry when it's a slow growth in strength/prowess and it's believable for the situation/universe that they've created. It's also one of the reasons why I loved GreenGecko's Resonance trilogy. But with those, I feel if you create a super!harry, then there needs to be a believable/strong enough enemy to contrast it and show real struggle (wether physical, mental or emotional) and I think they both did a good job of that in both, and in different ways.
