Yeah, there's a reason Superman has a Kryptonite allergy and very powerful enemies. Stories with omnipotent heroes are extremely boring.

Also, and this is more of a preference thing, but I never could finish the Artemis Fowl books. I'm not a fan of authors essentially trying to make Harry into him. I like in character Harry a lot more than arrogant, know-it-all, self-interested Harry.
