A powerful super Harry doesn't have to be an asshole. Maybe he went around when he was little and constantly was using magic to help muggles all over the place, creating a long series of problems for magical law enforcement desperately scrambling around trying to stop knowledge of magic from becoming public in a funny way. Who knows? I strongly (ba dum tiss) believe that super Harry stories COULD be written well.
