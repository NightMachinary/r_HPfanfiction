Even with his weaknesses/enemies, Superman is still boring for a lot of people (which is the way I feel about him).

For Artemis Fowl, I don't mind someone turning Harry more into him, though I think the enjoyable aspect there was that Artemis /didn't/ have magic - and so he had to rely on his intellect (even if boosted up by the author) to manage anything. Super Harry fics would be like if Artemis Fowl was also the most powerful magic user in the world and had even more plot armor, which is what makes it a lot more boring.
