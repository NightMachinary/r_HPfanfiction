  When you focus on challenging his morality or creating a non-physical challenge the stories and his characters become a lot more interesting.

In my opinion, this is the best way to write a story about a character with god-like strength: focus the plot on other types of conflicts in which that strength is not a trump card. That's what Neil Gaiman did in writing the /Sandman/ graphic novel series, in which the main character is something higher than even a god.
