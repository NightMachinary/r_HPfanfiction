After reading fanfiction for several years, I see why people have a problem with it. It's kinda like asking the book readers how they feel about the movies. Really, of any series. People who have only seen the movie frequently don't understand why the people who read the book hate the movie, and no amount of explaining will make them grok. In my particular case, Starship Troopers is a movie I enjoy very much as a satire about war, space travel, etc. After i saw the movie, I read the book (along with everything else Heinlein wrote) and I could barely recognize it as being related. It's all about timing.
