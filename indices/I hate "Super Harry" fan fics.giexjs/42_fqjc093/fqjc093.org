You mean Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin?

The super popular fic where Harry is a Gary sue and by the time he is 13, he gets everything he wants including curing Lupin.

Its fucking ridiculous. What makes a story good is when your characters have flaws and overcome them. Not be good at every bloody thing.
