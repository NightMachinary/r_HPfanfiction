Oh yeah! There was one story that I really liked. It was a world where every pureblood/halfblood had 'family magic'. Some unique ability that only their clan had. (Gave a bit more reasoning behind the pure blood mania). Harry in this was able to transform into a dragon (Basically Smaug), so he was quite a bit more powerful than his peers as this gave him a damned good control over transfiguration. But he still would be beaten like an amateur by most adult wizards.

It was called Breath of the Inferno by Primordial Vortex. However, it ends after first year simply because the author, despite having very good writing in my opinion, seems to jump from one idea to the next without actually finishing any. It's a shame too, because a lot of his stories really interest me.
