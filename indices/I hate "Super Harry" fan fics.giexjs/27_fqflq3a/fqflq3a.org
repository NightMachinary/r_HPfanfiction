I have seen 'Super Harry' done well. But the distinction is that he's super compared to others his age. When up against titans like Voldemort or Dumbledore he's nothing great. He's getting there, but still behind. I'd personally recommend Taking Control by fake a smile. Sadly it's sequel never got finished, but it's one of the most well written HP fanfics out there that I've read.

Another good one that I really liked was Partially Kissed Hero by Perfect Lionheart. This one I only recommend if you enjoy very detailed explanations about lore, and evil Dumbles, and a ridiculous plot wrapped up in a semblance of seriousness. It is a well written story in my opinion. But it was never finished sadly.
