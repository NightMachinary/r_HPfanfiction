That's where Dumbledore's plotting abilities could come in, plan a trap of some sort for Voldemort. Or I've also seen a few fics where harry gets the ministry to work with him, like Amelia bones and the unspeakables. In which case you now have more people to fight in the final battle, plus they're actually trained people rather than students. But essentially, with deatheater numbers the most obvious solution is to work on a trap.
