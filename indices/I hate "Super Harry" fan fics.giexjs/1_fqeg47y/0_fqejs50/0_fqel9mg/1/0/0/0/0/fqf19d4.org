I never said Harry didn't off Voldemort, just that he didn't do it alone. For instance, with my example of the teachers hold him off? The one who sneaks up and kills him? Bam, Harry. Plus I mentioned the ministry when you pointed out deatheaters, because the ministry could handle the deatheaters while a trained up harry faces Voldemort.

Although keep in mind this is fanfiction, so even if Harry isn't the protagonist of a fanfiction, there is nothing wrong with that. It's just much less common and sought after.
