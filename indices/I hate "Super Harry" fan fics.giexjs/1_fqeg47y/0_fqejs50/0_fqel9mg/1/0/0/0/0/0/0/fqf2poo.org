I did specify sneaking up would be anticlimactic, but I also provided the option of a trained up harry facing Voldemort while all the adults held off the deatheaters. Plus extras in a battle could always take potshots at Voldemort randomly since the prophecy implies only harry can kill Voldemort, not that only harry can injure Voldemort. And the "chosen one" doesn't have to mean he finished the whole war by himself. Just means he'll be the one to finally kill the dark lord.
