Who COULDN'T help harry with defeating Voldemort? All the professor's have specialties that they could help harry work on, or help Dumbledore build a plan that plays to each of their abilities. For instance McGonagall using transfiguration to trap or otherwise impede Voldemorts ability to move as easily and Flitwick's dueling specialty and Dumbledore's versatility/power to occupy Voldemort's actual face to face fighting while someone else sneaks up to put him down for good. (Sneak attacks are anticlimactic but just a rough example off the top of my head) I personally love stories that Flitwick steps up to help harry since he is afterall a former duelling champion.

In summary JK Rowling wrote in a decent amount of impressive adults fan writers could use as well as tons of adults that she didn't specify much about, which allows a technical non-OC character that the fan writers could develop more. After all, any adult teaching in that school should be better off fighting Voldemort than a virtually untrained child.
