I also enjoy a good time travel fic, it does make sense.

My thought is that people working together in numbers. No single person may be able to take down Voldemort, but a group of skilled wizards could speed up the horcrux hunt and once Voldemort is mortal there's a far better chance of taking him out.

Most people in the order were working in the dark without really knowing the relevance of what they were doing.
