That is something that bugged me about canon HP. The prophecy stated that he was born with a power that the dark lord knows not.. The ending given in the books is Harry's capacity for love and his willingness to sacrifice himself coupled with the fact that the Elder Wand was technically Harry's is what won the day..

However, that is utter bullshit. Voldemort would never DO those things. But he sure as hell knew what they were. Besides, the whole reason he survived was because his MOTHER had those same qualities. Voldemort has experienced several wizards willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of their loved ones. Did he understand it? No, he was incapable of understanding why someone would give up their lives for another. But he KNEW it.

Even if we factor in the Elder Wand. Voldemort KNEW the wand. Hell, it's the reason that he was carrying it in the first place. Even then, it's not a 'power' it's a tool. A very powerful one, it by itself is not a power.

Honestly, sometimes it feels like J.K.Rowling just couldn't decide how to make Harry powerful enough to fight Voldemort without making him godlike, so she came up with some cop-out chain of events to set the stage for Voldemort to disintegrate from a bloody Expelliarmus.
