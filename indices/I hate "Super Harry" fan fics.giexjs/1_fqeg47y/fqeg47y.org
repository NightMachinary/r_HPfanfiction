The problem with Harry Potter I would say is that the Dark Lord is tremendously powerful, that is, one of the most of powerful wizards of his age, and Harry - well, he's just a kid.

There isn't a "proper" form to deal with Voldemort other than relying on LUCK to solve the Voldermort problem in realistic terms.

That's why if you don't power-up Harry or deal with Voldemort thanks to immense luck, there's no point in the story.

Regardless, some OP fics are just ridiculous because of how powerful make Harry. In order to engage the reader you have to make the protagonist suffer a little, I would say. If not, where's the sense of adventure? ðŸ˜Œ

So there has to be balance. Harry has to be almost as powerful as Voldemort or equal to him, or the story has to be inventive enough to solve the Voldermort problem in a creative way.
