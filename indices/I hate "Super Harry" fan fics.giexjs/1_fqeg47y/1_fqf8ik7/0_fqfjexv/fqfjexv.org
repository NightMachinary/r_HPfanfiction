But that's the point right. We have the meta knowledge to know that Harry wins, If he didn't it would be a cheap "look I subverted hahaha", but the journey and situations he has to go through in order for the author to show he's ready to slay Voldemort is what the story should be about. (At first, more after Hogwarts stories guys)

The powers are cool and all but what does it mean for Harry to have and use them?

If Harry could one shot or even challenge Voldemort, he should just do it. Its one of the reasons people dislike Dumbledore.
