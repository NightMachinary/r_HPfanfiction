"Raw potential means dick all compared to experience and training." That's not necessarily true. The idea that a group of teens hold off Voldemort's best and the many other feats of Harry Potter year 2 and 3 prove that.

Magic has always been an equalizer, one of the reasons I don'y buy the gender power dynamic in a lot of fics.

Albus Dumbledor at age 114 was able to out duel a revived Voldemort while protecting Harry Potter. In what Harry described as some of the most impressive and creative magic he'd ever seen. Albus Dumbledore had constantly at ages 95-99 fought "Full Power Voldemort" to numerous stand stills.

And by wizard standards it wasn't very old.

Albus Dumbledore having all these titles most likely didn't attribute to workload and were adviser roles, and even for Hogwarts Minerva most likely did the day to day paperwork.
