Raw potential means d*** all compared to experience and training. A good Super! Harry shows the training, research, and backbreaking work that otherwise goes into becoming the next Dumbledore.

As for Dumbledore's seeming inaction, I actually have a reasonable explanation. At the time of his death at the end of 6th year, Dumbledore was either 115 years old (if we go by his canon birth year of 1881) or 150 (if we go with the number Rowling gave in an interview). In 1980, when the prophecy was given, he was 98/99 years old (using the former year of birth), almost a centenarian, extremely elderly by any standard you choose to use, Muggle or Wizard. Until 5th year, he had three full time jobs; a Headship, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, and Supreme Mugwump of The International Confederation of Wizards. That's a massive workload for anyone, let alone someone in the 100+ demographic. Simply put, Dumbledore is playing Twister and has stretched himself too far to do anything else.
