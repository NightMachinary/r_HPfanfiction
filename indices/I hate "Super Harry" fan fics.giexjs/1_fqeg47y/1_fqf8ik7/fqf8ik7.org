Well, unless it is a fic with major character death, we know that Harry is going to survive, somehow. What is even the point of "make the character suffer a little" when you know good and darn well that that amounts to nothing? Look, Super! Harry can definitely be overdone to a ridiculous extent, but he's the Chosen One of this story; if he's not at least as powerful as Dumbledore, then he doesn't have a snowball's chance in Atlanta in personal combat against Voldemort. Sunshine and roses aside, Dumbledore was the only person the Dark Lord feared, with good reason.
