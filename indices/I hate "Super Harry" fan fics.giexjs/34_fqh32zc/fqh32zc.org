I've seen a Super Harry done well by playing up the comedy angle...and setting it in a rather grim world that his talents can't easily fix. The juxtaposition is quite interesting to read.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/][Enter the Dragon]] has Harry turn into a dragon, with far beyond human strength, ridiculous magical reserves, nigh-invulnerability to magic (even the killing curse), comprehension of all languages, etc - but slower mental maturation than a human, so he's stomping through Hogwarts literally eating his problems for breakfast (the troll in the bathroom was quite delicious) and thinking that in order to be a good dragon, he has to dig himself a lair in the mountains and carry maidens off to it (all with their consent, of course) and have study groups with them.

Meanwhile, it's a world without international treaties, so travelling abroad means negotiating passage with the native wizards; where international people-smuggling rings use extensive mind magic to brainwash people into prostitution etc and pull kill switches in them for if they're rescued; where Muggle hunting has only recently become /unfashionable/ through Dumbledore's efforts; where, if Hermione had turned down the offer to study at Hogwarts, she would likely have disappeared within weeks to become a mindless pleasure slave and brood mare while her parents would lose all memory of her and be magically compelled to have more children for the kidnappers to someday harvest.

It's actually really well written, albeit incomplete (but actively updated).
