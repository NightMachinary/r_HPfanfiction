I'm currently reading through my random saves on pinboard, so it's very divided by category. Right now I have 7 stories open. They are all extremely generic Harry went to an orphanage and now is independent and the most sLyThErInE that have ever SlYtHeRiNeD. It's almost like reading different drafts of the same story. He is the first wizard to be polite to Gobblins ever, he can see right through Fumbledorks manipulations, he uses his muggleraised big brain to use wit and cunning to change the wizarding world with a few arguments. And he has a giant cock (both physically and metaphorically).
