The only SuperHarry I can stand is extreme post-hogwarts. There's a Dresden crossover that has Harry as an old, old man as the protagonist - he dies, goes on the train, only for someone to call on the phone requesting the Master of Death. He is summoned, makes an entrance, and transfigures a weird eldritch body into his human shape again.

He's pretty damn powerful in that story, but it feels believable, because he's like 120-170 years old by that point, with the majority of those used to hunt dark wizards.

Here's a link btw, just read the parts in order: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-dresden-files-the-master-of-death-part-iii.214737/]]

I think a lot of it is the attitude as well. Lots of these stories feature a little kid with an ego so large it eclipses Jupiter, and most of the time the story portrays it as acceptable. That creates a dissonance in the reader; you want to slap this kid for his comments, insults and general cringiness, but the story people are genuinely cowed or respectful towards him.

I think making a compelling character is the bigger problem. I like stories where the protagonist is absurdly powerful, but uses this power in ways that aren't cruel or disingenuous or hypocritical. Power comes with responsibility, and I like to believe that most people would do a vibe check with themselves if they suddenly found themselves being a god.

Interestingly, Core Threads does this well. This Harry is on the upper end of the power spectrum, but he has a very consistent and likeable characterisation. It sort of falls apart towards the end, but especially the middle, before he gets the three hallows, I consider the best super!harry from a characterisation standpoint.
