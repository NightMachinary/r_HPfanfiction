They can be fun, Often I find that super Harry is a way of saying “the fights won't be the focus here, he wins them” so that the author can focus on another element (wiz politics, romance, p0rn, etc) and I like that sometimes. When authors try to do everything in one story, it gets cluttered and not as good, so if one element is kind of removed, it simplifies the story in an often good way
