I started reading and the fic begins with an interesting concept I liked the Harry/snake bonding, but when Harry started healing werewolves and acting like some kind of mesiah I stopped reading, besides Harry wasn't a mature kid he was just a kid with the problems of the average kid/teen + a maniatic evil wizard trying to kill him, but despite of that he was just that a regular kid growing up, he had a higer level of maturity because of all of his suffering with the Dursley, but he was like an 11 years old acting one year of two ahead of him, in this fic Harry acts like a 30+ years old with the burden of being a mesiah that can heal any disease just with the ocassional fainting becsue of his huge power.
