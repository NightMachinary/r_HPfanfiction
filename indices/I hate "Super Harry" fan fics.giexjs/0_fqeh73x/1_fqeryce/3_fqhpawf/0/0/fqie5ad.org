There's definitely some theatricality in the character that was brought to life by Rickman.

I personally really enjoy the various conflicts that shaped him - when I've got my "writing brain" switched on, I find I can do more with Snape's character than for other characters. Lots of room for interpretation. Lots of unknown facets to his background and motivations that can be easily molded to make him redeemable or unrepentedly despicable. He's a fence-sitter, but disciplined, and very talented. Likewise he's in possession of skills and has influence that can make his character a fairly active component in a wide array of stories (Potions master, DADA skills, teacher/mentor, spy, legilimens/occlumens) - he's very interesting. His strained relationship with Harry, in the right hands, can lead to interactions, tension, and dialogue that you just can't have with any other character.

There's a huge amount of opportunity to expand his character to fit whatever story you write. Once of the best stories I read about him had him in post-war Britain living his life as a cross-dresser. And somehow the author was talented enough to make the character believable in that context. I doubt I could believably picture any other character doing that.
