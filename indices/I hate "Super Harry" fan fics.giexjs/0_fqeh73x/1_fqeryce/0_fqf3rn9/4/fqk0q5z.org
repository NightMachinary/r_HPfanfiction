Try Blood Magic by Gateway Girl. There is some mentioning of male/male romance and a kiss, but apart from that it is very tame. It is a Severitus fic, a fic where Snape is the biological father of Harry and most of the story is about that.

Two het stories that are relatively unknown and that I like to recommend are:

"The Seamstress and the loveable stray" by Katinka31 which is a story about Sirius and female OC that was written before OOTP came out, so some of the facts about Sirius don't fit the canon established in OOTP, but it is a great read anyway. linkffn(714431)

"The Potion's Master Apprentice" and the whole "Darkness and Light" series by R J Anderson. Snape paired with a female OC. linkffn(1546145) This too was originally written before OOTP came out, but later had some revisions to include the OOTP canon. It is not compliant with HBP and DH, yet interesting nevertheless.
