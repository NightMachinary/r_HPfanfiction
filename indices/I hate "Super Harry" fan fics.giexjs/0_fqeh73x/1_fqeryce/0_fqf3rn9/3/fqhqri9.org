I recently read a story called Azeroth that immediately became one of my favourite stories of all time. I tried finding a link to it for you, but for the life of me I can't find the exact story again.

It's a Harry/Draco story where Harry chooses to apprentice in Potions in his "8th year" and engages in an alchemy project alongside Draco.

I don't think I've ever read a story about Potions/Alchemy that is as legitimately believable. I firmly believe the author is a time-travelling alchemist and should be burned at the stake.
