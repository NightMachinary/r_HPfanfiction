I don't really care for slash fics too much, because in general, they seem to get a lot more crass and crude than other fanfics with straight romances. I mean, I've read /smut/ with fewer euphemisms for penis in it.

The only slash fanfic I can recall reading and enjoying was a Death Note fanfic, because I found it very funny. Light ends up eating a slice of cake in front of L, who's suffering under a sugar-free diet. Hilarity ensues.
