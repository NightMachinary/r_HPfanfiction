Lol I remember that one.

The problem with creating a "Super Harry" / "Overpowered Harry" story, is that you actually have to devise a method to make him powerful, and for the author that's really flipping difficult to do in a believable way. It took Dumbledore decades of experience for him to be as powerful as... Dumbledore. As far as I'm concerned, without figuring a way to "boost" Harry's power in a believable way, you're looking at similar decades of study and practice for me to believe Harry is comparably powerful.

The Santi's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][/Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived/]] did it quite well.

"Master of Death" versions of Harry are a shortcut to delivering a Super Harry in a not-too-objectionable way. Though Master of Death is such an undefined term that it kinda becomes Godlike!Harry unless you impose restrictions. My favourite interpretation of Master of Death Harry wasn't even a Master of Death-Harry story. Harry's animagus was a crow, and as crows are historically descibed as omens/messengers of death, when he was in that form he could see spirits of dead animals. Very big brain move by the author that I had little problems buying into.

Likewise, having Harry be fundamentally changed into a more powerful person. I.e. in Taure's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][The One He Feared]] you have Harry get Dumbledore's knowledge transferred to him. That's a "cop out" in a sense, but you at least easily believe his newfound abilities. And Taure doesn't gloss over the fact, he labours over how Harry acquired /decades/ of knowledge in a variety of skills. This allows us to suspend our disbelief - because we understand how powerful Dumbledore is, we can transpose that understanding to Harry. You can't "cheat" your way to power, the audience has difficulty with giving a shit if you just tell them your character is powerful without justification. Another fict that uses this method is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A long Journey Home]] wherein a "Jasmine Potter" lives for an exceedingly long time, we therefore believe she can conceivably become overpowered in that time frame. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] is another one like this.

One way of portraying a powerful Harry is to not focus on generalised power. Many fics go the "Harry understands magic /differently/" route, but that is difficult to write effectively unless you know what you're doing. It takes more than a "Rocky montage" to make me think your character is powerful. It is a much better idea to develop Harry's abilities in a restricted domain, such as:

- Your Harry chooses to invest his time studying Potions. Therefore I believe that he can acquire expertise in this topic with sufficient motivation.

- Your Harry invests more time practicing Transfiguration, I will therefore buy into the idea that he can overpower opponents using advanced Transfiguration.

- Your Harry receives tutelage in overpowering his spells to use the "brute force" method of beating down death eaters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8215565/1/Knowledge-is-Useful-But-Power-is-Power][Knowledge is Useful, but Power is Power]] is a story that goes over how an innately powerful Harry learns to apply his power more effectively. At least then the author provides the baseline power for reference, I can therefore believe that power can be /more efficiently applied/ to overcome obstacles.

I imagine the reason "magical cores" exist is because authors had a difficult time finding ways to develop their character's power. If you have "magical cores", it's easy:

- Your soul is the source of your power, as Harry has a bit more soul with Voldemorts Horcrux in him, that makes him a bit more powerful. But wouldn't that make Voldemort /less/ powerful?

- Using rituals to increase the power of your soul. Harry uses rituals and Dark Magic to become more powerful than normal.
