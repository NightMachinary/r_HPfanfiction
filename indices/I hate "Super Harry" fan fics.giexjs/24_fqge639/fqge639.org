The thing I dislike about Super Harry (Indy!Harry fics often do the same thing too) is that they usually have Harry just become all powerful off screen. It doesn't feel earned, especially when Harry just studies over the summer and is suddenly amazing because if it were that easy basically everyone would just apply themselves and really study.
