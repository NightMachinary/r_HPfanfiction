Deus ex Machina is "This shit came out of nowhere" Like the "Harry disarmed Malfoy so Harry was the Wand's Master so Harry won GG" was a terrible copout.

Harry finding the Stone earlier and using it to get tutoring from Slytherin, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, from Merlin and Morgana, finding a way to not have to literally walk to his death by summoning Herpo the Foul who made Horcruxes and finding a way to remove it from himself without suiciding, using the Stone, actually taking the Wand instead of letting it be buried with Dumbledore, and beating Voldemort by being the master of the one thing Voldemort fears, Death, makes more sense than that. The Master of Death being a title, but a title for someone who has all 3 Hallows and uses them wisely. Harry using the Cloak to sneak up on Voldemort and Reducto him in the skull makes more sense than that.
