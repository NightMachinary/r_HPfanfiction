Yeah, I don't think any of those endings would have made for a good story. They would have completely lost the story arc and the moral. There's a reason Harry is the protagonist and not Dumbledore.

Telling a good story isn't necessarily about what makes the most sense (though I actually don't think any of those endings would have made that much more sense, having a skilled teacher isn't going to make you super powerful in a few months).

Otherwise, the story would have been about Dumbledore and Moody taking Voldemort down in the early 70s. /That/ would have been realistic.
