Honestly I don't think they should have bothered with the Deathly Hallows at all. I would have been happier if maybe they had something where Harry discover's his power through some means. Could be from diving too deep past his limits, or some form of spiritual journey.. Hell, if they wanted to, they could have done the thing with the Horcruxes, had Harry die. Then learn about his power in the realm of the dead, come back and kill Voldemort. Would have been just as impactful.
