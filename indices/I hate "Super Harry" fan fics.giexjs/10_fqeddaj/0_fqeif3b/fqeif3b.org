But enhanced abilities for a 17 year old seem no less Deus Ex than Harry beating Voldemort because he can do the one thing Voldemort can't, accept death. Voldemort essentially offs himself due to his fear and power hunger. Harry just pushes him along through bravery and self sacrifice. It's a victory of virtuousness rather than power. Personally, I think that's a better story than Harry getting a power up from a Magical McGuffin. But I can see how others might disagree. I can see the appeal in an epic showdown.

And it's fanfic so I see the appeal of going in a whole other direction. I just personally find it a bit less compelling.
