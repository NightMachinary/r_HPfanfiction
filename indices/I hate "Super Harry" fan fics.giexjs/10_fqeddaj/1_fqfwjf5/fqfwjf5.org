  Though sometimes I do like ridiculously Super Harry. Reading Harry beat Voldemort using the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan, the Giga Slave, summoning Cthulhu, by literally being the God of the Bible, with the Kamehameha, with Hakai, having Zeno-sama erase Voldemort because Harry is Zeno-sama's friend... Does that count as a Guilty Pleasure?

I like those too--they give me the same feeling as when you're ridiculously OP in a game and just totally curbstomp every enemy. It's not fun for long, but while it is, it's a /blast./
