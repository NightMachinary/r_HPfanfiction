I like Super Harry to an extent because I like Harry beating Voldemort legitimately in a good even fight, rather than "Massive PlS and Elder Wand Ex Machina where Voldemort should have won effortlessly" from Canon. Watching a brutal back and forth spell off where Harry's enhanced abilities make him even with a Dark Lord 54 years his senior, and not "EXPELLIARMUS!" trying to fucking disarm Voldemort.

It's why i Like fics that power up Harry and don't buff anyone else, but just removes PIS and makes Voldemort use spells that aren't Avada Kedavra (Which by the Final battle had failed against Harry twice) and makes him years of Dark Lord abilities, but Harry's Super abilities make it a Shonen style Power vs Skill clash.

Though sometimes I do like ridiculously Super Harry. Reading Harry beat Voldemort using the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan, the Giga Slave, summoning Cthulhu, by literally being the God of the Bible, with the Kamehameha, with Hakai, having Zeno-sama erase Voldemort because Harry is Zeno-sama's friend... Does that count as a Guilty Pleasure?
