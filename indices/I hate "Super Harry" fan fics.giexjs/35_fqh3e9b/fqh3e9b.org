Really depends on the "Super Harry". I remember reading a crossover where Harry is raised by Saitama(from *One Punch Man*), and frankly it's hysterically funny, IMO, but then, Harry being super-powerful is played for laughs, as is the whole fanfic. I still follow it and wait for new chapters, as the author is still actively writing it.

There was another fanfic that sort of had an interesting premise, but it had so many stupid "Harry knows something that no one else knows because he's a curious muggleborn" without any sort of justification moments and it just annoyed the piss out of me to the point where I gave up trying to read through it both times I read it.
