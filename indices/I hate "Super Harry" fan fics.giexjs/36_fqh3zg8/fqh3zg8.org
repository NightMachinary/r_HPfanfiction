I did read a fic about Harry can defeat Voldemort after a fight, no talk and I kind of like it that way. Overpower comparing to the Original, but it had the part when Harry is trained by Dumbledore.

But you're right, the healing thing is ridiculous.

I once read a fic about Harry starting a Dark Wizard group with, like, half the Hogwarts, and the part he smiles evilly is repeated 1000 times or so.

By the way, anyone recommend a fic where Draco making a great life in the Muggle world? I like Drarry btw. Thank you.
