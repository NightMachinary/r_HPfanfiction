  I theoretically love stories with a very powerful Harry, but a lot of them are terribly written trash.

One powerful!Harry that I absolutely love is Fate is a Four Letter Word by Philo on ao3.

It is about a 40+ year old Harry who is married to Ginny and lives a quiet life as "man next door" with a career as a carpenter. Ron is an Auror and Hermione a lawyer. James, Rose and Albus have graduated while Lily and Hugo are in their last years at Hogwarts.

His live gets turned upside down when Ginny gets murdered. To the ministry it is an open-and-shut case while Harry and friends quickly suspect political motives. He and his friends have to catch Ginny's killer(s) and keep themselves and their children safe and prevent the rise of a new pureblood supremacist movement. Yes, there is an attempt at Harry's life bc he is powerful and thus seen as a threat by the enemy.

It is a great who-dun-it with plenty of plot twists and I can highly recommend it if you like that sort of story. While Harry is powerful, there is no powerwanking - he is still "just Harry".

Most people are put off by the main pairing (slash and Snape), but this is unjustified. Give it a try, you won't regret it. linkao3(4267422)
