I theoretically love stories with a very powerful Harry, but a lot of them are terribly written trash. Good heroes need adversity and obstacles to overcome (duh)! If Harry can just breeze through everything it's not interesting (duh)!

I want a super Harry story were Harry grows magically extremely powerful from a very early age, but that creates many problems for him. Examples:

Every wand he tries to use burns out after just a few days and he constantly has to get a new one. This could lead to all sorts of interesting developments. He could try staffs (since they can handle more power) but finds them too limited. He could try to make his own wands, but he learns that making good wands is a skill that will take him at least years of dedicated work to master. He could temporarily solve it by scrounging old wands from the room of requirements, but they don't work well for him and (of course) burn out fast.

Every time Harry casts a spell or tries transfiguration etc. the power is like a horrifically powerful firehose of streaming magic. Whatever spell he is trying to cast gets turned to 11 and Harry has to concentrate very hard to limit his magical output so that the spells he uses are even remotely useful.

When Harry daydreams or actually dreams, magic just leaks out of him and causes unexpected magical phenomenons around him causing him to have a room all to himself but leads to social isolations.

People fear him because sometimes his accidental magic is dangerous and his social isolation makes him lonely and a little bit resentful of all the fun and joy of other people being casually friendly with each other around him. His social interactions consist mostly of scholars and teachers and Dumbledore who becomes his reluctant mentor because there's nobody else who can understand powerful magic in the same way. Maybe Harry still goes to classes, but while he's the most powerful he is outshined by some scholarly types who understand magic much better in a theoretical way, including Hermoine who can even do magic better because she doesn't have to strain against her own magic to not explode the whole room. Maybe an adversarial relationship could be created based on that that later develops into a friendship. Or some other character. Whatever.

My whole fucking point is that a powerful super Harry could be written in an interesting way. It's like trying to write interesting stories about Superman. Writing interesting stories which have great power is difficult, but possible and I desperate want to read them. Alas, they are few and far between.
