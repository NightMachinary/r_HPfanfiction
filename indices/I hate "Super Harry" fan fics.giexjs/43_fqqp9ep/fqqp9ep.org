ugh i hate super anyone fics in general like i get the powerfantasy and all but I've read alot of genuinely good fics ones I would consider just as good if not better than many published books. And loads of those fics are hp fanfiction.

I get it this is mostly a fun thing that people do for fun and you should continue to do what you think is fun.

But from the perspective of the reader it can get a bit boring when there are no real obstacles for the protagonist. They don't have to struggle for much and its harder to get invested in their journey.

The story of Harry Potter as a series set up pretty ideal obstacles for someone who was like Harry. Even if someone stronger or smarter or better connected would fare much better Harry wasn't that person. So it was still a struggle for him.

The obstacles played to his weaknesses and flaws to a degree in my opinion. But alot of these super Harry or Hermione stories even when the obstacles change they play to the character's strengths. I think it would be so much more interesting to see a super Harry story where he is amazingly strong and competent but the obstacles are such that its still a huge struggle. He still has flaws and weaknesses and the flaws play into those. Change the world and plot to be a more challenging journey for this op character so you can have him be badass get that wish fulfillment but still be compelling.
