I've yet to see a story, and I'd like to sometime, which ups the ante on every character.

- Everyone worth their wand has an expanded trunk. Harry's is cozy and nice, with a small living/bedroom, a few bookshelves and an explosion-proof potion area, but Malfoy has a 1:1 copy to his father's mansion in his trunk. Even Ron got his mum to enchant his trunk with a replica of his room at the burrow.

- When channeling strong magic, the body reacts. People's eyes glow, their hair sparks, etc. It's part of being a wizard.

- Unique abilities are dime a dozen, and most wizards will eventually develop one as they grow into adulthood. Dumbledore for example is so good at transfiguration he's figured out how to transfigure space itself. Snape has a supernatural sense for potions, to the degree that he can literally make one up as he goes along. Voldemort has the ability to sense any sort of magic cast, performed or existing around himself. Just stuff like that.

- Dead houses are dead for a reason, and once a name has been declared so, it is dead for good. If a muggleborn with the same name wishes to create a new bloodline, they can of course take the name for themselves. However, inheritances work like they do and no assets sit around waiting for a dead family.

That last one may be overly indulgent, but I can't stand that trope.
