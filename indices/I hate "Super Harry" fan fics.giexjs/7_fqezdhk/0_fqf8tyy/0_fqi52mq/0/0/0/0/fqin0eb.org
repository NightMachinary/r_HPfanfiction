Well, it's not canon - differences in magic power is canon, see the sea cave scene where Voldemort's enchanted boat was limited to one adult wizard and couldn't detect Harry's power. It is likely growing, though, as people learn and grow older.

Although whether skill/experience or power, people have different abilities to work magic. I usually assume, that most specialise on a few spells for their work. That explains why there's an economy - not everyone can use magic to make clothes, for example. Or to repair complicated items.
