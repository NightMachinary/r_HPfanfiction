  Stories where most wizards can't even cast a shield charm always evoke a sense of loss in the reader, as there are examples of magic that are so much grander in the past, creating an implicit suggestion that magic is dying.

I don't think this is the case for two reasons:

1. This could just mean that most people just never need combat magic after Hogwarts. Most wizards are probably great at summoning charms and cleaning charms. But most wizards probably aren't skilled with shield charms for the same reason most Muggles don't know martial arts. It generally isn't needed in daily life.

2. The people we learn about in the past of canon are the Dumbledores, not the Mafalda Hopkirks, but there were probably mostly Malfalda Hopkirks in the past too.
