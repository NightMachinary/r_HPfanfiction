I usually dislike the trope of "most wizards are incompetent at magic", which is sadly supported by canon. I'd like to see a truly magical AU where everyone is equal in power, but there exists natural talent. Stories where most wizards can't even cast a shield charm always evoke a sense of loss in the reader, as there are examples of magic that are so much grander in the past, creating an implicit suggestion that magic is dying.

An AU that takes place in a perpetual magical golden age (in the sense of innovation and magic, not socio-economic) would be very interesting to read.

Alas, most stories of this type I've read glorify and justify magical racism through bloodlines, which inverts the trope and makes it equally bad, just in the other direction.
