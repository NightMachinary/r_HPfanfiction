To be fair “To shape and change” is actually one of the more down to earth Super!Harry there is, in the sense that at least the author made the effort of seeking out mechanisms for Harry's badassery that didn't involve a little kid being instantly smarter and more powerful than every other character (the whole werewolf thing was because of his parseltonge, although this brings up the question of why others healers with the ability didn't do it sooner).

Really, there are plenty of stories that use the Super!Harry troop much worse than this one. You've seen nothing until you read one of the ones where little six-years-old Harry manages to crumb-stomp all his possible oppositions while getting his degrees at many different muggle universities, building up an harem big enough to make all sultans in history green of envy because of his thousands of noble titles and mastering all known types of magic without a wand (which is supposed in-story to be difficult and yet Harry has no problem).
