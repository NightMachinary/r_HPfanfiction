It is actually a pet peeve of mine that Voldemort is basically god, no one can touch him. I mean horocrux or not he should be able to "die" and go back to haunting as a specter until true dead.

I mean yes, he is powerful, but just like a special forces guy, a bullet to the head should take him down. a thirty year veteran could be taken down by an 18 year old that was trained and has experience. Would not be easy, but a lucky shot should take them down.

Thrity guys should be able to get him if Voldemort is not using something like Fiendfyre all around him. But no, it is imposible because he has the power of a god, the reflexes of a snake, the strenght and endurance of giants, and the luck of the devil.
