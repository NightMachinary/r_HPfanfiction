Yes, but then a good and trained harry, being the Chosen One, should be able to take him, or at least come close to match him if he plans. On a pure fight I mean, not on esoteric knowledge. A cutting curse is all you need, what does it matter if you know 1000 ways to kill?

I have seen many posts saying that a 17, or even a 15 year old, that it is imposible to even touch him, that that makes him a super harry. When Voldemort most likely stopped training since a while ago to concentrate on taking over, and harry training and ability on Dada should at least put him close in a pure one on one, but he is so very easily overpowered it is ridiculous.
