I don't know the books themselves actually, my examples are from the movies, and I don0t know how different they are.

Don't know if it's played different in the book, but harry stayed there in the background doing absolutely nothing at all, though I can see he was most likely unable to move because of magic pressure shenanigans. Like had there been one more person, a competent/experienced one, could they have won while voldemort tied magic with dumbles someone else casting a cutting curse or AK?

Had Harry actualy trained for war, could he have done more? You say they never saw anything like it before, and I am of the same mind, but would it have been imposible to teach him more? Make him more than a liability, make some hit and run, sneak a peek and shoot something to make voldemort twitch?

Also, Molly is pretty amazing and exemplifies it, if a mother that has not trained for war or not kept in shape at all can beat one of the most "powerful" witches like bellatrix? Why can a Harry trained in fighting not at least survive him? not match him, voldemort could probably, if he actually tried kill, him with some esotheric use of magic, but at least realistically survive him.

Alright, going back to what I wanted to say, a fanfic with a harry trained better for actual fighting could realisticaly do much better than he does on the movies. Not match voldemort but give him pause, at the end at the last fight he matched magics, so magic power itself should not be THAT different.

Voldemort should be able to be distracted by harry while allies run, hit and run tactics could do something, had he no allies or overwhelmed in numbers if he does not escape there should be a chance of making him run or killed.

It's just that, the cliche of only you can do it, no one else has any way to do it annoys me.
