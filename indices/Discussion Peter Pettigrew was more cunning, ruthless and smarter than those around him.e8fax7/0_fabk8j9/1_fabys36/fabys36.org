  Sirius was already thin and haggard from Azkaban and, I could be wrong, but I believe Peter specifically sought out a wizarding family.

Yeah, I think Sirius did say that Peter would have sought out a Wizarding family in order to keep an ear to the events of the wider world.

Sirius had to live in a cave and live off rats. He relied on rare chances to eavesdrop and get information.

Peter, on the other hand, found a Wizarding family with a bunch of kids so he ate like a king, could listen in whenever he wanted, and lived the life any fugitive would dream of up until Sirius escaped Azkaban.
