Peter is cunning but you are giving him way too much credit lol. /He/ didn't trick the aurors, they already thought that as Dumbledore thought that because James and Lily told him that. It helped that Sirius said it was his fault (I think) and Barty/Fudge didn't try to investigate. And Peter killed 12 muggles by blowing up the street with the Blasting Curse.

  He was able to become an Animagus

With the help of a transfiguration prodigy.

  He was also able to stay hidden in years as a rat, we see Sirius in hiding as his dog Animagus, that's not good for him, imagine that for Peter, before he came across the Weasley family
#+end_quote

Because no one but Lupin knew he was an animagus and we know what Lupin does in lieu of facing or admitting a truth.

Sirius was already thin and haggard from Azkaban and, I could be wrong, but I believe Peter specifically sought out a wizarding family.

  I'm sure Voldemort could have contacted Bellatrix Lestrange or Lucius Malfoy, but it was Peter Pettigrew that found him, that helped bring him back.

Voldemort was a wraith who had to posses rats for 12 years he couldn't contact anyone. Lucius wasn't trying to look for him and Bellatrix was in Azkaban without a way out. /Peter/ knew about Voldemort in 1992. He /only/ sought him out because he had no where else to go.

TL;DR Peter just had the stars align for him in the form of trust, grief, incompetence, and cowardice
