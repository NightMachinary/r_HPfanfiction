When people talk about the Marauders being Animagus, they seem to forget that they all became one when they were underage, not saying you forgot, just in a general sense.

If it's difficult for a full blown Witch or Wizard to be one, it by sure is difficult for a teenager, to become one.

I could definitely see Pettigrew as a Slytherin, I often think many of the time he acted like a sniveling coward, he was very smart, and acted, of course I could be giving him too much credit, but with everything he's done, it wouldn't surprise me in the least.
