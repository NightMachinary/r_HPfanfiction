I believe JKR has said that the sorting hat might have put him into either Slytherin or Gryffindor at the sorting, and that this was one of the people she had Dubledore refer to when telling Snape in DH that he "sometimes think we sort too soon." So yeah, I think she definitely imagined him as cunning when she wrote him.

Remus says in PoA that he "needed all the help he could get" with becoming an animagus, and that it was therefore lucky Sirius and James were "the cleverest students in the school" and could help him. It seems they tried for a very long time and then "finally managed it" in their fifth year. He absolutely couldn't have been completely stupid to manage it, although I think the impression from the books we get is that he wasn't necessarily book smart. Voldemort makes fun of his potioneering abilities in GoF and Sirius makes fun of how much he struggles to describe the physical appearance of a werewolf in their DADA OWLs. He killed the twelve muggles with a single spell, however, and that was clearly very powerful magic and means he must have been good at some types of magic.

He was never seen as as good or as brave as the other three Marauders, which is said to be the reason that nobody suspected he was the secret keeper. Sirius and James clearly knew he would not be suspected, and from that point of view the idea to switch secret keepers worked as they intended. In PoA Sirius says that Peter began passing information to Voldemort a year before the Potters died, and a year is a very long time to be a successful spy. It's suggested in the books that Remus thought Sirius was the spy and vice versa, so that maybe explains part of his success. Maybe Peter even helped to sow those seeds of doubt between his best friends.
