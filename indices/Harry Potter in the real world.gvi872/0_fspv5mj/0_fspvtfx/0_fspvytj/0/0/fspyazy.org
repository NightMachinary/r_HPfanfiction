It's your story, so I'd say to go for it. I would go for the secrecy aspect, and what it means for them to be here. Think about it, suddenly these fictional character are living and breathing in our world? If they are real, is every story we made real too? What could happen if the world found out Harry Potter and his band existed? Or the chaos the Death Eaters could unleash in a world were THEY are the only magicals? Sorry, I'm just rambling at this point.
