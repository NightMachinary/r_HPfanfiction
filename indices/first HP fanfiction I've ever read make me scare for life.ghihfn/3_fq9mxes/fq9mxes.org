I had a similar one when i was like 11. Kept thinking that it was sick and stuff and cuz of my insecurities couldn't even ask my parents. Surprisingly got the talk by watching “How I Met Your Mother” instead of parents. 👌 i still don't like though fics which are mainly about pairings and smut. Probably a everlasting trauma.
