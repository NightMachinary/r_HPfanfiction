I admire the effort that went into this post, but to echo another poster, I too hesitate to urge new readers to drop what they're doing and head to DLP. While it undoubtedly hosts useful tools and excellent writers, there is also a very troubling atmosphere of casual misogyny that stands to alienate a large portion of new readers. (Just consider the conversation that takes place on [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=28631&page=4][this]] page about whether an eleven-year-old Hermione can be considered a cunt, or merely a bitch. This kind of thing is toxic, not snarky or caustic.) Maybe point to the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/][DLP C2]] instead of to the messageboard?
