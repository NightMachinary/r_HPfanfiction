That post in specific references how an AU Hermione should be handled (ala Hermione in the [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2740505/1/Wit-of-the-Raven][/Wit of the Raven/]]) . The two posters did not say that in an attempt to demean women in general. While DLP users couldn't care less about being politically correct, they aren't shortsighted. Even if they /were/, dropping an entire website full of intelligent and critical reviews just because you disagree with the mindset of a few users is a /terrible/ idea.

The message board is a very helpful tool - something I certainly wish I knew about when I entered the HP fanfiction world. The vast majority of people that post there are quite intelligent, have spent quite a bit of time reading fanfiction, and provide insightful reviews and criticisms of more fanfocs than on the C2.
