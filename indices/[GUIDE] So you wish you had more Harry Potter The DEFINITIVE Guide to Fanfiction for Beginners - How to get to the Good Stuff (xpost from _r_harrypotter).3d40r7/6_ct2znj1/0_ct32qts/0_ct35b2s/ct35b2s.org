Forgive me, I misspoke earlier---the character in question is Pansy, not Hermione. But you're deliberately misreading the discussion if you think that exchange is meant innocently. (Flip to the previous page, where a reader applauds Harry's sexual assault of Pansy because it will "cow" her.) This is an extreme example (although not the most extreme I could have chosen), but it's not an isolated incident or mindset.

As I said in my first post, none of that's to say that a significant portion of the discussion on DLP isn't constructive or insightful. (I follow several threads myself, and occasionally contribute posts.) But as the point of your guide is to nurture fandom growth, I am inviting you to consider that DLP may be more than just "politically incorrect," and that its less attractive characteristic stand a good chance of alienating new readers.

Edited for phrasing and grammar.
