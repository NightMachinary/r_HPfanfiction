  I advise against reading a fic purely for romance. There's a reason why the DLP forums have so few fics in their romance subforum - it's really hard to write good romance and almost always comes across as a mushy, completely overdone criticism of canon.

I disagree with this. Romance fics simply follow the same rule as your first point. 99% of everything is terrible.
