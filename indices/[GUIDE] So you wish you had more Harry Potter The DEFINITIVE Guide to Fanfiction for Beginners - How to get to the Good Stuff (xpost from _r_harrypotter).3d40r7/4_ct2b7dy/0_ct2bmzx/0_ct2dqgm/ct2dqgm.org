How about my recs ([[http://oddhour.tumblr.com/tagged/fic%20recs][1]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3an5ot/great_fics_from_hpff_primarily_oneshots_minor/][2]]) or [[/u/cambangst]]'s [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/reviews.php?reviewerid=209695][review page]] (he's written over 1200 reviews)? I'm sure he'd be happy to filter out the ones he really likes.
