Dark!Powerful!Harry is... wait for it... in the /Dark Arts/ subforum of the Library. There are quite a few canon-compliant stories on DLP. Your stereotype of the entire community is an absurd overreach, I think.

I have yet to see a well-written, thought-out, and engaging story rejected from DLP just because it doesn't have a Dark!Powerful!Harry, or because it isn't AU. Indeed, such stories are what you'll find in the General subforum of the library.

Regardless, if you find better sources of material, that provide well-written, engaging stories, and attempt to filter out ones that are not, feel free to link it here. I'll probably add it to the OP.
