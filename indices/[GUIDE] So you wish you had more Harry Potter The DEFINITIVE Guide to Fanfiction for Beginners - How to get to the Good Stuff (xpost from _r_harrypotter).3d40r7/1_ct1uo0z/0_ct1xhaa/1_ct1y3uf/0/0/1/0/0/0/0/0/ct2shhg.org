Oh, I know where I find my fics; I've been in fandom over ten years now. I'm partial to Painless J's rec lists, for starters. I've found the most effective way to find stories is looking up rec lists until you find someone with your taste. Hence why you think DLP is the best place to find stories-- they rec what you like.
