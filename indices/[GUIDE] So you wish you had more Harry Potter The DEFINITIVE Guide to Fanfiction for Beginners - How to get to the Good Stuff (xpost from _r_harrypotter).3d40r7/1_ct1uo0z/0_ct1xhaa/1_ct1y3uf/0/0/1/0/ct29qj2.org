No, it really doesn't. What would fix it is to be upfront that these are DLP-based recs and that the recs you're going to get have a certain slant --- and to explain in the OP the type of slant you're going to get.

Adding a link to a DLP thread (which requires registration in order to even ask) that has slightly looser standards --- where, admit it, you're likely to be insulted if you ask for something going against the majority of DLP --- doesn't make it a definitive guide for beginners.

Look, I don't post to DLP, because if I did, I'd get bogged down in yet another venue for Internet debates, and I'd never get anything done, but I do think that DLP library is a valuable resource to the fandom and is generally quite good at pointing out flaws and bad taste even in fics that fit the DLP's general slant; and I follow many of the discussions, as they are interesting and informative, and there are some users whose postings I follow personally; and I believe that Taure is a highly intelligent and well-informed individual whose opinions I respect; but, if you can't find any good non-DLP sources, then don't frame your post as a general guide for beginners, frame it as a DLP-based guide for people interested in DLP-style stories.
