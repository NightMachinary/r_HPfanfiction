I know that I for one love Slash fics and DLP seems to hate them with a passion. Well-written or not, they aren't the sort of story they rec.

That doesn't mean that Slash stories can't be well written. There are lots of other ways to search. DLP as your primary fic source really is cutting out large areas of fandom.
