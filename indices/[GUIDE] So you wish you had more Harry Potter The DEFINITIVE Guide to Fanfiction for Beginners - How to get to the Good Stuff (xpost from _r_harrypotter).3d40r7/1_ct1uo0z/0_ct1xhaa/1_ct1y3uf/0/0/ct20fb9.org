With all due respect, when you write a post that you advertise as "The DEFINITIVE Guide to Fanfiction for Beginners", it's on you to find some less skewed sources. If you can't find them, then don't advertise your post as "The DEFINITIVE Guide to Fanfiction for Beginners".

I'll take a look when I have time, but the only constructive criticism I can give at the moment is to please fix the OP to be explicit that these guides are catering to a specific taste, and describe what that taste is, ideally starting with the topic.

Ultimately, there are several subfandoms that rarely intersect, and all of them have their "best of", some of which would be utterly intolerable to many of those outside of that subfandom. The best way I can think of to assemble a beginner's guide is to do it by subfandoms and subgenres: best DLP-style, best Dramione romance, best Harmony romance, etc.. That, in turn, might be possible to accomplish by finding people of good taste in each subfandom and asking them for their recs. (Once, someone came to a forum I hang out on asking for Dramione. I am not a Dramionist myself, but I knew one whose approach to the pairing was one that I could respect, so I asked her for the recommendations and passed them on. I don't, generally, read Dramione; but if someone will read it, and they will, they might as well read good Dramione.)
