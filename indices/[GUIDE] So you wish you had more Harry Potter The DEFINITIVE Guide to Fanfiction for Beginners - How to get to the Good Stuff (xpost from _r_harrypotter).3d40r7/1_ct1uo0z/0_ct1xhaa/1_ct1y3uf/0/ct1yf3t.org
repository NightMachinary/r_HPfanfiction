You make a valid criticism of my post. In my defense, these were the best resources I have found for jumping straight in to the fanfic world. Remember - no list is exhaustive, especially for fanfiction. But - if you do come across a resource or doc better than DLP for these, please do tell me! I'll add it to the doc as soon as I can. I, personally, couldn't find such a resource.
