Yes, but, collectively, DLP's standards for non-Harry-centric fic are much, much higher, which means that a lot of TastefullyPowerful!Ambitious!Harry fic that's mediocre gets in, while non-Harry-centric fic (or fic where Harry has to share the spotlight) is lost. For evidence of that, go to the ACA thread and count the number of instances of comments along the lines of "Not about Harry: -1" (not a direct quote of a specific comment, but the general spirit), not to mention the casual misogyny sprinkled throughout.

For that matter, ACA didn't make Taure's list or your list. Are you really going to tell me that every single fic on your and Taure's list is --- as a recommendation for a generic "beginner" --- better than ACA?

You have the right to your tastes of course, but, like I wrote in my original post, it's inaccurate and pretentious to promote your lists as some sort of a generic guide for a beginner in HP fanfic.
