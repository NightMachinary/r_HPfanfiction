It's a useful guide, if inaccurately --- I would argue pretentiously --- titled. That it's a /Dark Lord Potter/ guide should be front and centre, not mentioned in passing.

That it's a DLP guide means that it skews in a particular direction: generally serious fic, featuring a powerful (albeit usually tastefully so), ambitious protagonist, and operating on a generally epic scale; and, unless it's an AU taking place in an effectively new setting (like Alexandra Quick), Harry Potter /must/ be that lead protagonist.

This means that this guide generally neglects the comedic and lighthearted fics, and fics that occur on the slice-of-life scale, which is unfortunate, because a big part of Potterverse's charm is not Harry Potter and his magical proficiency but the playful, whimsical setting of wizards who wear pointy hats and use trained owls for communication and have a weird --- to us --- perspective on the world. This alone makes Taure's list woefully incomplete for Beginners. [1] OP's favourites are a bit better in this respect, but still miss a lot of the good comedy (list available upon request).

To be fair, the DLP Library isn't bad, and there's a sizable Humour section; but the ratings themselves tend to have a modest signal-to-noise ratio --- and Heaven Forbid Harry is not the main protagonist or that someone else in his generation be better at magic than him!

[1] Also, while I read /What would Slytherin Harry Do?/ and enjoyed most of it, recommending it as a must-read... Well, imagine, for a moment, an AU of PoA told from Draco's perspective, describing how he first successfully manipulated those around him into sentencing Buckbeak to be executed, then, in an awesome gambit, simultaneously got Sirius Black captured and Kissed, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger expelled and their wands snapped for attempting to aid in Black's escape and for Time-Turner abuse (thus putting himself in line to inherit the Black fortune), and, in the end, Buckbeak's execution was only delayed by a day; and it's all told like it's the funniest thing ever, and there aren't any permanent consequences to the protagonist; somehow, people trust him just as much as before. /That's/ basically how the later chapters of WWSHD read to a non-DLPer.
