  - At 14 years old, Harry wasn't really ready for the Triwizard. If not for Hermione and Barty Crouch Jr, the poor boy would likely have done himself a whole lot of damage if left to his own devices... Of course, if not for Crouch he wouldn't have been IN the tourney, but that's another story. So, I asked myself what if things had gone a bit differently? What if his broom hadn't shown up? What if other... opportunities presented themselves?- There are those who say, if you're not cheating, you're not trying.
