It truly takes first place when it comes to ridiculous. Its also a good candidate to take first place in the categories "chauvinistic", "(borderline) pedophilia", "rape apologetic".

I'd even add some "pro-slavery" there just for good measure, since they never even try to find ways to break the concubine bond (or however that shit was named).

This fic is the epitome of the dark side of fanfiction. I don't know what the fuck the author was thinking while writing this, but I'm sure it would be disturbing to know.
