Had some good ideas not related to the actual harem part. Mainly the automated potion making the twins took care of or the enchanted firearms that pulled ammo from another area. Mainly the muggle technology being used to improve the magical world or magic being used to improve muggle stuff. Rest of it is ridiculous. I feel the reason it hasn't been updated in over 4 years is because theres no where else to go with it besides making it a crossover. It's extremely long and a mess at this point. Basically if there has to be a scorecard for relationships at the end of every chapter, then it has gone too far. Some of the chapters are just stuff you can skip because they don't really impact the rest of the story enough. First time I read a good bit I was drunk. When it got weird I figured I was taking stuff the wrong way because of the alcohol. Read it sober and wished I was drunk because it seemed better that way.
