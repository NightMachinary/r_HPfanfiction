linkffn(The Harem War) for the curious and yes it really is that ridiculous. I'm not even doing it justice there, I didn't even mention the Potter-Black war room or the distinction between wife, consort and concubine or the pregnancy announcements or the collars they wear (Minnie (yes Minnie) likes hers even as a cat!) or that Sirius used to bang his concubines as Padfoot.

I'd also just like to clarify that this is in no way a crack!fic. It is 100% serious and was written in 2010, long after this should be acceptable. The author does have some other pretty decent fics, this one just seems to have got away from him.
