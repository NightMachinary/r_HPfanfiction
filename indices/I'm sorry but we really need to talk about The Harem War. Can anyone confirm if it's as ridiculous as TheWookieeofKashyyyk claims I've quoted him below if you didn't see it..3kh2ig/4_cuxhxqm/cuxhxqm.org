I nope'd out after the author had Harry discussing the purpose of Walden McNair's job as executioner for the Ministry. They came to the conclusion that his job was not to execute dangerous animals but rather unwanted muggleborn concubines. It was then never mentioned again. WTF!! The systemic rape and slavery is bad enough but the characters have more issue with that then murder.
