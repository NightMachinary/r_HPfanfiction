Linkffn(7069251) - MuggleOC/Harry, I didn‘t like the ending very much, but still enjoyed the fic immensely.

Linkao3(11745900) - WIP - One of my favourites and I can‘t recommend it enough. I know that the summary really doesn‘t sound too great but I urge you to give it a try. It deals very well with the problems we often have in SI-stories and makes good additions to the HP magic, also I find the characterization of Slytherin and its power structure to be one of the most believable in the fandom.
