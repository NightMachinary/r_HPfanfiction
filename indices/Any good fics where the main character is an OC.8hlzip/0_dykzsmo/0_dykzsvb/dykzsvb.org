  I'm a little upset with the creativity of my and my twin's names. I get that it's because our father's name is Arthur, and I was an unexpected --- though pleasant --- surprise. But Guinevere is just the English version of Ginevra! That's so- Wait. What do I even care about that? I'm the eighth Weasley. In the Harry Potter universe. Ginny is my twin sister. Oh god. (Well, at least magic is super cool. Right?)

  When muggle Kate Foster first met Harry Potter, he saved her...by breaking her fall. She knew then and there that he had a major hero complex. "I hope that you don't make a habit of this saving people thing. You aren't very good at it." She didn't know that he was a wizard, or that he was destined to save the world. Very slight Harry/OC.
