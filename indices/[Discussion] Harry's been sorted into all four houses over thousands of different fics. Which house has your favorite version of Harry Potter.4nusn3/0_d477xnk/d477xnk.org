I tend to love Harry in Hufflepuff. They are very rare, but I've liked the ones I come across. Harry tends to be friendlier. Hufflepuff helps him adjust better from life in a abusive house. And like serenehime said for Slytherin, Harry tends to have a wider circle of friends and interactions when he is in Hufflepuff.
