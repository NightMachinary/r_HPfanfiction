  I think because Harry is a Gryffindor in canon, authors can sort him there with making him a stereotypical Gryffindor, whereas stories that sort him elsewhere are usually written with the intention of writing a fic centred around him being in that house. This often leads to him being a stereotype of that house and making him sort of one-dimensional.

This is very interesting to me because it's been something I've been considering for my own story lately. A reviewer commented that the changes I've made to the characters (it's a 'Malfoys adopt Harry' AU, because I have a problem) mean that Harry and Draco don't really fit Gryffindor and Slytherin, respectively, anymore. They said this makes them excited for my story to get to Hogwarts. Taking a step back, the reviewer is absolutely right - Harry's influence has made Draco more of a Gryffindor, and life with the Malfoys has made Harry's character much more Hufflepuff than in canon.

I was originally going to leave them in their canon houses, but now I feel like that would be adhering to canon 'just because' and wouldn't make sense for the story. OTOH, I don't want to fall into the typical 'different Sorting' tropes and make that become what the story is about. :/ I mean, my /premise/ is an overused trope, I don't need to add more!
