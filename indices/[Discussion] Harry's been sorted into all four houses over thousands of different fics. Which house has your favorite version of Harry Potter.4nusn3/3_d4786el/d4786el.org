Gryffindor because it's is usually the most versatile (although it could just appear this way since he's a Gryffindor in most stories).

It makes him befriending/dating Slytherins a story in and of itself. Of course, he can do the reverse in Slytherin too, but just as often you see him dismiss all the other houses for no reason other than they aren't cunning enough (read: they're 11).

I haven't read much Hufflepuff Harry but the ones I have usually have him sorted there because he wants to fly under the radar and be a loner, which can be quite dull.

Ravenclaw Harry is usually the most stereotypical i.e. he's a genius and everyone else is stupid (read: they 11).

I think because Harry is a Gryffindor in canon, authors can sort him there with making him a stereotypical Gryffindor, whereas stories that sort him elsewhere are usually written with the intention of writing a fic centred around him being in that house. This often leads to him being a stereotype of that house and making him sort of one-dimensional.
