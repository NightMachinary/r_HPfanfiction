Overall, I enjoy Ravenclaw Harry fics the most. I tend to find that I lean towards superHarry style storylines and as others have said, a Harry that is willing to knuckle down and learn is the one that's most likely to end up as a Dumbledore-esque wizard instead of a Ron Weasley (not that there's anything wrong with Ron, no Weasley bashing here).

However, if we talk about specific Harry incarnations, my favourites rarely come from Ravenclaw. My top 2 are the Harry depicted in linkffn(What Would Slytherin Harry Do) and linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff), but they aren't really what I'd call indicative of the typical house values.\\
The rest are actually 90% made up of plain old Gryffindor Harry; I like stories that branch off of canon at a certain, defined point so a large number of fics I read are ones where Harry was sorted into Gryffindor and went through his adventures as normal until the fan author decides to intervene.
