I skimmed a few chapters, because I actually forgot what it was about, lol. It was okay, I guess. I'd like to know how it goes, but it's not up there on my favorites.

It might also be influenced by the writing style, it felt a little stilted to me. Not saying that it's bad, just that it's not for me, :).
