I like Slytherin, because it usually features greater interaction with other classmates, and he ends up getting a wider circle of friends/contacts. I was never into the quest part of DH, so I like AUs where there's more community involvement, so to speak, haha.

That being said, I did enjoy that fic where Harry is a Hufflepuff. I haven't found a Ravenclaw fic yet that I enjoyed.
