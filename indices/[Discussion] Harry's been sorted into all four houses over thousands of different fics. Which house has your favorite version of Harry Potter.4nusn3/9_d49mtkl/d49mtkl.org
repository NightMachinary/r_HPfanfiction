It's Harry/Draco but the slash is not the main plot at all. The plot is that all the 7th and 8th years are resorted for house unity reasons. Both Harry and Draco are in Hufflepuff (I think Neville too iirc). Magic in Britain is somehow tied to certain plants (this is well explained but I'm forgetting it now) and muggle pollution is causing pockets of Britain to be magical dead zones. All the older students are researching the problem and hufflepuff house does a bunch of cool hufflepuff things to help fix it. There's also some really interesting fanon ideas about the hufflepuff common room and an initiation for new hufflepuffs.
