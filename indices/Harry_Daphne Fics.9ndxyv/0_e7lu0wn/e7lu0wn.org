Dude, this is coming from a huge fan of this pairing...

Just search on the reddit over there >>>>>

There are dozens of post like yours, I myself have done a couple and have suggested for other at least 20+ times. There aren't many new ones, so you usually get the same suggestions.

Just so I don't come out as a douche, I'll give a few suggestions of my favorites here.
