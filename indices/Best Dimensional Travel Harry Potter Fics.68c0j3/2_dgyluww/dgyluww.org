I replied to a thread similar to this with:

Well reality swapping fics without the Order being involved in the dimension travel. There's a bunch and a whole load more crossovers but sticking to popular Harry Potter ones.

Linkffn(9704180) I'm still here. A well know fic, still being updated but slowly. Harry unintentionally slips into another world.

Linkffn(11525673) A one shot that inspired linkffn(4040192) (Harry Potter and the girl that lived.)

linkffn(3959072) the final story in a trilogy that hasn't aged too well but is being rewritten. Alternate Harry swaps places with canon Harry.

linkffn(12446118) (Intersecting realities) The newest completed reality swapping fic. Harry WAS summoned by AN Order but left and found himself in an entirely new reality. For all intents and purposes Its the Canon world he swaps into. Not fantastic writing but new enough that you probably haven't read it.

Linkffn(12188150) technically time travel but its Tonks (Yes Order member but quickly begins to disapprove of their actions) so not the usual swap. Either way, injecting a new variable into canon universe.

Here is the DLP scryer search for Dimension travel I didn't set it to summon since the summoning charm etc might interfere with what you're searching for. Hopefully one of these will be worth reading.

Hopefully something on here is relevant to your search.
