Here is a collection of COMPLETED dimensional travel fics I have in my Favorite list:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052): Both Harry and Sirius before dimensional-traveled through the Veil. They started wrecking things in the new world, quite recklessly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/A-Riddled-Universe][A Riddled Universe]], linkffn(8678567): Again, the Veil served as the conduit for Harry and Sirius to a new dimension. Harry met a good Tom Riddle there, but also new bad guys.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6989327): This fic is IMO very similar in its feel to "Stages of Hope", but not as good. The story is about Hermione from an alternate dimension, where the war was basically lost, requesting help from the canon dimension. The canon Trio and Ginny eventually answered the call and went once more into the breach.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3959072/1/Deepest-Reflections][Deepest Reflection]], linkffn(3959072), is the sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within][The Darkness Within]]. Harry from that dimension made it to canon universe and swapped places with canon Harry. Lots of Angst in this fic.

[[https://www.reddit.com/user/InquisitorCOC/comments/?count=175&after=t1_ddouy31][Shadow Walks]], linkffn(6092362), and its sequel [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/8127][Shadow Walker]]: They are two highly UNDERRATED fics. The first one has Harry searching for Hermione across several dimensions, and encountering of course multiple outcomes. The second one is about one of the Hermiones he encountered during his travels going on her own dimensional travels, looking for a new home.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): My favorite dimensional travel, read it for yourself.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307886/1/Strange-Reflections][Strange Reflections]], linkffn(12307886): In the other dimension, James and Lily survived and raised Harry. They made it to canon dimension after canon Harry defeated Voldemort. To avoid confusion, the other Harry called himself 'Hadrian'....

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3571753/1/The-World-As-We-Knew-It][The World As We Knew It]], linkffn(3571753): Harry and two other canon characters ended up in a world without prophecies, and that world was even in worse shape. The author wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3872862/1/Rebuilding-the-World][an alternate version]] that was IMO even better, but unfortunately abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6730432/1/World-in-Pieces][World in Pieces]], linkffn(6730432): Harry got summoned to another universe by a desperate Order. The characters there took somewhat different roles than their canon counterparts. Snape, however, was good.
