Thanks for all the suggestions. I have read several of them (A Black Comedy, World in Pieces, Shadow Walks, Deepest Reflection and started but never finished Children's Crusade and Strange Reflections).

But most of the others are new to me. Stages of Hope is actually on my too read list but I was a bit worried about its premise and length. I have heard of A Riddled Universe but it just seemed an odd premise to me and I wasn't sure I would like it. The World as We Knew It is probably the most intriguing to me of the group I had not read.

I noticed you said "completed". Are there any non completed or in progress ones that are also worth keeping an eye on?
