I have not found a complete fic for Naruto in which the protagonist uses Konan's Paper Jutsu. There are a couple of incomplete ones that you can google for that are shit.

Also Konan's paper Jutsu is perfect for Harry Potter, its easily explained as magic if one tried, and i can just how... versatile it would be, much like Harry's butterfly spell in A Cadmean Victory, except with paper that could be sharpened, and used as a weapon easily.

I dont think anyone really writes about Konan's Paper Jutsu; it doesnt really have much in the Naruto wikia either, and in reality, its probably one of the most dangerous techniques, especially if the user specializes in Fuinjutsu. I can already think of a shinobi who with a flick of their wrist, sends out thousands of seals to paralyze, or incapitate, or form barriers around... In the midst of a war scene, that ability would be insane. Have a seal that absorbs a technique while simultaneously attacking with a modified storage seal, and shooting thousands of paper shurikun, that unfolded formed explosive tags...
