Japanese language fandom has a few great fics with a taste I don't normally see in the English one. (I haven't finished the two fics below, so the summaries are just a teaser based on my incomplete knowledge.)

/Dolohov/ is a story set in an era years before Harry's. Oscar Dolohov, 11 years old, son of Antonin Dolohov, has grown up under a constant monitoring by Aurors, with his parents prisoned in Azkaban, without a loving family for his entire life. He hasn't had much hope for things to improve when starting at Hogwarts, but an incredulously friendly girl named Est Prewett, whose parents were murdered by his father, begs to differ. Plot is well-structured and dialogues are witty - the author tries to imitate (the official Japanese translation of) JKR's style. I think that's fairly successful, although the characterization is undoubtedly affected by YA Japanese novels and manga. Main characters feel a bit overpowered and can fight using adult-level spells as 1st years (with reasons). Link: ドロホフ君とゆかいな仲間たち [[https://syosetu.org/novel/139995/]] (incomplete but updated)

/Houdini/ is a very Slytherin story of /Harry Potter/ in which Dolores Umbridge has a cunning administrative clerk named Vladimir Propp (the protagonist). The point of departure is when, after the resurrection of Voldemort, Lucius Malfoy decides to plant Propp (instead of Umbridge) as a teacher at Hogwarts. The tricky thing is, unknown to anyone else, Propp is barely magical - he is determined to survive by deceiving and manipulating both foes and friends. It looks like the story involves a lot of politics and the protagonist's inability of using magic brings interesting constraints. The first-person narration is not off-putting - it's actually a specialty of Japanese novels - and fits well with a character who does a lot of plotting behind the scene. The author is a manga artist and posts illustrations of his/her fics on Twitter. Link: フーディーニの魔法 [[https://syosetu.org/novel/147613/]] (complete)
