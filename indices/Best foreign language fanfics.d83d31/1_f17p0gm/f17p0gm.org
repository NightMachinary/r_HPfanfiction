[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11820851/1/La-partida-del-Maestro-de-la-Muerte][*/"La partida del Maestro de la Muerte"/* or quickly translated */"The Departure of the Master of Death"/*]], is one that I do really want to see translated.

I don't speak spanish so was trying to read a machine translated version. What was there certainly drawed me in, before the translation gave me a headache...

Quick translation of the summary (mostly machine, but I did clean it a bit.)

  Harry takes advantage of the fact that he is the new Master of Death and gets a second chance for Hermione, who died during the Battle of Hogwarts. Now he just has to wait the necessary years to see her again and, hopefully, love her as he should have from the beginning. The only thing he didn't calculate was the age difference...

Interesting things that were happening include; Hermione being picked by the elder wand, Harry's friends being suspicious about this new Hermione, and Hermione thinking that Harry is being cold to her because she shares the name of his "dead" friend.
