A long long time ago, I really enjoyed the German language Geheimnisse trilogy, dealing with a blind Muggle (or is he?) boy finding his way into Hogwarts. It was an adventure story with a similar vibe to early canon books, dealt entirely with OCs and took place during the second to fourth Harry Potter books.

However, towards the end, the author stopped updating regularly and updates only came a few times during the year and without any editting, so I slowly gave up on it. Just looked it up on his homepage though and apparently it's complete now. You can read it (including an English translation of the first two chapters) [[http://storyteller-homepage.de/Storys/Harry_Potter_Fanfic/harry_potter_fanfic.html][here]].

(NGL I really appreciate the old school page design as well...)
