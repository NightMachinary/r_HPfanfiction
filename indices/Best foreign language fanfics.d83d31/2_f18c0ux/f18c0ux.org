Harry Potter und die Schatten der Vergangenheit. German fanfic, can be found on fanfiction.de. Au after halfblood prince, starts with the defeat of Voldemort. It's epically long and while it's main theme is Hermione taking a potions apprenticeship under Snape and figuring out what the fuck is wrong with the dude and eventually getting into his pants, pretty much every character in Canon has a very well thought out story line that all interconnect beautifully.

Highlights are:

Harry's weird magical talents nobody really understands

Malfoy family story line, especially Lucius loosing his sight due to inbreeding

Sirius dealing with his metric fuckton of trauma and finding happiness

Snape being very in Character and his entire backstory

A dark lord that's actually a muggle

The first couple chapters are a bumpy ride, but it's easily one of best fanfics I've ever read.
