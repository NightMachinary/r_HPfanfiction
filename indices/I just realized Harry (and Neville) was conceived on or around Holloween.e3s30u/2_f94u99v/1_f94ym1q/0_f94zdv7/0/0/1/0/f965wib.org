I'm going to be honest, the nice, gentle encouragement I've been getting on tumblr has been a really big help during a really deeply horrible time for me - it's why I all but vanished from here and the bigger sites. I'm really happy just on there to be honest, having less of a spotlight, and then the pieces I feel particularly proud of I put over onto ao3. But as I said, there are like 300 of them now, so that's a lot of admin.
