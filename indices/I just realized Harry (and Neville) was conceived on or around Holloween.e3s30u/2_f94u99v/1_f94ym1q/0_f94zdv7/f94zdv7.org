Tumblr is permanent - I link all my tumblr ficlets on my blog in chronological masterlists. I have about 300 stories there, and though I do put some on ao3, that would be a huge undertaking to upload them all. A lot of them were written (and still are) during a time of significant emotional stress for me and I didn't want critical feedback, so I just kept them to tumblr where it was less likely to be picked apart.

I'm planning on uploading the Marauder stuff as one story once I have a more cohesive and filled structure. So far I have some major moments for them, but filling it in a little more as I go.
