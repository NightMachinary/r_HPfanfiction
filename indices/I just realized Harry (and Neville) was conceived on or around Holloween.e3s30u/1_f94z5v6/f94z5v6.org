Harry being conceived on Halloween is actually highly symbolic. There's an old Judeo-Christian tradition that prophets, and later saints, died on the same day they were conceived. It's one of the reasons why Christmas is in December, because it's nine months after Easter. (See e.g. [[https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/people-cultures-in-the-bible/jesus-historical-jesus/how-december-25-became-christmas/][here]].) So Harry is conceived on Halloween, and then two years later, he also "dies" on Halloween.

Combine this with the fact that there's a lot of saint imagery around Harry. Draco calls him "Saint Potter" in Book 2, and Lucius calls him "Patronus Potter" in Book 5, which means almost the same thing. Not to mention the whole Christ analog thing in Book 7. So having him be born nine months after Halloween just completes the picture.

(Granted, July 31 is also JKR's birthday, so I don't know what she would have done if it wasn't.)
