  Freeing the basilisk's eggs is Harry's priority, but other forces are pulling on the threads of his life: the nonhuman nations in the forest and under the lake, his promise to the elves, and a prophesied starchild, just to name a few. Fortunately, old and new friends will be there with him. Featuring wands, dreams, death quests, and deep magic.
