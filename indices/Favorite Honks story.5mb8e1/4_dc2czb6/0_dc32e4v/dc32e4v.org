What was the point of this comment? Did you really think OP would go "Oh, this random dude on the internet said that there are no good Honks fanfics. Clearly he has read every single fanfic that has ever existed and is able to say this with complete authority, not to mention that clearly this random person exactly shares his likes and dislikes with me."

Fanfics are posted here as recommendations, in the hopes that others will be able to share the enjoyment that you got from reading a particular fanfic. It makes literally no sense to make a comment like this.
