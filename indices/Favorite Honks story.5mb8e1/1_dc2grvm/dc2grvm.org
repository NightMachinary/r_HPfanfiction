There's the classic linkffn(Harry Potter and the Summer Of Change), which /Definitely/ shows its age but is still enjoyable.

Chelseyb1010's Honks stories were excellent (The Rebel and the Chosen, and The Half Blood Auror, and basically everything she ever wrote on ffn), but it appears that account has been deleted :(
