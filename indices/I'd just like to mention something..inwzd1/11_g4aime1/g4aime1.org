Eh it's a convenient moment to start with if you want to write a Weasley and Dumbledore bashing fic. I doubt many people actually believe it's unreasonable within a canon reading, it's just easy to twist into a ‘dumbledore and the weasleys were conspiring to befriend and control Harry' scene if that's the story you're going for. I'm sure one person did it first and everyone else was like ‘ah yes that will help with my Weasley bashing' and followed suit
