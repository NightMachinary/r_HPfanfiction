It is something you ask younger children, if I ask my ten-year old that she will acuse me of thinking her stupid and loudly denying that.

I think the ambiguity of wether or not it was premeditated is a, probably unintended, quality of the original story. It left a lot of things in limbo. Just like real life it doesn't give all the answers. Not everything is nicely explained. There isn't allways a neat linear history to deduce.

This probably one of the reason's the series is so popular in fanfiction.
