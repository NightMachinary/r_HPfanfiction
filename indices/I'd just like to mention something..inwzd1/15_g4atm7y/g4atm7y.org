  It's just, one fanfiction I could write off as a fluke, but there's hundreds that claim Molly asking Ginny the platform number is totally unreasonable? Do people really think that?

When you add that to all of the other inconsistencies, plotholes, and other weird issues? You get a pretty good foundation for an AU fic.

My main issue with that whole thing was why wasn't there someone from the DMLE/Obliviators there to keep watch as hundreds of kids walk through a wall? This is a crowded train station, and Harry could hear Molly? Yeah, the statute of secrecy doesn't need that. Then you have the events there in book2.

There are people that like Harry/Draco, Snape/Hermione, Draco/Hermione, and many others. Then you have the people who paint Snape as the Mother Teresa. Why allow those, but not this one?
