In one fic it is mentioned that she is tasked by Dumbledore, not for any nefarious purpose, but to draw attention of any stranded parents and muggleborn children who got confused.

That's why she comes late and looks around, with her big brood she can draw attention, unrelated people can think she might be some hippie and soon ignore her and also anything uttered by her, but those who know those words can approach her. she also looks accommodating , not someone whom people are intimidated to approach.
