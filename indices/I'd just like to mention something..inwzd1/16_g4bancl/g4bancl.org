It's mostly just the kind who will latch onto any reason to bash the Weasleys.

They forget what their parents did - I guarantee that nearly any parent will do the same "quiz your kid on something you already know, so you're sure the kid knows it as well".\\
I still remember my parents quizzing me on what was first and last on the grocery list (which was inevitably the vegetable for dinner that night and something to reward me for not complaining, respectively) nearly every time we went grocery shopping.

I think one fanfic author would have forgotten that was a thing (or willfully ignored it for the sake of bashing), and then several others latched onto it because they also disliked the Weasleys and any excuse to bash was a good one.\\
Friendly reminder that people will believe almost anything if it fits their narrative of the world.
