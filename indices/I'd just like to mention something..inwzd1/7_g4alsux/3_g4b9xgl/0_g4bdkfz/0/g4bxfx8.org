How do you fit your school trunk in the fireplace with you?

Also, as an adult 1. You want to wait until the last minute to see your kids properly off and make sure all their stuff gets on the train -- they might need help with the trunk! Harry certainly does. 2. There is a social aspect of seeing the kids off amongst other families. You'll see other people you went to school with, maybe some old friends, and maybe after the train leaves the adults hang around to chat more.
