JKR's [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/floo-powder][own writing]] from Pottermore:

#+begin_quote
  No shortage of Floo powder has ever been reported, nor does anybody know anyone who makes it. Its price has remained constant for one hundred years: two Sickles a scoop. Every wizard household carries a stock of Floo powder, usually conveniently located in a box or vase on the mantelpiece.
