In a few towns in the south of England, every year on May Day weekend, people will dress other people up as Christmas trees, ceremoniously parade/hunt them through town, then fake-kill them on a hill to 'release the spirit of summer'.

Other People roll cheese down hills for fun.

People do weird, stupid inconvenient shit in the name of 'tradition' all the time. And psychologically, people who reliably live for over a century will evolve far slower than we do (the Statue was enacted in 1690 something, which is feasibly only two to three generations of magical people), so it's no surprise they keep doing the same shit over and over even if it makes no sense.

That's tradition.
