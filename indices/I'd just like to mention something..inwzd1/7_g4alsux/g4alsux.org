I agree with you but there's something i don't get (and don't really remember from the books/movies).

Do they have to go through the muggle side of the station? Isn't there like a more simple way (floo, apparition or whatever) to get there? Honest question- i understand wizards doing that for the first year of the childrens education, but afterwards it doesn't make sense to me.

Any thoughts?
