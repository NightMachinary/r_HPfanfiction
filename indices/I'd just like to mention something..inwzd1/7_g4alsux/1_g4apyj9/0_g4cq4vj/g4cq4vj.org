It's implied that Side-Along Apparition is an emergency measure, and the Floo doesn't go to muggle areas. That's why they used Portkeys before the Express. Making everyone take a train is kind of weird, but there's something to be said for, "Everyone use muggle infrastructure to get to a central location, and we'll transport all the kids at once to this place that's otherwise hard to get to."

The obvious problem with this is that the Floo /does/ go to Hogsmeade.
