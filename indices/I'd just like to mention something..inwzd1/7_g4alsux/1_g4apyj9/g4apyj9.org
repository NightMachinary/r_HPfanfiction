My head canon is that magical travel can be extra hard/stressful with multiple children. With babies/toddlers, you can probably just grab tight and apparate or floo successfully, assuming you have a 1:1 baby:grown up ratio. Older kids can likely be trusted to floo on their own, but obviously one grown up shouldn't be bringing more than 1 or 2 kids by side-along for safety reasons.

Then, for Hogwarts, add in all their luggage. With animals and trunks and such, that seems complicated. And, in this case, Molly is the sole grown up for 5 kids, including a 9/10 year old and 2 mischievous twins.... plus all their stuff... yikes.

I could also see there being a floo station set up in a different area of King's Cross so as to not attract attention by having people randomly showing up in the middle.
