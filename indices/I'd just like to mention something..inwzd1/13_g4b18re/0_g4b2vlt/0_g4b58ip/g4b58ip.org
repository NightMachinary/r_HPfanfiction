I get all that, what I don't get is the hate the bashing fics get. A lot of fanfic writers aren't professional writers, a lot are children just writing for fun or first time writers but I see people absolutely ripping into them for this and I don't understand that level of hate to it. What you said about cherry picking, if they didn't how would their story work. I rarely see the level of hate on any old AU fic than I do the bashing ones. Personally I like them because I like to see how people can make the light side bad, how they can find small inconsistencies in the original work and interpret them to their own desire. A lot of ideas only work with certain changes. Idk, just confuses me the hate. If you don't like a certain trope or fic type then just don't read it, most fics have bashing in the warnings, and if they don't then maybe msg the author and ask them to put one in.
