It's fan fiction.... what does it have to do with canon? That's something that confuses me. Yes I'm the actual book this is true, it was an innocent nonissue... but this is fan fiction, you take from canon what fits with what story you want and damn the rest cause it's fan fiction not canon. I think of all fan fiction followed canon completely it'd be boring wouldn't it. You get it see people's interpretations and changes in characters and situations. You see an innocent question of a child, someone else sees a way to collect lost Muggleborns and someone else sees a potential manipulation tactic to use in a story. For reference I'm not trying to be rude I'm just curious why there are people who hate on certain types of fan fiction (eg. Bashing).
