You say that this writer bashes all the time then switch and say they copped out and took a lazy root midstory? Which is it? Do they always do bashing or did they cop out in this story? (Not trying to be rude or anything, just confused) And sure bashing can be seen as an easy plot or cliche, that doesn't make it bad, just makes it that, easy or cliche. Also the point of why not just make a new character, they use the character as a base for their version. Or maybe that is their interpretation of the character with the bad qualities turned up to eleven. Making a whole new character might be what you would want to do but that doesn't mean they want to do it that way. You may see all this as laziness, maybe sometimes it is, but what if that person is lacking in creativity but still wants to give writing a go. I can tell you now my creativity is so shot that no matter how hard I would try whatever stuff I tried to write it would end up looking lazy and cliche because I can't write to save my life. My big thing with all this is not trying to say bashing is good and everyone should do it but to say the hate is not okay. As I've stated before, these are not pro writers, they are people who could have no real skill or experience that are just having fun and trying their best. I actually doubt that many, if any, fanfic writers are actually lazy.
