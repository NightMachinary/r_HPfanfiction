  I actually doubt that many, if any, fanfic writers are actually lazy.

There is lazy and lazy. Certainly not lazy to write hundred thousand words, but lazy to sit down and make that seventh rewrite even they know the story requires it. I know, because I was there many times.

  Books aren't written - they're rewritten. Including your own. It is one of the hardest things to accept, especially after the seventh rewrite hasn't quite done it. (Michael Crichton, alluding to Steele MacKaye (1889) article where he said this about theatre plays)
