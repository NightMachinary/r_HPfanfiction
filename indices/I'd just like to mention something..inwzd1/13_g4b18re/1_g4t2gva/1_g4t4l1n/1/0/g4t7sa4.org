Yeah, a lot of fanfic writers stick to one or two general points. I love this fanfic writer Elvirakitties. She is a bashing writer and a lot of her stories are very similar which means as she switches between them to write and eventually finish she sometimes forgets an important point for a specific story (ie, one story Harry has no scar but later on he does have it and vice versa) I realise it's not everyone's cup of tea but that's how she writes. But most of her stories centre around Harry/(Voldemort, Snape and/or Lucius) and bashing the light. It's what she likes and I happen to like it too so I read them. If I didn't like it I wouldn't read them, simple. The hate is what baffles me...
