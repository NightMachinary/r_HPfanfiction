Problem with bashing is not that it makes characters different from the canon (although, it still makes me wonder: if you want to write about different character, why do you use the existent one, not some OC?), but it is usually signal of the bad or missing plot. In 99.9% it just an effort to create some antagonist for the main character(s) and laziness to create your original plot.

Take “A Different Halloween by RobSt“ linkffn(6439871). OK, it is RobSt, so for him the bashing is as natural as breathing for others, but until the middle of the third chapter (when Tom missed the fine print) it is a reasonable story. Yes, ultra-super teeth rotting sweet with the frosted icing on the top, but it made sense if you are for that kind of sugar overload. But then I see RobSt sitting there in front of his computer and swearing “Shoot, I just killed my whole story. There is no plot, dramatic tension, nothing. What will I do?”

What should he do? It seems to me the answer is simple: shut down the computer, take the paper, pen, and sit in the garden and create new plot, new drama, new crisis, everything, and write new outline of the new story. Then, and only then, return to the computer, start completely new story and write (and perhaps salvage some parts of the original story, when needed). Or perhaps just to cut the story there: it would actually work pretty well as a three-chapters short story without much any modification. He took the easy way: bashing. Create completely absurd caricature of Dumbledore and pretend that the story continues.
