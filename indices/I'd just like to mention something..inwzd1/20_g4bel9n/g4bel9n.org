I mean I get your point. The suspicious part is saying that /so/ loudly in a place with /tons/ of muggles. That was just stupid, IMO. It's so important not to let muggles know about the Wizarding world but let's loudly shout things about the Wizarding world. Best case a muggle ignores them. Worst case a muggle gets curious and follows the family and watches them disappear into a wall... and promptly freaks the heck out and probably gets admitted into an insane asylum (best case). Worst case they become obsessed and go back to said wall again and again until they get it on video or stumble their way onto the station.

Sure, anti muggle wards exist, but I dunno. It's not canon but I would kinda think anti muggle warding only goes so far (or perhaps some muggles are more easily gullible than others kinda like how some wizards/witches can throw off imperius curse and others cannot) but obviously that's a theory and not canon. Either way molly wealey was probably close to breaking statue of secrecy talking as loudly as she was and whether she was just teaching Ginny or just including Ginny is irrelevant when muggles finding out about magic is so detrimental.

I mean it's just dumb. It was probably just a stupid little plot to get Harry to meet the Weasley's as soon as possible. Like a little, I dunno, “treat” for Harry Potter fans to enjoy “oh look! Harry met the Weasley's BEFORE he was friends with Ron! It's like he was able to go to the train station with his FAMILY because the Weasley's practically adopted Harry (then he married his so called adoptive family's daughter) isn't that so cool?!” Kinda thing. We can all agree JK didn't always make the best moves when it came to Harry Potter but that's where fan fiction comes from (still love the FF I read once where this canon scene played out but Harry already knew about the Wizarding world and thought that Molly was insane for risking the statue of secrecy shouting about the Wizarding world. Pretty sure he ended up flagging her for it but can't quiet remember how, haha)
