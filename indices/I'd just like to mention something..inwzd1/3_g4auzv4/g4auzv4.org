I think that this conspiracy come to live because many fanfiction-writers don't actually have young children while J.K. had children that age when she wrote that. So for many people thats a plothole where they start their bashing/conspiracy, while it was absolute clear for Rowling why mothers do that.\\
I totally agree with you - Molly either asked this to include Ginny or did it so Ginny would remember the plattform. It is was parents do with their children.
