My favorite HC is that every year one family offers to arrive late at KC's screaming (under muggle repealing charm) about the platform number and saying keywords like muggle preferably with an owl in full view to attract the attention of all the muggleborns that for one reason or another didn't yet go to the platform (maybe they didn't know how -like Harry; maybe they were sceptic of running into a solid wall; maybe they were being held up somehow) and help however they can. That year the Weasley's volunteered, nothing more.
