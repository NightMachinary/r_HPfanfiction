This is exactly how I feel about it. Talking out loud to yourself as you're passing a bunch of identical brick walls between platforms, since 9-3/4 is just a platform you go to once a year (and the platform number itself really isn't a big deal unless you're Muggleborn). As an adult you have other things and numbers in your head, and it's Ginny that responds not one of the older kids (implying both that Ginny is extremely excited and wants to be included in the journey/destination, and also maybe that the platform number is just a humdrum number to the older kids too).

It's just a good character-building moment.
