I was already of this opinion. It just turned out someone else pointed it out in different words. I haven't even seen or met someone who even /tried/ to deny or change my mind on the matter. Impossible-Poetry is right, people don't believe/are against vaccines because one person who has been proved wrong said vaccines cause autism. If people are moronic enough to put in jeopardy the lives of their and everyone else's children by not doing the responsible thing of having a professional vaccinating their children (unless they have a medical condition which prevents them from being safely vaccinated) and risking to make preventable diseases reappear, do you really think people will stop believing Dumbledore is this big bad and cunning yet stupid enough to be outplayed by an eleven-year-old manipulator who did everything in his power to make Harry's (and many others) life a living hell and that the Weasleys were all collaborators who only like Harry for his money?
