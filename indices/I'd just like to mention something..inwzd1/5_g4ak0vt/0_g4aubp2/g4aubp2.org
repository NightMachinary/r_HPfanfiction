People like to pretend that Molly Weasley legit SHOUTED the question in the train station, when its clear that Molly asked at a normal speaking volume, maybe a little louder to be heard over the hustle and bustle of the station, and Harry was just close enough to catch onto it. And some would point at Ginny seemingly yelling the answer in that excerpt, but in reality I feel like those people who use that as proof have never cared for children. They have no volume knob. Kids are either whispering to the point where you can barely hear them, or screaming at the top of their lungs. No in-between.
