Especially when you think about that Ginny is the youngest sibling in a very big, very loud family. Between Arthur who loves to hex muggle things to life, Bill who loves curses, Charlie who loves big magical creatures and Fred and George who loves things that explode - if Ginny doesn't shout nobody would ever hear her. And Ginny isn't a timid girl - she is only shy around Harry. Ron points out at one point in CoS that usually "Ginny never stops talking". I totally can see a girl like her announcing the platform number in a way that everyone and their neighbors hears it without any conspiracy going on.
