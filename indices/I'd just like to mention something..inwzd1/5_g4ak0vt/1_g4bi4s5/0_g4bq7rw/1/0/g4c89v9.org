Not to mention, this is London, the capital city of a first-world country. You're also standing in one of its biggest train stations. There'll be people from other parts of the world, speaking accents, dialects or even languages hou've never heard before. I'd just assume it's some american word like "fangled" or "y'all" and forget about it in ca. 2 seconds flat.

I think people underestimate the solidity of the Statute by a LOT. A guy could walk into the streets, raise his wand and shoot off some explosions while shouting "FEAR ME! I am the Dark Lord Grendequest! Bow before me!" and then apparate out, and /not a single person would suspect him of being an actual wizard/. Same with Hagrid supposedly breaking the SoS by being tall - nobody is gonna see him and think "wow that guy is tall. His parents must've been giants, which means magic is real /oh god oh fuck/". They'd regard it as a curiosity and move on.
