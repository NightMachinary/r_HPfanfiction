Seriously I remember reading a fic(I think realignment) where someone said that if they can get rid of video evidence there's no problem. Plus I think that Dresden files said it best. They don't have to put much effort into hiding the magic since most people will just explain away things they see. Oh sure some people might but if someone says they saw a man with a wand do something, odds are they think they're insane or tripping on something.
