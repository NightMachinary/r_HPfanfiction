We, as readers, see it from the perspective of someone who knows magic is real in-universe. We should instead try to paste our own irl view on magic onto the muggles in the setting - they aren't suspicious, because they /know/, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that magic isn't real.

"It's just special effects." "I must have imagined it." "Everyone knows magic isn't real, I must've been daydreaming." "I need my coffee, too tired"

I think wizards would have a harder time *purposefully* breaking the statute more than they have to fear doing so accidentally.
