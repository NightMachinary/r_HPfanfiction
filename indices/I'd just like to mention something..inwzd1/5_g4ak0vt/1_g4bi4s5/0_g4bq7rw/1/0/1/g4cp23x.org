Most people would regard Hagrid as a curiosity. A fair number would know that Book!Hagrid is about two feet taller than any documented human who ever lived. (In fact, how did he even fit on the muggle train?) They might think he was a guy in a costume for a publicity stunt, but they'll know something weird is going on. The Statute was still robust in 1991 mainly because there weren't cameras everywhere yet for someone who knows better to see it.
