If I heard "the station is packed with Muggles" that is indeed what I would think. But if I heard just "packed with Muggles" or "it's packed with Muggles" I might think it's some kind of new fangled technology or someone's nickname or a word in another dialect (of which Britain has many) or a product/brand name that I wasn't familiar with.
