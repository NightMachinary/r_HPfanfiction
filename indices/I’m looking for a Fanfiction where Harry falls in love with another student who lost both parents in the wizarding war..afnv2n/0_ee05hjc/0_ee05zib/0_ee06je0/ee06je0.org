The story which comes to mind is "The Silent World of Cassandra Evans". It starts out really dark with exaggerated Dursley abuse on Fem!Harry, which leaves her mute and dumped in a back alley. She manages to make it to Hogwarts and initially befriends Hermione, but when saving her from the Troll, the sheer brutality scares Hermione off. Queue some angst before it turns into a very fluffy, cracky comedy which subverts a lot of tropes (most notably "surprise sibling" and "OP!Harry"). It also has a well done Hermione "redemption" arc later on.

Susan Bones is the chosen pairing for Cassandra (Fem!Harry), so it's femslash. Dumbledore does definitely not agree with Cassandra's choice of partner. Susan has been orphaned in this fic and is raised by her aunt, who also opposes Dumbledore.

And the first few chapters are difficult to read since there is almost no dialogue and no one has learned sign language yet. 200k words in total.
