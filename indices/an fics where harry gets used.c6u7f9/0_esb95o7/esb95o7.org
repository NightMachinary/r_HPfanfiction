Canon? He gets totally used by Dumbledore, and "raised like a pig for slaughter".

Of course, in every indy!Harry fic, he finds out and raises a ruckus. A couple fics have however unique takes on this matter:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): [[/spoiler][He and Ginny first killed him outright in a carefully laid trap. After interrogating Dumbledore's soul using the Resurrection Stone, Harry sentenced it to eternal torment in hell.]]

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: Dumbledore is totally manipulative greater good here. The kids also finds out on their own, but since Hogwarts is a spy school in this universe, they are kind used to all sorts of dirty tricks, so no hard feeling here. They even quickly realize that Snape killing Dumbledore is that old KGB â€œshoot your own guy, gain enemy's trust" deal.
