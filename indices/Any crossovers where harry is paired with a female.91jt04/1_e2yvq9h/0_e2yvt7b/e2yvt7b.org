  This is in response to Storylover213's Bloody Brandy's Vegas Vacation Challenge (from Fanfiction.net). Harry and Lupin take a trip to Vegas. Things then take a turn for the strange. He hits it big, then hits the booze hard, then hits his comped hotel room with his new wife in tow. This is Harry Potter done the DC way...sort of. Rated M for sexual situations, language and violence.

  Harry is fed up. Left alone with the Dursleys year after year. Being the boy who lived means nothing when no one seems to care HOW you have to live. No one listens to him. No one believes him. No one cares about him. So Harry Potter is taking his destiny into his own hands. With his vault key, the clothes on his back and his trusty wand, Harry departs, leaving the wizarding world behind...or so he thinks.But eyes are on him always. His journey isn't as unknown as he would like to believe. Plans are set in motion to claim the boy who lived and change the lofty title to something a little less...lively.Will a master assassin's blade turn the boy who lived into the boy who died?A story that has been requested by many. Another take on Storylover213's Bloody Brandy's Vegas Vacation Challenge (from Fanfiction.net) but this time with someone from Marvel's lineup. The character of choice is one of my personal favorites. I hope you enjoy.

  She is a slayer. Born to fight the demons, vampires and the forces of darkness. Now, because of bad luck and bad mistakes, she's running. He is The Boy Who Lived. Destined to destroy the Dark Lord. Now, because of a loveless home and a manipulative old wizard, he's more alone and frustrated than ever. Together, these two lost souls discover that they are far more powerful than they ever were apart. Brute strength meets magical finesse in a story of young love and...okay, I'm sorry, I just can't. It's Faith Lehane and Harry Potter, people. They don't do mushy. A slayer being dropped head first into Wizarding Britain? Shit's about to get real up in here and nothing and no one is going to be the same. Gloves are off and with Faith's help, Harry ain't buyin' what the dark lord is selling.

  Rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Harry Potter discovers he is a mutant and decides to take up the cause of equality between mutants and humans (among other causes). How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.
