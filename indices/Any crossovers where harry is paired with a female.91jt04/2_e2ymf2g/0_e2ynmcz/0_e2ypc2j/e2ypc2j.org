Not much. If you know absolutely nothing, you should still be OK as the HP characters in the story get a lot of the background info explained to them as it becomes relevant. You won't see as many twists and reveals coming as some who is deeply invested in the WoW lore would, but that's really it.

The basic background for Warcraft is that it is a somewhat generic high fantasy setting with just about every fantasy race and trope thrown in, but with a minor twist in some way. Magic is powerful and commonplace, but there are also knights and rogues and all that.
