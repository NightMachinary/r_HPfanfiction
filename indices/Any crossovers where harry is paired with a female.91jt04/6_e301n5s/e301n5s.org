Here are some crossover fics with pairing (no harem) and out of the HP plotline (or in two rec cases, so little that it's negligible).

Mystic Knight Online and it's WIP sequel which are crossover with SAO. HP plotline dealt with really quickly. linkffn(11815818; 12651746)

Terminal Justice (unfortunately abandoned just before its last chapter (if I understood the A/N for last released chapter on his original publication site)) which is a sequel for Make a Wish (from Rorschach's Blot). The first fic is also nice but not crossover so I didn't put it here. This one is a Justice League Unlimited (the animated series) crossover. linkffn(11965672)

The Swallow and the Dragon from Flameraiser (WIP) which is a Witcher crossover. Not yet romance but pairing is pretty obvious. linkffn(12343855)

The Difference One Man Can Make, GOT crossover with pairing with a wildling. linkffn(11132113)

To Train A Dragon Rider crossover with the Inheritance Cycle (Eragon) which has unfortunately not been updated for quite a while but one can always hope. linkffn(9622073)

A Trek to the Stars: The Potter Files Star Trek crossover with Vulcan pairing. linkffn(10622535)

All the following ar SW crossovers

Let's Try This Again also from Flameraiser (WIP). No actual pairing in it yet but same as the previous rec from this author; I think we can guess what pairing it will most likely be. linkffn(11761091)

Harry Potter: Lost Very Far Away, pairing with Luna linkffn(12497548)

Revenge of the Wizard, with Leia pairing linkffn(10912355)

In All Things Balance and it's sequel (both completed, awaiting third installment). These ones are kinda special case as the HP plotline is here but it changes in the end and even if LV is there he's not the main antagonist (won't say more). Third installment will see a "new" villain (as in not the same as the 2 first books but not really an unknown entity. Ahsoka pairing for now (I don't think there will be any harem but it's kinda still open in the plotline so...). linkffn(11759933; 12089357)

So here was my mega rec list (if I remember of others I will post something but all the other important ones (IMHO) were already linked by fellow users (funnily all the harem ones).
