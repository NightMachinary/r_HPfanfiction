As part of the house elf attire, Death wears a king size black pillowcase from head to toe with eye and arm holes cut out and a rope around the waist. The open end at his feet is torn in stringy tatters to drift along the ground.

Death is given a miniature scythe to do gardening work with but also carries it everywhere unprompted.
