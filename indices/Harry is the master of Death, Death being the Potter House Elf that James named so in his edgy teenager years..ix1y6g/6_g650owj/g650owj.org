In a world with magic, names have a much closer relationship with the being, just as belief is much more important (if you don't believe you can cast as spell you can't, whereas when you believe you can it is more likely that you can - Harry Potter Patronus in third year). So I picture it going somewhat like this: Death has been serving the Potter family happily ever since he/she had been named by Master James. On the night of Voldemort's attack, Master James orders Death to protect young Master Harry and Mistress Lily, while he tries to fight of the Dark Lord. Master James dies, Death's magic starts to react (in preparation to blast Voldemort back like Dobby did Lucius) . Mistress Lily orders Death to protect young Master Harry and while she pleads for with the Dark Lord to spare him. Mistress Lily dies, and Death tries to protect young Master Harry with the magic already built up. Death doesn't quite succeed or fail, but the magic backlash blasts into all of them, leaving Voldemort disembodied, young Master Harry scarred, and Death changed by his exposure to the killing curse and whatever Mistress Lilly did to protect young Master Harry. And 10 000 years in the past.

Death's adventures lead to him/her coming into the role of Death, accidental becoming the progenitor of the House-elf species and creating the Hallows all while trying to get back to young Master Harry and carry out the last instruction given to him/her.
