I think it's reflex. What is Lily's role in the story? Being "the" mother, her sacrifice saved the world, blah blah blah.

I think everyone projects a bit (or a lot) of their own mother into Lily, given how readers tend to identify with the protagonist.

Was a typical reader's mother once a teenage girl? Surely. Does the reader know them in that way? No. What they know is being scolded for eating too many sweets, to remember to take a jacket (I'm 32 and mom still tells me to get a jacket whenever she sees me) and just generally a huge blob of nurturement, guilt, safety and emotional manipulation.

And that's why Lily is mostly written as a party pooper. Plus the canon hints.
