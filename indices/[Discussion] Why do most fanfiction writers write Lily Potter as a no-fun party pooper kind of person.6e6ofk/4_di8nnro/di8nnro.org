I agree that she would have to be at least somewhat "fun" (if not quite as much fun as James). She would have to have a sense of humor to be attracted to someone like James. If she found him obnoxious rather than funny, their relationship wouldn't last more than two seconds. She appears to have been popular and well-liked, and you don't become popular and well-liked if you don't have a sense of humor. Slughorn also described her as charming and "cheeky."

Unfortunately, the books put Lily on a pedestal, and fanfiction sort of makes this worse.

We're well aware of James' flaws, but we don't really get that kind of depth for Lily. Snape's memories give us more information, but she's still sort of this perfect moral figure. Even if you can forgive JKR for not fully fleshing out a character who died before the story began, some writers do more to reinforce the idealized version of Lily than to complicate it.

Sirius states that James "grew up" and /then/ Lily came around to him. I think some people reverse those two events, and present Lily as the person who basically nagged James into being a grown up.

I think of Lily as someone who's fun and likable at the best of times, but more emotional and neurotic than James.
