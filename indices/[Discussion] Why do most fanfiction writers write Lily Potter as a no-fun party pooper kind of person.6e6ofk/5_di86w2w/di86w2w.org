I'd honestly say it's more due to projection than anything else. The sense that Lily didn't enjoy James' sense of humor when young, but they grew to a happy medium by the time they were 20, makes more sense. However, many authors (many of whom are teens or young adults) will project what they know of parents or shoehorn them into easy tropes. This is why you get a mix of stories, many where Lily is a perfect loving mother with basically no flaws and quite a few where Lily hates fun. Most good stories avoid these simplifications.
