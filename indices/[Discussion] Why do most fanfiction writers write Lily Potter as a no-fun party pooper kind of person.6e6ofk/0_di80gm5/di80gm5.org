Well she did chew out James when he was being a shit to a friend of hers. Granted this makes me like her a lot more, but she definitely will tell you when you have crossed a line. It's a imho unwarranted crossover with those henpecked husband tropes. And generally in those stories James is acting like he never grew up in sixth year when we know canonically he did.
