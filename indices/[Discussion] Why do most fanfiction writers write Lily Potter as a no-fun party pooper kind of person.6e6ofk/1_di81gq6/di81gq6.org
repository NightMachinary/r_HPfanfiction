What do we know about her, well we know that she was not a fan of James's fun. Now James' fun straddled/played hopscotch along the line of fun and bullying. Now if it was fun for James and the spectators then Lily stopping it is anti-fun regardless of how much it sucked to be the victim.

A far more annoying case could be made that we know Lily was an intelligent muggleborn. Who else do we know who is an intelligent muggleborn? Therefore Lily and Hermione are the same person. The lack of information about Lily as a person means people have filled in the blanks with what is available. James, we meet his friends. For Lily, we get Petunia, Snape and Slughorn none of who are particularly helpful.

She was one of Slughorn's all time favourites. Assuming that requires more than just academic brilliance then she would have been a teacher's pet. Enough so she stood out from all of the other clever ones. I think Flitwick was fond of her too.

People who like Snape often dislike James. James therefore becomes worse and so the idea that James never grew up spread even though we know that the only reason little Harry exists is because James grew up. That means there are more occasions when Lily has to step in.
