Actually, it is a pretty serious story.

On the plus side, the language is excellent.

On the minus side, it looks like it will never be complete.

On the plus side, the general idea is pretty cool.

On the minus side, it features the most ridiculously overpowered 12 year old Hermione I've ever seen.

On the plus side, the crossover elements are well thought-out, with elements taken from one canon used to explain things and events seen in another.

On the minus side, characters seem rather OOC, even when there's a good explanation for that.

You get the idea. :)
