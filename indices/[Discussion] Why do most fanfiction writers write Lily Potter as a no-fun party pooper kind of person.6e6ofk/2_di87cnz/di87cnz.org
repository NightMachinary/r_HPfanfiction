Yeah people just seem to base her on Hermione. I'm currently writing her and trying to remember that Slughorn said she was cheeky - trying to give her Harry's sass and dry humour while James has more goofy, immature humour. I think people struggle to understand the different types of humour and just broadly put people into categories of funny and not funny - then if they think of a funny line they automatically give it to fred/George or James.

Edit: this has also inspired me to flip the trope on it's head a little. When it comes to the point in the story when Harry gets his toy broomstick, I think I'll have James racing after him as the over protective, paranoid parent while Lily laughs and finds it funny as per the photo in DH. What do you guys think?
