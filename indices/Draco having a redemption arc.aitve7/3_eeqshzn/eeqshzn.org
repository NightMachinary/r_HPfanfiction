Just finished The Sacred 28 linkao3(9818924) and I thought the Draco and Ginny characterizations were spot on, Draco's still a bit of a selfish coward but when it came down to keeping his family safe but he did what he had to do which led to his redemption, I'm on to the sequel Bottled Magic now linkao3(15748284) :)
