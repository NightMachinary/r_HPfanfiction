The Arithmancer and sequels give applying-science-to-magic a go. Hermione becomes rather Sue-ish in the second book, but I find it's still a decent read if you mostly ignore her as a character, and instead treat her as a plot device.

Also, the third book has >! the magical world anticipating that ubiquitous cameras and immediate online publishing will eventually out them beyond their ability to undo, so they plan to bring down the masquerade!<, which is on point.
