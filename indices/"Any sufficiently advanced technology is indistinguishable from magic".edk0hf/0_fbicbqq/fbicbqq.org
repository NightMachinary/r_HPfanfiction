  maybe the Oblivorators get dispatched because they detected magic but it turns out to be a big science experiment.... (and then maybe muggles investigate why everyone at a university seems to have lost the memories of the past year).

That is scary by itself. Any kind of experiment near that would be behind heavy-duty security with lots of notes and whatnot taken down. If all of a sudden they forget, but have all of these notes/journals/security videos? That would raise a storm by itself.
