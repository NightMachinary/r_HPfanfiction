He could make things move without touching them, he could make his hair grow back when his aunt cut it too short, and he could talk to snakes. The Dursleys would always hurt Harry whenever he made strange things happen. Until one day, when everything changed.BOOK ONE - COMPLETECURRENTLY BEING EDITED
