Harrys 's blood status in my mind depends on perspective. A blood purist would consider him halfblood cause his mother was muggleborn but others especially if one doesnt really understand the importance of it would probably consider him pureblood cause both his parents were magicals. Even harry said in book 1 whem malfoy asked harry said they were witch and wizard and at that point he didnt know muggleborn were looked down on yet
