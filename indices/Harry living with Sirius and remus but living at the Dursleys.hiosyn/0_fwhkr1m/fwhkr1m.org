Houses like that aren't really a thing in England. The closest we have are either old houses that get divided up into flats or what we call semi-detached houses (I think they're technically called 'duplexes' in the States?). The majority of houses in the UK are what are called 'two-up, two-downs' (named because they have two rooms upstairs and two rooms downstairs), so dividing already small houses in two isn't exactly viable in most cases. I'd imagine that's why you haven't seen them before.

The more possible thing in British culture would be moving in next door, which has been done in some fics. Hell, No Competition had an entire street of Dark Creatures move in to be around Harry.
