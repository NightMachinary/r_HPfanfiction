The Dursleys' primary concern is wealth, connections, and reputation. They live in suburbia both geographically and socially -- Petunia is just as much a busybody as her neighbors. If Sirius and Remus lived next door, they'd be fodder for gossip, and for the Dursleys, that /just won't do/. Their reputation means everything to them, to the point where they lie and lie about Harry living there, being mentally disturbed, going to a correctional school, etc. Having full wizards living right next door, and encouraging Harry's "freakish" nature, would be an absolute nightmare for them.
