Would they all be adults? Lily Luna is at most 10 when the epilogue happens so Harry is 36-37 at that time. Give it 10 years so LL is 20, Harry is 46-47, and at best Lily could only be 20 or so if they go back to visit her.

Maybe 18ish Lily picks up "dad" at/near/just after the end of book 7 (to be her approx age) and then they both go back to when Lily was their age.

Or maybe Lily is sent forward in time and Lily Luna is sent back to when Harry was in school?

I am really overthinking this. Sorry.
