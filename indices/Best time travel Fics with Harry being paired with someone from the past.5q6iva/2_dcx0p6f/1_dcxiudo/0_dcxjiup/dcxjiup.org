Well, Passageways is garbage, so that's not saying much. Turning of the Sun is decent, though the author tends to get sidetracked with nonsense, like randomly spending chapters trying to explain why Merlin was in Slytherin (right after it was said on Pottermore) despite it not being relevant at all.
