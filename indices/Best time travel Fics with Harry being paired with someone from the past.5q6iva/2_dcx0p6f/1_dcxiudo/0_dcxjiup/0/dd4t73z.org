The author is writing it for his godson to enjoy; we read it as a consequence of that so keep that in mind.

I pmed the author complaining about how often the characters seemed to whisper and his replied saying that he wrote it like that purposefully because his godson has vocal cord problems and has to whisper. I felt quite admonished.
