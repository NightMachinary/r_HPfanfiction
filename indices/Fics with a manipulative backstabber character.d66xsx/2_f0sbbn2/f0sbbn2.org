Well, Cedric Diggory in /The Diggory Papers/ - the Goblet of Fire from Cedric's point of view.

He's a ruthless manipulative bastard underneath, while maintaining the completely false image of being decent, noble and honest. Though he's not like Underwood in that he's really not very malevolent and not a murderous sociopath. Just a cheating devious sod you should never trust.
