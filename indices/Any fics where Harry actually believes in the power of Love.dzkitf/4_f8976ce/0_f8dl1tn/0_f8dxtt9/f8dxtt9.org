Dude. Take a joke. I know you dont know me, but it's something I do a lot, joke and play tricks. I didnt mean any harm by it, and, last I checked, you aren't the poster. Shouldn't he be reprimanding me himself if he was so bothered by it? I really just don't see the problem here. Sure, Deathly Hallows is a book, not a fic, but I honestly know so few power-of-love centric fics that I wanted to make it just a little funny while also not helping much. Sorry my fellow redditor.
