Oh man, I had a /ton/ of fun reading /Basilisk Born/, linkffn(10709411). Out of Harry Potter fics I've read before, this one really takes the cake.

Regarding /non/-Harry Potter fics, I really enjoyed reading /The Ocarina of the Wild/, linkffn(12781394). This was a Legend of Zelda fic. Unfortunately, it's only eight chapters and hasn't been updated since April.
