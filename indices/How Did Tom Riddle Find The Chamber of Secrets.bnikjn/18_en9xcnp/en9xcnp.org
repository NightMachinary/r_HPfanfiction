In my headcanon, by third year, Voldemort knew he was related to Slytherin. Maybe not directly persay, but he knew enough to know parseltongue was a Slytherin trait. As an orphan obsessed with learning more of his heritage and likely to figure out who his father was because his mom couldn't be magical as she died... He would have started looking. He likely found the Room of Requirement by accident at this point, much like Dumbledore did as well. It likely took him the two to three years of searching. That is possibly why he made the claim that he knew that castle better than anyone. He, the self proclaimed most powerful wizard alive, took 2 years to find slytherin's chamber.

He likely cast 100s of revealing spells. Said dozens of words in parseltongue, and it is likely in this time, he struck up a relationship with the grey lady and other ghosts.
