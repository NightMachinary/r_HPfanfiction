Canonically, what actually happened is that a 19th-century Gaunt family member further concealed the entrance Chamber (thus far just an ordinary trapdoor) and added the bathroom setup. Riddle would not assume /Professor Slytherin/ would have done such a thing, but he may have guessed a previous Heir had interfered, and he would not think so highly of the Gaunts from his limited knowledge of them.

Barring this, and while I love the image of him simply spending a /lot/ of time walking about the Castle shouting “/Open/” in Parseltongue to nothing in particular, a more likely theory would be that he guessed there would be a clue to the entrance such as a carving of a snake, had some unwilling cronies find all old-looking carvings of snakes in the Castle, and then investigated /those/ one by one; there can't have been /that/ many.

If one accepts /Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey/ as canonical to any degree, there is also the fact that there is a Portrait of Salazar Slytherin in the Castle. The Portrait-Slytherin /might/ have known the secret, though I'm not quite sure the original Slytherin would have trusted anyone (even a magical copy of himself) with his secrets. If he did know, it's entirely possible that finding the Chamber was as simple as locating the portrait, and asking it nicely (in Parseltongue, so as to prove descent).
