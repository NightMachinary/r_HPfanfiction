  and two because Slytherin had been vilified for centuries, so I find it unlikely they'd have a portrait of him kicking around.

Public sentiment goes against him, but the House /is/ still named after him, and the Slytherins (who /do/ after all comprise one quarter of Wizarding Britain's population) certainly like him. If you tried to hang the portrait in the Great Hall there might be trouble from angry Gryffindors and fainting Hufflepuffs, sure, but if the Portrait were put, say, inside the Slytherin Common Room, or otherwise somewhere in the dungeons, I don't think there would be any trouble.

Plus, since they can move frames, I think it's harder to get rid of a portrait than you're giving the painted buggers credit for. Even if someone tried to remove him from Hogwarts, Portrait-Slytherin could just have fled his frame, gone into hiding, and then commandeered some poor schlock's frame for himself.
