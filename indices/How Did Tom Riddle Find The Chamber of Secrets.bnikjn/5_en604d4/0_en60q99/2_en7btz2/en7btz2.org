Slytherin reputation is not really that bad. People must not forget that, in canon, Harry spends most of his time with convinced Gryffindor who have absolutely nothing in common with Slytherin and his ideals. This sentiment is further renforced by the fact that Voldemort use his blood relation to Slytherin to "justify" his actions.

I'm pretty sure Slytherin is really respected in most "Slytherin" household (even the non Death Eater ones) while Gryffindor is presented as a fool, uncultured and arrogant just like the members of his house are seen.

I also doubt that there is any portrait of Slytherin at Hogwarts, but I'm pretty sure that there is no portrait of any founder at Hogwarts, and it is my headcanon that any portrait of Slytherin left in the Chamber would have been plundered century ago by a Gaunt along with any item of value there.
