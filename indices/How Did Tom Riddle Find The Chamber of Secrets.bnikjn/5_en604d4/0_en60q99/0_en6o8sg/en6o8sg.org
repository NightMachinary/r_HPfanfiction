  As for the Gaunt's, yes, I know that in cannon they were going to fix the plumbing and he hid the entrance, but Riddle knew nothing of the Gaunt's at this point. He did not find out about the Gaunt's until later that year at the earliest (that's what's implied anyway) and at that point the chamber would have already been open.

Interesting, I wasn't aware. I know it doesn't answer the question, but rather than his connection to the Gaunts and theirs to Slytherin leading Tom to the toilets/Chamber, it could instead be the opposite. Tom might have read about renovations done to Hogwarts, and some detail or other led him to investigate. Discovering the Chamber then leads him to research the one who did the renovations. A Gaunt. He connects Gaunts to Slytherin. Then he searches for living members of the Gaunt family, discovers the unique name Marvolo in a Ministry report/Daily Prophet archive, and from this and his Parseltongue ability chooses to make a visit and discovers truth of his family.
