I'll be honest, I doubt the portrait theory. One because I do not consider that cannon personally, and two because Slytherin had been vilified for centuries, so I find it unlikely they'd have a portrait of him kicking around.

As for the Gaunt's, yes, I know that in cannon they were going to fix the plumbing and he hid the entrance, but Riddle knew nothing of the Gaunt's at this point. He did not find out about the Gaunt's until later that year at the earliest (that's what's implied anyway) and at that point the chamber would have already been open.

As for cronies searching all the snake carvings. It would work but there's a problem... Riddle would NEVER trust anyone to help him with this. His paranoia and independence would never allow it.
