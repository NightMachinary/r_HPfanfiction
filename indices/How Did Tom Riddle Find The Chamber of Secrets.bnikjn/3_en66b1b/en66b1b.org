As McGonagall would say: "Pure, dumb luck!"

In my headcanon a Parselmouth can open the Slytherin common room entrance by simply saying "Open" in Parseltongue. So after finding that out, Tom would naturally try and see what else he could open that way. During his usual late night wanderings he went into the girls' bathroom, noticed the overly large and ornate sink, something wholly unique to that particular bathroom, examined it closely, found the hidden serpent etched onto it and commanded it to open.

That or he read about the Chamber in an obscure book in the Restricted Section, noticing that it mentioned that it was connected through the pipes and after logically deducing that bathrooms were connected to pipes as well explored every single bathroom until he found the right one.

I refuse to accept Jo's ridiculous statement that Wizards and Witches relieved themselves anywhere and vanished the remains. For one thing, a first year student wouldn't be able to cast the vanishing spell, so there would be piles of excrement and urine everywhere that some other poor sod had to vanish for them. No, it's far more logical that magicals at least had a basic privvys with the wooden board with holes, the waste would fall into the pipes until they converted to toilets. Pipes that were conveniently big enough for an adult Basilisk to slide through.
