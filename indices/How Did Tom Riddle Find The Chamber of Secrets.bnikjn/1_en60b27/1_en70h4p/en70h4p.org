  Edit: Now that I think about it. Who put the snake emblem and spell on the sink in the first place? Surely the plumbing wasn't installed almost a millennia ago?

This is the perfect example of something that didn't need fixing. The Romans had plumbing, and it's easy enough to believe that wizards kept their knowledge of it even after it fell out of use in the Muggle world. So it's believable enough that a castle built c.1000 by wizards might have plumbing.

Unfortunately enough people seem to have said to JKR "Lol why does Hogwarts have plumbing?" that she seems to have felt a need to "correct" it; thus her explanation that the entrance to the chamber was added by one of Slytherin's heirs, and originally it was reached via a trapdoor.
