He clearly knew the school well considering he found the room of requirement, and seemingly explored the rest of the school to great lengths while he was a student. Maybe one day he overheard one of the female students talking about a weird snake emblem in the bathroom on the third floor. He likely read all he could about Slytherin history, and believed that the Chamber of Secrets existed. In order for it to be hidden for 900+ years, it would have to be somewhere no one ever looked.

If he got the sink to open, it would only be natural for him to explore it, and find the Chamber proper. He was supposed to be this incredibly smart student, who knew the school better than anyone, he might of just searched the entire school looking for snakes to speak to. Just a theory.

Edit: Now that I think about it. Who put the snake emblem and spell on the sink in the first place? Surely the plumbing wasn't installed almost a millennia ago?
