Not really related to your question but I have one of my own. I always thought since only the heir of Slytherin could open the chamber it was cunning of Slytherin to place the entrance in the girl's bathroom (the last place anyone would look, after all what kind of legendary entrance is in a bathroom) but...JKR once said that wizards didn't always use bathrooms. They would just do the deed and vanish the evidence. So maybe when Slytherin placed it there it wasn't a bathroom and the bathroom was eventually built around it.?

Slytherin was probably rolling in his grave when he found that out.
