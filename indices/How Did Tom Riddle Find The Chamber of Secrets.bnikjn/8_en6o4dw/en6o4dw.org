I always liked the explanation given in LinkFFN(Seventh Horcrux), where there are secret puzzles hidden around Hogwarts to lead you to things like the Chamber of Secrets or the Room of Requirement, which involves following a chain of fucking soup cans, learning important life lessons, and not being able to get the last piece of the puzzle until you really need it.
