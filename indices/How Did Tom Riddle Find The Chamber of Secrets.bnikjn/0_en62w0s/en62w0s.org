He managed to get some Felix Felicis and took a teaspoon before he went looking for the chamber, it ended up only taking ten minutes. Recognizing the snake sign on the copper tap he immediately knew that he could open it by saying open in parseltongue, after he entered the chamber he proceeded to rightly guess that the beast has to be a Basilisk and after a couple of tries figured out what to say to the Statue so the Basilisk shows itself(he of course knew to avoid looking into its eyes) the entire process took him twenty minutes and proceeded to have his perfect day.
