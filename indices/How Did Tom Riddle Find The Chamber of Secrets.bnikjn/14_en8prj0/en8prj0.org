The bathrooms were put in centuries after Hogwarts was originally built so he would have been right in that Slytherin would never build his entrance there. A little research would have given him that knowledge (any change to Hogwarts would probably be recorded somewhere or the ghosts/portraits would know). Also there is likely a Gaunt portrait somewhere in Hogwarts that he went to for help.
