Tom Riddle, by Dumbledore's own mouth, was a brilliant student. One mark of brilliance is to be able to extract from disparate sources a detail or theory that would evade others.

So in Tom's case he reads everything he can (ex. learning oldest parts of Hogwarts, that Hogwarts didn't have bathrooms/get plumbing until later, an account of a trapdoor on that floor that never opened, a fable involving a cunning Slytherin who hid something in plain sight, and a host of other information.)

Tom also explores and makes discoveries with Hogwarts, and in general always has his eyes and ears open to learn/find something new/of interest. And of course he studies everything he can on magic (such the ability to detect magic and its traces (like Dumbledore did in HBP), and the possibility of picking something up that a non-Slytherin, non-Parseltongue may have missed). Through the years he accumulate a vast store of experience, knowledge, and magical understanding. At some point, through his endeavors, some pieces fall into place.

Basically to answer the question satisfactorily a whole mystery plot would have to be created from thin air. Think of Harry's mysteries (connecting a grubby package, a gringotts thief, a chocolate frog card, a headache, a cerberus, a jinxing, a name (flamel, on silver platter). Unless you know the story it sounds a load of nonsense. I also have to say Luck is a copout IMO, Harry and the gang put in a lot of work (in addition to having a lot of luck), and Tom never seemed to have much luck at all.
