My story has chapters of Harry taking on a vampire at their own game and discusses /very briefly/ how their magic works.

That said, in this particular fic, anything or anyone that features is discussed only very briefly. The style is deliberately sparse. The vampire is around for several chapters but is not a 'main storyline' event. Vampires that arrive later on appear even more briefly than that.
