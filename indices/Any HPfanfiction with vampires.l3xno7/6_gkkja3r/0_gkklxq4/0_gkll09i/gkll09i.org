Well, one of the qualifying characteristics of vampires, if I know anything about them, is that they are dead (or undead) and ever-lasting. If you start work with it in your story, you soon discover how weird and ill-fitting to the rest of the world that makes them. Of course, it is possible to say that it is just a Muggle prejudice, and in reality they are much closer to normal humans except for something.
