Well yes, Vampires could in theory pose a somewhat awkward part in JK Rowling's narrative regarding death and the limits of human endurance. However, that is only true if we believe that Vampires in the World of JK Rowling function the same as in the rest of fiction. Moreover, that - of course - is not a priori true. Nobody says that Vampires need to live forever or be categorised as an anomaly. Vampirism could theoretically be a very similar phenomenon to Lycanthropy; i. e. a phenomenon that affects the human body in such a way that it makes it dependent on some natural phenomenon (for example, Werewolves are defined by Lunar phases, but they are in essence stil human. Is it such an offshot to think that Vampires are simply humans with a simmilar dilemma?)
