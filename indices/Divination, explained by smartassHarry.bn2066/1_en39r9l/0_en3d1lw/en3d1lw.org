I agree about the theory, but disagree with you on characterization. A smarter Harry would have meant more sarcastic gems. Plus, canon Hermione's best trait is her loyalty. Open-mindedness isn't really something she embraces. Frankly, I love these oneshots because I feel Hermione's opinions and decisions should have been challenged.

Personally, I'd love to see an interaction between a smart Harry and Hermione that isn't bashing or romance.
