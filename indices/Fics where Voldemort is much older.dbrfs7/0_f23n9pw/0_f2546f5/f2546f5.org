Many great â€˜villains' in life have had a flare for drama and have made decisions that are not optimal for their ultimate goal but satisfy their sense of drama or destiny otherwise.

Why wouldn't an immortal villain recognise a child as his nemesis? Voldemort has great respect for the older magics no matter how much he denies it - as can be seen by his ritual in the fourth year. Him listening to a prophecy is not obviously stupid - this is a world dominated by magic after all.

Voldemort was never immortal whilst Harry was hanging over him in any case - there was always that threat to him.

Was he acting stupidly? Maybe at times. But saying he's the one of the worst villains in fiction is ignoring the aspects of him that are interesting - like the characterisation he gets by way of the visceral fear other characters feel when talking of him.
