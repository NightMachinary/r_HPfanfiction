You've set a wider scope than my story is set in but you nailed one of my main pillars of thought. But so far I've started with Fith years and blood tension. And some small things like ballpoint pens being an unsavory thing to have in Hogwarts.

For now, my main focus was going to be the Wizards and Witches of modern times and the teachers that have taken up the roles of those left empty by the series finale. I've never written Harry Potter fanfiction nor have I finished the books yet. So I thought it'd be nice to start small then expand out as I felt comfortable. Namely, Wizard/Muggle relations.
