There were only two big dark wizards in the entire 20th century relevant to Britain, Grindelwald and Voldemort, and Grindelwald mostly stayed in Europe, so he was only a danger to British wizards fighting on the continent, not for families at home. Only Voldemort was actually a danger to the general British magical population. So no Dark Lord in 20 years is quite possible.

If I was writing a story set in the 2020s, I'd choose technology as the main opponent. With cameras everywhere and AI instead of humans looking at the data, hiding the magical world becomes more and more difficult, so magical politicians would have to cooperate with limited in-the-know muggle politicians, but political disagreements (should we tell the Google CEO about magic?) would make things difficult, so my story would be mainly a political drama where everyone tries to further their own agenda while everyone's fighting against the unstoppable force of progress. Some radical muggleborns getting their hands on enriched uranium, trying to duplicate it with magic, making nukes and almost causing WW3 while everyone's scrambling to stop the muggle public from noticing that blast in Antarctica might be a subplot, as might be the adventures of various purebloods in the muggle world where they have no clue of their surroundings.
