Twenty years without a single dark wizard seems a little off to me. And I doubt the Death Eaters wholly gave up their ambitions for power. If someone showed the promise of power and skill they'd gain followers all the same. I think the books and movies did the "Single dark wizard enemy" thing far better than what would want for a do over. I've not pinned down who I want to be the big bad. I'll be posting in chapters so hopefully I'll be able to hear from readers to help shape the way the story will go. One of the benefits of this form of content creation. What would you have wanted most for a new enemy if you got first pick?
