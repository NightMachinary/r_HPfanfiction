I appreciate the advice! And please, don't mistake me, I very much */dislike/* Cursed Child! I Just wanted to write in the timeframe. Why sulk about it being subpar when I could write a plot I found worthwhile instead.

I've not adjusted to the atmosphere here just yet, a lot of the terms I've read in requests don't make sense to me yet nor do I really understand what people really want from writers. But thank you for the support to write what I want, I'll puzzle this place out eventually!
