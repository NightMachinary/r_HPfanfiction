Wanna counter Prince of Slytherin as a first read. I think a lot of it's value and humor comes from being familiar with other tropes in HP fic, so I don't think it'd be as fun as a first fic, though it's one of my favorites. OP definitely read this after you've read a few, but I'd save it for then.
