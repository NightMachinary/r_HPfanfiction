A few that I really enjoy are [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/30/][What's Her Name in Hufflepuff]], [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11517506/73/][The Odds Were Never in my Favour]], and the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] series.

You might be getting overwhelmed by the sheer number of recommendations so I recommend checking out the filters and tags in Archive of Our Own. You can search specifically for or exclude characters, relationships, tropes, or other other common elements. I enjoy Wrong Boy Who Lived stories and Slytherin Harry stories. My sister likes magical tattoos, BAMF Harry, and soulmate AUs.

I hope you find something you enjoy!
