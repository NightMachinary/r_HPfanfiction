There are so many!!! (I am, in fact, one of those crazies who have read thousands of HP fanfics (no joke. There are hundreds of thousands out there. Even with as many as I've read, I've barely scratched the surface).

However, because I don't want to overload you, I'll link my top 5 favorite fics.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Antiquity Link)

Linkffn(The Marriage Stone) - please note this is SLASH.

Linkffn(Realizations)

Linkffn(The Lie I've Lived)

Linkffn(A Marauder's Plan)
