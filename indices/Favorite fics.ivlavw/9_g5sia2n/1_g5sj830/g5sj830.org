Alright I cant resist. The first 5 I've linked are all over 200k, so I decided you should really experience some shorter ones too, something you can really read in one sitting. So, here are a couple of my favorite short fics:

Linkffn(Two Weeks in the Alley)

Linkffn(Don't Forget the Dog)

Hope you enjoy!

If you read any of them, you should come back and let us know whether you enjoyed them or not!
