Came here to rec this and that's my favorite one of these too. It made me cry a couple times. The author's writing style is really unique and is a brilliant counterpoint to the “show, don't tell” mentality. They're telling this story in such a sad but beautiful way. Melancholy and haunting. Some of these are uplifting and funny too, which shows a real range.

OP, please also check out their series on the women of HP who don't get enough sympathy or props. It's a fun blend of essay/fanfic that I think would be great for someone just dipping their toes into the community. My favorite is the Pansy Parkinson one.
