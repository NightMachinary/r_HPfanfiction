One of my favorites is a rather short one that discusses the (purely platonic, student teacher) relationship between Luna and Snape. It doesn't pull any punches with Snape as an asshole, but it doesn't demonize him either. It's one of my favorite writings of Luna in fic, completely in character with her book portrayal. I think she's one of the hardest characters to write well, and this is a spectacular example.

My personal favorite long fic is linkffn(the arithmancer) or anything by whitesquirrel generally. This one is “if Hermione were a math prodigy instead of just a bookworm” but the part I like best is that it really delves into the concept of Arithmancy as a basis for spellcrafting and the way it treats magic as something that can be understood, but also something that can't. The final battle is one of my favorite action sequences in all of fic. (E: I think this is the only one on my list that has any romance, but it's a background point, pretty minor, and not at all the point of the story; nothing smutty, nothing beyond a kiss.)

Some of their shorter ones are also amazing: linkffn(justice, justice shall you pursue) is about what would happen if the muggle government was competent and got involved, and linkffn(petrification proliferation) is about what the response should be like if a basilisk really were set on a school.

My old school long favorite is linkffn(prince of the dark kingdom), which is about a world in which Voldemort won the first war. Lots of fun Celtic magic and stuff, plus a delightful amount of international politics that really drives the story forward. Basically nothing plot-wise is taken from canon, so it's really like reading a whole new book. Warning: abandoned at the end in the worst way, but there are still > a million words to enjoy.

linkffn(the Snape chronicles) is my favorite story that sticks to canon relentlessly. It's a biography of Snape from his POV that does a masterful job taking small details from the books and making them into major plot points, and I think the author must have grown up in England in that era because he seems so familiar with what the world actually would've been like during snape's childhood. It's a bit more sympathetic to Snape than I usually like, but that didn't super bother me. Background characters are really fleshed out, and his relationships with the other Hogwarts teachers are hilarious and poignant and beautiful.

Since you asked for OCs, one I've seen recced /a lot/ but haven't gotten around to reading (because I just wanna be in Hogwarts) is the Alexandra Quick series. Linkffn(3964606).
