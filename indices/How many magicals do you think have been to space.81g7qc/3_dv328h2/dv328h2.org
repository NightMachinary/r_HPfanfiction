I think a lot of wizards visited space, but I think magic would behave quite unpredictable there, and the experience would be interesting at the beginning but become quiet boring and unpleasant for them after a while. I think it would be like visiting Antarctic for us, something mainly done by researchers and occasional tourists.

  Also since Voldemort probably knew it was possible to go to the moon why did he not hide one of his Hocrux there?

Because he had no connection to the moon, he didn't want to hide a horcrux at places without significance, he also thought he is already safe with nobody knowing about them and nobody else knowing about the room of requirement.

  I think if you were to explain the idea of asteroid mining to the goblins the magical world would be doing it with into 5 years

them doing asteroid mining would actually be a great explanation for how the value of a galleon became so small(quidditch through the ages mentions how in 1269 a hundred and fifty galleons were as much worth as a million galleons today).
