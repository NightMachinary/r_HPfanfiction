It's more that a wizard could have gotten into space for years before the muggle did with magic that has been available for years.

You have magic to make things weigh less ,Unbreakable and air tight and the charms used on brooms would make it trivially easy to escape the earths gravity well.

A muggleborn with an newt in charms could probably make a viable way too travel to the moon over a weekend if they wanted to and there spacecraft would be reusable.
