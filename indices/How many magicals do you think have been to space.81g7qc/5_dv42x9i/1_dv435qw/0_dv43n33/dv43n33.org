It's true that a wizard could do it with magic, but wizards lack a lot of scientific reasoning. Their way of inventing new stuff reminds me very much at throwing things at a wall until something sticks. I don't think they know about the vacuum of space until someone actually attempted to fly through it first.

And why would a wizard fly to the moon, if he doesn't even think of celestial objects as places in the first place. Wizards still used a lot of earth centric astronomy in 1994, after muggles already had common knowledge of heliocentric astronomy. I don't even think that the common wizard knows he can go to the moon, when Ron (a slightly lazy, but decently capable and smart student of 14 or 15 years old) didn't even realise at first glance that a moon covered in rice is a silly idea.

A side note, I don't know if brooms work in a vacuum, and the fact that the quibbler reported that someone (allegedly) went to the moon, already implies that it isn't common nor trivial to go there.\\
But yes, a muggleborn would most definitely have a head start. That's absolutely where you are right.
