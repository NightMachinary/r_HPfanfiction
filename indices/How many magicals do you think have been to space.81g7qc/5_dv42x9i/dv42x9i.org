I don't think any witches or wizards have been into space. Hogwarts students study astronomy and astrology with a very medieval idea of what space looks like. There's one guy who claimed that he did fly to the moon, and gave a bag of frogs to a gossip magazine as proof.

I think muggles are miles ahead in this race. If you need a wizard in space for your story, make him a muggleborn. He could have connections.

Regarding Voldemort and his plan. I don't think he planned on staying alive literally forever. He was a cunning, sentimental S.O.B, who kept all the shards of his remaining soul in England. It's very like ly that he still wanted some form of self-termination possible if he ever got sick of living.

If one horcux is a not-retrievable pebble on the surface of the moon, good luck getting it back after civilication has died because the moon exploded.
