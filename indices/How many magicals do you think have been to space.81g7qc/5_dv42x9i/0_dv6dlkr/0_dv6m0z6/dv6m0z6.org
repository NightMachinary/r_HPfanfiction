I extrapolated; astronomy and astrology is given as the same course, they use an Astronomy tower (modern day muggle astronomy is often done on the ground because it makes no difference) and both astronomy and astrology are used in Potions and Divination, all of which gave it a more medieval vibe to me. I missed some details, like that galaxy ball, but as far as we know it was perfect from the perspective of a 13 year old. I never interpreted it as an actual perfect model, because such a model wouldn't move noticably. It reminded me more of an orrery, that usually cannot be built to scale.

But I checked and they do indeed have a pretty good grasp on the concept of the universe. They seem to know that Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter, is covered in ice. They cover planetary tracks, and can see Venus at midnight (which is pretty much impossible for muggles, since venus is closer to the sun than earth, you can't see it when you are fully turned away from the sun).

I still don't think wizards Have gone to space yet, though, since that conclusion was more based on the fact that one guy DID claim he went to the moon. Not only was this worthy of reporting (which hints that he was either the first or one of very few), his proof was a bag of frogs given to a gossip magazine (which kinda takes away his credibility).
