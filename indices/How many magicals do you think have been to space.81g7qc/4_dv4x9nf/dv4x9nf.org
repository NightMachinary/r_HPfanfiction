Honestly, I'd assume none have. I mean, we know they can't apparate there, since it's too far and none of them have been there before and since they can't do it easily I doubt they'd do it at all. We know wizards are unaware of muggle technology most of the time, so we know they certainly didn't replicate a rocket and I really doubt the ministry would try get a wizard onto a muggle space exploration mission.
