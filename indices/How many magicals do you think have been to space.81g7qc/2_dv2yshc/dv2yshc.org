I think quite a few wizards and witches have been in space --- I wouldn't be surprised if rocks from the moon were useful in some potions. Might be they're actually ingredients in the Wolfsbane Potion? It would certainly explain why it's so expensive. As to other reasons wizards might go there, well, wizard Astronomers who can see Mars with perfect clarity through their enchanted telescopes might want to actually go and see what it's like someday.

About Voldemort, though: he only hid Horcruxes in place that /meant/ something to him. He never felt a particular connection to the Moon, ergo he didn't put one there.
