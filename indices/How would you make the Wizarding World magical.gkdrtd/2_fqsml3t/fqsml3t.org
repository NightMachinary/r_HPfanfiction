There are a couple of things I can think of to make the Wizarding World more 'magical'.

The first is simply, give it history. I swear that J.K.Rowling decided to make the history professor such a dull, unimportant figure so that she could get away with students (and by extension, the reader) not having ANY interest in the history of the magical world. Merlin and Morgana both existed in the HP universe. So therefore one can reason that other myths and legends did as well besides just the creature. What about Norse mythology? Were the Aisir, Vanir and other figures of Asgardian legends real? Was there actually a giant magical tree that Muggles would see as the 'World Tree'? What about the Greeks? Romans? We know that there were ancient Egyptian wizards but did they take the place of what would become muggle legend?

Even beyond that, there are hundreds of mythical artifacts of legend in the real world. What about having them be real? The fanfiction 'Partially Kissed Hero' did a good job on that aspect. Though it is a bit of a crack fic.

I've always felt that Harry Potter could have been better served if there was some ancient family magic that died out in his family. Only to be revitalized by the inclusion of his mother's blood. Harry could go out on a quest trying to identify these ancient secrets with his friends and comrades in an effort to learn this magic to be able to beat Voldemort.

Another way I like to imagine the Wizarding World is to make it grander in scale. Basically, Earth is significantly more massive than Muggles think it is. Much of the world is hidden behind unplottable tracts of land known as the 'Wild Lands' or the 'Ancient Lands' In these lands lie the ruins of ancient magical civilizations, much of the wild magical creatures of the world lie within it.

The Ministries of Magic that exist throughout the world are the representative government for the "civilized" portions of magical peoples. However, those that live and wander through the wild lands are known as "Wanderers" or "Wildermen" if they're being nasty about it. Magical civilizations live outside the boundaries of the wild lands because magic is so much more raw in the wild lands. So things can happen outside of Wizard's control because the very land itself is magical.

In this kind of world, magic would be more epic in scale. Magic is sort of like a muscle but the truly powerful are capable of remarkable displays of magic, though the more connected to the 'Wilds' you are, the more primal the magic is, because as you channel magic in the wild lands, you are trying to push magic to manipulate something that already has a good chunk of magic in it.

I've imagined a fanfic (never written, I'm trash at writing and lack the patience to complete a fanfic to give the idea justice) where Harry, gets abandoned in the woods, nearby one of the access points to the wild lands. Harry gets picked up by a Wanderer who teaches Harry the basics of survival, along with essential skills so he can read/write and all of that. There is a bit of an interesting issue when he gets back to England in time to go to Hogwarts where Harry and his peers both think that the other is absolutely daft in regards to how they do magic. I feel it could lead to a lot of interesting interactions. One such example is that Harry would be absolute pants at fine control. He simply has too much raw magic to be able to manage the fine tuned control required for small tasks. However, in terms of battle, he's insanely strong as you WANT to throw out huge amounts of power, and he enjoys it too. School for him would be more about learning how to do the finite things, while his peers struggle to manage the power needed for things.
