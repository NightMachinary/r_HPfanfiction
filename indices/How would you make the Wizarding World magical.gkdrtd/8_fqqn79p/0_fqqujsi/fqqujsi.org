I kind of feel like you skipped over the section, where I wrote:

  Another way to do it, would be to make the magical world bigger. /Much bigger./ Hell, add a Fae Realm and Underworld, and make places like King's Cross station and Diagon Alle be just small areas where the two intersect (many mythologies have other worlds that exist along our own, that can be entered trough a physical location, connecting the two). This way you can have any kind of cultural differences, moon-logic, and bizarre legal and moral norms, and have it all /make sense/. You can do away with all that "don't let the muggles notice" nonsense and have some truly fantastical buildings, vehicles and fashions!

Besides, the topic isn't on how to make life exciting in a, seemingly, mundane world, but how to make the world itself more exciting. I'd love to hear your ideas :-)
