That's what Twilight did, and that's the reason I don't like it (yeah, that, not the sparkling vampires or whatever) - it doesn't provide an alternate /society/ I can escape to.

There's no reason you must have a normal boring life in the wizarding world as it exists in canon - in the same way you are not forced to do it in the real world :)
