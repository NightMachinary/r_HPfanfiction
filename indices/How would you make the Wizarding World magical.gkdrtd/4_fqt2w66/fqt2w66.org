I think a nice little touch of magic is the idea that things don't have to be done because of logistics but because of comfort. Like a house that's completely round or a basement without supporting pillars. Windows in the kitchen that show the front yard or a beach in Tahiti despite the kitchen being in a basement.

The ability to house endless arrays of nonsense. Because every wizarding home would have a icecream maker and a a bread maker and all those other kitchens what's it's because the drawers are endless.

At the same time certain things should be made more structured off of dates of equinoxes and lay lines. Oh we can't make bread today the moons of Saturn are alight and all the flour will sprout.

Magic having seasons or times of day could be an interesting idea with little rituals or jigs one has to do.

Another thing is a change to how powerfully magical things act. What if everything with magic embed in it attained a very minimal level of animation and perception.

The invisibility cloak would be a trickster trying to help you in amusing pranks but might also have a mischievous streak where it waits to reveal you at the most inopportune time.

A near constant beauty and the beast thing.

Simply magic being a constant thing to navigate. A force in the world you would have to constantly be wary of.

A good example is the use of fae or spirits. Needing to treat the world with vigilance. Learn the rules and play fair while trying to get an edge. Like having to grab your toast while looking away from it because the toaster like it when you get surprised and will get moody and burn your toast if you haven't pretended you got spooked once in a while.

An ancient filing cabinet who was smitten with a girl named Sophie from accounting and so steals her files despite it being housed in another building.

A neat idea is that Hogwarts is safe not because of defenses or its teachers but the castles ability to soak in the rampant magic of generations of magical children without becoming too sentient especially in unfortunate ways.
