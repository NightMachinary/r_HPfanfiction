Personally I like the "normalcy" of magic - I feel that is what keeps the HP world so relatable.

Magic can fix many material needs we Muggles have, which gives the reader the "God I wish I was a wizard" feeling which is so key to the HP universe's lasting appeal. We want magic so much because we can see how it could be used in our current day-to-day lives to make life so much easier.

But at the same time magic doesn't fundamentally alter the nature of interpersonal relationships or social problems. In this way we can see parallels to our real world problems in the HP universe while still having the "Wish I was a wizard/magic would solve so much" feeling. It's like the perfect combo to reel readers in.

This is why I dislike fanfics that have veritaserum be infallible, or memories be reliable enough you can use them in trials, or for it to be possible to just swear an oath and now everyone knows you are telling the truth.

All of these ideas undermine the relatability of the HP society, because a society where you are never uncertain because the truth can be guaranteed; where you don't have to trust people because it's possible to completely eliminate the possibility of betrayal... this is not a world that we can look at and recognise our real-world problems in.

In particular I don't see how taking away magical professions and giving wizards "normal jobs" makes them seem more magical.

In my fanfic, one of the ways I make the magical world feel more magical is to use ecological themes. Wizards are able to enjoy a higher quality of life than Muggles without any reliance on infrastructure or industry. Additionally we know that for reasons of secrecy, most wizards live in rural locales. This to me gives the magical world a fundamentally bucolic character which feels romantic to modern sensibilities.

Some selected excepts from VP Chapter 14 (The Workshop) which are focused on this:

  The Muggle world felt /wrong/.

  Hogwarts was filled with nooks and crannies, hidden alcoves and spiral staircases, but everything was neatly rectangular at Number Four, Privet Drive. The anemic electric lights were a pale imitation of a flickering, crackling fire, and the front garden was little more than a square of grass, not a single blade out of place, its perimeter brimming with meticulously arranged flowerbeds. Just like everything else in the Muggle world, there was nothing wild there, nothing truly /alive/.

  Claustrophobia was setting in, and Victoria found herself longing for wide, open spaces---forests and valleys and sprawling castles perched atop tall cliffs.

  [...]

  Vernon left for work, and soon enough Petunia drove Victoria down to Great Whinging high street, where a number of charity shops were to be found. As they looked for a parking space, once again Victoria was struck by the strangeness of the Muggle world, all concrete and plastic and glass. It was as if the Muggles were determined to kill off all connection to nature.

  She had been thinking about this a lot over the summer. Muggle technology depended on the laws of nature, and yet Muggles seemed so disconnected from everything green and living. Meanwhile, wizards lived in close contact with the natural world, even though their powers continuously defied it. At first Victoria thought that it was simply because wizards didn't need things like electricity and roads, but her time in the garden had made her rethink that idea. Magic was supernatural, yes, but it was also closely connected to nature. It was an interesting contradiction.

  She began to relax. The sun and wind had dried her out quickly, and now the broom was level she could sit back in the saddle without having to clutch it with her thighs. At first she didn't think they were going that fast---certainly the breeze wasn't too strong---but when she risked another glance down, she noticed that the clouds where zooming past beneath them, faster than any car. They quickly left London behind, the urban sprawl giving way to farmland dotted with small towns. Victoria took a deep breath of the cool, clean air. At last she was out of the crowded Muggle world with its smog and litter. This was where she belonged.

  Every so often they would pass other flyers in the sky, from lone riders to families on long tandem brooms like their own. Each time they crossed paths with another flyer, Mr Bones would slow down to greet them, often calling out to them by name:

  “Afternoon, Lincoln!”

  “Byron, old chap! Perfect day for a spot of flying!”

  “Leaky on Saturday, Abbott?”

  One time they were even overtaken by a greenish blur on a racing broom.

  “That's a Cleansweep Six, girls!” Mr Bones shouted as their own broom wobbled in its wake. “Probably one of the Holyhead Harpies!”

  Not long after their encounter with the racer, they came across a wooden signpost sticking out of a cloud, directing flyers towards Diagon Alley, Godric's Hollow, Mould-on-the-Wold, Appleby and even Hogsmeade. It was here that they began to veer to the east, heading into the Fens. The land below became flatter, a lush green riddled with rivers.

  [...]

  ... they shot down towards a tall, irregularly shaped building on the east bank of the river. A water wheel jutted out from its side, turning steadily in the rapid current, and ivy grew all over the stone walls. The house---for surely this was where Susan lived---was surrounded by vegetable plots, and beyond them were fields in which a handful of cows grazed. There wasn't a road or electricity pylon in sight.

  A flat platform occupied around half of the roof, almost like a Muggle helicopter pad. They circled it as would a carrion bird, each circuit bringing them closer, spiraling downward until they were coming in to land.

  The tour concluded on the ground floor, which was far more homey than the rest of the house. It was clear that this was where the Bones really lived. A second kitchen looked out upon the vegetable patches, much smaller than the one upstairs but well used, with muddy boots next to the back door, half-melted candles on the kitchen table, and jars holding tea leaves and coffee beans by the stove. The kitchen was connected to a cosy den heaped with cushions, blankets and board games, and that in turn led to a small library, the shelves overflowing with generations of accumulated books.

  [...]

  They had some juice and biscuits---shortbread from a Muggle bakery in nearby Eley, which Mr Bones made them promise to keep secret from Arthur Weasley---before going outside to explore. Susan led her past carrots and cauliflower, rhubarb and raspberries, Victoria's Muggle trainers getting increasingly muddy as they made their way towards the river.

  [...]

  The afternoon was spent outside. They wandered down the river, several times having to hop across mossy rocks to the other side when the east bank became too steep. They climbed trees, played pooh sticks, and looked for frogs, shrieking and running away every time they actually found one. Eventually they doubled back to the house, where Susan rooted out a skipping rope so that Victoria could show her how to hover in the air.

  [...]

  “Customer!” Mr Bones called out of the kitchen window, “and look at the state of you!” They were splattered with mud, with grass stains on their dresses and messy hair. “Upstairs to clean up, before your mother arrives for tea!”

  The girls retreated back to their bedrooms, where they washed and changed while Mr Bones was meeting the new customer. Victoria took her time about it: the day had already been eventful, and it all caught up with her as she lowered herself into the hot water of the bath. She explored the toiletries that had been left for her, scrubbing her face with half a sugar-lemon and washing her hair thoroughly with Sleekeazy's Hair Potion , which smelled strongly of coconut and left her long, dark hair gleaming in the fairylight.

  She decided to dress up for the evening, wanting to look nice for her birthday and make a good impression on Susan's mother. She selected the same velvet green dress robe she had worn to Dumbledore's party, slipped Mrs Malfoy's silver charm bracelet onto her wrist, and put up her hair up into a waterfall braid. After vacillating on the matter, she even used the tiniest amount of the makeup Pansy had given her for Christmas, applying some lip gloss and, after several failed attempts, eyeshadow.

  It was fortunate that she'd gone to the effort, because when Susan bounced into her room (knocking was apparently not known to Hufflepuffs) she was similarly attired, wearing an embroidered white dress robe and daisies in her hair.

  [...]

  They made their way to the ground floor kitchen, where the table had been laid for dinner.

  “Really, Bruce, you have a perfectly good dining room,” Evelyn complained as they were climbing down the spiral staircase, “why not use it?”

  Victoria preferred the kitchen. The candles were lit and the door had been left open, a gentle summer's breeze drifting in with the distant sounds of cattle lowing.
