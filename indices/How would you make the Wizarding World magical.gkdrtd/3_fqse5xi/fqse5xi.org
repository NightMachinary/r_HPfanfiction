I would probably mishmash a bunch of different magic world fictions together. So like stuff from TYPE-MOON, Ancient Magus Bride, Supernatural, The Magicians, Shadowrun, etc. So I like a bunch of stuff from TYPE-MOON but its generally far to grimdark far to much, so I would tone it down a bit in terms of amount. I would probably keep like 20% grimdarkness. Ancient Magus Bride has an incredible mystical/otherworldliness quality that I don't really see in much fiction. Magic ends up becoming pretty standard in a lot of fiction. The Magicians has an excellent whimsical quality to it while still being mature. Other fictions like Supernatural and a hidden magic version of Shadowrun are more flavor.

I would probably cut out a bunch of definitively high-magic aspects. Like with supernatural parts I would absolutely cut out stuff with Gods, angels, and demons or at least make it more vague so it doesn't literally have messengers of god but rather good natured spirit beings. I wouldn't want actual god to show up. Something more ambiguous.
