I enjoy the small things, not whole new dimensions or worlds. But the subtle difference between everything. Like I really like the whomping willow and I think more magical plants are needed to be explored. Like why are there so few magical trees? You think there be hundreds just as a way to build better wands or brooms or something. Or maybe magical insects like butterflies that can change the shape and color of their wings to mimic stuff or crickets with the ability to create enchanting lullabies. I think that would be cooler than one giant man-eating spider species.

And you're right if the worlds are already seperated why are the building not more extravagant. Where are the floating houses? Or shopping plazas built on a cloud or something. I imagine in times before planes and hot air balloons there would be at least some sort of floating city just cause wizards could.

Another thing I would like to see more is the religious aspect of the wizarding world. Like its fine and dandy for some of it to be Christianized because cultures change. But you think some of the old pagan religions would be prominent as those religions are very cult base and have rituals that could take on powerful meanings in the wizarding world. The few fanfics I see touch upon this always do it well and I just want more of this.

That is my take on a more magical wizarding world.
