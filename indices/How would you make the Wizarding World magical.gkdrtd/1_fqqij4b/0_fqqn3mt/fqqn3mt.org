Yeah, those could be cool. Like a garden where the flowers sound like wind-chimes, or someone straight up Alice-in-Wonderland's the whole thing with gossiping flora and a sapient caterpillar as a gardener, or something.

Or, imagine if on Halloween the dead actually stopped by, to look in on their descendants, like an extra-large family gathering. Religion, I think, would be very different, in a culture where literally anything is possible, with enough effort and the right knowledge.
