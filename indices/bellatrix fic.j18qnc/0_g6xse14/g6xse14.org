My main comment on the Neville's Girlfriend thing is simply 'think about why'. What does that add to your story? What influence would it have on the development of the OC-Bellatrix relationship? Does it have an actual impact on your planned plot or character development?

(In my opinion), there are no bad ideas, it's all about what you do with them. So basically, think about what you'd actually do with that idea and work out whether you like that or not. If you can create some interesting developments in a character with it - maybe the relationship breaking up motivates Neville to do something - or write an interesting plot arc or something, then keep it. Otherwise, try think of some impacts that idea can make on your plot or characters. If it doesn't do anything at all, then it might read as pointless to your readers and that could get people less invested in it.

Not to say that the developments or impacts need to be all drama and angst, mind. They can be positive or negative or even both!
