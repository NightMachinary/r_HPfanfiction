when deciding on it i realize it would definitely give character to the story, and angst, and just something not in the waters because for neville past with bellatrix. i have not fully decided but i was thinking of the oc having dark inside of her that isnt been awakened, and bellatrix helping that side of her come out. i have the outline of the plot and working on to make everything realistic and in character as possible. the oc's relationship with neville represents the good, light and innocence, while being bellatrix represents the complete opposite. i am myself interested to see on how i path this out and see it fall into place.
