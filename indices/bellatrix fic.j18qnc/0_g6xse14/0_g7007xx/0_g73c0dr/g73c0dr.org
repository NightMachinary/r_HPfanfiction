So, it's kind of a Seduction-Corruption 'Fall to the Dark for Love' story, huh? That could be fun.

But yes, that's exactly the kind of thing I meant when I said think about why. So, keep 'pathing' it out and asking why your ideas might be the way they are in that world and either finding an answer or adjusting your logic and then you'll find a story.

Just... don't be afraid to drop ideas if you can't find a logical way to fit them in. Remember, every idea you don't get in this story is an idea you can set at the centre of the next one!

Might be a good idea to look at the TV Tropes pages on Face-Heel turns or Shades of Conflict for some inspiration. They both cover writing advice and tropes (in the actual sense of the word, not the one this fandom commonly uses) around the idea of good vs evil and good falling to evil.
