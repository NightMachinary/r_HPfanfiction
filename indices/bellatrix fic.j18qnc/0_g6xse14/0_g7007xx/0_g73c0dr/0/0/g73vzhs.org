Glad I could help.

Oh, and on the pacing note - you mentioned in your first comment that you were worried you'd end up making your relationship messy and rushed - I'd say make a basic 'roadmap' of the relationship. You don't have to plot the entire thing out, but make a note of some events you want to happen to develop their courtship.

Generally, something like:

- The Meet Cute (how the two come into contact for the first time)

- The second meeting (always good for a callback or a 'deepening denial' moment)

- The First Temptation (basically the first time your OC feels 'Want' for Bellatrix or the Dark)

- The Crescendo (Technically a series of events, but basically flesh out your character's argument on being dark/bonking Bella and set up the final thing that'll make your OC fall)

- The Griping (Oh, woe is me, I can't like a maniac like her/Oh, woe is me, I can't want to maim and murder people)

- The Final Temptation (Basically the catalysing incident that sets the final fall brewing, maybe your character gets put into a situation where they have to make the choice to do something dark to survive/escape it)

- The Fall (the moment your OC goes dark and/or goes for Bella)
