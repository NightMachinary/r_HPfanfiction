roadmapping is very useful and important for fanfiction for characters like bellatrix, so thank you for reminding me to do that. i do have fears of lack of creativity to bring context to said scenarios, and how to bring opportunities for the oc to see how she does desire the darkness. her desire and want for bellatrix is prominent as soon as she sees her, but rather ignores, though she falls to accept it sooner and easier than admitting of the want of the dark. pureblood superiority does come into play as soon as bella is officially introduced into the ocs life, and bellatrix definitely helps with giving a slight nudge to the direction that the oc always had in the back of her mind.

thank you for your advice once again, you really brighten up spots and give me a lot to work with. ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤
