Eh. Creativity is overrated. So long as its well-founded and interesting, you'll do aight. Just keep questioning the situation - why would this happen, why would she choose this, why would she react in this way to that, etc. Once you know the whys, you'll find it easier to find ways to reveal them and ways to provide context to the scenarios in which you do.
