...what? I mean, okay. I'll admit that there is not as much explained about it in the books as I would have liked but the HP universe is literally our universe and then some. And even within the limitations of what we know about canon, there have to be better options then making the bank run by a different species do things like wizarding heritage tests. That's what we have a ministry of magic for. (And let's not even talk about weirdly specific rituals to remove powerful spells and/or Horcruxes from a person.) Especially if it's just "Drop some bloodinto this bowl and that's it."

I think most people do it because a) it's a trope by now and sticking to trope is what fandoms do best, sadly. And b) Gringotts is conveniently right there in Diagon Alley where wizards hang out all the time, especially Hogwarts students before the term starts. Making up an excuse for character x to be at Gringotts is laughably easy.

Basically I think it's a lazy and at times rediculous way to get a story rolling but I don't mind that much if the rest of the story is interesting.
