Their core competency is security, of course. You dump a pile of gold in your vault, they make sure that only the people you authorize can access it. Their cursebreaker branch is an offshoot of that: they know how to secure a treasure, and that means knowing every way that security can be defeated.

The second most obvious criterion for who can access a vault is inheritance. (The most obvious is "only the people I name", which isn't very forward-thinking and is probably a source of a lot of goblin wealth.) If you are keen to trust Gringotts with your security, you might want them to have a way to ensure that a given person is in the proper inheritance chain.

That's for someone who walks up and asks to access a specific vault without a key. (And pays a fee in advance for the privilege.) It's not for Harry finding out he's the lost heir of Merlin, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Rasputin, and Peggy Schuyler all at once and is thus heir to a fortune large enough to crush all who oppose him with the weight of the gold alone. That sort of inheritance ritual is not in the goblins' best interests, and it's unlikely they would agree to keep vaults active for centuries without payment.

Most likely, money with no owner that's located in the Gringotts vaults is split between the Ministry and Gringotts -- and the only reason the Ministry gets a cut is due to past goblin rebellions.

I tend to prefer depictions of goblins as technically honest but unhelpful and usurious.
