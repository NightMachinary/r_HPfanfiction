Since canon is open-ended, Gingotts can basically be anything as long as it is in addition to being a bank.

As for Harry's parents having inherited the vaults, etc. first, not necessarily. Considering they died during a war in which presumably many others could have, then those vaults could only have lost their heirs between the last time the Potters Sr entered Gringotts and Harry's first trip.

I personally imagine Gringotts to be a bank and little more. They provide deposit, investment, and loan options. Cursebreakers function as developing and maintaining the security of their premises and vaults. Additionally, they are sent out to recover valuables from tombs/ruins, functioning as a method of investment--think mining rights.
