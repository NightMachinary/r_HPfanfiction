"Cursebreaker for Gringott's, in Egypt", wink-wink, nudge-nudge, know what I mean know what I mean?

From what we've seen in HP canon about curses and the breaking thereof this job title might as well be an euphemism for mercenaries in the internal power struggles between the various goblin clans or professional thieves, excuse me, "security specialists" recovering valuables after hostile takeovers.
