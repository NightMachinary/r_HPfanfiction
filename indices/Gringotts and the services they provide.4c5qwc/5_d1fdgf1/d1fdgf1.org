You are thinking too much :) Just enjoy the stories. Besides, there are ways to explain things like Harry inheriting things while his parents didnt.

For example, perhaps not everyone has to have an inheritance test (as long as you have a key to your vault). In general it would only happen if there is a dispute or someone wants more information. So Harry's parents and grandparents and so on, may have been ignorant of their history.

As for what Gringotts really provides... all we have to go by is the very limited information in the books/lore. Thats why often people give Gringotts other powers and jobs in Fan Fiction, because its implied that Gringotts and Goblins are very powerful in the magical world. So much so that wizards/witches somewhat fear them.

Gringotts:

- Exchanges money
- Stores artifacts and money
- Provides curse breaking
- Provides money/affairs/property management services
- Provides a loose sort of... "stock market" style of system
- Provides identity verification (to some degree)
- Sponsors events in the wizarding world

Keep in mind that Gringotts and Goblins operate a commodity based system, and its my understanding that they do not pay any interest on money stored in their vaults.

They do however help you earn more money with your money via business ventures, investments, and other similar things. Point is, you earning more money, means they earn more money from you in payment for their services, as well as more money stored in the vaults which "could" be theirs one day based upon the restrictions on the vault as well as your current condition (alive/dead/incapacitated) and heir situation.

Also remember that there is a flow of money between Gringotts and the Muggle world (part of why they provide exchange services), meaning one could earn interest in the muggle world of banks, if wanted.
