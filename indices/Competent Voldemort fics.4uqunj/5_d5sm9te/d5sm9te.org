Linkffn(Dreams and Darkness Collide by Epic Solemnity)

No prophecy/BWL/Horcruxes, post Hogwarts, complete AU. Voldemort plans his takeover over the course of decades, going the political route and becoming Minister. Harry is an Empath, able to see the soul/aura of people, whether they are effectively a good person or incredibly vile. The Potters are tortured and killed, leaving Harry tremendously scarred and setting him on the path for revenge and justice by using his Empath ability to target and destroy the worst kind of people in Wizarding society.

It's HP/TMR but it's quite complicated as neither of them are idiots, there is some slash but it is rather insignificant compared to the conflicts. It's a constant battle for control. Riveting ethical serial killer drama and a complex mystery of the reasons and persons behind the Potter murders are the highlights to this ongoing story. It's also very well written. I was turned off by the slash at first but drawn in by what I described above. Definitely recommend.
