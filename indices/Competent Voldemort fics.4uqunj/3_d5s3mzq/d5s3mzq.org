An obvious answer would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] but I wouldn't be surprised if you've already heard of that one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] is another good choice. It's an AU that takes place in a world where Voldemort won the first war and rules Magical Britain. Voldemort's portrayal is pretty nuanced here, and you get a nice look into his mind-frame through his twisted relationship with Harry (Not slash btw).
