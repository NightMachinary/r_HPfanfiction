  The one grateful thought that he threw to the sky was that he was not surrounded by trees. Truly, Harry was used to waking up in enchanted and lonesome forests and while he could surely survive in one again, the wide-open, grassy plain was a sight for sore eyes.The untamed magic and general feel of a land unknown to him were far outweighing any relief he could find, however.Because of course Harry Potter, the boy who had never stuck between the lines of “physics” and “magic,” would again defy the rules and end up very, very far from Hogwarts -- the place where he should have been at the moment. Appearing in a world with nothing but the clothes on his back and the wand in his holster for protection was very unfortunate indeed, and it was only the mind-numbing shock Harry was in at the current moment that saved the grass in a small radius from him from an explosive destruction.“What,” he said, “is this.”OR.The one where Harry finds himself in Middle-Earth and goes with Bilbo on his quest, making attachments and saving a few lives along the way. But don't be fooled: Fawkes is the real hero of this story. This is basically an "EVERYTHING IS BETTER WITH FAWKES" story. I'm a big fan of his.

  Smaug lost his son to orcs years before taking Erebor. In another world Harry Potter is experiencing some strange changes while attempting to compete in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. But how could the two possibly be related?
