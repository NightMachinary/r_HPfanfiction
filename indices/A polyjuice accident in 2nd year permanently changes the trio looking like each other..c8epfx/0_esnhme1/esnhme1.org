Considering Harry is incredibly noble, he would explain the situation to the Grangers, and have them either send the police to get Ron from the Dursley's, or find a way to contact the Weasley's. Hermione would likely do the same as Harry and tell the Weasley's about the switch, which would motivate them to get Ron from Private drive.

If the Dursley's did anything to Harry(Ron) while he was there, I feel like Arthur would release Fred and George on them.
