Here's what I'm thinking. Third year, the trio nearly get their souls sucked out, somehow their souls get mixed up. Of course Dumbledore promises that its a temporary situation and that he'll find a way to fix it, but time drags on and it becomes clear that no solution is forthcoming, so they just learn to live with it. Obviously they become quite a bit closer due to this, while at the same time this strains their relationships with the people around them. Optional gender based body dysphoria component. Optional trio threesome as well.
