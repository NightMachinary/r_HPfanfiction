Personally I prefer "Daniel" to "Dan" if these two must be used. A wealthy London dentist who fathered Hermione seems too strait-laced a fellow to go by "Dan". "Emma Granger" at least sounds nice enough, but for myself, if we're talking pure fanon, I prefer "Helen Granger", as the Hermione of Greek mythology was the daughter of Helen of Troy. There's also "Sally Granger".
