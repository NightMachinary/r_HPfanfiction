I see large potential for keeping Hermione Ron pairing despite their new bodies.

Or you could go Harmony, with Harry and Hermione finding their (new) bodies end up growing attracted to one another, and Ron finding (to his dismay) that neither Harry or Hermione are attractive. Although a certain Ravenclaw Seeker catches his eye. And very confusing when he begins to notice his sister is growing up...
