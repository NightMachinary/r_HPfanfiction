I think 'curse' has two distinct meanings in Harry Potter. The first is like in 'The Killing Curse' - a spell, cast by wand, with malintent. But the second meaning is more in line with the old school type of curse: "any expressed wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall or attach to one or more persons, a place, or an object".*

I see it as a type of 'old magic'. There are no magical words or wand-waving. No sure fire way to invoke the magic. And no guaranteed effect. It's simply an expression of your malicious intent on the world, and the universe itself changes to make it come true.

And because it wasn't a simple spell, there is no simple remedy. You can't /finite/ this kind of curse, or 'trick' it by changing the name of the position. It's just now a fundamental part of how the world works.

*as an aside, I expect the two are related. Many of the most common old school curses, like cursing someone you truly hate to die, were studied extensively and eventually someone figured out a simple and reliable way to call on magic to make it happen. Thus the Killing Curse was born.
