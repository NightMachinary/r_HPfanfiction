Well I would think you are right because curses seem to attach to physical objects, locations and even to abstract things such as job openings. However the story hints at the fact that in this case, Voldemort used his wand at the point when he left the office (Harry thought that Voldemort was trying to curse Dumbledore when he saw the memory). So if that's the case, some intent concentrated through the wand was definitely there. But I suppose that, as other users said, the purpose of the curse was not born out of some strategic thinking but more out of pettiness (I mean even with proper DADA training, few wizards could hold their ground against Voldemort by themselves). He is kind of like the evil witch who sets the curse from the sleeping beauty because she wasn't invite at the princess's birthday feast.
