Perhaps the DADA position was easier to curse. I don't imagine he could've kept Dumbledore out of Hogwarts or Ministers out of the Ministry for that long if he'd wanted to. You're right, there are curse-breakers who fix this sort of thing. I think Dumbledore not breaking the curse is likely a plot hole.
