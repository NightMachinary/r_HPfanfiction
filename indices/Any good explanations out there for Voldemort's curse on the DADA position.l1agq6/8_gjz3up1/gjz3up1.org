Canon seems to imply that the act of refusing the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professorship to a dark wizard as skilled (powerful) as Lord Voldermort established a curse on the position.

Consider the fact that even when his power was broken on October 31, 1981, the curse remained active. It was only with Voldemort's death that the curse was lifted.

Indeed, it is interesting if this were the case as it establishes that actions have significance beyond what they would for Muggles. Lily and Harry could provide protection to others with their sacrifice whereas Voldemort (a selfish man obsessed with immortality) being rejected from a position he deeply desires could result in a curse on the position.

There are other instances where actions are more significant for magicals than muggles.

I'll end with this quote from DH "Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts."
