A combination of things as listed. Another is even without fandom bashing, Dumbledore's canon personality includes a great deal of arrogance. He got better from the time of Grindelwald, but even so he keeps /everything/ to himself as he's the only one who can handle things, or such.

I can see him thinking if he can't find a curse, it must not really exist, it's just really bad luck.
