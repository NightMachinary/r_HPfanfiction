Funny you say that. My thought was similarly in relationship with the Marauders. It's stated that the Potters escaped him three times before he finally caught up with them. I like to think that at some point they used their Animagi forms to elude him and escape him so he cursed them so that they will only experience freedom in their animal forms. James ends up dead while in hiding, Sirius is only truly free when he is in his dog shape, otherwise spending time in Azkaban or in his parents' house and Pettigrew is only free as a rat because as soon as his human form is revealed he runs to Voldemort who treats him for the rest of his life as little more than a slave.
