Honestly... I don't know where either tropes came from. My question stemmed from that trope that he was trying to weaken his adversaries but as one user mentioned, I think they're right and Voldemort was just being petty. I also don't think he is really crazy... he is supposed to be actually quite calculated and secretive. Does he suffer from megalomania and a god complex that make him overconfident? Absolutely. Is he a sociopath with extreme sadistic tendencies and complete disregard for human life? Yes. But he is not the cuckoo type of crazy. He is not like the Joker. In fact he does seem quite well calculated and sober to his surroundings. He only loses his cool when it comes to Harry.
