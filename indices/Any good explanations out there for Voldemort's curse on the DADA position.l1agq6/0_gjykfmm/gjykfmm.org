I think that you're misunderstanding why he put the curse on the position. It wasn't some strategic act of warfare intended to reduce the strength of enemy soldiers (even though many fics like to portray it that way). It was just Tom being petty because he couldn't get the job.

As for why he didn't curse any other positions once his reign of terror started, there simply wasn't a need to do so. If he wanted the Minister or the head of the DMLE dead, he would just kill them. Voldemort openly killing the head of the DMLE is a lot more effective at causing fear and chaos than him claiming responsibility for their affair being discovered or them catching a bad case of dragon pox or something.

And cursing the position of headmaster would just give Dumbledore more time and motivation to stop him. Especially if it decided to remove Dumbledore by convincing him to dedicate his full attention to the war effort. It's far better for Dumbledore to be kept busy in a very public way.

Dumbledore probably did try to have the curse removed at some point, since there is no reason why he wouldn't. It's not canon that the curse was tied to the Diadem, but it is the easiest explanation for why no one was ever able to find or stop the curse. It could also just be that Hogwarts is such a magical place with so many overlapping and interconnecting enchantments and magical effects that it became impossible to single out and remove one specific curse. We really don't know enough about how magic works to be able to say for sure.
