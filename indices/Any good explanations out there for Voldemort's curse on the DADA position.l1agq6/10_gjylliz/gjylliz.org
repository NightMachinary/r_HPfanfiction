This series has breaking the DADA curse as a subplot: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22220911]])

- The curse intensifies negative emotions towards the DADA professor so the cause of the incumbent's death or resignation varies and looks natural in isolation. As it affects other people it can't be detected by looking at the DADA professor.
- The curse doesn't happen every single year.
- The curse is anchored to a physical object in the RoR, where only the elves and Voldemort know how to access the room.
- Parseltongue acts as a 'backdoor' to Hogwarts defenses.
