I like that theory. Diadem and curse were placed at the same time as well. First saw this in Wind Shear.

Another one I liked was in The House of Potter Rebuilt. The new DADA makes it a class project, all years, to brainstorm how the curse works. A couple Ravenclaws win, it turns out to be a bad luck curse powered by a taboo on the word 'professor'.
