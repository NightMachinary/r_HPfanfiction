The first, I have no idea, sorry: it's something I remembered from months back. I do remember it involved Amelia basically disowning Susan from being her heir, since she destroyed an alliance the Bones had with the Potters and Longbottoms for centuries and the former basically propped her family up, if that helps.

The second was linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11271762/1/The-Wish][11271762]])

It's not very good, IMHO, and I found it after a Google search for similar fics to my OP (not much luck there either, sigh!).
