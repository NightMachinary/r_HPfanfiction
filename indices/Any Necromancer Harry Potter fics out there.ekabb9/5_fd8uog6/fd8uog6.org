linkao3(survival is a talent) - WIP drarry and very interesting. "Golden trio" and "silver trio" become friends.

linkffn(bitter hug of mortality) - harry is a squib but necromancy is just the whole new magic.

Linkffn(6099036) - Caf√©. The first half is boring as hell but there is a necromancer after that and he teaches Harry

linkao3(dead things by eclipsewing) - this one is just brilliant. Read it.

linkao3(Inevitabilities) - I heard about it

And [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2528972/chapters/5621090][Hell to Raise]]. It's abandoned and just almost 20k words but it's still good.

  All Harry knew that day was that his Aunt Petunia had begun to scream. When he came from his cupboard to see what was wrong, he found her sitting pale and distraught on the spotless kitchen tiles. She was gibbering as that evening's three-kilogram chicken dinner did a rather acrobatic tap-dancing lap of the room, squawked loudly, and then fled through the window and out into the back yard.
