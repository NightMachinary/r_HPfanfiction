Not so. I've been reading it- it's decent- and Harry is trained in necromancy, charms, and enchantment before he ever reaches hogwarts. No, he's not a superwizard, but he's described as "leagues ahead" of his classmates, Petri is surprised by his ability to perform certain kinds of magic- stating that he couldn't have done better himself- and Ulrich is utterly astonished by Harry's abilities as a ten year old. It's another one of the many, many fics where he's tutored in magic by some benefactor, with massive amounts of magical theory. So yes, it absolutely fits my description.

I wasn't trying to "pigeonhole the fic into a negative stereotype." I was pointing out that that form of reductionist description is invalid. Lumping fics into simplified, broad categories like that does many writers a massive disservice. While this fic /does/ fit the description of "Harry is found by a powerul wizard who teaches him all about magic long before he gets to Hogwarts," and is even complete with other common tropes from such stories, summing it up with just that sentence would clearly not be a fair description. the same goes for many of the stories which begin at or near the point of canon. Many of the most creative, well written fics I've read start at ysars 1-3, but they're not just another one of the "thousand or so canon rehash fics."
