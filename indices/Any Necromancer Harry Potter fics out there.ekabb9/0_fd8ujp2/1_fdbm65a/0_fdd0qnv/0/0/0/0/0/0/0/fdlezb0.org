Some reasons why your "reductionist description" is inaccurate (and thus why I said 'wrong on all counts' in my previous comment):

#+begin_quote
  Harry is trained in necromancy, charms, and enchantment before he ever reaches hogwarts. No, he's not a superwizard, but he's described as "leagues ahead" of his classmates,
#+end_quote

Harry's training was deeply specialized to the point that he only knew how to perform the few spells/tasks that Petri needed him to know for his role as unpaid assistant/slave labor. That eventually changed about a year before Harry got his letter, but when he arrives at Hogwarts he is still only 'leagues ahead' of his classmates when it comes to a few particular spells and Petri's extremely spotty coverage of theory. After that point his drive to learn pushes him ahead of most of his yearmates, but not much farther than other similarly enthusiastic students (such as the people in Charms Club).

  Petri is surprised by his ability to perform certain kinds of magic- stating that he couldn't have done better himself
#+end_quote

Later in the story someone explains that it's actually extremely common for wizards to have an innate talent for at least one of the many different forms of divination, with a lot of variation in where each person's talent lies. Roughly 50% of wizards have a particular knack for at least one form. In that context, Harry's talent isn't actually very special.

  Ulrich is utterly astonished by Harry's abilities as a ten year old. It's another one of the many, many fics where he's tutored in magic by some benefactor, with massive amounts of magical theory. So yes, it absolutely fits my description.
#+end_quote

Ulrich is an unreliable source of information due to his nature at the time of that conversation. His perspective on the matter is unlikely to be accurate, and Harry rightly treats it with skepticism. Also, to call Petri a "benefactor" would be a bizarre misrepresentation of his behavior towards Harry.

#+begin_quote
  I wasn't trying to "pigeonhole the fic into a negative stereotype." I was pointing out that that form of reductionist description is invalid. Lumping fics into simplified, broad categories like that does many writers a massive disservice. (...) Many of the most creative, well written fics I've read start at ysars 1-3, but they're not just another one of the "thousand or so canon rehash fics."
#+end_quote

If you meant your previous comment as a 'take that' over my use of the term "canon rehash", then you landed way off base. I don't see anything inherently negative about fics starting at year 1 and/or following the stations of canon. There's also nothing inherently negative about that sort of story being extremely common. "Canon rehash" is simply a descriptive term for a large category of fics that Blood Crest does not fall into. That you assumed the phrase has negative connotations says more about your own opinions than it does mine.
