Dumbledore makes his thoughts about prophecies abundantly clear. He believes that Trelawney's prophecy will affect Voldemort as long as Voldemort believes in it and acts on it. But, if Harry rejects the Power that [Voldemort] Knows Not by becoming a bully --- because fear and violence are powers that Voldemort knows all too well --- the Prophecy will simply fail, like most of them do.

He would just have to do the best he can fighting Voldemort without the Prophecy, and hope that some other opportunity to defeat him arises.
