It's still strange. I dont mean that some strange force makes the prophecy to be fulfilled, simply that, once set in motion (when Voldemort murders the Potters and marks Harry), things will turn so it is fulfilled. Because it is a divination thing, prophecies are about how things will ultimately turn out. It means that through their chosen course of action, Harry and Voldemort will face each other and one of them will kill each other. If Dumbledore gets Harry killed (which seems a bit ooc, having a kid killed because he's a bully, rather than educate him...), then the prophecy won't be fulfilled. So either Dumbledore won't kill Harry, or prophecies are rubish, since this particular one is already set to motion.
