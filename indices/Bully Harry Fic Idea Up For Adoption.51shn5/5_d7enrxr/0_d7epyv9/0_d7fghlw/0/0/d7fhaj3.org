Dumbledore seems to believe otherwise, or at least says so to Harry. From HBP, Chapter 23:

  ‘Yes -- just love,' said Dumbledore. ‘But Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him -- and in doing so, he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him!'

  ‘But it comes to the same --'

  ‘No, it doesn't!' said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, ‘You are setting too much store by the prophecy!'

  ‘But,' spluttered Harry, ‘but you said the prophecy means --'

  ‘If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?'

  ‘But,' said Harry, bewildered, ‘but last year, you said one of us would have to kill the other --'

  ‘Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawney's words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don't you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realise that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!'

  ‘Of course you would!' cried Dumbledore. ‘You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal ... in other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you ... which makes it certain, really, that --'

  ‘That one of us is going to end up killing the other,' said Harry. ‘Yes.'
