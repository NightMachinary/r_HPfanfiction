It doesn't make make sense that the prophecy would fail. Either prophecies don't fail, or they don't exist. If they don't exist, why would Voldemort act upon it.

A true prophecy is something that is fulfilled no matter what. That you act upon it or not doesn't matter. If it's true, Dumbledore won't be able to kill Harry. If it isn't, Voldemort wouldn't have act upon it in the first place (He's one of the better informed wizards in the world, he just has to know if prophecies are rubbish or not...).
