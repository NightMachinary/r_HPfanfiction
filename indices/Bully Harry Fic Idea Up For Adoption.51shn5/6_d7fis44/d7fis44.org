As he grows, his bullying gets worse and worse and he's soon casting spells that have intent to hurt other people, laughing. He doesn't realise he's being drawn into the Dark Arts until it's to late and he kills someone. He then runs to Dumbledore, sobbing.

But, it's to late and Harry has already done the damage and no one will forgive him. He was so mean and spiteful to everyone that they band together and leave him outside to fend for himself. He returns home, back to the loving Dursleys, and finds them dead.

Unsure of what he should do, he turns to his bullying partner, Draco, and walks straight into the home where Voldemort is.
