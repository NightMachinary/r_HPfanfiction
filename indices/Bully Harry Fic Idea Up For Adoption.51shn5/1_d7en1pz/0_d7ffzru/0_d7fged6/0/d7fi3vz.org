I agree, but if Bully Harry ended up being essentially useless for Dumbledore's ends, I see no reason why he wouldn't start mentoring Neville as a backup. Bully Harry essentially becomes a decoy. Why couldn't LV change his mind about who the prophecy pointed to halfway through the series, especially with some manipulating on Dumbledore's side?
