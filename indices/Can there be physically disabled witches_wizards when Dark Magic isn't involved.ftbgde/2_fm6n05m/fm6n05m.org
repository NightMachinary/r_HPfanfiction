I treat it as reattaching the limb rather than growing your entire leg back like a lizard. The cases where it cannot be reattached are where the cut is cursed and resists healing. If you can't counter the curse then you can't put the limb back. Healing is more advanced and faster than normal and the degrees of healing mean you just need to make your own limits. If you can turn a teacup into a tortoise then why not a log into a leg.
