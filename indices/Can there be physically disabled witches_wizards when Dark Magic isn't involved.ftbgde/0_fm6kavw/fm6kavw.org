My usual stance is that wizards can fix any injury, illness, or malady in a trice, so long as it is not magical in nature. From there, degrees of difficulty vary.

Not necessarily just Dark Magic either, but magic in general. Of course, having a spell that is specifically designed to resist attempt to heal it is going to be more pronounced in this effect, but even a simple diffindo would produce an injury that is harder to heal than if the same injury was made with a sword.

In Harry's case, as with Percy and Dumbledore, it may be that genetic issues such as poor vision run into similar problems.
