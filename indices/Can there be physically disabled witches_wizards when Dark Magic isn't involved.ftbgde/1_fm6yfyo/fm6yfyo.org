- This is getting into headcanon territory, but I think there's a difference between fixing an injury like a broken bone by returning a person to their baseline state and fixing a congenital disability like myopia, where the nearsigntedness /is/ the person's baseline state. Such a permanent alteration of living tissue might even involve Dark Magic. So, there may be a potion for regrowing a lost limb (We know there's one for bones.), but not one for regrowing a congenitally missing limb.
- There is nothing stopping a wizard from going in and magically transforming the physical shape of an eye; but unless they can do it with the accuracy of an opthalmologist, they can mess up disastrously. Teeth are simpler, however.
- As for non-Dark nonfatal injuries, I think that pretty much all of them can be fixed, unless the fanfic author wants Hermione to be physically crippled by the Troll in their fic, which happens surprisingly often.
