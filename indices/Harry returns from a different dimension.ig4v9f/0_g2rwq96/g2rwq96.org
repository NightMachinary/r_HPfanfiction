[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942): Harry jumps the Veil after Sirius, lands in Star Wars universe, gets lobotomized into a Sith by Palpatine, and returns to HPverse after 4 years (only 6 weeks passed here). Typical Darth Marrs fic with lots of great moments and ridiculous nonsense.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/][Shadow Walks]], linkffn(6092362): Harry traveled through many dimensions in search of his long lost Hermione

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): Badly traumatized Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville spend some time in a new dimension, but still return to finish their job.
