I have an interest in chess -- not enough to spend hours on consulting openings or playing in general, but enough that I play once a week-ish at a local chess club.

Yes, they're somewhat legitimate sentences. Chess just happens to be basically impossible to make sound exciting, especially to people who don't care about it (aside from blitz, which I'd imagine can be fun to watch even if your chess knowledge only goes as far as "knows how the pieces move").

Even as a chess player (kinda) myself, I would never bother going into detail when describing chess in a fic, except maybe for fics where chess is a major focus (what about a "Ron the Chess Champion" fic?), beyond "they played chess, Ron won, the end".
