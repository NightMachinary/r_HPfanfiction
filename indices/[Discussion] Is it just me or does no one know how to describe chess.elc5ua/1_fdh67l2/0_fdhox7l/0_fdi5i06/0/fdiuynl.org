Hmm, the fandom's fairly dead, and there's not much activity. I can't remember which are the best fics, and there's very slim pickings so what's there isn't amazing to more developed fandoms, but I'd say linkffn(Hikaru no Ghost) is decent, there's a lot of works by esama (who you may know for Business and Island of Fire, both fantastic) who is also a great writer for HikaGo, though I haven't read many of their works because I felt like reading fem!Hikaru at that time, there's also a lot of solemn, one shots out there that are good, and I would recommend linkao3(A kid like that? by Amber_and_Ash). I'd also recommend linkao3(Affection by Veltpunch) which is a K-pop minor crossover, though I fear it may be dead given the tragic state of f(x) in real life, even though Hikaru has already left them.

The show was definitely well researched, and the manga had Yukari Yoshihara 6-dan as the advisor, though she was only a 4-dan for most of the manga's run and later a 5-dan in 2002. If you want to read or watch other strategy game manga/animes, I'd highly recommend March Comes in Like a Lion, which is an amazing series about Rei, a 17 year old shogi player. It's not as focused on playing games as HikaGo, and a lot is focused on his mental state, but everything is amazing. I believe the advisor is Manabu Senzaki 9-dan, so the games are well thought out, and he also provides commentary at the end of chapters.
