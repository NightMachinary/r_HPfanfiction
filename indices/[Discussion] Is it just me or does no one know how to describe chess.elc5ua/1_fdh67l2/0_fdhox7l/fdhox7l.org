The difficulty of describing strategy games like chess is made even more apparent in the Hikaru no Go fandom. It's the awkwardest thing, reading works where authors fail to describe how the game works when its central to the story. Describing chess is hard enough when you have pieces with individual names to help convey what's happening on the board, but then Go doesn't even have that. Most writers probably haven't even touched a Go stone nor understand how to play it, at least most people know chess. And since HikaGo involves high level professionals, authors need to use annotations, though few do.
