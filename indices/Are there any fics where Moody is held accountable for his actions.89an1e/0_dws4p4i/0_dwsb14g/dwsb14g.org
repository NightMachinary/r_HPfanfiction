While you have a point, he wouldn't necessarily be caught. He'd just have a much more frustrating time of it. I mean, no one found his behaviour odd, so it's not that I think disciplinary action would out him. I just think he got away with far too much, because he was a valued veteran, essentially. McGonagal let him drag Malfoy off with only a pitiful attempt at reprimanding Moody, after he admitted to blatantly ignoring the code of conduct the teachers apparently have. No wonder no one bothered going to her about Umbridge.
