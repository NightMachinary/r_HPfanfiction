It is hard to see how that wouldnt just become a 'Crouch got found out early' fic. I am pretty sure I read a few of those, although it is usually more along the lines of "smart student figured out he was drinking polyjuice from flask"

One possible way to go about this is to have a badass Moody who reacts poorly when he is told what his replacement did. "Let me get this straight, my replacement used unforgivable on students, transformed a student into a ferret .... What kind of school are you running Dumbledore?" Then he goes and gets a team of investigators and digs up all the shit the school has burried.....
