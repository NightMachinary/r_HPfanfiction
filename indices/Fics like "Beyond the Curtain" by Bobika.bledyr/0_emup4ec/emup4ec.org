The author here.

Thanks a lot for recommending the story - truly appreciated.

I'm trying to think of the stories that were my inspiration. Stages of Hope linkffn(6892925) and The Skitterleap linkffn(5150093) come to mind but they've influenced the mood and the characters' development more than the plotline or the worldbuilding.

You might still enjoy them, though
