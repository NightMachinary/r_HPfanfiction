I always keyed in on the comment of "taking the life of an innocent" to me that meant killing a child as only the youngest are truly innocent. However, that explanation truly doesn't cover Myrtle or the creation of nagini as a horcrux though the murder of the baby to make Voldemort's homunculus could account for that. Of course canon implies if not states that the death of Bertha was used for that.

In my mind that would make the killing just a little more horrific then all the other murders.
