I don't know in what language you read the books, but in French, it's made pretty clear that killing, murdering someone only "fissure" the soul, while creating an Horcruxe completely tear it.

I think you could compare that to having someone scarry himself, and having someone else litteraly rip his limb out. Both are bad, but one is worse than the others, and way order to heal.
