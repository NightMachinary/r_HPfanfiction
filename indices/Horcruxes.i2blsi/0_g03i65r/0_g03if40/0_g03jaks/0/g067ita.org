It's similar in English. If I remember correctly, simply killing someone isn't enough -- it has to be an act of /murder./ Cold-blooded premeditated killing. So something like Harry killing Quirrel in book 1 wouldn't count, because that was self defense. Snape killing Dumbledore wouldn't count either because that was pre-arranged between them, basically an assisted suicide. And then the Horcrux creation itself involves some sort of ritual that JK has never divulged to the public but allegedly made her editor throw up when she told him.
