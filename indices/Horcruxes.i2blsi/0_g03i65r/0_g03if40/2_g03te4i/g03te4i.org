I'm going to use a metaphor from a completely different series to explain how I see the difference. In the Wheel of Time series, there's a group of people who follow the "Way of the Leaf." This is a pacifist lifestyle where, just as a leaf does not fight where it may fall, they seek never to harm another living being. The explanation they give is that violence damages the one who does it as well as the one who is attacked. An axe may chop down a tree, but the axe is also dulled by the wood.

Using this metaphor, killing someone is like the axe chopping down the tree. The killer's soul is hurt like the axe is dulled, but it can be healed like the axe can be sharpened. But to create a horcrux is like leaving the axe embedded in the tree, then taking a hammer and pounding it in further before breaking the blade with part of it stuck in the tree. Now you have a broken axe. You could sharpen it again, but it will never be whole. To create a horcrux, you have to destroy another person's life and irrevocably damage your own soul. That seems a bit darker to me than just killing a person,
