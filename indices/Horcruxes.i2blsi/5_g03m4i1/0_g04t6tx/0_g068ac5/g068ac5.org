There's a lot we're not told about what makes dark magic dark and why the Unforgivables in particular are worse than the alternatives. Given that the killing curse isn't depicted as being particularly violent in and of itself, it seems likely to me that the reason it's considered so dark ties into something about how it works at a fundamental level, or perhaps the intent needed behind the spell. Crouch-as-Moody claims that a class of fourth years could all cast it at him simultaneously and he wouldn't get so much as a nosebleed, while Bellatrix says the cruciatus only works if you actually intend to cause harm. So perhaps part of why the Unforgivables are Unforgivable is that successfully casting them at all is /de facto/ proof of intent to kill/torture/enslave. Whereas an entrail-expelling curse, on the other hand, might have a fig leaf of an excuse along the lines of "I didn't /mean/ to do it!" (As flimsy as that would be.)
