I don't think Avada Kedavra isn't the worst spell ever. I mean, dying by the entrails expelling curse sounds much much worse than an instant death. I'm not saying that the killing curse is a good spell, but there are much worse ways to go. But I do agree about the split soul being unnatural. It seems like the soul is the way it should be and should stay that way in order to stay sane.
