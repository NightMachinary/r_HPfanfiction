linkffn(9474009) has Harry going back in time to 4th year and gets resorted to Slytherin. He is fairly dark grey but doesn't kill people for no reason. There's a lot of Hermione/Nevill/Weasley bashing in there too.

Also this link has all the threads that mention Slytherin in them. Some won't be about Harry being sorted there but that should be the majority of them.
