linkffn(on the way to greatness by mira mirth) is probably the most recommended one out there. It's the quintessential Slytherin Harry story. Though updates are slowwwwww.

The linkffn(They Shook Hands : Year 1 (New Version) by dethryl) series is much recommended but I personally view it as a not as good version of OTWTG. In my opinion there isn't any conflict where there should be, especially between Draco (and his father) and Harry.

I looooooooove linkffn(magical relations) which has a Slytherin Harry and the characters are all awesome. It solves the problem I listed above about a lack of conflict and has a nice sort of realism with the characters.

Seconding the Serpensortia series! I really came to care about the secondary characters, who were very well written. Bummer that it's "completed" after third year, but you do get resolution.
