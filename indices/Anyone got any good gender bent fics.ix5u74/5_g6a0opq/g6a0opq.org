One of the very few I like is one where after he dies, Draco meets Harry in between and Harry reveals that Death is going to let him send someone to another, very similar world to be reborn. Draco agrees, as his life hasn't been great between his father, Astoria dying, his son, and so on.

Cue the birth of "Dancia Lyra Malfoy", who decides she's going to help Harry's shit life this time around. It's fluffy and very well done. And very humorous in spots.

It's called "A Life Twice Lived"
