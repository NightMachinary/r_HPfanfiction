Naruto Fan-Fiction felt very similar, but Worm is radically different. It's a small community, and the canon text is both massive and complex. It's most popular on sci-fi creative writing forums. This all leads to some very detailed investigation into canon mechanics and character development that can get pretty intense.

Most of the works tend to focus on the same main character as the original works, but the ending to canon and the degree to which the community relates with her (at least initially), means that post-canon works are grilled like you wouldn't believe. Heaven help you if you mess up her character. . .
