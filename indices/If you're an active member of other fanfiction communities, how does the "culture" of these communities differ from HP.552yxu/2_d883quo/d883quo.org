I read a lot of Worm fanfiction and i think the biggest difference is the interaction between authors and readers. Most worm fanfics are posted on SpaceBattles or SufficientVelocity and it's very easy for fans to ask questions or make suggestions to the authors.

It's a lot easier and more convient than the review section on ffnet or AO3.

The other big difference is that worm fanfic hardly ever gets finished. I believe that's mostyl due to Worm's ending which just isn't all that easy to replicate if you don't want to follow canon to closely and the main antagonist requires a very specific powerset and setting to defeat.

Most fics just focus on the main character getting a different power and/or changing something slightly in the beginning and see how the changes would affect the story. There aren't all that many big AU's and while HP fanfiction often focuses on romance it mostly plays a background role in Worm, if there's any romance at all.
