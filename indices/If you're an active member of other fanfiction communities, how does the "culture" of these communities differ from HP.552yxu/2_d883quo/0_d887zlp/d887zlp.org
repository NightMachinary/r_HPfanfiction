Unless it's Silencio. Ia Ia shipping chart f'taghn!

But yeah, the Worm fanfiction community has the distinction of being /the/ place to go if you want to do more than just write some fics in that Universe. That's the upside of it.

The downside is the sheer amount of thought you have to put into even a minor fic as each canon character has such a diverse set of abilities and characterisation (this includes PHO, which could be said to be a character in its own right) that giving your main character a badly thought out power set will get them killed before you've finished writing the intro (which is kinda hard, given that the first real station in canon is a fight with a raging Dragon-man that gets bigger in size and power as the fight intensifies, even the weakest villain on display could tear through a Death Eater squad as if they weren't even there and oh yeah, your average antagonist [Kaiser, Coil, Lung, Jack Slash, Nilbog, Mannequin, Bonesaw, Shatterbird, Echidna, Teacher etcetera] makes Voldemort look like a pussy-and the Endbringers make THEM look like chumps).

And may Khepri help you if you get a character's characterisation or actions wrong without justification.

So to sum up, it's hard to get going but damn it's a fun sandbox to play in! It helps that the whole thing can be found for free [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][here]]. It's a long goddamn read, but oh so worth it.
