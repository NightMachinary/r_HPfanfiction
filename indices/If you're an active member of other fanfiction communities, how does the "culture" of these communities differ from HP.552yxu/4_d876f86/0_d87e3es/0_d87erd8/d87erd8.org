Canon Naruto is entertaining for a small period of time and then he's almost annoying. Not that canon Sasuke is any better. I need a mix for HP fan fiction. Reading canon re-iterated over and over gets dry, but sometimes authors get over the top in their characterizations. I cannot stand Snarry and Drarry fics, and I literally don't understand Harry/Riddle. The man kills his parent so he screws him?
