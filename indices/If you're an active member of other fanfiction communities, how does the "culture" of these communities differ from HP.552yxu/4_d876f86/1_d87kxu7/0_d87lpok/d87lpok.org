Linkffn(11516692) is a pretty well written time travel story I'm reading at the moment. Linkffn(11542676) is ok, it has a Naruto trying to be a serious ninja approach, inspired by Zabuza. Mrs.Insaneone is an author that writes a couple pretty good Harry Potter/Naruto crossovers that take place in the Naruto world. Linkffn(11634921) is kind of a crack Harry Potter/Naruto crossover. Then you can also sort by favorites on the Naruto fanfic section and you'll find a couple older ones that are good or ok. Team 8 is an ok read. I thought Perfect Lionhearts Naruto story is pretty fun for crack, but I know a lot of people have issues with his writing.
