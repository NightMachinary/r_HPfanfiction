FFN did a lot of good in bringing communities together and letting them find each other.

But it did kill a few other communities.

Ranma was one of these.

The number of FF written before FFN took over versus the number it holds is night and day.

But in Ranma there was a sense of what ifs.

Since Genma set up so many marriage contracts we usually played in the Which Tendo Girl now? Or Who can Ranma beat up next?

It was a pretty good community to be in. Even the Akane lovers versus haters didn't divide us.
