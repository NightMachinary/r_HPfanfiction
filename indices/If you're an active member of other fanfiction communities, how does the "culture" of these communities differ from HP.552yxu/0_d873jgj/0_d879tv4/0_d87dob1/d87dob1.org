Agreed, I'm not anti people loving her but I just don't get it. She just goes from weird jealous fangirl to girlfriend too quickly imo.

Though honestly I would just have liked Harry to not get together with anybody or at least ambiguously have him with Ginny but not have the epilogue. That way we could let our imaginations fill in the rest with our own preferences.
