You're absolutely right about not having enough character progression with Ginny, I don't know anyone who would say otherwise. I do think its unkind, and definitely not canon, to say Ginny only dated other people to get Harry's attention. What we do see of her character is that she is a very outgoing person. Dating two boys when she is 14 and 15 is normal behavior.

JK didn't write any romance, and despite having a pretty large number of characters very few have any depth. The only female character who got any significant time is Hermione. After that Ginny, Luna, Fleur, and Tonks are all similar levels of not much for the time they're present.
