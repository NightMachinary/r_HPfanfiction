After CoS, I don't believe for a moment that Ginny would settle for any other bloke than Harry.

I admire her that instead of becoming a stalker or a mopping mess, she actually resorted to strengthen herself, make herself useful for his cause, become his friend, and improve her overall standing among the student body.

Some readers expressed dismay that this transformation of Ginny was not written EXPLICITLY by JKR and thus not credible. I disagree. Small hints are occasionally given beginning in GoF, and they became quite extensive in OotP. Also, just because something is not explicitly written by the author, doesn't mean you can't deduct it from other given facts.

Ginny's transformation from a silly fangirl to a strong young woman and finally to a heroine is the key reason I like her so much.
