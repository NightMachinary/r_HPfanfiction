  Agreed, I'm not anti people loving her but I just don't get it. She just goes from weird jealous fangirl to girlfriend too quickly imo.

Don't know where jealous comes into this, but when we meet Ginny she's 10 years old wanting to see the hero Harry Potter, then she's still 10 when she sticks her elbow in butter. Then she's 11 when he has Voldemort possess her and almost kills half a dozen people. Then 4 years later she and Harry start dating.

Your complaint of it happening too fast doesn't hold up, that isn't opinion there are years between when she is the awkward kid we meet and when they get together.
