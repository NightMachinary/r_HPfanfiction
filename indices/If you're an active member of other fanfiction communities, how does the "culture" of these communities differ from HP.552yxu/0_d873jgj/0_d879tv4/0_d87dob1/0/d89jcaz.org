  Agreed, I'm not anti people loving her but I just don't get it. She just goes from weird jealous fangirl to girlfriend too quickly imo.

The problem isn't this, I feel. We know that she's hot and that's reason enough for a teenager (or an adult...) to want to date her. Add on the fact that she has a shared interest with Harry (Quidditch), broadly shares his world view (consider reactions of Ginny vs Hermione to Harry cursing Malfoy in HBP), and that they have a history (Chamber of Secrets events) and it's no surprise that Harry ended up dating her.

The problem isn't that they dated. The problem is that they lasted as a couple and got married. But that's a problem with HP generally: far too much successful young love.
