Yeah, I agree completely. I know irl people do marry their high school sweethearts though, so I could see them marrying and breaking up. I can imagine that Harry wanting to be a part of the Weasley family in a more permanent way as well as desiring to be loved by Ginny due to his crummy childhood. I tend to enjoy post epilogue fics where they spilt up for this reason, I can see the marriage happening but not it lasting forever and ever.
