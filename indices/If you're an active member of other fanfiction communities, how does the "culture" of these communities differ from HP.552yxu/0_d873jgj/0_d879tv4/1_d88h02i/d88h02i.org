I really liked Harry/Ginny pre-HBP when it was an outside pairing, but after that I stopped reading it as much. I can kinda see where you are coming from. I didn't really like JK's characterization of Ginny or the nature of their relationship. Seems like Ginny is a really safe choice for Harry and it makes a lot of sense for Harry to join the Weasley family. It just seemed to inevitable after HBP, and it wasn't nearly as interesting to read.

That being said, there are some really great canon-compliant post-Hogwarts fics like linkffn(Strangers at Drakesaugh) and linkffn(The First Day) that are good reads.
