I've read in a number of other fandoms and the number one thing I notice about HP after is the sheer size of the community. Seriously, it's huge compared to almost everything else. HP fandom is spoiled for choice and variety of fic; anyone who hasn't read extensively elsewhere doesn't know how good they have it here.
