HP fans are very protective of canon in general, and do not like to see any variation. The only variation they seem to accept is a more powerful version of Harry.

On top of which, they have a really strict definition of canon that includes not only the books and movies, but all the stuff on Pottermore as well.

This really limits the writers overall (to really just alternate perspective fics) and harry Sue stories.

It's kind of annoying to me, since the world does have a lot of room for exploration, but non one want to read it.

As for other fandoms: My Little Pony fanfic writers are the only ones allowed to do crossover: and they do a lot, some of which is really good. In fact, I've seen a lot more high-quality fanfic out of that fandom than any other I've seen.
