I think you have to treat it like you're reading an entirely new book. The first time you read the HP books you probably didn't stop reading to ask questions about what random spell x or y was. You figured it out using context and your understanding of the words.

You kind of have to try and do the same thing with AU fics I feel. The better written ones will help you out, but with the others the onus will be on you.
