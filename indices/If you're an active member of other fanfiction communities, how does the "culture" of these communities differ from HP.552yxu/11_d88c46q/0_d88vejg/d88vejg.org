I'm one of the ones who preferes HP fanfiction to stick to canon, simply because it's easier to know what to expect from the story. Not that I don't love unexpected plot twists. What I mean is something like this: A story lands Harry in the hospital wing soem ten or so chapters in. The diagnosis is this; his magical core is depleated, because he overexerted himself durring (insert whatever). At that point at least one reader's first thought is "his what now is what?". That's not a nice break to have in your reading experiance. Especially if whaterver story element it is that breaks you out of your flow is something that has never been mentioned before in the story but apparently every reader is expected to know about. "I made an AU and things are this way now because I say so." is a fine concept for fanfiction but a bit of explaination is necessary. If there isn't any it's like playing a game you don't now the rules for. For me at least, it's like this; I will read any number of AUs, UAs, crossovers, anything if they are either well written or explained well enough. The problem is that most aren't, so I usually go for the canon compliant stuff. Also canon compliant FFs tend to have less bashing. I cannot stand bashing. Even just mention of "manipulative old goat Dumbledore" has made me drop fics.
