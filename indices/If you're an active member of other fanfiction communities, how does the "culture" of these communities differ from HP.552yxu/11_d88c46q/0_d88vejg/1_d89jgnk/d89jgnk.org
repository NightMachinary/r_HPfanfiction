I hear what you are saying. I don't think I have read anything about magical cores, but I know there are enough of those stories out there that it seems like those sorts of tropes have rules of their own, which I don't choose to buy into. And it's as if you have to know those rules to enjoy some of those stories.

I don't ship anyone per se, but I have written several different nods to Dramione simply because I didn't do the right thing as many of you do and ask what was decent to read first. I read awful stuff and then thought about how it might be remotely possible to put those two together. (For many of you the answer is NEVER; I wouldn't try to convince you otherwise.)

I'm sort of curious about bashing, the whys of it. We all probably have that thing we do when we'd rather punch someone---I write stern letters to my governor. Is that what craving bashing is? Or is it something else? That is off-topic, I suppose, but I wonder.
