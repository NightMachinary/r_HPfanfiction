For the most part, I'm a part of the Twilight, Harry Potter and Castle (TV Show) communities.

As mentioned, Twilight is in my opinion fairly receptive to out of character writing, though I'd qualify that as if you're well known within the community, if not, it's difficult to break through. I will say that for all tye types of Twilight fic, there is a dearth of Science Fiction based stories, but also cross overs. That said people will mess with things to a certain degree. To those who might be familiar with fics, try to find a good Lauren or a good Jane. It's very hard compared for some of the other characters.

The other community that I'm a part of is for Castle. That community for all the AUs seems fairly rigid, perhaps on the level of the Harry Potter community or worse. I can't help but feel they don't quite understand the butterfly effect and how that changes things. To give an easy example, in the show Kate Beckett's mother is murdured that becomes the onus for her to drop of out school and attend the police academy, eventually becoming a detective. If there's an AU where she lives, Kate is still oftentimes a detective or an attorney (her parents are/were attorneys so this seems natural) with the same drive. I personally feel there would be not small differences in her personality, but the community won't have it.
