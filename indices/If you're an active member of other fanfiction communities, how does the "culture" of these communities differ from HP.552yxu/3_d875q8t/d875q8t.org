One of the best community, perhaps the best, I have seen in Jane Austen Fan Fiction community. The variation of stories, the characterization, the plot all are vastly wide & so much well written stories that's rare.

I do hope HP fan fiction community will spread up like JAFF community. And HP offers so much scope in fanfaction!
