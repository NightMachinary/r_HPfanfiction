I don't think any of these have been mentioned yet, one of my favorites: The Pranksters Apprentice (George/Hermione), Strange Bedfellows (same pairing and author but an earlier attempt, not as good, but still solid.)

Another fun but of fluff Harmony, no Voldy, just some au 7th year fluff: Thresholds

One of my wife's favorites, I'm still not sure how I feel about it, but it was a story that made Dramione make some sort of sense: The wrong strain.
