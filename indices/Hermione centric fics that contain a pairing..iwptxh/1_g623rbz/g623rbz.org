So I'm sure you've read words from these two because they're pretty well-known, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/ShayaLonnie/pseuds/ShayaLonnie][Shayalonnie]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/olivieblake/pseuds/olivieblake][Olivieblake]] are amazing! I believe they can be found on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] too, but i linked to their a03 pages. They've written some amazing dramione, lumione, and sirimione stories!

I've been reading a lot of dramione lately, so here are a few others I've really enjoyed as of late!\\
[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17457683][Sweetly Broken]] it's kinda angsty but has a happy ending\\
i've read several of [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/senlinyu/pseuds/senlinyu][senlinyu's]] stuff lately and it's all been really good, but heed the warnings

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2727356][As the Moon Rises]] is a good remus/hermione fic. So is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8170214][Mine, Always]].

Sirius/Hermione is a personal fav of mine, so once i find some of my favorites I'll link them!
