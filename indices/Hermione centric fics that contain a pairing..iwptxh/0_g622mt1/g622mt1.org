How do you feel about Charlie/Hermione?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12789201/1/Last-Christmas][Last Christmas]] is a (long) one-shot by Kittenshift17 that's excellent.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8417149/1/A-Pleasurable-Kind-of-Torture][A Pleasurable Kind of Torture]] by Allotropism is a nice one-shot that I always seem to come back to every once in a while.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12703557/1/Whom-the-Gods-Would-Destroy][Whom the Gods Would Destroy]] is a post-apocalyptic story that starts a little slow, but definitely picks up the more it goes on. This story (by ianthewaiting) is complete at 136,000 words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13228312/1/Lost-and-Found][Lost and Found]] by minasark is a story I found a couple of days ago that is amazing. It tends to lean a bit more Muggle, but by no means is it a Muggle-AU story. Charlie and Hermione's personalities here are done so well that I literally lost myself in the story with them. Unfortunately, the story seems to be abandoned at 43,000 words. However, I highly recommend giving this a shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3550231/1/Only-In-The-World-of-Dragons][Only In The World of Dragons]] is a good story, though it tends to be wordy (and, in my opinion, a tad unrealistic at times). With that being said, it's worth a read nonetheless. At 90,000, this story by atruwriter, is complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3993848/1/Games-are-afoot][Games are afoot]] by grumpy grizzly is a classic in the Charlie/Hermione pairing. Unfortunately, this story does not hold up in terms of how I remember it when I first read it. (I tried a re-read of it a short while ago and couldn't get very far in.) Also, there are a ton of overused tropes used (e.g., "Twin-speak" by Fred and George) and the ending is extremely, and I mean extremely, rushed. For example, the last chapter of the story is a couple of paragraphs long with only one line of dialogue (and it's not even spoken by Charlie or Hermione either). So while it's marked "Complete", I don't think I would consider it as such. Yet, there are some really good ideas used in the story; the only issue is that the execution is wildly off.

Also, if you don't mind two stories of my own:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12915227/1/The-Freedom-Land-of-the-Seventies][The Freedom Land of the Seventies]] is a one-shot that deals with Charlie and Hermione, along with a great deal of smut.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13699001/1/The-Sparrow-Suite][The Sparrow Suite]] is a story I just started posting last Friday (with Chapter 2 coming tomorrow!). It follows a different approach to Charlie and Hermione: with them initially not liking one another. During the summer, both are approached to teach at Hogwarts and the story goes on from there.
