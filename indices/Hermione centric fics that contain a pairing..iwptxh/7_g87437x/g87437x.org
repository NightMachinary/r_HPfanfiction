This one is very Hermione centric. The author has not decided on what pairing but it's a great story.

A Stumble in Time by SorcerersScone

Summary:

Voldemort had a back-up plan and came back with a vengeance. As a result, Harry, Ron, and Astoria Greengrass died two months after the final battle, when Voldemort stepped out of the veil of death and destroyed the Ministry. Hermione spent three years afterwards salvaging what she could of the defenseless Wizarding World, helped by a rather shaken Draco Malfoy. When Voldemort targets and destroys both Draco's and Hermione's parents, they decide that they're better off starting all over than they are muddling through another loss. But time is a fickle friend, and not all of them make it back alive.
