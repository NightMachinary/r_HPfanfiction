So far, "The Diadone Method" is the only one I can think of.

It is ongoing with fairly consistent updates. The basic premise of the story is that Harry Potter is the adopted son of a Mafia Don.

It has a sort of competition similar to what you're looking for.

There are future illegal plots planned.
