An entire month later and I am finally up to date. This is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best work I have ever read. It is absolutely captivating! And oddly realistic for a story which deals with magical creatures, morality, and fate. I want to thank you for recommending me this story - I am blown away, even with 100 more chapters still waiting to be published.
