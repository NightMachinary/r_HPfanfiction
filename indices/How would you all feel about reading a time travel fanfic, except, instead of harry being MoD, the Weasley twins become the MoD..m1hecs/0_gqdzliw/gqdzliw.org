Wow what an interesting idea! I think it's definitely worth exploring because I don't think anything like that really exists so it would be fun to put something different out.

About the Weasley twins being MoD, right off the bat I feel like being Death is almost the opposite of what they are and preach to the world (fun, full of life/life of the party, jokes, laughs). Death represents the party coming to an end, or remembering something that makes a joke not funny, and sorrow and despair.

But the Weasley twins are also mischievous and can be dark in their own ways when they take things too far. I feel like Death, likely being unaffected by the lives they take, probably wouldn't be against adding some fun to their otherwise grim job.

That being said, I would 100% read your fic! In fact, if you write them as darker characters I'd be even more interested because it's so refreshing to see different takes to familiar characters!
