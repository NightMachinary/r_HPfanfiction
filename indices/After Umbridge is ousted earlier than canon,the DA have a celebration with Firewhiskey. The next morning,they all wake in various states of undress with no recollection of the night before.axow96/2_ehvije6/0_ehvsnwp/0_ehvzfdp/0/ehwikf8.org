  Dumbledore said he was connected to the wards and could feel everything, right?

I don't think the word "ward" ever appears in the books, it's just fanon. There are spells and charms that behave like wards, like apparition restrictions in Hogwarts, etc. But again, not sure about that "I can feel everything" bit.
