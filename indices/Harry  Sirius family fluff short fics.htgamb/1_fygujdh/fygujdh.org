Try â€žLiving with Dangerâ€œ (sorry idk how to link stuffðŸ˜…) It's an AU having Harry grow up with Sirius, Remus and some other characters, and it's really great!! But it definitely isn't a short fic, 50 chapters, and 4 sequels (but you don't really have to read the sequels, imo the first is the best anyway)
