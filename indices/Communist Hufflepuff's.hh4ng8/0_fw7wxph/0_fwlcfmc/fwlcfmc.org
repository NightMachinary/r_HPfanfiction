You can link a fic from FFN in 3 ways:

linkffn(Harry Potter Becomes a Communist by Hardcore Commie)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9655837/1/Harry-Potter-Becomes-A-Communist]])

linkfnn(9655837)

The first acts like a google search, but sometimes it can return the wrong thing if you just do a title and not the full author name, too. The second uses the full url of the fic, and the third just uses the ID number of the fic.

EDIT: See? idk how a random fic from Katekyo Hitman Reborn! got added in here!
