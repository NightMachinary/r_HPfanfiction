Same, and I think I know why too. JK did a really good job of writing teenagers, including making all the relationships feel like those of teenagers. As a result it all feels authentic, but there is also a feeling like it's just kid stuff, like all the relationships really are just schooltime things. Whereas, Talesin19 writes adult relationships with emotional depth, commitment and maturity. As a result Talesin19's relationships read as being much more precious and meaningful. It also helps that Harry's relationship with Ginny has profound impact and consequences on Harry's life in Grow Young With Me, hell, it's practically the entire premise. However, Harry's relationship in canon is barely explored. Its very much /"the hero got the girl and they all lived happily ever after"/ and as a result it really doesn't have much impact. They're only together for the last few weeks of Half Blood Prince and she's pretty much completely absent from Deathly Hallows. You could remove Harry and Ginny's relationship from canon and the only thing you'd really have to change would be some flavor text and a bit of dialogue at Dumbledore's funeral. The plot wouldn't be affected at all. With Grow Young With Me, you'd have to rewrite the entire story.
