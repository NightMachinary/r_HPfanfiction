I always loved the character of Calypso Rosier from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]], well built and "believable" (though I remember reading on this sub that the whole character was stolen from another fic that I can't recall the name).
