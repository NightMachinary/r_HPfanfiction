I have post-concussion syndrome, I've had it ever since I got a concussion in 2014. The symptoms get better, but they haven't truly gone away.

I would appreciate something like this a lot. It seems to me that nobody in fiction really appreciates the impact of a concussion and takes them rather lightly.
