Beside *Patron* mentioned before, I think following fics did a decent job describing a very different wizard society:

*Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw*, linkffn(11574569)

*Firebird Trilogy*, linkffn(8629685;9646669;10373959)

*The Pureblood Pretense*, linkffn(7613196)

--------------

*The Accidental Animagus*, linkffn(9863146), is heavy into pureblood politics, but its magical society was even closer entwined with Muggle world than in canon. For example, Fudge consulted with John Major about the site for Quidditch World Cup, and Major would seal off large areas in the name of 'Military Exercise'.
