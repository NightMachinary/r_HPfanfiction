I've written "Patron", an AU where the pureblood culture is more different than "Old England, with some spells". Different Religion, different clothes, different mores. In some areas it's far more progressive than muggle Britain - they consider muggles to be prudes - in others it's far more archaic or alien (laws are often outdated, although the actual laws are usually checked by social pressure and habit, and so what was stated in a law might not actually be enforced anymore.). Also, there's more than one culture in Britain, and France and other countries (Bulgaria, Ottoman Empire, Jamaica, Scandinavia) have different cultures as well.
