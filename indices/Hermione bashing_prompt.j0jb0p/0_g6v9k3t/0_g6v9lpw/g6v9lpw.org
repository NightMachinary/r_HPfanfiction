  Why, in the Harry Potter books, did no one comment on the fact that Hermione doesn't actually know how to write a paper correctly. This story addresses that. Slight Hermione bashing, nothing too mean.

  Usually it is someone highly intelligent that travels back in time -- even Harry is only suppressing his brilliance. But Ron? Hard-working, quick, open-minded... He is not. But with years of advantage over his peers even he can become something more than a tired Auror with a wife that hates him. Amoral!Sly!Ron.

  He survived the war---now it's time to grow up. Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.
