I imagine Voldemort organizes his allies in layers. Some will be courted to gain their support. Others will be hired for simple tasks, granted more trust as their services become more useful. There would always be a temptation to know the 'deeper mysteries' that Voldemort shares only with the upper echelon, and once an inductee was interacting with him directly, he would insist that some form of leverage be in his hands to ensure loyalty.
