I think it would be impossible to turn billions of pounds into galleons - there can't be nearly enough demand for pounds from Wizards to support that transaction.

Converting galleons into pounds sounds easier, however. Firstly because there's plenty of demand for gold in the Muggle world. Secondly because even if there's no demand for it, there's nothing to stop Wizards from using magic to alter a Muggle bank's books to create a new deposit of Muggle money (and use magic to prevent it from raising suspicion).

Given the numerous places in the world where huge amounts of money are squirreled away without anyone knowing, I doubt it would raise eyebrows even without the spells.
