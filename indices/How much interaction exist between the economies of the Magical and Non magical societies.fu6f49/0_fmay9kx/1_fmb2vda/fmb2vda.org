The typical way I've seen/pictured turning pounds into galleons would be through purchasing gold - which I think goes off the assumption that since the Philosopher's Stone explicitly calls out the creation of gold as one of its powers, that normal transfiguration can't do that (which'd explain why the only fake money we see are the leprechaun's galleons and other non-transfigurated gold).

Combine that with seeing goblins as greedy/wanting gold, and it's easy to make that make sense.
