  Voldemort still needs a body for his soul his body would not survive but his soul would (Assuming he has them and they aren't all already destroyed) and a shot to the heart, head, etc is a fatal wound. Unless the person is shooting at kneecaps, arms, feet, chances are they'd be dead or close to it.

He can recreate his body.

  Most of the wizarding world probably doesn't even know what a bullet is or the basic mechanics of a guns functions.

Assumption doesn't really hold up. Riddle grew up in the middle of world war 2 in Muggle London. I'm pretty sure he'd be familiar with Muggle weaponry. Wizards in general know enough muggle technology that purebloods don't mind riding a train. Sirius, a pureblood, was able to make a magical motorcycle. I'm pretty sure wizards could make a simple charm that causes guns to jam or even fire backwards at the user.

They can conjure small blades and banish them towards victims, thereby recreating the effects of a bullet. If wizards can learn to defend themselves against that, they can learn to defend themselves against bullets. I really get tired of these tropes that you can kill any wizard with a gun or something.
