The wizarding world has blood replenishers, and skele-gro. Stands to reason they can fix muscle. Live animals are easy to transfigure because you don't actually need to make them alive. You can just make a chunk of stone look like a lion and then animate it. Like the Hogwarts statues. They don't have muscles and bones and tendons and ligaments. They're just animated. Guns actually need internal parts. And what do you mean by a bullet and a reductor? That would just destroy the bullet.

Further, just because Voldemort's body is destroyed, that doesn't mean jack shit. There's a reason Harry and co. destroyed the Horcruxes before they killed him.
