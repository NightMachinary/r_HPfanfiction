  A small powered reducto would blast the bullet forward at high speeds.

A Reducto destroys its target. Thats all it does. If you shoot it at a bullet, the bullet explodes. What you look for is a Banishing Charm. But then I'd have to ask: Why bullets? Why not just use pebbles and banish them at high speeds to make them shrapnel like projectiles?

In general I agree that with a cheeky shot from a handgun you could surprise a wizard and get a shot in -maybe even a lucky lethal one. If you're ambidextrous, wielding a gun and a wand would probably be pretty effective in a fight. You could fire your gun, keeping your opponent on a forced defensive, while you hex and curse the shit out of him. Yet, if you're not good with both hands, I'd always prefer the wand. With the gun you have a first strike potential, but once figured out what he's up against a wizard has all the advantages against the explosion based projectile weapon, if used exclusively.

When it comes to transfiguring a gun, I'm of the same opinion as [[/u/Aoloach]]. Thats gotta be insanely hard to achieve if you aren't talking something crude like a flintlock, or the like. Modern day guns are works of millimeter precision to make them as effective as they are. If you want to fight with a gun (which, again, I agree with in general) I'd say: buy one. Or steal them, you're a wizard. Maybe charm the magazine with a Replenishing charm, or something.
