Is Episkey not just a "tap your arm and use it" spell? Or whatever Snape used to reverse sectumsempra? Anyway, A reductor on a billet would A) just flatten the bullet and B) not necessarily direct it forward as there is no barrel. Anything to do with using spells to launch things is really just inefficient. Just use the spell directly on your enemy. Really the only instance where you could take the time to do that is for an ambush or a backstab, and if you have the time to set that up you could just buy a gun.
