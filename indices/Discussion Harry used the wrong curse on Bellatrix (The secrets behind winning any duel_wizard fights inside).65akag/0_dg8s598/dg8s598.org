Voldemort has Horcruxes, he would survive a bomb. Further, gunshot wounds are occasionally survivable with muggle medicine. Wizarding healing would be far more capable of treating a gun wound.

Guns are usually rather complex things. I doubt your average wizard has enough knowledge of the inner workings of a gun to transfigure one. Your average adult muggle definitely doesn't. I could probably tell you how a gun works, but I don't think I can visualize it well enough to transfigure one.

I'm not even sure if you can transfigure one substance into multiple different substances, and into parts that aren't connected.

This isn't even getting into how bad an idea it is to transfigure explosives, as would be in a bomb or bullet casing. Little bits of the explosive in the form of smoke will be thrown into the air and inhaled. Those bit will later revert back into whatever they were transfigured from, right? You wouldn't want the byproducts of a gunpowder explosion to suddenly turn back into solid wood while in your lungs.
