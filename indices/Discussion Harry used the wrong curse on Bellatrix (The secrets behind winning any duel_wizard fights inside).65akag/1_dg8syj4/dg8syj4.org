With something like Wizard Duelling existing, it can be inferred that Wizard's are capable of both increasing their reflexes, and have naturally high reflexes. Wizard's also seem to be highly aware of their enviorment, naturally making surprise attack futile.

Or the Wizard you're Duelling can cut your hand off before you even have the ability to aim. And since most people can't aim a gun properly without actual firearms training first, it's highly unlikely that Wizard's would be able to either. Also, there are shields that can be slammed up remotely through charmed necklaces or the like, there are shields like the one Voldemort used on Nagini which was impenetrable according to he himself. Bullets can also be stopped by Arresto Momentum, if used at the right time, it could cause the gun to backfire and destroy the person's hand.
