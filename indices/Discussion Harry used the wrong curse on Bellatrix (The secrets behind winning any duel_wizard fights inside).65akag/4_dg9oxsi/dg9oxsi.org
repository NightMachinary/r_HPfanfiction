This particular horse has been beaten to death. Repeatedly. There's an excellent thread on the DLP forums about it. If you want to talk about the atomic bomb, I'm sure they'd love to have you there. Last I checked, the consensus was that a prepared wizard of not inconsiderable skill could survive the blast, let alone Lord Voldemort.

I, personally, think that the best solution is to treat guns like they are sometimes treated in the Dresden Files - dangerous, yes, but not incredibly threatening to any being of greater power. In those books, they can kill you, but a wizard ought to be able to block bullets - lots and lots and lots of bullets. In the Potter universe, this would be even more apparent because spells do not draw on the strength of the caster. That's why they don't care about guns.

Using guns in a duel would only be useful if you were extremely close to the opponent and the opponent wasn't expecting it, or as a sort of distraction/annoyance if he were. Otherwise, the time it would take for you to draw the gun, fire it, and the bullet to cross the intervening space would allow him to cast a Shield Charm.

In the world at large, long-distance snipers would be devastating, but would only work a few times before someone caught on.
