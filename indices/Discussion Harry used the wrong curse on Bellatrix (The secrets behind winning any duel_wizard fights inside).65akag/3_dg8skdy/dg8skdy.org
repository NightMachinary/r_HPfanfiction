Horcruxes obviously save you from annihilation, as shades are incorporeal. Besides that, I have serious doubts that a atomic bomb could destroy a Horcrux. The rule for destroying Horcruxes is along the lines of destroying it beyond magical repair, protections included. Atom bombs are completely muggle. They have no magic which could destroy enchantments. We know canonically that the Diary Horcrux was completely immune to water and water damage. We also know that the impervious charm is canon, and can repel all foreign material. So what does an atom bomb actually do to objects to destroy them? The shockwave which destroys buildings would be easily repaired with a reparo. Shrapnel would be repelled. The immense heat is tricky because there are no canon solutions, but this is a society which routinely shatters the laws of physics with no energy cost or repercussions. It would be silly to think that they wouldn't have magic to divert heat.

Guns are pretty easy. The trick is that you don't use Protego, you use a different spell. Canonically, Impervious would work, going with fanon, a spell to remove kinetic energy would work perfectly.

As for Harry's competance with the Unforgivables, we could probably put some it it down to character development. But you are correct, in that the wrong mindset makes the curse fail.
