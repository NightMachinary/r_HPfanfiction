Flame freezing charms are a thing. Presumably with sufficient power they can protect you from nuclear fire. I don't believe it works against fiendfyre as that is "cursed fire" and dark magic wounds cannot be healed by the usual healing magics (see: George's ear). Not sure how ionizing radiation affects anything, if at all, though.
