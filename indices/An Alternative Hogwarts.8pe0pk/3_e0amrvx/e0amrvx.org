In my forever-not-ready-to-post fic I'm trying to portray Hogwarts more like an elite school, like Eton or Harrow IRL. There are two fics I've come across with a similar approach:

linkffn(Black Luminary)\\
linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome)

I think Untitled Tome captures the feel of a public school better, from what I remember.
