I imagine that there is a fair bit of Magic Theory taught in all classes, especially Transfiguration and Arithmancy, but I always figured it should be a class. Maybe it wasn't offered because there isn't a whole lot of theory behind magic in general?

Clearly there is a great deal of research done in the Department of Mysteries, or at least we are lead to believe as such, but it would only make sense to teach it in school.

Also there appear to be a marked lack of prerequisites for courses. It would make sense to have some NEWT level courses on more advanced subjects that have OWL perquisites.
