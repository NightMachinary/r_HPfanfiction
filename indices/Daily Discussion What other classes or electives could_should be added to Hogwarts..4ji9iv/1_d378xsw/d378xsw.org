I would add a more physically challenging subject. Notice that most are all theory or a mixture of the two. There isn't a subject that would burn the kids out at the end of the day. Good old fashioned Phys. Ed. would help the kids in the long run.

Keeping kids physically, mentally, and magically tired would help lessen the shenanigans...and maybe provide stronger graduates too.
