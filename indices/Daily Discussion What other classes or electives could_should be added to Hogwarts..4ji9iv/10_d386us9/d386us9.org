Languages, cooking, houshold-charms, enchanting and tool-creation (including how to create magical items including something like those communication-mirrors and maybe even swords etc.), wizard-traditions, politics and economy, spell-creation and maybe something physical like fencing :)

Oh and something really neglected:

Art, music and maybe creative writing :)
