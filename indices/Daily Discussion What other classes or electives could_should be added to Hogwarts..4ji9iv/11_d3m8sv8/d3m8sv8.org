It would be lovely if Muggle born students were given the option of taking the GCSES/A-levels and wizard students also had to take some GCSEs as well. I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy]] covered how unfair it is to essentially cripple Muggleborn students if they ever want to get a job in their world or go on to muggle university. If they drop out of the magical world, they're trapped in menial jobs without test scores.

Since so much of standardized tests are memorization-based, I would like to see memorization potions/study aids used to cram it all in so they can also focus on magical subjects. So it'd be nice to see GCSEs: Year 1, Year 2, etc.
