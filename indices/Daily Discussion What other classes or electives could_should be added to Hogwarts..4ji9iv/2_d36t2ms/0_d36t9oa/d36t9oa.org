  I am so into the idea of Hogwarts with a class that teaches sewing and tailoring charms, charms to customize their clothes, as well as spells for approaching woodwork and the like.

There should be a magic literacy course for muggle born students. A complement to Muggle Studies. That would solve this problem. It would teach household magic and discuss aspects of the magical world that wouldn't make sense to muggle born students.
