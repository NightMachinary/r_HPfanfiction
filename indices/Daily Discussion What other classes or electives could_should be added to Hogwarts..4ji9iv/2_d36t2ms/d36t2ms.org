Okay, firstly:

- Latin & Ancient Greek classes

Okay, so I normally include characters having a Latin dictionary to hand for figuring out spells, but given that the majority of spell roots seem to come from Latin or Ancient Greek, I feel like lessons in both would be really useful for students of magic.

I know that they study individual theories of magic in Transfiguration and Charms in terms of the physics of it, but a more comprehensive study of languages involved in spellwork would make it so much easier to work through their years at Hogwarts.

- Modern language classes

I'm sincerely opposed to any children being raised to only speak one language, honestly - there's no excuse for it in a modern society, and magical foreign relations would almost definitely be improved by kids learning languages like French, Arabic, German, Russian... Or, you know, learning languages like Mermish or Troll!

Who doesn't want kids chatting with the merpeople in the lake on a summer evening?

- Spell Creation.

Okay, so this I'd love to see as a NEWT elective for more talented students, as it obviously wouldn't be great for twelve-year-olds to blow themselves up trying to make a charm to make their quill look like a Pikachu or whatever, but encouraging kids to approach spell creation in a safe environment would be fabulous for the magical world in terms of bolstering productivity and novel sorts of magic.

- Textiles & Design

Okay, this one is my personal whimsy as a gay boy speaking, but I am so into the idea of Hogwarts with a class that teaches sewing and tailoring charms, charms to customize their clothes, as well as spells for approaching woodwork and the like.

Magical children presumably will never know the true satisfaction of soldering something, but I'd love to see Design courses as a third year elective, with kids learning to design certain crafty things and then approaching them.

Making one's own clothes is exciting, and so is burning designs into wood and the like. It'd be great for them. Miserable little shits might avoid being nearly killed for once, so long as Harry was kept out of the class.
