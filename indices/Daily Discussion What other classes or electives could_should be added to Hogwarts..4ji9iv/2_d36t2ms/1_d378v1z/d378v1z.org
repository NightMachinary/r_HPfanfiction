I would agree on the language classes. However, in-universe, teaching mermish/troll/any other non-human language wouldn't fly by blood-supremasists.

I think spell creation shouldn't be taught in Hogwarts. It should be after the fact. Unstable spells would wreak havok in Hogwarts. Maybe advanced maths instead? E.g calculous. It'll provide a supplement to arithmancy too.
