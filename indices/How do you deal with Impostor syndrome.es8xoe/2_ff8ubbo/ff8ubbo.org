Tfw I started writing a fic called the Imposter Complex and started getting Imposter Syndrome about the positive feedback from it. Especially when some of that praise came from some of my favourite fanfic authors.

The important thing to remember is that almost everyone in a creative field (and many people in other fields) have experienced Imposter Syndrome to some degree or another. The only ones that don't still get that tingle aren't the kind of artist you want to be anyway, they're smarmy dicks.

The best way to get past it in my experience is to try and avoid seeing your work as something you're doing to impress other people. You're just writing what /you/ enjoy writing, and any praise that you get for it is just icing on top.

Edit: Just realised you mentioned my story in the OP, dunno how tf I managed to miss that.
