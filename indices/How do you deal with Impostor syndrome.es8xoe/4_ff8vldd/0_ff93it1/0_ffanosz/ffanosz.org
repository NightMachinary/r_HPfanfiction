Sorry, was sleeping. I am a notorious (if I had any notoriety, that is) fic abandoner so most of them are deleted.

Linkffn(Ars Notoria) is the latest one I started.

Back to the point, I felt like I have hyped myself and will only disappoint anyone who reads the fic. Can't stop myself from feeling that way but if you know what's going on then you can work with it.
