Well, I start getting nervous about 10 favs in so I can't really give any advice. I get really worried that people are seeing plot hooks or cleverness where I didn't put too much thought into it. Even though I have a rough idea of what I want, I feel like people expect me to have planned everything out from the hints they have received.

I can't really say anything about imposter syndrome because I don't have any obvious evidence of my competence. I will say though that if it really is just a mental syndrome acting up then it is unlikely that you can just work it out yourself within your own mind. Either have someone to constantly talk to and interact with that you recognise as having a different mind than yours or better yet maybe confront it, accept it and move on. Feeling illogical things isn't all that bad. As long as you know what's happening, it can't really hurt you in any way.

Don't they say it helps to give others advice, looking at something from separate viewpoint? Maybe you can think what advice you would give me.
