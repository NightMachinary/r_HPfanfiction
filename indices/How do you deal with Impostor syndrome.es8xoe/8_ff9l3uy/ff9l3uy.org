I know how you feel. After swearing off posting WIP fics for a decade, I recently went for posting a WIP and it has exploded in ways I never expected.

I've had to learn how to take compliments all over again, and I also keep reminding myself that I'm writing the fic for ME. I was the first person who wanted to see the story and I'm the first fan of it, haha.

Basically, it's YOUR fic, not theirs. Other readers just happen to be entertained by it and that's a bonus.

That said, doing extra revision of your writing isn't a bad thing. I've been doing the same and I think I've learned some things along the way. I do recommend stepping away from a chapter for a day or two if you feel you're over-editing or over-analyzing it; coming back to it with fresh eyes really helps you realize how it sounds. :)
