Take a deep breath, and remind yourself it's only a bloody hobby. That's step one.

Step two is remembering that people - including me, as it happens, I would cheerfully buy you a pint for the magical rickrolling /alone/ - liked your story /before/ you had any thought beyond your own fun in writing it: that sense of fun /absolutely/ comes through in the reading experience. Find your first draft of that chapter, the one you /enjoyed/ writing. Get the spelling, punctuation and grammar straight, and publish it.

While a certain amount of craftsmanship is right and necessary, there's also a lot to be said for starting each new chapter with a rousing cry of "NO SECOND DRAFTS! WE DIE LIKE *MEN!*"
