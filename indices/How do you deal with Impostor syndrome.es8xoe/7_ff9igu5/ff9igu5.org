That's part of the reason I don't publish anything besides my ficlets that are responses to prompts. If I have a story I really want to tell I finish it first before publishing it. Learned that the hard way on RoyalRoad years ago. Got so burnt out that I stopped writing for years. It was one of your prompts that inspired me to start writing again.

Now I have three stories I am writing at the moment all past the 35k word mark. When I get fed up with one I switch to another. When I'm fed up with them all I just take a break and read instead.

It's part of why my responses to prompts are always so rough. They are written right then and there with no real editing. It is freeing to just put it out there and not worry about grammar.

Maybe take a break, tell your readers you're new to writing and need to refocus yourself to get that spark back.

I find doing other hobbies helps me as well. Perhaps a walk in the park, people watching at the mall, just cleaning the house listening to music. Something that takes your mind off it and lets it wander.

Either way best of luck in finding your spark again!

P.S. love your prompts by the way, they are awesome!
