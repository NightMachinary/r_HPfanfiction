Originally I wanted to just do a short writeup how I'd defeat Voldemort. Now I got plot for years and multiple enemies beyond Voldemort for the dimensional traveler main character planned out. But when it comes to writing it I'm still stuck on Christmas of year 1. No idea how to write Nicholas Flamel's character.
