The people who love and follow your story love the thoughts you had and the characters and storyline that you planned out.

Not the story that you think they'll like.

Those are two different things. They love your writing for what you put into it, not what you think they want you to put into it.

Some food for thought: who's the true impostor here?

The person who put their heart and soul, pieces of themselves into a story they lovingly crafted?

Or the person who keeps second guessing themselves and re-writing their thoughts as they try to live up to someone elses' expectations? A person who... for all intents and purposes... isn't themself?

If you want to do justice to your readers... BE YOURSELF. :)

Happy writing!
