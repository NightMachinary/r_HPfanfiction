So, first of all, with all the follows and favs your fic has racked up /despite/ it being an unabashed SI, you're pretty darned impressive.

But, it sounds like you've grown the scope of the fic beyond Voldemort and don't have the confidence to write in this bigger universe.

I am not going to tell you to relax and that it's just a hobby, because you already know these things.

So, my only suggestion for you is to find a beta reader or an editor^{1} if you don't already have one. You are your own harshest critic, but a trusted adviser will be able to give you a reader's perspective and tell you where you are overthinking things, as well as giving you some peace of mind, because the odds that both of you miss some glaring problem are much smaller than odds of you missing it on your own. (For the record, I am not prepared to volunteer for the job at this time.)

^{1} --- An "editor" is distinguished from a "beta reader" in that an editor doesn't just get to read your drafts shortly before you post them but is also privy to the "big picture" and your long-term plans.
