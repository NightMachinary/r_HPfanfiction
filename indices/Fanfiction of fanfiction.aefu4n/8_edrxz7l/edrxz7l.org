Anyone who gets mad that you've made a fanfiction of their own story has an extreme double standard going. I don't even think you need to ask permission. Just tell the reader's point blank about the original work. If you're feeling generous, then send them a notification about what you're doing and send them a link. If they tell you that you can't do it, then laugh in their face and go for it anyways.
