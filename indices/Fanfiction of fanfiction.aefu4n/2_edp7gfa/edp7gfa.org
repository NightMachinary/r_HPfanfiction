I've seen fanfics of finished works, and that was super neat. I'm also super bad at finishing works, so if anyone wanted to pick up the torch I'd probably let them. I've also wanted to read fanfic of fanfic, and I feel like an 'inspired by' fic would be amazing in a lot of cases. Something that takes place in the same universe is mostly what I find myself wanting.

As an author and reader I'd love them, but it depends on the person.
