This is called recursive fanfiction, and is generally considered a compliment. However, you may wish to ask the author if you can use their characters/AU/whatever first, since some take a dim view of others using what they made (because irony is hard to understand).

Continuing fanfictions, particularly dead/abandoned ones, is a slightly more difficult topic, but if you ask first, and either get a 'yes' or no reply at all, then there's no real reason not to give it a try.
