So...you don't approve of how many authors wrote their own versions of books six and seven before those were actually released, then?

I mean, I guess you can say that JKR gave blanket permission for people to write fanfic, but then it hardly makes sense to say that those authors can in turn forbid fanfic of their fanfic.
