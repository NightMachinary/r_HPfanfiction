As long as you credit the original author of the fanfic, I don't see any problem with it.

I don't even think you need permission. Sure, asking for permission is nice, but most fanfic authors didn't ask the original creator for permission either. In my opinion, it would be a bit ironic if a fanfic author wasn't okay with fanfiction to their work.
