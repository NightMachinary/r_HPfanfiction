In my opinion you are, for two reasons. When I first started out reading, I only wanted Canon compliant fics. But after a while I really started liking AU fics just for variety. At that point it doesn't matter much of it was written pre deathly hallows or not. The second reason is that there are many really well written fics pre hallows. Many of the most popular tropes were started before Hallows and became popular because they were so well executed. That said, because they started these tropes they can seem a bit stale if you have read a bunch of more modern similar fics. I think the best example of this is Dobbyelflord's Altered Destinies. It was written pre Hallows so much of the information regarding Grindlewald wasn't out when it was written. Horcruxes play almost no part in the story from what I can remember, and it uses common tropes like time travel, multiple animamgus forms, and a dueling specialist Harry. Some of these make for a stale experience if you have read similar things before, but I remember it being one of my most beloved fics for a long time.
