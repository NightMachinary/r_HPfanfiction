Yes, because fics written before DH or even HBP aren't stifled by the terrible decisions JKR made for those books.

Fics released after those, even when they attempt to rewrite the final two books, never really manage that carefree attitude of completely forgetting about HBP and DH.

But it all depends on what you want out of fanfiction.
