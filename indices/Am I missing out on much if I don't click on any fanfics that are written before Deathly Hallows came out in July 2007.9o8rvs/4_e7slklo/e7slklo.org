Yeah, there's a few really good fanfics that were written before and continue to be updated that are quite interesting. There's also the fact that the authors can incorporate canon facts into the story later on.

One that comes to mind that was completed before the 7th book (well, 1 month after actually, but only the last chapters) is linkffn(Hell Eyes). Also Hope from Jeconais, I believe was from before too.

Another that is still updated but was started before the release, is linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky), which is going strong since 2004, if I'm not mistaken, it was just published later in FFN.
