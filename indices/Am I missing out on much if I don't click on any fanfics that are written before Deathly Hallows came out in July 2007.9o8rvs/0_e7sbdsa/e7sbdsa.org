I guess it depends on what you like to read. Canon compliant? Better stay away then.

But oneshots like the one I linked below aren't really impacted by the release of DH, and most stories set in the earlier years ditch the DH plot either way. It basically boils down if you want Harry to be a Horcrux or not and if you want certain characters to be "redeemed".

Other than that, the existence of DH doesn't make much of a difference, especially if the story goes with an original plot that diverges before the 6th year (see 2nd linked as an example).
