Rorschach's work is really really hard to work on (even to improve it) because you cant really talk to him. he doesnt well.. respond. (in my experience) that being said, google Azkaban Harry Stories. the first link is a community, its full of them. A fair bit of them are /better/ than Rorschach's attempt.
