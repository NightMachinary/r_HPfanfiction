There are some amazing Draco/Astoria dics out there! One of my favorites is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6817919/1/True-Colors]] . This is a hypothetical DH fic where Draco is forced to either side with the girl he loves or follow his father into ruin. Narcissa's character is also explored throughout this piece as well as the unspoken question of what place religion holds in the wizarding world. A fantastic and complex story and the companion piece by the same author is told from Astoria's POV during the same time frame.
