People are getting sick of her superior attitude, especially Draco Malfoy, who schemes to get her down, once and for all. And then there's the thing with The Bracelet...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2064124/1/Parenting-Class][Parenting Class is HILARIOUS.]]: Sixth years at Hogwarts are now required to take a parenting class, what fun!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3144908/1/We-Learned-the-Sea][We Learned the Sea is a really good story!!]]: Draco Malfoy turns himself in after a very successful career as a Death Eater, then enlists Harry and Hermione to help him in a scheme to bring down the Dark Lord.

I recently just read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8982722/1/Cruel-and-Beautiful-World][A Cruel and Beautiful World]] and it was one of the best Voldemort wins scenarios. Definitely a must read: After years of captivity, Hermione Granger fights her way onto the streets of Voldemort's London with only the knife in her pocket and the blood on her hands. There's a checkpoint on every corner, a curfew enforced by Voldemort's most trusted followers, and the only way back to the Boy Who Lived is through the Death Eater who let her be captured in the first place.
