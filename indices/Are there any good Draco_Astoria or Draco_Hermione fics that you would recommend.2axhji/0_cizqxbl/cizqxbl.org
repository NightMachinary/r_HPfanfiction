I haven't read any Draco/Astoria but as for Dramione, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation][Isolation]] is of course, the most popular Dramione fic at the moment. If you haven't read that one yet, then I would definitely encourage you check that one out.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3732710/1/Silencio][Silencio]] is probably my favorite Dramione fic followed by [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/dmtabf/MTK.html][Meet the Kids]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6725154/1/I-Spy][I Spy]] (I like Hogwarts era fics).
