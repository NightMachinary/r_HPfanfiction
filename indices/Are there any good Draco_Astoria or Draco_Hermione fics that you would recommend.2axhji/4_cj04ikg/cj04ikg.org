I also can't think of any Draco/Astoria fics that come to mind, that are just about them. There's a good Lily Potter (the younger) and Scorpius fic that has a lot of Draco/Astoria in it, but it's not specifically about them.

As for Draco/Hermione, here are some of my favorites:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6364608/1/Slippery-Seduction][Slippery Seduction]] is a great one, Hermione and Draco start a secret relationship and Snape uses his spy prowess to try and figure out what's going on. I was fascinated by the way that Hermione's work in arithmancy was worked into the story in a way that I had never seen before, the way the equations made visual projections was brilliant and I loved that aspect of it.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3626876/45/Stolen][Stolen]] is one of those more complicated journeys that takes place over more time, more locations, more emotions than most others. There are a lot of different aspects to it, on the foundation of being a marriage-law fic. It has a rather more realistic take than many of those stories, in that Hermione and Draco don't immediately see what they were blind to all of those years, fall in love, and live happily ever after. It's a struggle and it takes a long time for them to begin to understand and respect one another, and their adventures along the way are very engaging.

I liked [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3667037/1/Gravity][Gravity]], it's a lot about Draco figuring himself out after turning to the light side, and his friendship/relationship with Hermione weaves through it all.

It's sadly not complete, but one of my favorite Draco/Hermione fics is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7958303/1/How-To-Marry-A-Malfoy][How to Marry a Malfoy]]. I typically don't even start uncomplete fics, but this one is so clever and entertaining that I didn't even mind too much. Last updated last year, so maybe it's not completely abandoned.
