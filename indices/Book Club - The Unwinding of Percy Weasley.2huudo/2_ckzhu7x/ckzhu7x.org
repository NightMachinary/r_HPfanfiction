It is a very good fic in the purely "Romance" genre, but the fact that it is only a love story makes it a bit of a boring read. I prefer Romance when it is coupled with adventure or mystery.

That said the fic is very well written. The characters are totally believable, with no bashing or clich√©s. I took a liking to the author's Percy, remorseful and self-doubting after the war and the OC, which is a Luna-like self-insert in my opinion, is... okay. By that, I mean she was not overly annoying, but probably a bit too perfect (beautiful and intelligent with many men lusting after her) in the sense that her "flaws" are really more quirks.

My favourite part of the fic was how Mr Weasley described the Weasley men. It was very inspiring so I'll let you discover that on your own :)

Overall, I'd recommend this fic, especially to fans of Romance.
