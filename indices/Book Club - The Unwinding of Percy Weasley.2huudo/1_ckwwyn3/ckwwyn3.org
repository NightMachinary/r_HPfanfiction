Oh man of any two words that might put me off a story, I never expected "Percy" and "canon" to top the list. Is this even canon though? I'm going to read it anyway just because it's on the book club thread, so I guess I'll just have to answer that question myself.

edit: BTW can you add the summary and stats when you post the thread?
