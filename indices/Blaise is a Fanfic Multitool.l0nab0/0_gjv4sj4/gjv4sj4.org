It's so interesting to me the very different stories we get these characters. I've read fics where Blaise is Draco's best friend and fics where Blaise hates Malfoy.

It all depends on the story. That being said I don't think anyone really writes Blaise as female anymore though I recall reading some back in the day.

My favorite iteration of Blaise is rich, hot, go with the flow type guy, here for a good time not a long time. Like Naveen from Princess and the Frog. It's how I picture him.
