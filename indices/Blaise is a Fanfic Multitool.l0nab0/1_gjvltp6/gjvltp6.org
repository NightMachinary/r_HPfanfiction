I don't like him either - for all the reasons you mentioned. Playbloy Blaise is so boring IMO and usually present in the equally boring "Slytherin good Gryffindor bad" edgelord fics.

Also they make him one of the "good slytherins" even though he scoffs at Harry and call Ginny a blood traitor, he's just as bad as any pureblood bigot so much he even got to replace one of Malfoy's goons in the 8th movie, because the OG actor for one of them was arrested for drugs.

Also whenever I see his name I can't help but read as "Blaze" which just sounds really cringe and edgey (appropriate for the fics he appears tho).
