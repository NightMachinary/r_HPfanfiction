There's one crack-fic where a chance comment clues everyone into how to be immortal without a Philosophers Stone - Human Transfiguration. One brief moment of mental "how could I have been so stupid" later, McGonagall transforms her body back to its early-twenties. Dumbledore follows suit... also transforming into a young (adult) woman.

Sadly, I can't remember if it was a one-shot or not.
