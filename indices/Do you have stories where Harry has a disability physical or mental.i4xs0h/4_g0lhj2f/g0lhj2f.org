I don't remember what it was and it wasn't really serious but there was one where Harry had Multiple Personality Disorder

It was sorta weird. I don't remember much but there was something to do with the founders. I remember in the summary it said something like 'four founders and pot brownies' It was something...

There was also a more serious one where Harry has multiple personalities due to the Dursleys' abuse, but I can't remember the name for that one either.
