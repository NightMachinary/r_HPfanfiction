Almost every Harry time travel to Tom's era ends up with Harry befriending/raising/shagging him, such as in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destinies]], linkffn(3155057).

The one time he was really trying to kill Tom, Dumbledore showed up to derail his plan, as in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/][Realignment]], linkffn(12331839).

I would greatly appreciate if someone can LF a decent fic that has Harry (not Hermione) successfully killing Tom.
