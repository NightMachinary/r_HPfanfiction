Linkffn(Death has no Master, but Life has Servants By Jinchuu21) - still updating slowly, harry can't use /all/ his powers here so it's not a stomp.

Linkffn(The Black Prince By cxjenious) - warning, abandoned on cliffhanger, made worse by how good it is.

Linkffn(Hadrian Lannister Lion of the Rock by Sage) - This has a strange final act, Harry is pretty OOC too if that's an issue.
