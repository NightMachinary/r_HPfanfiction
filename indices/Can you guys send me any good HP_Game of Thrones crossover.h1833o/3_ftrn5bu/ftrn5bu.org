There's linkffn(The Difference One Man Can Make by joen1801) although I need to warn you that its been dormant for three years. There's also linkffn(For Myself by Chaos65) ymmv on that one. Finally there's also linkffn(The Alpha Wolf by Wyvern03) that I constantly reread as a sort of wish fulfilment type. Been dormant for a year that last one.
