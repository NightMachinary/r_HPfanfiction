[[http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2009/05/entitlement-issues.html][Fanfic authors are not (like George R R Martin is not) your bitch.]] (Quote taken and altered slightly to include fanfic authors from the source article.)

Enthusiasm for their work is great and nearly always appreciated, but please remember that writers have lives outside writing -- and also remember that fanfic authors are doing it /solely/ as a labour of love, and making not one red cent that pays their bills off of it.

Tell the authors you love their stuff, by all means (it's the only 'pay' fanfic authors get!) -- but the whole, "You need to get a move on" phrasing really smacks of entitlement issues.
