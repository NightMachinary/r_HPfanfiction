I'll just continue sitting over here waiting for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/663423/Sith-Lord-Darth-Revan][Sith Lord Darth Revan]] on ffn to update one of his star wars fics. He said he had plans to do so. [[https://f1.nwstatic.co.uk/forum/uploads/monthly_01_2014/post-18134-0-85438800-1390176220.jpg][Any day now.]]

(But seriously, I get it. We can still hope they update faster without acting like we're entitled to updates though. Its very discouraging for fanfic authors to feel pressured into releasing chapters.)
