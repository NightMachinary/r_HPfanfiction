I would love him to write a story where Harry and Hermione aren't instantly in love. Maybe one where they aren't even friends at first.

I stopped reading any of his stuff a few chapters into the goblin story (Harry Crow I think?). I read the first chapter of his newest story and was just rolling my eyes the entire time. I'd take him off my alerts if I wasn't so lazy.
