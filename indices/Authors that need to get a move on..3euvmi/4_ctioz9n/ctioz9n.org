robst needs to move on but in the opposite direction you are thinking of.

All of his stories have a character spectrum consisting of "awesome and everything works out" vs "damn near worthless and gets defeated or outdated". If I could convert each story into a map they would all end up at the same address.

I don't even dislike his writing that much. I just want an original piece of work. The fact that so much of his stuff occupies what is essentially the front page of H/Hr is a tragedy.
