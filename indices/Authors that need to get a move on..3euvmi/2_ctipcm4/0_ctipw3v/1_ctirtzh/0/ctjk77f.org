I guess from a readers point of view, fan fiction should always be free. From a writer's point of view, I am not sure I entirely agree. Why shouldn't someone be able to live off fan fiction? [[http://bookshop.livejournal.com/1044495.html][This]] list might be able to convince you. But even from the point of view of the original story writer... I dare say adaptations, modernisations and twists are the only way for fiction to become /classic/. As long as your story contains enough original ideas and is not plagiarising, I don't think it should necessarily be free.
