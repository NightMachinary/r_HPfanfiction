Beyond the fact that the definition of "fanfiction" is stretched to the point of worthlessness, overwhelming majority of those authors do not and did not make a living off of fanfiction. Making stories that retell or adapt ancient mythology, centuries old plays, or a culture's fairy tales, the stories that are so historically significant that they've become part of our culture and have been reprinted by various publishers since the inventing of the press, is not nearly the same thing as writing "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince except Harry dates Hermione". There's no objective way to measure "enough original ideas" and the entire point of fanfiction is plagiarizing so that you can build a story off the popularity and audience knowledge of an existing world.

There's really no comparable real world situation that would fit the idea of selling fan fiction. The way I see it, using the world that JKR built, her characters, and her plot, to make yourself money is just scummy. If you want to make fanfic, you know going in you shouldn't sell it. If you want to write a story and sell it, create your own original world. I'll never pay for the sort of fanfic I read, but I have bought original works from authors that have written fanfics.
