I adore Inverarity's method because when I get the story, I get the story and I know it will be great. But I just break into fangirl smiles and weird twitches when I think about waiting just 1 more second for the eventual update. At least he is kind enough to keep us updated about progress.

Now obviously I need jacobk to hurry up please.
