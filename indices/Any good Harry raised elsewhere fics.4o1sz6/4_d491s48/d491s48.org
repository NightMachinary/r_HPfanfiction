It's a James Spookie fic, so it's not for everyone, but linkffn(The Fourth Champion by James Spookie) is one.

There's a fic called linkffn(The Katarn Side by Darth Marrs) which suffers pretty much all of Darth Marrs' usual failings, but isn't as good as the few HP fics previous to it. Worth reading just because

A) Fuck yeah Kyle Katarn

B) The Chuck Norris-style jokes at the start of each chapter.
