If you have a few chapters after it and don't want to rewrite them, I would change the bad chapter to an A/N explaining the situation and also put an A/N at the top of the next chapter explaining what happened. You might want to also take a look at how the chapters of either side transition into each other. It could lead to a rather jarring break of immersion, especially if you ever referenced something that happened in the chapter to be cut.
