I'm like 41 chapters into my story and I still edit my chapters if I see any mistakes. You'll do just fine. Just put a note in bold at the end of the chapter saying what you edited and why.

  Do I just re-upload the other chapters and overwrite it, or leave it as a "blank" chapter, or what?
#+end_quote

There's no need to reupload chapters. FFN has a little red button on the far right in Content tab of your Story properties page that allows you to delete specific chapters.

  How does that effect reviews?
#+end_quote

Positively. I had a turnover rate of 45% from my 1st to 2nd chapter and 85% from my 2nd to 3rd chapter before I did my edits, and afterwards it went up to 65% and 95% respectively. If anything, improving the story increases traffic, which increases the chance of getting reviews.
