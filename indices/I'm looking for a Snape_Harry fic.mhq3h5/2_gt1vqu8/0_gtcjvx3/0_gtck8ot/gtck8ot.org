It's understandable. They did spend a lot more time together than Draco and Harry, which is why you probably got mixed up.

Also, while I did find the ship cool, there wasn't that much buildup towards the Sanguini/Severus thing. Probably because Saguini went immediately towards seduction without the "getting to know you." phase.
