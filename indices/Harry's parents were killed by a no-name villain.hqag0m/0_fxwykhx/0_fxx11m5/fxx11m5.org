Would they even be /called/ Death Eaters if Voldemort's campaign was pretty much just a political movement, since it's such an "obviously evil" name? I'd think in this AU, the Death Eaters would solely refer to the radicalized movement spawned by Bellatrix Lestrange.

Also, would there even be a curse on the Defense professorship, given a less vindictive Voldemort? If no, which political faction would the long-term Defense Professor be? Would Voldemort be able to get any of his supporters in a position of authority over children?

Sirius would actually be in a /prime/ position to take care of Harry - and not influence him too much politically. He seems like the kind of character to stay out of politics altogether.
