I have two because I can't really decide. The best one shot easily goes to this one. linkffn(4152700) Cauterize is the best one shot I have ever read and it is marvelous. For longer fanfics... thats hard. Recently it has to be linkffn(The Mind Arts) This fic definitely has its negatives, but I love the take on magic, and the way the mind interacts with it.
