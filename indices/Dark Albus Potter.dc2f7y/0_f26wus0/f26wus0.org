The only fic I can think of is probably linkffn(Catharsis by nuhuh), though its incomplete (if pretty action-filled).

Tangentially related, if your interested in non-CC Albus Potter, you can try linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation) and its sequels. Its not dark, but its definitely a different characterization.
