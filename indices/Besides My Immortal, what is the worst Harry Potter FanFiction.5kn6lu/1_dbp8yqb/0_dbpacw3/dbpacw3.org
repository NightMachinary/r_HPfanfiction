They are readable and complete though, which is more than can be said for many of the (rightfully) ignored fanfiction out there. There are a huge number of fics out there that have terrible summaries, less than a thousand words per chapter, and were dropped after a handful of chapters. Sort by follows or favorites and go to the last page and you find loads of unreadable, incomplete trash that is so much worse than Robst that it isn't worth naming.
