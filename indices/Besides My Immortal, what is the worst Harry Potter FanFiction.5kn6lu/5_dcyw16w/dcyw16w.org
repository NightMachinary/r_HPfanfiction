Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. The fact that they charge people $20 to read it just makes it all the more painful.

Okay unfunny jokes which are sadly not jokes aside:

Anything by StarPolaris on FFN [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/163177/Star-Polaris]]

He has all these really interesting, exciting sounding story ideas.

Which he promptly ruins by giving his characters sudden powers with no explanation, (Such as Harry suddenly knowing how to throw knives ((because we all know the Dursleys are gonna let that kid around weapons.)) and being a "natural born animagus.") ((no training required he just suddenly finds himself able to change into a magical flying panther one day cause faq it deus ex machina.)

And lets not forget the tear jerkingly bland generic dialogue that will make you wanna claw your eyes out after a few minutes~

Its not that he's a atrocious writer. And thats the worst part. The story are GOOD, the PLOTS ARE GOOD. But then things just get so unbelievable with everyone suddenly having all these hidden powers that I personally just threw my hands up and closed out. Its more of a peeve probably but I for one have never been able to finish any of his HP fics. If you all find one that isn't an annoying god-mod lemme know please.
