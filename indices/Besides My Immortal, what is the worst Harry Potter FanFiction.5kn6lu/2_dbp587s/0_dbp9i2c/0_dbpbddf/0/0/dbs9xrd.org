Geeze, how about identical wording, in a slightly different order. I've worked as a TA and grader when I was still in school (both undergraduate and graduate), and this is the exact kind of thing I was taught to look for/notice as a sign of plagiarism. This is the kind of thing I've turned in reports for, and led to course failures for the perpetrators.
