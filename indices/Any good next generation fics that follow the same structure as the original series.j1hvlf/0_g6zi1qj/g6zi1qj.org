Those are definitely the best multi-book traditional next-gen series I've found, and I've spent a /lot/ of time looking for others.

Alexandra Quick is probably the first thing that comes to mind, five/seven complete and sixth in progress. It's not traditional next-gen obviously but it's set in the 2010s.

Slide's Stygian Trilogy has three big books, it starts in 6th year though. But definitely the best-quality next-gen series set at Hogwarts.

Maverick.Heart's Fabula Post Bellum series is getting very good, maybe a notch below the three you listed. Fourth book just started. Probably closest to Vekin in tone.

There's an author, "Colin Creevey", with a complete seven-book next gen series. I didn't think it was on the same level as those three. But I still got through five books and will probably try to finish it at some point.

Alissie has the currently updating Rose Weasley series which is on third year. Also a little lower-stakes and a little less polished than the three you mentioned.

I believe the Gray series now has the largest word count for a Harry Potter fanfiction, but it's bloated beyond belief. I haven't been able to get past twelve chapters or so, but you might like it.

SGTwhiskeyjack has a James Potter series. I read about half the first book, can't remember why I quit. I don't think it was that bad, maybe I'll go back and try it again.

Lysander's Pen has an Albus series. I think I read some of the first book. Like the above series, I can't remember why I quit. I think this was pretty readable.

That's about all on FFN. I don't hang around AO3 much so maybe someone more experienced there could give you more recs.
