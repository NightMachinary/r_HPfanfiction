No problem, the Colin Creevey ones definitely develop a better plot in the last couple books I read (4 and 5). The first three books in the series seemed to mostly be Hogwarts life rehash with maybe a little mystery at the end (somewhat similarly to canon but lower stakes) so seeing a nice overarching story arc start to emerge was nice. I'll definitely get back to that series.

As for AQ, it's definitely not for everyone. I'd still encourage you to give it a try if you haven't, though; it reads pretty similarly to Vekin, Noah, and Lippert, although personally I find it a good deal better.
