Thank you so much. These all seem really great. For some reason, despite of Alexandra Quick gaining positive reactions, I was never really interested in that story. Maybe because when I am on FFN I'm looking to read stuff about familiar characters and not new ones.

I'm actually aware of the Colin Creevey ones. The first few books are not that well written but you can see the author improving both in terms of storytelling and character development, which makes me really happy for him or her. Maybe not as obvious and in such a steep manner, but it kind of reminds me of how JK evolved as a writer throughout the books. If the first book shows you unidimensional characters with a single defining trait engaged in a battle of good vs evil, as you read more the characters and the plotlines become more complex.
