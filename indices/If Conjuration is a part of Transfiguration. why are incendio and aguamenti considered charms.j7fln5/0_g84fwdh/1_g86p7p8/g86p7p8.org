For Aguamenti, another route is saying it just condenses water from the air particles (could also duplicate the existing water in the air to avoid any issues with running out of water, duplicating food seems to be Charms). Since it's not changing the nature of the water, rather just relocating and altering its temperature, it would be a Charm not a Transfiguration.
