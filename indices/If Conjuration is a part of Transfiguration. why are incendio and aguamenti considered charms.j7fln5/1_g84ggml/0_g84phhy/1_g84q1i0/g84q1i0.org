The argument goes like this:

1. According to legend, the Quintapeds were created centuries ago when one wizard family transfigured another wizarding family into Quintapeds.

2. No one knows if the story is true or not.

3. The Ministry have attempted to Untransfigure the Quintapeds back into humans and failed.

4. This means that the Ministry believes that it is possible that the legend is true.

5. The Ministry knows how Transfiguration works.

6. Therefore whether or not it is in fact true, the story of wizards being transfigured into Quintapeds and staying that way for hundreds of years is within the range of possible transfigurations.

7. This is evidence that transfiguration is permanent, or at the very least lasts hundreds of years, which amounts to the same from the practical standpoint.
