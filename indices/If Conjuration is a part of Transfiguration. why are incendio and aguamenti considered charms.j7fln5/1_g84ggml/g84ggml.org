The two branches are distinct in theory. For example, the limits of transfiguration are different from the limits of charms. However, the two branches do overlap in function. Aguamenti is a charms that conjures water (a function associated more often with transfiguration).

Transfiguration can also be used to animate objects, a function associated with charms as well. And fire, of course, can be created and manipulated through a charm or transfiguration.

Conjured objects are not permanent.

However, transfiguration (as in entity to entity transfiguration) is permanent. See McGonagall's chessmen, the fact that Dudley's tail had to be removed, the fact that a self human-transfiguration has to be reversed by someone else (you can't wait it out), and the fact that the ministry tried to untransfigure Quintapeds.
