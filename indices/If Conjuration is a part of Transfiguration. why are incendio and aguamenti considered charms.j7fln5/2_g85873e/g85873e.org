If you transfigured something into an amount of water, or straight-up conjured some water, it would just fall down and pool around. Transfiguration also involves defining exactly how large your end result will be from the start of the spell, and happens all at once.

Aguamenti produces a stream of water that has momentum and energy and is sustained. You can keep it up for as little or as long as you like, mess with the pressure, and change your mind partway through.

Transfiguration always has a desired end result that you are shaping things towards, and charms are capable of producing malleable effects that can be directed and changed while you are casting the charm. So it's clear that while matter is being created, Aguamenti has reasons to be considered a charm.

This is similar to how shrinking and engorgement charms are a thing that exist, and differ from transfiguring objects in to larger or smaller versions of themselves.

TL;DR: Conjuring x number of gallons of water would fall under the school of Transfiguration. Making a jet of water would fall under the school of Charms.
