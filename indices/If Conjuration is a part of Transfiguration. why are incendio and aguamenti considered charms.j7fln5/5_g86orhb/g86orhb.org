Aguamenti might not conjure water, but rather condense water from the air. Same for Incendio, it doesn't create fire, it ignites existing gases.

Both things would take horrendous amounts of energy which is bypassed, because magic.

This does mean these spells would be subject to environmental conditions heightening or lowering their effectiveness.
