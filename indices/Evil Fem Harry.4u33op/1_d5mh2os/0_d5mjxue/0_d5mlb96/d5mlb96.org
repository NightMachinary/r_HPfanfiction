My take on dark magic is that the most prominent of its spells represent a very basic level of human instincts. Domination, survival and the destruction of enemies is what it revolves around. Using it resonates with these intincts. Just like these instincts are regulated by law in our real society, the wizarding society has made laws to control these primal spells.

Just like with any sort of violence, people can become addicted to the momentary simplicity of solving their problems with it. Somebody doesn't do what you want them to do? Imperio them. Someone needs to be punished? Crucio them. Someone needs to die? Avada Kedavra them. Something needs to be destroyed? Use Fiendfyre.

However, in the end it is about intent. Applied in the right way, a "Tickling Charm" can easily become unbearable torture. Transfigure a french fry into a stick of arsenic and watch the eater die. Hell, we read in the last book that several stunners can be deadly.

Magic is a tool. Its as dark or light as the wielder.

Then again, I get that this may be boring, depending on what type of story you want to write. I always liked the idea that illegal spells have some sort of rebound onto the caster. I had an idea once that the Crucio is the go-to torture spell because the caster get the exact opposite effect on themselves. Instead of unbearable pain, they feel like walking on clouds for the duration of the spell. I explained Bellatrix' preference of the spell by that. She lived so long in Azkaban that the short relief of the "trip" the Crucio sends her on is extremely addictive to her.

Anyway, on a different note:

This leaves me completely baffled. My brain cannot compute that people react like that to me. Thank you for the compliment.
