The easiest solution for your problem would of course be to make her choose the path of dark magic to defeat Voldemort. Fire with fire and all that.

Evil is effective because it lacks morals. Lets look at the example of Malfoy. A good Harry defends himself with words and maybe a bit of a prank here and there. Your evil version could think that letting malfoy have a little accident from the Astronomy tower could be the ideal solution to your problem. If you don't want to go to the extreme of murder too soon, then maybe the payback pranks could be of a sadistic nature.

My personal take on an evil Harry (also fem!Harry) was to make her emulate what she knows - the Dursleys, with the added magic. She longs for control and wants to establish dominance wherever she goes, by violence, abuse and humiliation.

My fic started after the ministry battle, and the main twist there was that she was Bellatrix and Sirius Blacks daughter and that she used the Crucio on Malfoy instead of Bellatrix. The curse worked and she got a taste for it at that point. Malfoy swallows his tongue due to the spell and dies. The fact that she has killed a man doesn't sit well with her Gryffindor peers and she is alienated from them. She begins to write letters to her mother, who has defected from Voldemort after the revelation of having a daughter. This is basically where the main story starts. Ivy has crossed certain thresholds and uses her new found ruthlessness to establish her own powerbase. Some follow her willingly, like Daphne Greengrass who is smitten by Ivy, others find themselves broken and imperio'd like Pansy Parkinson and Hermione, and others find themselves the victims of accidents, like Susan Bones. Ivy's end goal is to usurp Voldemort and rule Britain herself.

I never published this because, frankly, it was a massive braindump. But maybe you find something in my rambling that you could use.
