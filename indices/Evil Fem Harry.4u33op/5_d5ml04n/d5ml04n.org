One possible definition of "dark arts" is magic with a negative psychological impact. Addiction or worse.

Expose her to dark arts. Have her learn something not knowing what it is. The addiction starts slowly. She notices it -- but dark arts are a shortcut to power, and she repeatedly encounters situations where she needs that power (to survive, to protect others).

The psychological impact is harder to notice at first than the addiction.

Not quite as satisfying an option, admittedly.
