With any character, start with what he or she wants and how he or she intends to get it. Saying a person is "evil" doesn't mean anything to anyone; it's their actions in pursuit of a goal that defines the character. Unless you're writing a sadist or something similar, even the bad guys have a goal that the pain/suffering they're inflicting is advancing them toward.

Furthermore, until your character wants something you don't really have a plot to your story.
