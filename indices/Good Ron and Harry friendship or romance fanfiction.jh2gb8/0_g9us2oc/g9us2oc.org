I can't remember much right now, but here's my favourite Ron and Harry friendship oneshot-

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13106128/1/A-Clean-Shave][A Clean Shave]]:

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry's being an orphan has an unexpected side-effect, and Ron helps him out---learning a lesson in gratitude along the way. (Harry-Ron friendship fic, because Ron doesn't get enough credit and Harry needs a hug.)

Might come back to this later if I remember some more.
