I think I stopped reading this after Harry decided to go to the duel with Malfoy. It seemed like it was establishing a pattern of OC explains to Harry why his canon actions would be stupid, Harry, despite having a soul bond and deep trust with OC, says 'Um, don't care, gonna do it anyway.'

I was also a bit put off that by most of the interactions being repetitive. Every time Malfoy talked to the OC it was basically the same conversation.

Did it get better? Did the characters grow, the relationships between them change, and did it diverge from the stations of canon?
