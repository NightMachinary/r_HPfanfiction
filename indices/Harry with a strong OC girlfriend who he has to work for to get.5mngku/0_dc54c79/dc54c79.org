Not sure what you mean by "work for" but /Grow Young With Me/ has Harry slooooooowly developing feelings for an OC muggle woman. It's probably one of the most realistic and organic relationships I've read in fanfiction, honestly. He's not slaying dragons or rescuing her from a castle, but they don't just trip over each other and find themselves in love, if that's what you mean.
