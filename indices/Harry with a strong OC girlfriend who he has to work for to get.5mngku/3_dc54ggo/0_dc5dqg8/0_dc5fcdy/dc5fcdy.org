Nothing new really besides [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5mizp5/if_you_havent_read_contractual_invalidation_a/?st=ixn256u4&sh=3e9c2ee0][this thread]] which I liked but it definitely had some suspension of disbelief problems. The politicking is quite fun imo.

Then there's always the stuff like Perfect Situations and Matroyshka Vignettes by Jeconais but you've probably read that.
