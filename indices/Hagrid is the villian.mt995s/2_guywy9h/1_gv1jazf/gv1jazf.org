That was only in the movie. In the book Harry went back 'home' to Privet Drive, and then spent the rest of the summer reading through all his new magic textbooks; and then on September 1, it was the Dursleys who dumped him off at Kings Cross on their way to find a doctor who wouldn't ask questions to get Dudley's pig tail removed. Now while it is on Hagrid that he didn't tell Harry how to get to Platform 9 3/4, it's possible that he just plain forgot about that tiny little detail, what with everything else he had to do that day.
