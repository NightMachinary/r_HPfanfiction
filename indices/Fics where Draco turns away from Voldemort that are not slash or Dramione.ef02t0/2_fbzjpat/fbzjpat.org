I remember the start of one fic where Draco time travels to the day before he meets Harry at Madame Malkins before 1st year (of a bit before that).

It uses the 'V had him made a werewolf' theory and has the curse travel back with him, including the scar/dittany mark.

So, that and his memories of V from the original timeline, lead him and I think his parents to turn from V.

I don't know if the author ever got past the beginning....
