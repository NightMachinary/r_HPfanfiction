I always feel awkward recommending 1.5m word fics for something that takes up less than ten % of the total, but linkffn(innocent by marauderlover) (and it's sequels - we're in GoF territory now) has an amazing Good!Draco. It's far and away my favorite part of the fic. Draco has an Irish twin brother Hydrus, and Lucius has the idea to get one son in Slytherin and one son in Gryffindor . . .
