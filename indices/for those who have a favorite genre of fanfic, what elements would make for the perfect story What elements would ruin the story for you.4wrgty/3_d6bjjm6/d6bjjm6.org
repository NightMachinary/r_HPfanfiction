Pretty much ones like that. The only person I missed in that fic was Luna. It is also the only unconventional shipping story I liked. Best part is no Voldemort, and I like stories where he isn't there anymore, or gets killed off early, the setting of magical Britain is interesting enough without dark lords.

Shipping of any kind is optional for me and mostly unimportant, but don't just follow the canon timeline until school starts and suddenly announce random things like Draco/Hermione. Try and write an AU atleast. These things don't just happen like that.

I don't care if the entire fic is a mary sue driven wish fulfillment fantasy, if it is well written and lets go of the rails of canon. I've seen so many writers stick to the most minute details, and it is annoying as hell to see Hedwig die the exact same way, or the chess match in the first book always requiring that Ron sacrifice himself, or Sirius fall into the veil, etc etc. There's other ways to develop your characters.

I think changing the sexual orientation of characters is okay in fandoms where there aren't many prominent gay characters, but not okay in others like Mass Effect.
