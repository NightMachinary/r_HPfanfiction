I generally avoid any kind of pairing unless it's a romance fic. In fanfiction, pairing generally destroy the fiction when the authors focus so much on romance. And I have read so many good fic being wasted due to improvise some stupid romance (whether it's normal or slash). For example, linkffn(8149841) - this story has an unique plot at the beginning, was fun to read. But as soon as it started to focus on Harry's(and others') love life, the story became meh.

And this happens 99% of the stories when it started to focusing on romance.
