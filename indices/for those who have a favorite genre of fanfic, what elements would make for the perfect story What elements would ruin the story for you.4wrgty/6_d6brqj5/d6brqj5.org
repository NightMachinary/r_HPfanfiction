Hmm ... well, my favourite genre is the coming-of-age one; not necessarily as a story about children growing up, but rather about characters learning from their mistakes, maturing emotionally and intellectually, that sort of thing.

That said, I can't really make a list of what makes for a perfect story because with this genre, more than anything, it's important for the characters to be themselves and as such every character's story has to be different. I guess this means that the “perfect” list only has two things on it: “variety”, and “quality”.

That said, there definitely are things that ruin the story for me. Gratuitous romance is one, gratuitous preaching is another, and contrived plot progression is the last one.
