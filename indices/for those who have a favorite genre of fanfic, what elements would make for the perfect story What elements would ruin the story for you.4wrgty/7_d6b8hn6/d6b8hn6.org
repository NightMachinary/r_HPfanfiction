Ok, my list - I'll start with what I like first:

- not Harry/Ginny (I don't believe it, hell not even the movies believed it IMHO!)
- No Hermione/Ron or Hermione/Draco (come on, the former is disaster waiting to happen and the later would probably lead to murder - sooner or later!)
- either Harry/Hermione or Harry/Uncommon-Female!
- lots of interesting new magic
- some quidditch
- maybe a foreign school
- no canon-rehash (OP might like it (I wounder why - canon isn't that great...the world is, but what happens in this world? Nope!), but me? No, if I want to read canon I will go read the books again!)
- Voldemort dies a different way (less "succeeding through luck, chance, stupidity and the sacrifice of others"!)
- either no horcruxes or a better method of removing the one in Harry
- no children, marriage or pregancy (might just be me, but I don't want any of those things in RL (can't get pregnant as a man, but you know what I mean) and I think that Harry is more muggle than wizard, so IMHO he wouldn't have kids straight out of school or even in his twenties (no real reason to...wizards age way slower so why do this?))
- Dursleys in prison (neglecting a child...well, let's just say that in Harry's shoes I'd have the Prophet print my life-story (including Dumbledore leaving him on the doorstep and the neglect or even abuse he suffered!)...I guess a lot of vengeful wizards would be looking for those crappy muggles afterwards!)
- some pointing out the flaws in characters (without necessarily bashing them - on the other hand: What is bashing? Seeing a character punished for crappy behaviour? I don't think so, so having the Dursleys in prison wouldn't be bashing...neither would be taking Dumbledore down a few notches and ruining the man's reputation!)
- No slash
- No soul-bonds (that's like mind-rape and a marriage-contract roled into one...I'd probably kill myself if those things were real and if it happened to me - why? Because I'd hate to be acted upon by outside forces like that...I would cease being myself if something like that happened!)

What does ruin a story for me?

- magical talents (aside from being a metamorphmagus and maybe a parselmouth), I prefer that every wizard can learn everything if they only want to!
- magical cores and power-levels (those for me come down to intelligence, knowledge and thinking on your feet - meaning Dumbledore isn't powerful, he just knows a lot and that makes him hard to beat!)
- slash and mpreg (I don't have a problem with homosexual characters, hell I don't have a problem with Dumbledore getting it on with Grindelwald - I do have a problem with changing a characters sexual orientation just because you'd like to stick him into bed with somebody they'd never even look at that way in canon!)
- teen-pregnancy (that's never a good thing and don't try to tell me other wise!) or any kind of pregnancy (don't like to read about that - I don't even want kids in RL!)
- mediocre Harry etc. (sorry, but I read fanfiction to see the characters (not only Harry) live up to their potential and not stay mediocre and be lead around by the nose (Sorry, Dumbledore, but I don't think you know best - your approach didn't work during the first war, so step aside!))
- whipped characters and women being written as all powerful (and their men are just yes-men who don't think for themselves and allow her to shame them in public etc.)
- weak women (so yeah - I don't like either sex getting short changed!)
- overprotectiveness (don't care if it's brothers, fathers or boyfriends - can't stand it in RL, so I will not read about it either!)
- stupid antagonists (Voldemort isn't only using the cruciatus, no he also rewards his guys for example, otherwise they'd desert him or they would try to kill him - dark wizards aren't dogs you can kick around as long as you give them some table scraps every now and then!)
- etc. etc. etc. (many many things!)
