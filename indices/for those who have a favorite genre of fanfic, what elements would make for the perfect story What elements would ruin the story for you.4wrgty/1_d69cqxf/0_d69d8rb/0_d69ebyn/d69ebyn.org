sure

*Ginny and Harry both can be jealous at times. --- When was Harry jealous of anything? The one time he saw her with Dean?

*some sort of falling out between Harry and the Weasleys over his and Ginny's relationship that eventually gets reconciled. --- Why would they get mad enough at Harry breaking up with Ginny that they have a falling-out over it, in the middle of a war? Needless drama.

*While Ginny is at school and Harry in training, the long-distance relationship takes its toll on both of them. Harry gets jealous, so does Ginny.--- Very arbitrary. Why would it take a toll on them? What are they getting jealous over? Is Dean really going to hit on the girlfriend of the person who just killed Voldemort, and someone he is a friend with as well? Doesn't seem realistic.

*Ginny goes on a date at school after they break up with a new character who she befriended or Neville --- Very random.

*there is an auror case that plays as a backdrop to the real story of their relationship. This is more for pacing. --- Whose Auror case? If Ginny is at Hogwarts for her seventh year, that means Harry is in his first year training - what kind of cases do you think a green Auror trainee is going to be handling, especially ones that are long term?

*the feelings Ginny might have of not being part of Harry, Ron and Hermione's special bond is a major plot line --- might be a major plot line, or it could be something that doesn't exist and is arbitrary. Harry chose Ginny to date, not Ron, and not Hermione. And, Harry certainly feels closer to Ginny in some aspects, i.e., they've both been possessed by Voldemort, whereas the others haven't.

*the realities of Harry's job force Ginny to make a decision about whether she can be in a relationship where Harry is constantly in danger. --- Harry was nearly murdered as an infant. There wasn't a year that went by at Hogwarts where Harry wasn't in danger, and didn't ultimately end up in the Hospital wing. This should be a non-issue, since it comes with the territory, Auror or not. But, if Voldemort couldn't off Harry, then I doubt anything he encounters as an Auror will.

*Ginny wants her independence after living with 6 brothers her whole life, but Harry dislikes her not wanting to live with him. --- Again, seems arbitrary. Drama for the sake of Drama. Canon Ginny seems like she would be more than happy to move in with Harry, if asked. I don't see a world where they are dating and the two options are 1) live by herself or 2) live with Harry, and she picks the first one.

*Ginny gets a bit too crazy partying with her fellow Harpies, causing a drift in the relationship that ultimately is repaired. --- Again, drama for the sake of drama.
