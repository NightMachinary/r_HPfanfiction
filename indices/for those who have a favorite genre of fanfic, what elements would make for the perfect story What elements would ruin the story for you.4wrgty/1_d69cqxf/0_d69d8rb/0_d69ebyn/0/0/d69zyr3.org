Personally, all the drama is the reason I avoid most relationship fics. I just don't find it interesting at all. If a couple is featured in a fic, I prefer to see them communicate and act as a team to work towards some goal. I'm not saying they have to agree on decision, but reading about temper tantrums and sulking and hurt feelings doesn't do it for me.
