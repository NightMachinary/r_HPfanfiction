I hear ya. I like drama focused around relationships as it is very character-driven. I like the idea of seeing how these characters who went through extraordinary events adjust to normal life. How do these relationships develop in the context of everything that happened? For example, I think Harry and Ginny being apart the year after the battle (him in auror training, her at school) is a very interesting plot to explore given the context of the previous year when they were also separated.
