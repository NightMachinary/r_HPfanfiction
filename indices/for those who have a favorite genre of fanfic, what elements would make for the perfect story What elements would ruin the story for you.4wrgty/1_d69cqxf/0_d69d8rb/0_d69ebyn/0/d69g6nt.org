Well I asked and you certainly answered. You're definitely right about a couple at least. All I can say is that these are new stories. All plot going forward will be contrived to some degree. I can suspend a small amount of disbelief for a good story. But going point by point:

1) Ginny definitely showed jealousy in the series. Harry definitely showed jealousy with Dean. So I don't see how this is contrived at all.

2) I'm not talking about the Weasleys being mad for Harry ending it during the war. I'm talking about after the war when they get back together. Perhaps Harry does something to Ginny that the Weasley brothers gets upset about. It could be anything, really. If done well and realistically, it could be interesting. Think about it. The Weasleys are the closest thing Harry has to a family, so if something happened that caused them to get angry at Harry, this would be a very interesting plotline.

3) Why would a long-distance relationship not take a toll on them? They are still a normal couple of teenagers who get jealous and act irrational at times. Harry is a poor communicator and Ginny has a quick temper. Surely you can imagine a scenario where the distance and not seeing each other often creates tension or misunderstandings. Regarding Dean, he is an ex boyfriend who would be around his ex while her current boyfriend is not there. Yes he is friends with Harry but he is a guy too who clearly liked Ginny. I'm not saying this is the most realistic plot I would support, but it is not so far-fetched. Plus, me including Dean is more a reaction to fanfics I've read where they make Dean way too platonic with Ginny. So you're not that off on this one.

4) The Neville one is random. Again, it's based on a very good fic I read that basically made the point that because Neville and Ginny were so close during Deathly Hallows (which I think is a fair assumption), that perhaps Neville developed feelings for Ginny. Honestly, it is not that realistic, but if you avoid a few minor events in canon, an argument could be made that Neville would be attracted to Ginny and she could feel a bond to him as well, though perhaps not an attraction. But the idea that Ginny might date someone else if she breaks up with Harry is certainly not contrived.

5) So you're saying it would be contrived for Harry to be involved in a case during Ginny's 7th year? You mentioned you liked conflict, but I'm having a hard time seeing where this conflict would come from for you if even the idea of Harry working on a case is contrived.

6) Of course it could be arbitrary. All of these are ideas as the whim of the author. It's up to the author to make sure the idea sounds natural. I think that such an idea is natural. Harry starts dating Ginny, but still falls into old habits of only confiding in Ron and Hermione. And thus, Ginny wonders if she will ever be as close to Harry as Ron and Hermione.

7) I personally think, and its backed up in canon, that Ginny would be able to deal with Harry's job, in the same way military wives and husbands often do. But it is not insane to think it might not be something she could deal with. Just the fact that many wives and husbands of military members do get divorced is proof enough that it's a tough role to play. As far as the dangers of the job, Harry couldn't be killed by Voldemort for very specific reasons that had little to do with skill. Those same protections do not exist against other dark wizards.

8) Again, you are right in that Ginny would likely live with Harry, but the question is really whether it is at all possible that she might want some time to live by herself. And of course that is a possibility, for the reason I mentioned.

9) It was a plotline in a northumbrian story, and I really liked it. That's really the only reason I included it. However, it is certainly a plausible plot line. Ginny is known for being fiesty and up for having fun, joking around, etc. I'm sure that she will go out with her teammates to blow off steam after practice and games. She would also be newly independent. She doesn't have Hogwarts or the Burrow to constrain her, if she want to cut loose. Harry seems more reserved; he likes to have fun like anyone but just never seemed to be the partying type. So perhaps he sees Ginny having a bit too much fun in a way he doesn't really like and it causes issues.

it's cool if you don't agree that these angles would be fun to read. But it seems like you are looking at these plots as if I'm saying they would be likely to happen in canon, rather than if they /could/ happen and if it would be interesting if they did.

I don't see how most of these are contrived. If nothing else, they are no different than pitfalls that could befall most young couples. The fact that Harry saved the wizarding world yet still might find challenges living a normal life is interesting in and of itself. Perhaps if I said that Ginny breaks up with Harry because Batman enrolled at Hogwarts, that would be contrived.

I'm curious, do you think any drama in their relationship would be contrived? If so, why? Or if not, what sort of drama would not be contrived?
