  Most of the stuff you want to see in your perfect pairing just seems like a bunch of contrived drama, just for the sake of drama. To each their own, I guess. Harry/Ginny post-war fics were what I started on as well, since I wanted to know what happened before the epilogue, but I eventually expanded my boundaries.

Can you elaborate? You're probably correct that perhaps one or two of my wishes could be a bit contrived but what specifically?
