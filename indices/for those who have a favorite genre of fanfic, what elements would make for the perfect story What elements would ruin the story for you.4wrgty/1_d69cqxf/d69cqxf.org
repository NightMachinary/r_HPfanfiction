Most of the stuff you want to see in your perfect pairing just seems like a bunch of contrived drama, just for the sake of drama. To each their own, I guess. Harry/Ginny post-war fics were what I started on as well, since I wanted to know what happened before the epilogue, but I eventually expanded my boundaries.

For me:

*I need conflict. There needs to be some overarching goal or plotline. There has to be a sense of danger, not necessarily in that anything and everything could suddenly go wrong, but the subtle reminder that something significant is happening beyond their periphery, and that you can't really just sit on your laurels waiting for something bad to happen.

*I hate arbitrary cliches. Sure, I get that sometimes you can really come to a natural conclusion that Harry using the Marauder's Map to uncover the fake Moody really does make the most sense in a story, but things like calling Daphne "Ice Queen" out of nowhere, or randomly mentioning magical cores with no buildup or followup is really jarring for a story.

*A story need a conclusion, or at lease some semblance of closure, even if it's just for the main plot. This isn't a knock at incomplete or WiP works, but rather those that leave a reader unsatisfied, or perhaps with more questions than answer, with no answers in sight. Feels bad, man.

*There has to be some semblance of realism, even though this is a fandom of magic. Like, I don't get the point of multi-pairings. So many people take a rare pairing with almost no good fics like Harry/Fleur, and then they randomly add Hermione into it (because she was his first friend! Then she gets transformed into some BDSM taskmaster) or Gabrielle, because of some veela nonsense. Same thing frequently happens with Harry/Daphne.
