I don't see any reason why the writer can't set rules that wouldn't allow them to see each other. Just like a writer could set it up so Harry, as savior, could come and go when he pleased. Fanfic largely addresses the question of what if. For me, so long as a potential plot is plausible within the world Rowling created, I'm fine with stories that explore that possibility. Regarding the long-distance angle, Rowling never said in canon that Harry, as savior, would have free access to Hogwarts. So it's equally fair to think there would be issues with them seeing each other and there wouldn't be.
