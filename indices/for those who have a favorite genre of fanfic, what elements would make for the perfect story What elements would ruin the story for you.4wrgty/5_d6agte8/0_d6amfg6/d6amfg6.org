  There is no such thing in the wizarding world. Floo-Powder, Apparition, Portkeys are all more or less instant-travel. The Hogwarts rules may play a part, but still.

But at least as far as Hogwarts goes, it would be difficult for them to regularly see each other. Same if Harry is bogged down with Auror training. Maybe the physical distance is not much of an issue, but they still aren't seeing each other very often.
