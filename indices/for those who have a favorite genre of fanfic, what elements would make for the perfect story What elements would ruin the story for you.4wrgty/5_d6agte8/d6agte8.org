There is no such thing in the wizarding world. Floo-Powder, Apparition, Portkeys are all more or less instant-travel. The Hogwarts rules may play a part, but still.

I don't really have some favorite genre, but there are a few things that may keep me off reading a fic if another option is available. There are also a few things that will instantly pull me to a fic, and make me keep reading even with some lame points in it.

My list:

- I simply don't like the canon pairings. I dislike Harry/Ginny and I dislike Hermione/Ron. If either of those is present in a very story-driven fic, I could deal with it, but in a character-driven fic I wouldn't keep reading.

- I love it when the story goes outside of Britain. The wizarding world is so underdeveloped that I like it a lot when authors explore it. However, what makes me put away a fic almost instantly is Murica-wank, Weaboo-Japan-worship and similar things.

- I don't like slash. Not because it is same-sex, but because the authors often make such a huge deal about it being same-sex.

- I heavily dislike worldbuilding that isn't labeled "AU" and moves outside of established rules. Especially Magical Cores and magical exhaustion. One of the appeals of HP's magic system is that the resource "magic" is infinite and its use takes no more energy than waving the wand needs. Its limit is only your knowledge.

- It will be an instant favorite from me if I see creative and new magic.

- If I see a rare pairing, I'll probably read too, if just to look at how the author does it. Rare meaning from Harry/Tonks or /Fleur to rarer stuff like Harry/Bellatrix or really unique stuff like Harry/ Amelia Bones or Harry /Bathilda Bagshot (I am currently searching for it in my bookmarks. If I find it, I post it).

- I love well done completely OC fics (looking at you Alexandra). I think they represent whats missing in HP fanfiction. Exploring a new set of circumstances, a new area, a new time, new characters is wonderful.
