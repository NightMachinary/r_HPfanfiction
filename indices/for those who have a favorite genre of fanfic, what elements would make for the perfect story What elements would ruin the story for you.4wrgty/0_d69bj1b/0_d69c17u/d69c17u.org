Canonically, you are probably correct that Ginny wouldn't have been angry with Harry since she understood why she couldn't go. Then again, Harry broke up with her to keep her safe. But it's possible that from her point of view, she wasn't safe at Hogwarts. So Harry left her for no reason. I don't necessarily agree with that, but I could see her rationalizing that in her mind. Also, Ron mentioned that she was very hurt by him ending it, despite it seeming like she fully understood why.

The point in my including this is that it would be a source of conflict in the story. Too many stories in this genre show little to no conflict, and what's interesting about that? I don't necessarily disagree that Ginny would not get angry, or if she did, it would be irrational. I'm just saying it was a possibility and an interesting plot to explore.
