Agree with you. Though I'd prefer angst for angst's sake rather than literally nothing happening, which I think is just as prevalent.

I also, as mentioned in the original post, would not want all the things I mentioned to happen in one story. But, for example, Harry and Ginny struggling because they don't spend much time with each other is a completely realistic scenario and one I wondered how Rowling would deal with if she ever were to write that story.
