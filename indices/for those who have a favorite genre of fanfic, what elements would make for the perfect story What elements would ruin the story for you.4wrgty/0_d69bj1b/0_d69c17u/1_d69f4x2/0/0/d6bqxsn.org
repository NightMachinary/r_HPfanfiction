Have /something/ happen, then. Unless writing a story that does not deviate from canon at all, in which case there's no effing reason to add gratuitous angst, there's always a way to introduce something or someone that will serve as a source for some kind of conflict. Adding angst that is not necessary instead of doing it is basically like going swimming, having a floating wheel that's not inflated, and going “well, this thing doesn't work and thus won't help me, I guess I'll better take this big stone with me instead so that I won't sink” instead of just inflating the thing; meaning, it's a really stupid decision.
