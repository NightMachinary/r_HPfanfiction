I agree that sometimes these stories are too easy where nothing ever goes wrong, but to me its worse when an author puts in lots of relationship angst just so there's angst. That drives me up the wall. I hate when there are romantic subplots where the author keeps the main couple apart longer than necessary just so there's more unresolved tension or adds on ridiculous miscommunication for no reason. Ive seen so many horrible fics where some crazy fangirl stalker polyjuices into Harry's girlfriend (be it Ginny or whoever it is in the story) and then has said girlfriend walk in on him making out with the imposter. I think that is the worst trope possible and there are so many more examples of stuff like this.

*TLDR:* Its ok if things don't always go right but issues that come up must be believable. Angst added for angst sake is an instant bail for me.
