Manufacturing angst and conflicts is a big No-No IMO. I will categorically refuse to read those stories. For example, *The Hogwarts Strike Team*, linkffn(10807718), started out wonderfully. After the author started manufacturing angst in chapter 15, this fic fell apart, the reviewers were furious, and the author has all but given up.

One major source of conflict between Harry and Ginny immediately after the war was whether Harry should return to Hogwarts or not. If Harry was inclined to join the Ministry, Ginny could have been potentially furious: they had already suffered one year of separation, now Harry wanted another year? What was this guy thinking?

Once more separated, they would face endless temptations from other people. Staying true to each other and still believing in each other would be no easy thing.
