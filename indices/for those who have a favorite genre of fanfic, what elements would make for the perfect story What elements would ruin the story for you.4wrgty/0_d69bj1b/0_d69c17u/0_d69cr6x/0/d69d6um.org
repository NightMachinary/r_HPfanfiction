I completely forgot about Harry choosing not to go back. You're absolutely right that I could see Ginny really being upset by that. The only issue with that is Ginny seems to get what Harry really wants, and being an Auror is what he wanted to do, so could she really get mad? But then again, it could be a case of the brain fighting the heart. In her head, she would understand why Harry couldn't go back to school. But her heart would tell her it made no sense. It could be construed as Harry choosing the job over her.

That's another plotline I like to see. Harry and Ginny's adult relationship is a great example of family vs. work. Chasing down death eaters is Harry's passion, but so is Ginny. Her passion is quidditch but also Harry. Neither job sounds like one where either can devote enough to the other while also being fully committed to their work. So how do they make it work?
