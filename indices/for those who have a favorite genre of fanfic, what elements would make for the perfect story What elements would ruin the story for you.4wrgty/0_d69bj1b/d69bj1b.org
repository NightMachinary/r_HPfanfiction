  Ginny gets angry at Harry right after the battle for leaving her to suffer during her 6th year at Hogwarts but they reconcile during the summer.

I disagree with this point. Ginny couldn't apparate, had trace on her, and would be a major liability on the horcrux hunt. She might have suffered a lot at school, but she also recruited an army for her (ex)boyfriend and provided just enough manpower to win the final battle. Looking back, I think she would rather be very proud of that achievement.

Speaking of her ordeal at school, Snape probably reigned in the 2 Carrows until Eastern holidays (when she went into hiding), and most likely bailed her out of several tight spots. So it's very conceivable that Ginny felt she owed a lot to Snape and wholeheartedly agreed with naming their child 'Severus'.
