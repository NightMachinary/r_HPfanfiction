I am kind of working on a story like this. It's set after Hogwarts and is supposed to show a first attempt at wizarding world domination, but not through mass violence/killing. Goal is still the same, story has not gotten to his methods yet, but will shortly and they will be very different. It is mostly a relationship fic with an OC though, and that's all the first few chapters posted so far really deal with. Doesn't sound like exactly what you want, but in case you are interested -
