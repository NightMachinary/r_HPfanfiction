Petunia would have spoiled the girl rotten like she did with Dudley while Harry would still gotten second hand clothes and sleep in the cupboard until he got the Hogwarts Letter. I don't see any change for Harry, except he would probably not get Dudleys second bedroom (because there the girl would sleep) but the guestroom.

Girls can be just as mean as boys - they just be mean in different ways. So while Dudley used his fists to torture Harry his female cousin would most likely used lies and gossip. Children imitate what they see from their parents and continue with bad behavior if encouraged. With a mother like Petunia who already spread gossip about Harry, the girl would probably make his situation even worse.
