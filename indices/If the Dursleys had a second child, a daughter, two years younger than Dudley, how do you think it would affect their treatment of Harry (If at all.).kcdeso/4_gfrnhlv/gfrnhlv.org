I would love to read a story where this little sister grew up idolizing Harry, much to her family's horror. You can imagine that Dudley would not react kindly to no longer being the only focus of his mother's attention, and this along with the girl's empathy would only strengthen her bond with Harry. Petunia would try and turn her into "her little Princess," but she would only want to help Harry with his chores and share her toys, throwing tantrums if they planned an outing or vacation and didn't bring Harry.

Part of me thinks it would be great if she turned out to have magic and Harry was there to help her navigate through it, but admittedly this might be too cliche in a sea of cliches.
