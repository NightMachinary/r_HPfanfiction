Why stop at rumours? Treat any kindness between her and Harry as Harry making a move on her, and punish him accordingly. Of course, if he behaves /unkindly/ towards her, he needs to be punished for that too. "How dare you ignore your cousin!" - more punishment.

They'd trap him in a lose-lose-lose situation where no matter what he does he's always at risk of getting at least yelled at and possibly more.

Even worse, what if Vernon got it into his head that Harry actually was a threat to his little princess's virtue? The abuse we see in canon would ratchet up a /lot/, possibly to the point of accidental or even deliberate homicide.
