I don't see Vernon and Petunia tolerating anyone mistreating her baby, even Dudley. But, toddlers have trouble with new siblings and Dudley being spoiled would have even more trouble than most. It could play out a lot of ways but I like the notion of Dudley being demoted from Golden child and coming to an understanding with Harry sooner.
