I've read a really dark version of a story like this where Harry has a younger sister. At the start Petunia has some version of PPD so leaves the raising of her almost entirely to Harry but then takes her away when she realises the sister actually likes Harry. The sister forgets Harry cared for her when she was a baby and grows up a bully like Dudley. It's a sad story.
