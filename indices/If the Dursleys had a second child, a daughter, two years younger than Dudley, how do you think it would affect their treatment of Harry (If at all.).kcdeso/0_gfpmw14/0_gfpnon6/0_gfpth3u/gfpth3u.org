Maybe, but Dudley knew how to manipulate his parents. He could just bully her at school or whenever his parents weren't looking.

But I agree completely that Petunia wouldn't let even Dudley get away with it if she saw it. But Dudley was also huge and able to intimate many children, he could easily frighten his little sister into silence.
