They'd still hate him, probably rub the extra-special treatment of Dudley and their "precious baby girl" in Harry's face even more so then canon.

However the girl might be more sympathetic to Harry for two reasons.

1) Harry may be forced to take care of her because The Dursleys just loved to load chores onto little Harry.

2) Dudley may try bullying her and if so then Harry would definitely defend her. He hated bullies and wasn't scared of Dudley.

So in the long run, it may have been good for Harry, having a member of the Dursley's who cared about him as he grew up. Of course it could have gone the complete opposite way and the girl could have been just Petunia 2.0 but I'm an optimist XD
