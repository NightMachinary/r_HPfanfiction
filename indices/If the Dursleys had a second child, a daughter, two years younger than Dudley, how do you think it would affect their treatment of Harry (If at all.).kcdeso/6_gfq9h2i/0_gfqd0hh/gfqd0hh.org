Four bedrooms, actually - Vernon and Petunia, Dudley, Harry, and the guest room Aunt Marge stays in when she visits. It's an issue I've actually been trying to figure out - who sleeps where when she visits in the summer of PoA, because there's no way they'd force Harry and Dudley to room together even for a week, so I'm torn between setting up a camp bed in Vernon&Petunia's room for the daughter to sleep in while Marge takes her room, or shoving Harry into a cheap tent pitched in the back garden and letting Marge have his room.

As for looks, personally I was going with face similiar in structure to Petunia, generally tall for her age but never gets fat like Vernon and Dudley, pale eyes and brown hair.

Totally going for her being a witch though, but all childhood accidental magic will get blamed on Harry so no one knows until she gets her letter.
