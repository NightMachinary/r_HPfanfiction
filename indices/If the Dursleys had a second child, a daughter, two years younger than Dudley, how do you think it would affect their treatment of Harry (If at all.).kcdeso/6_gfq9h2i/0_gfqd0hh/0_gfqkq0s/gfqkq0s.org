Definitely putting Harry out, rather then the daughter. Camp bed in Dudley's room, maybe?

When I was a teen and my grandma visited, my mom kicked me out of my double-sized bed into my little brother's twin-sized bed and put him in a sleeping bag. (Sucked for him but I wouldn't fit on the floor.) So I could see a domino effect - Marge gets the daughter's bed, daughter gets Harry's, Harry gets the floor.
