I'm drawing a blank on the name but I remember a one shot on FFN where the “light side” won the war in the late 70s-early 80s. Everyone said fiat lux or something similar. New arrivals at Hogwarts who were sorted into Slytherin were immediately fed into a machine that stripped all of their magic from them.
