There's so much Harry/Hermione and Harry/Ginny over-saturation it's gotten dead boring. If you want to draw me into a story with that pairing, do it with the plot premise instead. I much prefer Harry/Luna or Harry/Pansy, much more entertaining.

Oddly enough, there are a scarce dozen or so fics of Harry/Katie. I would have thought that'd be a more popular pairing, even if she is practically a blank slate.
