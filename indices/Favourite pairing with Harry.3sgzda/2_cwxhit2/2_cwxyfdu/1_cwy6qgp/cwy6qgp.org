One of my favourite stories, hands down and I don't think that enjoyment is at all damaged by my complete lack of familiarity with Firefly.

Well, I didn't know Firefly when I read it, now I know Firefly purely through fanfiction. So, in other words, if Firefly is like the Harry Potter fandom, I still know nothing about Firefly.
