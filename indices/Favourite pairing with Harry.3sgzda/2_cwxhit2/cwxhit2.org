Given how I've read so very many Harry/Ginny, Harry/Hermione, Harry/Fleur and Harry/Daphne stories I really appreciate a story that does something a little unusual. This is probably down to the fact that I'm getting pretty tired of canon-rehash-but-with-different-pairing stories.

If I see a story with a pairing like Harry/Padma or Harry/AlternateRealitySelf I will give it just a little more leeway than if it's the millionth Harry/Ginny story.

That's probably why I like crossovers, when I can find them. It makes me sad when I find a crossover that somehow still manages to be a canon rehash (An Elf from Middle earth goes to Hogwarts!). What a waste.
