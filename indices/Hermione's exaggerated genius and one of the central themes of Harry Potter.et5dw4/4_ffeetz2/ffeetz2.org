IMO Hermione isn't even that smart, she just actually applies herself more to studying. Harry could also be that way, but him and Ron prefer constantly messing around. Harry is amazed by magic when he is first introduced to it, but he quickly loses any motivation or fascination and treats it as a chore. This, combined with Hermione being a bookwork make her seem like a genius in comparison.

But there is more than just one type of intelligence. Hermione might have a bit of an edge with memory recall and retention, but she utterly lacks spatial or verbal intelligence. For example, she has trouble communicating with her peers often and can't explain what she is thinking, like in book 3 with the time turner. She can't play quidditch like Harry.

In fact, I would even say that Harry is smarter than Hermione, using his creativity, his natural athleticism, and his ability to perform well under pressure as a metric. Fanfic writers also like her because she is muggleborn, and they often like to use that as a plot point to bring politics and blood magic into their storylines.
