Harry and Ron apply themselves plenty, and Harry complains about it all the time; and they get help from Hermione, too.

What we do see, is that every time new magic is introduced in class---including DADA related, like nonverbal casting---Harry either observes Hermione mastering it before anyone else, including himself, or doesn't observe who did it first at all. We also see multiple instances of Hermione mastering magic just from reading about it from a book---including before she even starts Hogwarts. (Harry does have a pretty good record in that respect as well, though his is almost entirely with Dark Arts.)

I am not sure where you're getting the verbal intelligence parts; she seems to have no trouble expressing herself and she certainly has excellent reading comprehension. Are you talking about emotional intelligence and empathy? She certainly lacks those in early canon.

I am also not sure where you are getting that Harry is particularly creative. He makes some good leaps of intuition, but he also makes some disastrous ones. And, I don't think I've ever seen performing well under pressure as a metric of intelligence. It sounds like you're just looking for some criteria---any criteria---that you can use to put Hermione below Harry in cognitive ability.
