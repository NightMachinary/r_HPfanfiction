I think what JKR's going for is everyone is basically the same intelligence apart from outsized geniuses like Voldemort and Dumbledore and people just prioritize learning less and more. Like, Ron and Harry would be just as smart as Hermione if they did all the things Hermione does instead of the things they do. But they don't, because they aren't her, and as a result are not as smart as her.

Bear in mind she is always helping them with things, and never vice versa, and she's routinely the first or only one to get spells/potions right when we see anything happen in class. Just because she's not the mega genius she often is in fic doesn't mean she isn't the smartest person in Harry's year. She's just... your high school valedictorian, rather than the next Einstein.
