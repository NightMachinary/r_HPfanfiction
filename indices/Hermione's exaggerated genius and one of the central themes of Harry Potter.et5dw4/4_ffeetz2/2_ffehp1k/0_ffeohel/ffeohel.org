Again, I don't want to sound too critical, but we don't even know if Hermione actually is the smartest in her year of Gryffindor, let alone anyone in Hogwarts. We don't know the OWL scores of anyone except the trio and a few weasleys.

I find it entirely plausible that Hermione was outscored by Parvati Patil (Ravenclaw sister), or maybe Romilda Vane. (love potion can't be easy to make, maybe as difficult as polyjuice?) I know she was called the "smartest witch of her year," but that always felt like ego-stroking to me. Hermione just rubs it in your face that she is smart, but there are many quieter characters who are definitely smarter, so no, she's not the valedictorian.
