Harry not being his father's son, having a name that Dumbledore made up, having a delusion that Hagrid is tall when he's actually 4'0", would not change the story as much as it turning out that Hermione wasn't smart. We weren't discussing OWL scores, we were discussing if Hermione is Valedictorian level in her class, and deciding that she isn't is obstinately denying canon every bit as much as the above.
