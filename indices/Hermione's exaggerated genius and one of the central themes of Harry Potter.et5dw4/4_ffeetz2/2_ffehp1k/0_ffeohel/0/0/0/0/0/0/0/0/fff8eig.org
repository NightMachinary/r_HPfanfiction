What proof do you have for it being so "obvious"? That Lupin said it to her? There is no hard data or established canon in your idea. Just because someone said something to someone does not establish it as fact in the books. Voldemort told Harry "There is only power and those too weak to seek it." But that is obviously not fact. A few impressed teachers complimenting Hermione falls under that same category. Nobody ever asked them if Hermiome's academic rank was absolute. It IS possible and not contradictory to canon that they, like you, were simply using a bit of hyperbole. I don't know why this is so hard for you to understand.
