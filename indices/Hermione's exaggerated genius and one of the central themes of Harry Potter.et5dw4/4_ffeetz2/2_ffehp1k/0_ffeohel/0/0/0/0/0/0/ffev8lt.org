No it isn't, you exaggerate, and your overuse of hyperbole does you no favors. I am not sure how else we should measure class performace at Hogwarts? The OWLs are canon, it is not denying canon to acknowledge that we do not have much information about the final results. It is not mentioned in the books or by JKR ever a definitive ranking of OWLs, therefore it is open to interpretation. Hagrid is however established as the the tallest, being mentioned as a half-giant many times.
