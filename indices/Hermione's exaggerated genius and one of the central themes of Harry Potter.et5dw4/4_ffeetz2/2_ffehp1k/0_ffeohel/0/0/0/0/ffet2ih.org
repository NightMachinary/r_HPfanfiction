That is a false equivalency. There is no evidence that anybody was taller than Hagrid, or that Harry wasn't his father's son. There is however, room for interpretation regarding Hermione's supposed OWL scores. If Harry was taller than Hagrid, it would change everything, and not work unless it was AU. Hermione being outscored on the otherhand, would change nothing in the storyline.
