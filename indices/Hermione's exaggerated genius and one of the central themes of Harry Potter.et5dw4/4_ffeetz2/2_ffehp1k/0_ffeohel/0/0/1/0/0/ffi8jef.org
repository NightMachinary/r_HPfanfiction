There's a throwaway line in Prisoner of Azkaban about Percy taking every NEWT subject except Care of Magical Creatures, another about him getting an Outstanding in each of his subjects, and then in Goblet of Fire there's another throwaway line about Percy breaking some kind of record with his NEWT scores. There's also an interview with Rowling out there where she says the previous recordholder was Tom Riddle. It's not much, but it's all we've got.
