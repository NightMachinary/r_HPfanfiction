We don't have a ranked list of OWL scores, but we do know that Percy Weasley and Tom Riddle are the only characters in the series to take the maximum number of subjects possible and obtain perfect NEWT scores. Test scores are not exactly great ways of measuring intelligence, though. We know from an interview with Rowling that Hermione is supposed to be a genius, but also that she struggles /hard/ with time pressure and thinking on her feet. It's probably reasonable to assume that she's the best theorist in her year, but that she struggles a bit with practical exams.
