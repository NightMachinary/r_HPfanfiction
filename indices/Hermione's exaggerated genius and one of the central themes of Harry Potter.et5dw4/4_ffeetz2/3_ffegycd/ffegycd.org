Yeah Harry and Ron are more of the 'learn by doing' rather than 'learn by reading' type. They also receive similar marks on their OWLs despite barely doing any work. If they really tried they would blow Hermione out of the water.

  Fanfic writers also like her because she is muggleborn, and they often like to use that as a plot point to bring politics and blood magic into their storylines.

But that could be done with Harry. He was Muggle-raised. And he and Ron could compare and contrast a magical vs non-magical upbringing. It would be easier too, since we know little about Hermione's (canon) upbringing.
