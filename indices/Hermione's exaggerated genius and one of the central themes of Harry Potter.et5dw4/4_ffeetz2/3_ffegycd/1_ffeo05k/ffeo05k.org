I get what you're saying, and I don't want to sound like I'm bashing, but Ron just isn't on the same level as Harry or Hermione.

He gets more out the relationship than he puts in, from a purely pragmatic point of view. Sure, I know there is no way to measure the value of a good friend and confidant, but Ron just doesn't have that many redeeming characteristics. He doesn't contribute that often outside of friendly support, which is fickle at best. (See goblet of fire) I can only think of the chess match in PS that is an example of Ron actually contributing to progress the plot outside of comic relief.

To your Hermione point, Harry is a half-blood. Hermione isn't. Using Harry as a prop to preach about "magical racism" that many fic writers love to bandy about isn't as effective when you consider that Harry is directly descended from one of the oldest wizarding bloodlines ever.
