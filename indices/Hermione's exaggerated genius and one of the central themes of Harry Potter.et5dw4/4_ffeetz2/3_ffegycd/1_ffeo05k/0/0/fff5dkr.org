I know Harry is the protagonist, so the focus is on him, but I realised recently that Ron and Hermione always have to deal with his problems. Hermione researches horcruxes for him and they both help him practise for the tournament. They deal with his angst in OOTP. Harry, meanwhile, doesn't seem to want to offer to help Hermion in her third year or is interested where she is disappearing to. When Ron is upset because he isn't invited to Slughorn's party, all Harry cares about is what Malfoy is up to. Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't want to be his friend, because it's always about him.
