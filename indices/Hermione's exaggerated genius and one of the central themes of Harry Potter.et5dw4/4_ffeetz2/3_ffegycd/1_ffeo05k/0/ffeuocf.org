I would say that Harry gets more out of his relationships with Hermione and Ron than he puts into either one. It's not really his fault: he didn't choose to have Voldemort personally interested in him and all that that entailed.

In fact, consider that Harry was always going to have Voldemort after him personally, and Hermione, as a Muggleborn, was always going to be a target for Voldemort and pureblood supremacists. Their choice was fight or flight.

But Ron, the pureblood, he always had the option of walking away and sitting the conflict out as most purebloods did. He had family in the wizarding world, too. Of the trio, he had the most to lose. And yet, he was with his friends all the way, and it took wearing a horcrux around his neck for weeks to give him a mere moment of weakness.
