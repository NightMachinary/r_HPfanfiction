You're wrong. Harry gets the least. If Hermione or Ron was not Harry's friend, he could easily replace them. Hermione had no friends when she arrived at Hogwarts. Ron would've just been friends with Dean and Seamus, as we see in GOF. By being friends with Harry, the famous BWL, their social status is massively elevated. The same cannot be said in reverse.
