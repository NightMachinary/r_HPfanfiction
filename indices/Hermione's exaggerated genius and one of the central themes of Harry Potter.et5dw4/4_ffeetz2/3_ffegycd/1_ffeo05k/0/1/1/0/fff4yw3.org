I disagree. He would have been hurt really bad by the bludger and it would be Ginny who would not have survived. Harry probably would have survived anyways. In canon if he did not get the message about the monster being a Basilisk and pipe being written on it, he would not have figured out where the monster is. I don't think he would have figured it out on his own in this AU so he would not be in the chamber. Ginny would die and the Weasleys might have hated him thinking he was the heir.

Harry probably would not have made it through year one without Hermione. He would have atleast seriously injured if not killed during the Quidditch match. This would likely have started an investigation and Quirrel would be found out. If this does not happen and he survived this he would not have figured out about the stone and would not know about the trapdoor so he would have no reason to think something valuable is there and Voldemort would have come back and killed him.

So yeah her absence would indirectly lead to his death but it would definitely lead to more dire situations.
