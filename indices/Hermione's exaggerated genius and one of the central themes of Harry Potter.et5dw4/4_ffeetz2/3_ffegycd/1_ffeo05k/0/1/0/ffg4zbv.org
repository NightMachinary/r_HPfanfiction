He'd replace them, perhaps, but would replacement!Ron follow him into the corridor and into the Chamber of Secrets? Would he bring along the warm family that would adopt Harry as their own, provide both love and resources, and not seek to take advantage of him? Would replacement!Hermione be able to provide the erudition, the planning, the organisation, and the breadth of magical skill that he doesn't have the time, the talent, and/or the will to learn himself? Would they stay with him all those times he'd been ostracised by his House or the society as a whole? Would they invest months of their lives into helping Harry survive his latest crisis?

Sure, some Slytherins might befriend him in pursuit of "social status", and some Quiddich groupies might do the same, but once Voldemort comes back, how many of them would stick with him despite the danger to their lives?

I don't know exactly what you mean by their social status being massively elevated. Social status is not some number of points you can spend to get people to do things for you. That sort of mentality leads to getting sorted into Slytherin and then being bad at being a Slytherin. What, precisely, did this supposedly massively elevated social status actually get them? What did it enable Ron and Hermione to do that they couldn't have otherwise?
