Out of curiosity, what do you think all that going to class, researching in the library, writing essays, and practising spells that Harry was constantly complaining about having to do was, if not studying? And then, Harry and Ron did get significantly worse marks than Hermione in every subject but DADA---and DADA happens to be the one subject in which Harry, in particular, puts in massive amounts of extra effort.

Also, what does "learn by doing" even mean in this case? Being able to master complex magic just by reading about it in a book---how Hermione does it---is far more impressive than needing a teacher to explain it, demonstrate, correct mistakes, etc.. There's a reason schools have classes, homework, and other activities, rather than just giving each student a stack of books and telling them to come back in six months for the exam.
