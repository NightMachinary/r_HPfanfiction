  But there is more than just one type of intelligence. Hermione might have a bit of an edge with memory recall and retention, but she utterly lacks spatial or verbal intelligence. For example, she has trouble communicating with her peers often and can't explain what she is thinking, like in book 3 with the time turner. She can't play quidditch like Harry.
