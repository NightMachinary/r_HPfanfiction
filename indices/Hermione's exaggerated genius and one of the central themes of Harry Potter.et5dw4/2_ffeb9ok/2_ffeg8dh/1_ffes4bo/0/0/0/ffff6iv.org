There's few things worse than bashing, but you're still extremely obsessed for no reason. You're also projecting some very strange opinions on me, like how you insist that I hate Ron or like the Harry/Hermione ship, when all I've said is that you're extremely obsessed with the character for no reason.

Also, what does "stan" mean? As far as I know, it's some weird Kpop thing.
