- Because most people consider not conforming to canon to be bashing?
- Because you can't realistically break up the golden trio without a reason?
- Because Molly Weasley's natural state is Cunt (book 5)?
- Because someone has to be the bad guy? (this is school, you want your enemies to be annoying, a la Malfoy)

Because conforming to canon is boring? I read fanfics because they are different. I don't care who is bashed, as long as it conforms with the story. Except if you are uselessly bashing someone for no reason at all. Which coincidentally is a very hard concept for people to understand.
