  Because most people consider not conforming to canon to be bashing?

I strongly disagree. Bashing is just lazy characterization, showing how a writer is incapable of making you dislike a character/see them as wrong and still write them like a realistic human being.

I'd use Molly Weasley as a case in point. Still a realistic human being who loves her kids, loves Harry like a son, is generally a kind hearted loving woman -- and also believes everything she reads, and jumps to conclusions.

  Because you can't realistically break up the golden trio without a reason?

Sure you can. Ron drops dead of a heart attack. The hit from the chess piece in book 1 is fatal. Literally thousands of different ways, not all of which require death.

Edit: Just a few off the top of my head for good measure ; Hermione's parents take her out of Hogwarts for safety reasons, Ron's parents run out of money and can't afford schooling anymore, Harry/Hermione and Ron get into a very strong cultural difference between them that is reasonable for both sides to have (Unbreakable vows ; Harry wants every wizard to swear to not be a murderer so someone like Voldemort cant happen, Ron see's this as a massive taboo) ect ect

And as far as Malfoy goes, I'd say canon ultimately just veers off from bashing in the last few books. Malfoy isn't a complete incompetent, he fixes the Vanishing Cabinet and contributes to the plot. Thats one difference between an antagonist and character bashing- success. Another would be learning from your mistakes, like Malfoy does in the last book. Another difference would be how Malfoy doesn't repeatedly shoot himself in the foot for no reason, which Ron sure as hell does nothing but in the fic you linked.
