  Sure you can. Ron drops dead of a heart attack. The hit from the chess piece in book 1 is fatal. Literally thousands of different ways, not all of which require death.

My first point. People would still call that bashing. Did you mean it as bashing? No. People will still consider it bashing, because it didn't conform with canon. Yes, people expecting canon compliance in every fanfic is a thing. I wish it wasn't. But it is.

She's a controlling person where if you don't follow her world views, she will relentlessly tear into you. She's a loving person /most/ of the time, but as soon as you step outside of her world views, the mean/crazy side (damnit, you got me writing cunt...) comes out: howlers, destroying the twins' merchandise, not believing they can make anything of themselves without following her plan for them, tearing relentlessly into Sirius in book 5, and as much as I don't like it... not believing that Harry was the chosen one and letting them go off on a stupidly dangerous camping trip... Oh! She's the crossmix of Tiger/Helicopter Parenting: She hovers, and then explodes more than needed.

  canon ultimately just veers off from bashing in the last few books. Malfoy isn't a complete incompetent, he fixes the Vanishing Cabinet and contributes to the plot.

I think JKR realised she wrote herself into a hole. Malfoy doing a complete 180 like that wasn't believable for me. Malfoy will always be the stereotypical richboy trope.

  Ron sure as hell does nothing but in the fic you linked

I agree. The whole point of that link was the ALABAMA INTENSIFIES!

Bashing is pointlessly exposing a person's flaws. I'm of the opinion that you can use a trope like... Potions Queen Molly, and that wouldn't be bashing. It's a plot device. But if you continue to belittle them (like Malfoy in books 1-5), then it is bashing. *Harry Potter and Afterlife Inc* does this, they prove their point, and then moves on.
