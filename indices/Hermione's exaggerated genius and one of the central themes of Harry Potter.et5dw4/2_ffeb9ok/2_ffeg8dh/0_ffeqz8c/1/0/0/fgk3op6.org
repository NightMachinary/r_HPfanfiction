Can anyone please explain to me why 99% of fics have bashing in them? It's really, really not that difficult to make someone out to be a cunt without making "being a cunt" their entire characterization. It literally makes fic's unreadable, because all I think of in the back of my mind is "how does someone hate a fictional character that much?"
