the problem is that writing a story like that means moving away from the wonder of magic and gets you bogged down with all the gritty details

when you write a story focusing on harry or hermione you show them win through magic and not shounen bs without getting all caught up in the realities of war

that and the fact that most people are too annoyed with how passive harry is in the later books that its what they want to change the most that they lose sight of the other characters
