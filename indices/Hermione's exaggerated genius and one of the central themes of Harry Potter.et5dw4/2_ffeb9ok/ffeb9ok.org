I think this is actually the main issue: heaping all the glory and accomplishments on the main protagonist.

Don't let Harry (or Hermione) get all the credits for winning. The series says friendship is great, and I think that's a great message. But for god's sake let his/her friends be useful and make some key contributions. Apart from Hermione's awesome research ability, let Ron become a good tactician or strategist since he's so good at chess, let Ginny be an ultimate sidekick, let Neville be their voice or diplomat with the traditional Purebloods, let Susan be their Ministry contact, let Luna be the chief propagandist, let Justin be their money man or Muggle relation expert, let Tonks be the ultimate spy and infiltrator, and let Dumbledore do something cool too. There is absolutely no need for Harry or Hermione to outduel Voldemort in a straight fight. War is all about deceptions, fighting unfairly, and maximizing your own advantages anyway.
