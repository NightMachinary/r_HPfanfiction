while I agree that as written that premise isn't great, you have to remember that in the world of Harry Potter, with the exception of the hero protagonist, magical strength is directly correlated with knowledge. Dumbledore and Voldemort (and even Grindelwald) were powerful because of their strong knowledge and understanding of magic. By comparison, being good at chess doesn't lead to anything other than winning at games of chess.
