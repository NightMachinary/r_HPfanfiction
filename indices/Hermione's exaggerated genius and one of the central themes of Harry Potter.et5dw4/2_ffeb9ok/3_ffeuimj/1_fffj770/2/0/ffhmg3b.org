I totally disagree with this point. While I admit that knowing more spell may give an hedge in some situation, I don't think it automatically make someone more powerfull. It only represent a part of the strenght.

Hermione may know more spell that Harry and Ron, but she is also doesn't react well to stress, and in a situation of pure combat, I'm pretty sure you would be better with Ron than her.

As for Dumbledore and Voldemort, with the exception of their duel in OotP, they may stand at the top, but their spell repertoire isn't that great; I think that outside of it, Voldemort may uses something like 4 or 5 spells? And it's still enough to be the boss).

And my point was that some people use the fact that Hermione has good grade to make wide assuption about her, and make her way more talented than she is. Yes she gets a lot of O, but it doesn't make she can "make her wand do things I have never see before" as Dumbledore did during his OWLs. It's like saying "I got the best grade on my A level, where is my Nobel Price?". And since people are using this tiny bit of information to make so much assumption we are in the OOC territory, they can as well do the same with Ron.
