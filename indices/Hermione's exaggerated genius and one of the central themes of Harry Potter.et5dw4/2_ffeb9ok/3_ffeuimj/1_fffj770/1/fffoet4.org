I actually like this and wish we saw more of it. I always cringe when fics make the leap from "Ron is good at chess" to "Ron is a competent military general at 16" like is alluded to above. And that of course becomes the trope: Hermione is the brains, Harry is the brawn, Ron is the goofy member of the group who doesn't really do much until the inevitable "big battle." Using his knowledge of the Wizarding world and its culture (something Harry and Hermione lack) to navigate various challenges and so forth would be a lot more interesting.
