Well, let's put it that way, without land lease, the Soviets could not have come back in that war. While it would have not been over by Christmas 1941, it would have been pretty much decided as the Soviet economy would have been on the brink of collapsing, as that video points out. There would have been no Soviet counter-offensive in that Winter because LL was that crucial to the Soviet military. And ammunition was in short supply at that time as well.
