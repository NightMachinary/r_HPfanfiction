Except that everyone knew that the Russian winter was a thing and about the general difficulty which was to be expected. The German Empire even won the Eastern Front in WWI, and that front was completely expected (although not the speed of the Russian mobilization in 1914).

Napoleon lost because the Russians razed their +own capital+ major city and took every bit of food they could. It was also not a second front because he had already defeated everyone on the continent and couldn't hope to challenge the Royal Navy after Trafalgar.

Charles XII was completely mad and somehow his attack on Moscow ended up in modern-day Ukraine.

Hitler underestimated the Red Army because they had horrible losses against Finland in the Winter War. And even then it was Land-Lease which kept the Soviets in the fight. It was also not really a second front for him but the main battlefield, since the Eastern Front was where the overwhelming majority of German divisions was deployed (153 compared to 2-3 in the Afrika Korps or the 12 which garrisoned France)
