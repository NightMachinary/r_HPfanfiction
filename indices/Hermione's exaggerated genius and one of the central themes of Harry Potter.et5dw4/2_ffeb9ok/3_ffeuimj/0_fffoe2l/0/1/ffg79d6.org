Yeah but it's not about taking Russia, it's about holding it. Too many bordering territories, hard to defend, gets a lot of attacks as a land route into Asia, and if another player has Asia then the number of reinforcements they get is nuts and you're screwed.

There's a reason Russia has a geopolitical pressure to constant expansion, and it's cos holding Russia without that is super hard.
