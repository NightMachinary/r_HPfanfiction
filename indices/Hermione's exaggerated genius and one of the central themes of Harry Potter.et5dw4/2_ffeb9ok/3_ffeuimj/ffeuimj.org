Yeah, that's not how this works. Being good at a game does not translate into RL at all. I used to be 62nd in the global leader board in ski jumping in Vancouver 2010, and I haven't touched a ski in my life. And Chess is certainly no good metaphor for actual military engagements because of their unpredictable nature and lack of information about the enemy. There are games which are way better at simulating military conflicts, yet you wouldn't argue that someone should be given command of the military because they are rank 1 in Wargame: AirLand Battle.
