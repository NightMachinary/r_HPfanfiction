  Apart from Hermione's awesome research ability, let Ron become a good tactician or strategist since he's so good at chess, let Ginny be an ultimate sidekick, let Neville be their voice or diplomat with the traditional Purebloods, let Susan be their Ministry contact, let Luna be the chief propagandist, let Justin be their money man or Muggle relation expert, let Tonks be the ultimate spy and infiltrator, and let Dumbledore do something cool too.

This actually describes a pet peeve of mine. I think this kind of approach creates more problems than it solves. You see it in a lot of fics where Harry has more friends and each and (suddenly, for no good reason) everyone has to fill some kind of unique role (like a puzzle piece), employing a particular set of skills ("oh a botany problem, quick call Neville the green thumb)".

It creates the kind of impression where every story supposedly needs some kind of ensemble cast that can be used to approach the different facets of a problem. Why? In any other story the protagonist just has to make due without intelligence if he isn't particularly smart. That's it. No further action required.

The "characters are describable by particular skillsets instead of being actual characters" makes it so much more boring: "Oh there's a pure-blood snob standing our way, but hey, in my giant bag of holding I have Daphne, who is good at pureblood politics and will remove this obstacle" instead of "Damn, I don't know how to deal with this obstacle, I have to think on my feet and use my wits". Having to read one story after another where Susan Bones is just a glorified stepping stone into the Ministry and politics or law-enforcement just makes me sad.
