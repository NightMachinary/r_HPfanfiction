Problem is, in fics where harry is super powerful and shares that power, he still has to be /a tiny little bit/ more powerful. If he finds a secret technique for wandless magic, he still hast to be a smigen better at it than anyone else, and that's both the root and effect of this strange "lone wolf" sentiment.
