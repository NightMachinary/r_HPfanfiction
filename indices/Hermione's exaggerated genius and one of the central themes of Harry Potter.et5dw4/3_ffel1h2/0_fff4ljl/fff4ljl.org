I think it's a portrayal of Hermione that would work in a fanfic - but I don't agree with it in canon, particularly the comparison to James Potter. The big issue to me is that it's very difficult (if not impossible) to truly compare across generations in the series - because we see Harry's generation through 7 years, compared to just snippets of the other ones. Inconsistent at that, as well.

For instance, even the number of OWLs is something that is mentioned offhand for some characters (eg, Bill and Percy having 12) /before/ JKR actually went out and did the schedules - and are a number that is basically impossible to attend all the classes for from what we see in canon (other than assuming that Hermione's time turner was a regular thing) - leading to us having to jump through hoops to try to justify how that's possible.

In the same way, we get snippets of the other characters in ways that stand out as more unrelated. Like becoming an animagus - how hard is it, when Pettigrew did it as well? Is it a sign of his hidden genius, or that it might not be as hard as we think? What kind of support did they all have?

It's like the Polyjuice potion - it's described as very difficult, but from the way Hermione (and the others) make it in canon, it comes across as not all that hard.

So for nitpicks from your list:

1) Hermione doesn't just consistently know spells ahead of time, she consistently gets/achieves them first in classes when exposed to them - and is able to help others get it, even when she's first exposed to them in practical exercises.

2) We don't know the assistance James Potter got - but he at the least had the support of his friends.

3) James co-created the Marauder's map, and we don't know anything about the details there.

4) We have no idea about his OWL scores, nor the amount of study. From the canon results, I think it's /very/ unlikely that anyone but Voldemort and Dumbledore received all Os.

Your following description of James includes "James Potter has the level of talent where he is extending magic to new areas and mastering skills which many wizards never master. [...] whereas by all accounts James Potter achieves his largely through natural talent."

Again, there's no indication that James has extended magic to new areas - the closest we get to that is the Map, which we have 0 knowledge of in canon in terms of its creation. It could be as easy as magically hacking into Hogwarts' wards, and putting it in an enchanted object that they took years to make - advanced, yes, difficult, of course, but extending magic to new areas? We don't know. As for wizards never mastering skills, wizards are apparently by and large lazy and don't bother mastering many things - like shield spells, the patronus, and a host of other skills that Harry & his friends manage. Animagus could be easy and tedious, and that would be enough to stop most wizards from trying it. Finally, the achievements that you find most impressive with James are all outside of class - and there's no indication that he did not have to work hard on those.

In fact, the animagus transformation is said to have taken three years of intense study for both James and Sirius - that's hardly skating by on natural talent.
