Yeah, I don't think JKR ever intended to make Hermione all that magically special - none of Harry's generation are. If you were to put magical ability into tiers, I'd put Hermione in tier 3 with people like Percy Weasley and Remus Lupin (where tier 1 is Dumbledore/Voldemort and tier 2 is Snape/McGonagall).

That "tier 3" is essentially that of a skilled generalist: achieving a high level of competency in all (or most) areas of magic, but not setting the world on fire in any. Intelligent and hard working, these people are in the top 5% of magical skill but there's a huge gulf between them and those in "tier 2".

For tier 3, magic doesn't come to them naturally like it does to the most talented, and sometimes they struggle with the material (in HBP, Hermione is said to be finding NEWT Transfiguration difficult).

In that regard, I would actually put Hermione a bit below someone like Lupin, as Hermione is not quite a straight-O student - she has a consistent weakness in Defence Against the Dark Arts.

When you look at Hermione's greatest magical achievements in canon, they are:

- Consistently knowing spells ahead of time.

- Looking up and executing the Polyjuice Potion as a second year.

- Looking up and executing the Protean Charm as a fifth year.

- Looking up and executing the Undetectable Extension Charm as a sixth year.

Contrast James Potter:

- Became an animagus in fifth year without assistance.

- Created the Marauder's Map, a unique magical item.

- Had mastered non-verbal magic by fifth year.

- Achieved Os in his OWLs without any study whatsoever.

There's just a step-change between Hermione and James Potter. Hermione is looking things up and executing them ahead of when a student would normally learn those things; James Potter has the level of talent where he is extending magic to new areas and mastering skills which many wizards /never/ master. Additionally, Hermione is having to work hard for her achievement, whereas by all accounts James Potter achieves his largely through natural talent.

A common response to all this is that JKR has called Hermione a genius in an interview.

Firstly, I'm not sure JKR's interpretation of a character is final, similar to if she declares Snape a hero. JKR gets to dictate the facts, but not the interpretation. And the facts are those above.

Secondly, I suspect that JKR would consider being in the top 5% an example of genius. When JKR calls Hermione a genius, she's not saying Hermione is a Dumbledore-level talent. She is simply referring to those traits listed above and describing them as genius i.e. she would say the same of Remus Lupin.

*None of this is intended to bash Hermione.* She's a great character. In particular, she has capacity to grow and adapt as a character. A Muggleborn, by GoF she is describing technology as a "replacement for magic". That capacity for change is admirable and makes her a joy to write.

But there's a certain group in the fandom who interpret portraying Hermione faithfully to canon as a form of bashing. That is unfortunate.

I have been accused of bashing Hermione in Victoria Potter. I don't think this is the case. Rather I portray Hermione faithfully to canon:

- I consistently portray Hermione as getting magic very quickly, to the point where she would easily be top of the class if Victoria were not around.

- I contrast Hermione's canonical approach to magical study - namely, rushing ahead to study more advanced magic ahead of time - with Victoria's approach of sticking with a topic and delving deep into it. It's a classic tortoise vs hare situation.

- I portray Hermione as capable of learning from her mistakes, whereas bashed characters are stuck in a loop of making the same errors again and again. When Victoria expresses her intuition as regards the workings of the Arrival of Happi (a potion), Hermione's initial reaction was to reject it as having no basis (it's not in their textbook). A bashed character would continue to reject that intuition even when faced with its success, but Hermione looks into the matter further on her own time.
