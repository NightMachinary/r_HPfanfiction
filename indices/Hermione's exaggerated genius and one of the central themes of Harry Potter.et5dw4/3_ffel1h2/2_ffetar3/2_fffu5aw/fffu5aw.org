  I don't know if that would fulfil a dictionary definition of "character bashing" (if one existed), but it would certainly feel like character bashing if I were to read a scene like that.

On the other hand, I would consider this to be the identifying characteristic of someone whose attachment to Hermione is no longer proportionate to her role in the story. That is, feeling like Hermione is being bashed when she is characterised canonically, on the basis that someone else is doing better than her.

Re: James vs Hermione, I think the comparison is more than fair. What my comparison doesn't mention, but that which is nonetheless absolutely clear in the books, is that James has that magical /je ne se quoi/ - that spark of magical specialness which cannot be defined but is nonetheless apparent to the reader. It's the factor which separates out people like Percy Weasley, in spite of their straight Os, from more /magical/ individuals like Harry or, say, Bill Weasley. And I think it's pretty apparent from the text that Hermione just doesn't have it.
