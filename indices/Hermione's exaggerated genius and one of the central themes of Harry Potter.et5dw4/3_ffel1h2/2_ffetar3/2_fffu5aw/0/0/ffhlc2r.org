  And yet, it's telling that fics that maintain him as the sole lead protagonist but move away from the canon-style conflict against canon-style Voldemort almost invariably give him a personality rewrite and a magic upgrade.

I think this is the key. Because if you correct the HP universe to be more grounded, where you don't win wars by virtue of being the good guy, then it makes sense to also correct Harry's characterisation to suit the new world.

Indeed, I would say that to change one without changing the other would be a form of bashing, much like when fanfics change the rules of magic so that Voldemort can access Privet Drive because he took Harry's blood in GoF, but don't change Dumbledore's actions to take account of this. Changes to the world *necessitate* corresponding changes in characterisation.

In canon, Harry is said to be Voldemort's equal. That is his role in the story: Voldemort's opposite number. Now, in the later parts of canon, magic ended up taking on a certain quasi-religious aspect, where those of moral upstanding are magically rewarded because they are good. To quote JKR:

#+begin_quote
  It is important to state that I always saw these kinds of magic (the very deepest life and death issues) as essentially un-scientific; in other words, there is no “Elder Wand + Lily's Blood = Assured Survival” formula. What count, ultimately, are Harry and Voldemort's own choices. They have each been given certain weapons and safeguards, but the power of these objects and past happenings lie in how they are understood, and how they are used or enacted upon. Harry has a deeper and truer understanding of the meaning of the objects and past events, but *his greatest powers, those that save him, are free will, courage and moral certainty*.

So Harry gets to come back to life at the end of DH because he was the good guy. When moral integrity and courage are sufficient to have magic favour you, then you can be considered Voldemort's equal without needing to achieve any particular competency.

Essentially JKR took the trope of authors giving their protagonists plot armour and actually made it a part of her magic system.

It wasn't always this way. For the first 3-4 books, at least, Harry was on a traditional hero's path, with his mastering of the Patronus and using it in such a powerful way a clear step in that direction, as was his ability to resist the Imperius and his defeating Voldemort in what was essentially a battle of magical strength.

So what happens when you come to write a fanfic and you don't want to give your characters plot armour? What happens if your fanfic HP universe is intended to be more grounded and realistic? What changes do you have to make to ensure that Harry occupies his correct role in this altered world, that of the Dark Lord's equal?

The obvious answer is that you need to make him more magically accomplished - "Tier 1".

So where fics "upgrade" Harry to be more magically talented than Hermione, I don't really consider this an upgrade at all. Rather, I consider it /restoring/ Harry to the position he always /should/ have occupied, had the Harry Potter universe not turned into a fable with Jesus!Harry.
