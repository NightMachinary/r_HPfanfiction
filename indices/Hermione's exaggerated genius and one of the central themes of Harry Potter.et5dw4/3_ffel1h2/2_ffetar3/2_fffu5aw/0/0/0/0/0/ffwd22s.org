Like I wrote above, I am well aware of this observation, and I sympathise with it. However, while we don't get to see the text of the prophecy until OotP, it was a part of the universe from the start, and we got overwhelming indications of the spirit of the story---that Harry would not be overcoming Voldemort with force or cunning---from the first book on. It was always a moral allegory and never a "typical heroic bildungsroman".
