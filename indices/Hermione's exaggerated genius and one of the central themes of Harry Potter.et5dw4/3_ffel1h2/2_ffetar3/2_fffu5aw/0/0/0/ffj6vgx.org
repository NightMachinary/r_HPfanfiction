This strikes me as an interesting philosophical digression that doesn't have much bearing on the main issues of the OP or any of the ancestor posts. For the sake of argument, let's suppose that you are correct and that in an indifferent universe, "Harry" (using that as a placeholder for Victoria Potter, etc.) is in some sense entitled to be better at magic than Hermione.

The form of bashing I had described has two components: upgrading the character /and/ rubbing the reader's face in it. The first does not entail the second. A Powerful!Harry writer---however justified---does not have to set up confrontations between "Harry" and Hermione nor direct contests of magical skill between them.

Nor would Hermione seek such confrontation. Much as I wish it were otherwise, canon!Hermione isn't actually very competitive. She likes to show off her knowledge, of course, but she doesn't generally resent others for being better at something than her, and she doesn't work very hard to catch up when they are. (Even the conflict around the HBP potion text was at least as much about what she saw as cheating and about Harry endangering himself and others with untested recipes.) Therefore, "Harry" can do his/her own thing, and Hermione can do her own thing in the background. There's no obligation to rub the reader's face in the upgraded protagonist's superiority unless the writer has something to prove.

Nor does your framework have any bearing on how we assess Hermione's inborn talents, "tiers", "je ne sais quoi", and how those compare to James's.

--------------

As an aside, the argument that an indifferent universe calls for different characters is a valid one. I have made arguments along similar lines myself, particularly when defending Dumbledore's decisions against bashers and conspiracists.

I have also seen the line of argument that Harry /should/ have been a better wizard before and can genuinely sympathise with it, and I've never seen it expressed quite so coherently. In the end, though, I don't buy the conclusion. There are many ways to address the problem of defeating Voldemort in an indifferent universe that stop short of replacing a canon character with what is, functionally, a powered-up OC and then refusing to cop to having done that.

In some sense, the solution of making "Harry" Tier 1 is self-defeating. It actually goes against the spirit of Trelawney's prophecy, IMO, since "Being Tier 1" is power that [Voldemort] knows all too well. (There are other interpretations of the prophecy, of course, but they tend to make "Harry" even less important.)

Once you're in an indifferent universe, and ignore the spirit of the prophecy (or, as in some fics, make the main antagonist someone other than Voldemort), "Harry" loses his or her claim to exclusive lead protagonisthood. Once that happens, it turns out that there are other canon characters that have interesting personalities and motivations that don't need a complete personality rewrite or a massive talent upgrade to be interesting lead protagonists and/or form an ensemble cast of near-equals.

Nor do I see it solving things, really. Suppose that "Harry" has Tier 1 talent and is to defeat Voldemort in an indifferent universe. Voldemort still has decades of experience and obscure magical knowledge, and so "Harry" needs to be beyond Tier 1 to catch up by the time he or she turns 17. A "mere" Tier-1 "Harry" needs some kind of a cheat---but if you are willing to introduce those, then you might as well give them to a canon-level Harry or to another character.
