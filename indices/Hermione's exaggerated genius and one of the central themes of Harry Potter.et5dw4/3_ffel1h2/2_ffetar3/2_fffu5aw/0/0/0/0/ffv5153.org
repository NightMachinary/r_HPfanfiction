  In some sense, the solution of making "Harry" Tier 1 is self-defeating. It actually goes against the spirit of Trelawney's prophecy, IMO, since "Being Tier 1" is power that [Voldemort] knows all too well. (There are other interpretations of the prophecy, of course, but they tend to make "Harry" even less important.)

But Trelawney's prophecy comes in in book 5, which as Taure says (and I agree ) is the point the story seems to take a sharp turn from a typical heroic bildungsroman into some sort of moral allegory with self sacrifice as the centrepiece.
