  On the other hand, I would consider this to be the identifying characteristic of someone whose attachment to Hermione is no longer proportionate to her role in the story. That is, feeling like Hermione is being bashed when she is characterised canonically, on the basis that someone else is doing better than her.

Taure, what have I done to you to make you disrespect me so?

I talk about your fic, being careful to provide context and lay out what I know and what I don't know, and judging by your response, my speculation was entirely correct. You reply, questioning my character, and you don't actually address any arguments or provide any evidence for the more questionable of your claims.

And, the thing is, even your characterisation of me is wrong. Yes, I think that canon!Hermione is a far more interesting a character than canon!Harry. There is a reason Harry gets a near-total personality rewrite and a talent upgrade so often: without Voldemort breathing down his neck, he has to be shoehorned into the lead protagonist role.

However, I am fair about it. Upgrading one character and not others is fine. Doing it in a way that alters the relevant canon dynamic between them /and/ rubbing the reader's face in it can easily cross the line into bashing or at the very least be cringeworthy.

In the tiny number of fics in which Hermione gets the upgrade and proceeds to usurp Harry's virtues and achievements, I cringe just as much. (I can cite a number of instances of this in /The Arithmancer/, if you'd like.)

  Re: James vs Hermione, I think the comparison is more than fair. What my comparison doesn't mention, but that which is nonetheless absolutely clear in the books, is that James has that magical je ne se quoi - that spark of magical specialness which cannot be defined but is nonetheless apparent to the reader. It's the factor which separates out people like Percy Weasley, in spite of their straight Os, from more magical individuals like Harry or, say, Bill Weasley. And I think it's pretty apparent from the text that Hermione just doesn't have it.

Vous ne savez pas quoi, mais je pense que je sais quoi.

We see these characters in vastly different contexts. To compare the two siblings, we (by which I mean "Harry") see Percy at Hogwarts, as an uptight, officious prefect, in a position of authority over Harry (and we all know how well Harry handles that), mocked by his far more congenial and gregarious younger siblings. Until the Battle of Hogwarts, we don't even see him doing any magic that I can recall. And, he chooses a boring, officious profession. Bill, on the other hand, we don't meet until he is years out of Hogwarts---years of focused professional development and experience in what sounds like an interesting, dangerous, /magical/ profession. He is, unlike Percy, fun and easygoing, and he mainly appears when there is magic to be done---or when it's time to romance a supernaturally beautiful woman. So, one gets the sort of familiarity that breeds contempt, and with the other, we get glimpses of a magical Indiana Jones.

Something similar applies to James and Hermione. We see Hermione at her best and at her worst, and we see not just her achievements but also her limitations, struggles, and failures. With James, we only get to see him as a "finished product", triumphant in a magical conflict, and we hear decade-old recollections by his friends and teachers of a man who died a hero. Even the bad parts of his character that we see---bullying---happen to be ones that emphasise power.

Nous connaissons Hermione, mais nous ne connaissons pas James.

Harry, being the point-of-view character; being driven by destiny; and being given unique powers, tools, and information, can't really be compared on "je ne sais quoi" to anyone else. And yet, it's telling that fics that maintain him as the sole lead protagonist but move away from the canon-style conflict against canon-style Voldemort almost invariably give him a personality rewrite and a magic upgrade.
