[[/u/Taure]] proposes to use observed achievements and accomplishments as indicators of "talent" or "genius", and specifically compared those of Hermione and James. This is a valid starting point, since we cannot measure those things directly. (So, if you want to complain about "dick measuring", complain to him.)

I pointed out that it's not a meaningful comparison without accounting for differences in circumstances, resources, and motivations, and I pointed out the specific differences in those that would have led James to have greater magical accomplishments than Hermione, even if their underlying "talents" were equal.

Dumbledore (and Voldemort and Grindelwald) are in a league of their own. Snape was something you just brought up, and we can have a separate discussion about that, time permitting.
