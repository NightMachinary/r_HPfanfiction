I don't think that your comparison of James and Hermione is very fair. In terms of the listed achievements,

- James didn't create the Marauder's Map; he co-created it with three others. Hermione had far less help than that from her friends.
- If we are going by Pottermore, Animagus transformation has little to do with magical skill and a lot to do with investment of time and resources---and, for vast majority of wizards, is not worth it unless one lucks into a useful form or has special circumstances. For that matter, he did it with two collaborators, and we have no idea what resources and assistance the four of them might have had from their half- and pureblood parents.
- Where are you getting that he achieved straight Os on his OWLs without studying? And, how many OWLs? (It's not on the Wiki, as far as I can tell.)

Also, there were a number of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that would have caused James to achieve higher magical prowess than Hermione, other things being equal, and few countervailing ones.

- James had few demands on his time outside of Quiddich. Hermione had either a Harry-related crisis or some campaign against injustice every year at Hogwarts but HBP.
- James had a good study group, with at least one equal collaborator and two decent ones to facilitate his achievements, as well as a bitter rival to motivate him to get better at combat magic. Hermione had none of that, and her friends were probably a net burden in terms of studying and getting /herself/ better at magic.
- James's hobbies that we know of---pranking in a magical school---were ones whose practice would improve his mastery of magic. Hermione's hobbies---history, activism---were not.

  But there's a certain group in the fandom who interpret portraying Hermione faithfully to canon as a form of bashing. That is unfortunate. I have been accused of bashing Hermione in Victoria Potter. I don't think this is the case. Rather I portray Hermione faithfully to canon:

I've read your Alexandra Potter series, and I've read myriad fics with this general premise, but I haven't read your Victoria Potter series, so I am speculating here... Would it be accurate to say that your Victoria Potter is some combination of being significantly more generally intelligent and/or talented in magic than canon!Harry; being significantly more curious, organised and driven than canon!Harry; being significantly more strategic and less impulsive than canon!Harry; and having significantly better social skills than canon!Harry---all without being meaningfully worse than canon!Harry in any of these areas?

Unless I am completely wrong, this upgraded!fem!Harry will have acquired many, perhaps all of Hermione's talents and virtues, without acquiring any of her flaws and disadvantages. Now, every time your upgraded!fem!Harry and canon-level!Hermione interact, the fact of how much better your fem!Harry is than Hermione---often at the very things that canon!Hermione was supposed to be good at---will be rubbed in the reader's face. Am I wrong?

I don't know if that would fulfil a dictionary definition of "character bashing" (if one existed), but it would certainly feel like character bashing if I were to read a scene like that.
