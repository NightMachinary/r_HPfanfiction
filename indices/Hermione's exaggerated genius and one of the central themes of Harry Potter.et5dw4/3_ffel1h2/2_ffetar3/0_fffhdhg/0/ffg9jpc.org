  One of the key differences between James and Hermione, and and you touched upon this, is that from what we understand James readily shared in creation and discovery with his friends. Hermione approached learning as a singular activity in which she hurried off to find an answer to bring back to her friends group. Harry, as well, was prone to doing this. These character traits aren't failings of other people or even failings of the characters. They just forever handicap where your potential is going to be.

I agree that a good study group would have benefited Hermione in particular, but I don't think lack of one was a consequence of the trio's character traits or attitudes as much as of their circumstances. Hermione had no equals or even near-equals that we know of in her year---and certainly not in her year in Gryffindor. The closest were actually Harry and Ron, and they had very little interest in learning magic over and above the curriculum, unless they had an immediate need.

Could they have gone bigger? Harry got ostracised by his House and the rest of Hogwarts at the drop of a hat, while a lot of what they did required utmost secrecy, with life and death at stake. With whom could they collaborate?

Meanwhile, James & Co. were conveniently sharing a dorm and had common interests and attitudes---or, at least, James and Sirius did, but Remus went along out of loyalty and Peter out of sycophancy. They could also be a lot more open about their activities: with the exception of the animagus transformation, the worst consequences of their secrets being revealed would be a foiled prank and a detention.

I don't think we have that much evidence that Lily and Snape collaborated on anything once they arrived at Hogwarts---and it would have been a logistical and social nightmare for them to do so---but absence of evidence is not evidence of absence in this case, so I don't think we can really say either way.

  It isn't until the fifth book that they start learning more advanced magic collaboratively, and this results in (excuse the terminology) a skill buff of sorts for the entire group.

Yes and no. Consider that if the trio just wanted to get /themselves/ better at DADA, they could have met in an unused classroom or the RoR whenever it was convenient, and maybe invited some upperclassmen known to be loyal and competent (Weasley Twins?) along to give them some pointers. They could have made far more progress in far less time and with far less risk. Instead, Hermione pushed---and Harry ultimately agreed---to spread the knowledge to two dozen others, at great cost in time and at a great risk to themselves.

Therefore, DA is in some sense an example of Hermione & Co. /sacrificing/ their own magical advancement in order to expand their circle of collaboration. Take it as you will.
