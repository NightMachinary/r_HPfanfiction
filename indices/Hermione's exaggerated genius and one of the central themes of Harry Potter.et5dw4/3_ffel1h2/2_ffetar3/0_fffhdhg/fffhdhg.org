  James didn't create the Marauder's Map; he co-created it with three others. Hermione had far less help than that from her friends.

One of the key differences between James and Hermione, and and you touched upon this, is that from what we understand James readily shared in creation and discovery with his friends. Hermione approached learning as a singular activity in which she hurried off to find an answer to bring back to her friends group. Harry, as well, was prone to doing this. These character traits aren't failings of other people or even failings of the characters. They just forever handicap where your potential is going to be.

We see that the generation of Harry and his parents got to the higher tier of magical excellence due to consistent collaboration. Magic wasn't a singular study for them. Snape and Lily were partners pushing each other to be better. The Marauders learned how to do everything they did with each other. Harry, Hermione, and Ron...learn things individually and then report back to the group. It isn't until the fifth book that they start learning more advanced magic collaboratively, and this results in (excuse the terminology) a skill buff of sorts for the entire group.

So Hermione is an exceptionally bright character, but she was always going to top out at a certain level simply because of the type of person she was. She's smart, but she lacks the social skill and learning style that has been shown to accelerate people to a higher tier of magic.
