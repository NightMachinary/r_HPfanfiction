It is my headcanon, that Grangers were Jewish (or perhaps even better family of her mother, so she would be a Halachic Jew). Perhaps in completely secularized way (religion itself is not the point in this argument, although I am a practising religion myself), but certainly in the cultural sense. My wife's ancestors were Jewish (completely secular), so I know a lot of people with such background, and I am always surprised how really different they are in their stress on education and learning. Learning is REALLY highly valued. Kind of like in the Hermione case.
