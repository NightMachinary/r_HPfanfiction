I am American, and you're right, it is possible to be a secret Jew, or even be a Jew and not know it. This happened for centuries in Spain with the Converso Jews. (Forcibly converted Jews who practiced Judaism in secret) I've heard stories about women who lit candles every Friday because their family had done it for generations, and not know why.
