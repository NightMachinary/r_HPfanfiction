Yes, an assimilated Jew is probably the better term. May I venture a guess, that you are from the United States? The situation there is as much I understand it slightly different then it is and especially it was here. There were many Jews before the War who self-identified themselves as Germans (mostly, I am from Czechia, and there were some Czech-speaking Jews, but most of them were German-speaking), they didn't even know where their synagogue is (sometimes, paradoxically, all the way until the Kristallnacht, when it was destroyed), and yet many things, like love for learning, being lawyers or doctors, remained. I am afraid that this kind of Jew was completely eliminated in the Holocaust. Not only physically (although, yeah, that as well), but also mentally. Suddenly, it was too obvious that the assimilation is not an option.
