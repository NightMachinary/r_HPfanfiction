Even secular Jews do not celebrate Christmas. Source: I am a Jew, and have lots of irreligious family members I see every now and then. But even they celebrate Channukah and come for passover. But perhaps you mean an assimilated Jew, who is only ethnically Jewish. But that would throw off your point because assimilated Jews do not identify as Jews in the first place, so Hermione would not be influenced by Jewish culture at all if that was the case.
