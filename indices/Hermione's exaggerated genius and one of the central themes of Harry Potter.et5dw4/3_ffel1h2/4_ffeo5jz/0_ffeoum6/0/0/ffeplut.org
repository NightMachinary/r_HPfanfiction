Still doesn't explain her celebration of christmas. If she had even partial Jewish heritage, she would have mentioned it at some point, or possibly have developed more of a relationship with the only confirmed Jewish student in Hogwarts, Anthony Goldstein. While we're on the subject, JKR put antisemitic tropes into cannon, (goblin bankers, only Jew has surname Goldstein etc) So it's extremely unlikely she at all contemplated Hermione being Jewish.
