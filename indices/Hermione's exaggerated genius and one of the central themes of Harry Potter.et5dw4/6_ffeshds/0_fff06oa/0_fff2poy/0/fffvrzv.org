It was like, two weeks before his birthday if I'm remembering canon correctly. So mid-July. That's not really much prior. Let's say the letters only come the summer of the year that the student turns 11. Hermione and everyone else born later in the year (Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec) are still at an advantage to get more practice down.
