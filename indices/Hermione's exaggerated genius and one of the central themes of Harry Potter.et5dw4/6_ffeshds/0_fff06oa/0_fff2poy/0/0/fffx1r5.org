Why would the letters come the summer the student turns 11 as opposed to the summer of the first year the student is eligible to attend? Sending the letters to any student who turns 11 in the summer of that year makes it so that any student whose birthday falls after September 1st but before the end of the year would have to wait around a year before actually attending.

Wouldn't it make more sense to send letters to students who are, or will be, 11 by September 1st? Hermione's birthday is September 19th, so she just misses the cutoff. It simply doesn't make sense from an administration standpoint to send a letter to a student ineligible to attend until the next year.

The eligibility batch runs by the school year, not the calendar year.
