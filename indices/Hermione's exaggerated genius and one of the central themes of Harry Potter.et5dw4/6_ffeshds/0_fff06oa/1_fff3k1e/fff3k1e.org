Huh really, I could have sworn all students got the letter at the same time. Sorry must not be remembering it incorrectly.

Yeah if that was the case it could be explained by just dedication and she would not have to be genius; easily above average as she still had no guidance but yeah not a genius.

Then again she has accomplished some other things that are mind boggling.

- There is third year in which she took four electives on top of all the core subjects, and also researched the wizarding world's legal framework on her own without anyone with knowledge of the law to help her. She did this to save Buckbeak.

I am studying business law and it is incredibly frustrating with some of the examples for a particular section contradicting what other sections say. It is really hard to navigate without someone to help. And she still did so as a fourteen year old. Given she had a time turner but still.

- Fourth year she helped Harry survive the tournament. She was working as hard as Harry but was not exempted from the tournament and started SPEW.
- Fifth year she helped run the DA and the SPEW, was a prefect and still managed to get 9 O's and 1 E in DADA. In fact the only person we know to have outperformed her in her year is Harry who got O in DADA 5 E's and 1 A, P and D. Ron's result was same as Harry but he got an E in DADA.

The only people known to have gotten more OWL's than her are Percy, Bill, Barty Crouch.

I am not saying that others like Lily, Tom, Albus and the like couldn't have outscored her, we just don't know. So from what we have seen she definitely is really smart academically and unless wizards and witches are a lot smarter than normal people (going by canon they should not be) Hermione is really a Genius to have accomplished some of the stuff that she has.

Or she could have had Eidetic memory allowing her to retain all the knowledge she read and as most of the spells are just memorization of wand movements and incantation this would give her even a bigger leg up on her peers.

*Edit-* I completely forgot about the polyjuice potion she brew in 2nd year. She must have been really talented to have made a NEWT level potion on her first try after only one year of study. Or she could have been genius to have studied at least five years worth of potions in one year. Either scenario proves just how brilliant she was.
