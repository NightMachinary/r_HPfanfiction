Honestly to me she looks like a Genius. I was a 10 pointer student but I honestly don't think that I could have actually learned a year's worth of study material in a month and a half on my own and without the guidance of a teacher.

She practically learned all the study material and additional books before entering Hogwarts. And she actually learned it completely. Harry had also read all of his books and he was not able to answer questions at the drop of the hat in potions while Hermione knew all the answers. If not a genius then she would have to have an extremely good long term memory.

I could without anyone's help; maybe learn that year's worth of Mathematics in that amount of time but even that is a stretch because I am going to hit parts I would struggle with. And it's my best subject.

Hermione learnt the whole course material for her year without any help in a time period I would have struggled to do the same in my best subject. Maybe I was just a really dumb student and what Hermione accomplished is normal but IMHO she is a genius.
