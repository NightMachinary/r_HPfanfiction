I agree though I will make a couple of points.

Firstly- I blame the movies. (And especially David Yates) Hermione is even smarter there and Ron got the short end of the stick. And I think that tv series and movies are more visually stimulating. So people remember a scene from a movie more easily than, say, lines from a book. (Which brings a whole new set of problems when people start confusing the *character* Hermione Granger and the *actress* Emma Watson. But that's a whole other can of worms.)

  Hermione isn't an innate genius, she /chooses/ to dedicate herself to learning.

I've seen this sentiment several times and I agree. "Talent" or "innate genius" is often the result of long hours of hard work and not a given. Sometimes being consistent and hardworking can be better than having a "natural talent" and being inconsistent.

That being said, I still like Hermione. There is just something attractive about powerful and/ or vengeful witches like Morrigan from Dragon Age and Yennefer from The Witcher. For examples in fanfiction I like "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12548804/1/Lord-Hermione][Lord Hermione]]" and "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11388837/1/Adorable-Violence][Adorable Violence]]".
