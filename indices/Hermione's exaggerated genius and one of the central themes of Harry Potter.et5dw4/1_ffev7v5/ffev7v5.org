One nitpick:

#+begin_quote
  When she takes all the classes with the time turner, she gets 6 hours extra a day and still doesn't have time to do anything but study.

She also takes the time to master a completely foreign legal system just from reading books in a library, and without any help from a wizard legal expert.

One thing worth keeping in mind when gauging Hermione's talent is that her highest priority is not magical prowess or even magical knowledge. If it were those, she'd be in Slytherin or Ravenclaw, respectively. Instead, she always prioritises fighting for justice and helping others---whether it's Harry, Buckbeak, house-elves, or her classmates---over her own advancement.

She spends a lot of time studying, yes, and she often learns spells far ahead of the curriculum; but she also studies academic subjects like Ancient Runes (which is basically a language class), and reads obscure history books for fun.

I think that there is a general tendency in the fandom to treat Hermione's achievements in magic as being the full extent of her potential, whereas treating, say, Harry's achievements as just the beginning---that he could have been vastly more powerful had he just worked harder; but we forget just how much time Hermione had spent helping Harry and others get better at magic, getting little in return.
