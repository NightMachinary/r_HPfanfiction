Yeah, I think people are misinterpreting me as saying Hermione isn't very very smart, my point was that her intelligence comes more from dedication and /wanting/ it than with being so naturally talented that it comes easily. I can see it being within interpretation, but I'd guess she was smarter than the marauders, for instance.

(Actually, that might just be canon, as the oft misquoted Lupin line is that Hermione is the smartest witch of her age he's ever met, and that would presumably include a 14 year old James)
