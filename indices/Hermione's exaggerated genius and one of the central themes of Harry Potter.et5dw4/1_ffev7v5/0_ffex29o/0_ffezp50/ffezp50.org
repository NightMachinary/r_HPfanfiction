I think that /most/ people, when they talk about "intelligence" of a student in a school, are referring to talent, IQ, and other traits that are at least supposed to not be very mutable (or, more precisely, there are things, like infant lead exposure, that can reduce them, but one can't do much to increase them). Also, as far as I can tell, eidetic memory isn't actually a proven phenomenon for healthy adults.

Me, I think it's both, and canon gives us quite a bit of leeway. Hermione /is/ naturally gifted, and she works hard---though not always on things that increase her magical ability. One can try to tease nature apart from nurture, but that's an open problem even at the population level, and for Hermione in particular, we get a few early bits of evidence of extraordinary raw talent, and after that we can't tell how much of it is hard work. (I am referring to her being able to cast spells solely based on reading about them before she even started Hogwarts, and that her first Transfiguration during the first lesson was better than anyone's.)

From the point of view of fanfic, the number of readable fics in which Hermione's is portrayed as an actual genius /and/ her genius has actual plot impact beyond the first few chapters is small. There are many more fics in which Hermione invents something that kickstarts the plot and then never does anything interesting again; or in which she researchers a power-up for Harry and fades into the background. The number of fics in which Hermione translates her intelligence into magical power is tiny.

I get a bit more annoyed by so-called smart!Harry fics, in which Harry gets a personality and talent rewrite that gives him (or her, if fem!Harry) all of Hermione's virtues and talents but none of her flaws and disadvantages, then flaunts how much better this upgraded!Harry is than Hermione.
