But there's some inconsistencies with Hermione's characters in the book too. As you say, she shows she puts in a lot of work to learn, but in other books - especially beginning in book 5 - her character slightly changes to include things like eidetic memory.

For instance, in the beginning of book 5 she is able to recite Dumbledore's end of year speech post the triwizard tournament /word for word/. It's inconsistent that she retains knowledge like a normal person when it comes to textbooks, but is able to remember and recite a speech word for word after hearing it once.

Ron even points this out in the book! - he remembers the gist of what Dumbledore said in his speech but points out how odd it was that she was able to pull lines of his speech from memory.

There's other little bits of this that occur in the later books where she has this perfect memory /when the situation necessitates it./

And I think these changes happened because the movies started before Rowling started writing book 5 - so I think her characterizations were influenced from the movies and the casting choices and even fanon to some extent. Especially since she said she never reread her books.

You can see a shift in the characters when you compare the earlier books to the later books - they were once consistent between book 1-4 but lost that consistency starting with book 5. And I think the inconsistencies are more than just the characters being older in the later books.
