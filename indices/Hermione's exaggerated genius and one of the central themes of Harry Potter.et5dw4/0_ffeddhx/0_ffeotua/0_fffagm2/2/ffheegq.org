I'd rather see a fic where /all/ characters go transhumanist (transwizardist?), and it's a part of the setting. I wrote down some ideas along these lines a while ago, but I don't feel up to writing the fic. Here's the basic premise.

It's implied in (or at least consistent with) canon that injury inflicted Dark Arts tends to be irreversible. A corollary of that is that trying to magically alter another person in a /beneficent/ way over and above their baseline state doesn't stick. So, for example, if Pomfrey magically upgraded someone's muscles to have superhuman strength, they'd pretty quickly "heal" back to their baseline human musculature. This makes for the setting's defining element: magical enhancement ("transwizardism") only works if /self-inflicted/.

As a result, all children when they enter Hogwarts start at baseline human level, and Hogwarts has a class, alongside Charms and Transfiguration, on how to alter oneself safely (or at least not too dangerously). Everybody is expected to apply those skills to themselves under teachers' supervision as they progress through Hogwarts. Indeed, starting from third year or so, a typical baseline human may well be fundamentally incapable of keeping up with the curriculum. Along the way, students have to make choices about which self-enhancements they will attempt and when, keeping in mind the risks involved every step of the way.

Some technique developers offer services where they teach a self-enhancement technique, have the customer perform it, and then Obliviate them of the memory of the technique. Wit-Sharpening Potions and the like are used heavily, though usually saved for special occasions due to side-effects. False Memory Charms are sometimes used to transfer knowledge and teach skills, though each application needs to be individualised. Magical prosthetics a la Moody's eye are used by many.

Of course, some families have their own secret techniques for "self-improvement" as well, and some self-alterations involve Dark Arts, human sacrifice, or prices to be paid by the subject. Horcruxes and how to make and destroy them is public knowledge, but after a millennia-long arms race, they are a useful, but not an overwhelming tool, especially considering the costs. The Werewolf Contaigion is a result of someone a few centuries prior trying to make the animagus ability hereditary. They turned out to have side-effects and be contagious instead.

Of course, what's the point of a setting without a plot? I don't have one, though I guess just building on a skeleton of canon events could work. Specifically,

- Voldemort, who's come up with some clever applications of horcruxes, gets discorporated when attacking Harry as a baby. (Potterverse magic like sacrificial protection still works.)
- He is trying to get his body back. Due to the number of self-enhanced geniuses running around, Philosopher's Stones can actually be bought on the open market. But, they are still very expensive, and getting through security measures of those who can afford them is extremely challenging.
- One of Voldemort's earlier attempts at immortality was an upload of his memories able to interface with existing minds. It unleashes something nastier than a basilisk. Because, you see,

  - A mere canon!basilisk couldn't evade Hogwarts's professors with their lifetimes of self-enhancement.
  - A mere canon!basilisk couldn't challenge a tricked-out 6th-year Prefect like Penelope Clearwater when she knows about its capabilities. Mind you, Penny, befitting a Ravenclaw, had prioritised cognitive enhancements over physical. As a result, the rate at which she can cast spells that she can't cast wandlessly is limited by how quickly she can move her hands, which are still fairly close to baseline human.
  - Nonetheless, Ginnymort has to personally intervene to defeat her and Hermione (who's been climbing the transwizard ladder faster than anyone in her year).
  - Sword of Gryffindor is a lot more than an indestructible sword. It actually melds with the wielder's mind and body and does the fighting for them. In its final mode, it tends to leave the wielder on the brink of death, and it takes immediate medical treatment or phoenix tears to keep them from succumbing.
  - Ginny suffers long-term effects of possession, particularly because Diary!Tom had her rush self-enhancements that are on one hand very powerful for her age, but on the other hand not well calibrated. Nor is she ever completely cleared of his influence.

- The simulated Hell that is Azkaban does not hold Sirius, because it is designed to interface with human minds, not canine. Remus---a secret carrier of the Werewolf contagion---teaches Defence. Hippogryphs are a cross-breeding experiment that had escaped into the wild.
- Transwizard Tournament happens. Harry gets roped into it, and Barty Crouch Jr.---or, rather, his brain transplanted into Alastor Moody's magicyborg body---helps him along.

  - In order to accurately emulate Moody's behaviour in front of Hogwarts's hyperintelligent professors, BCJ keeps Moody's brain is in a jar in his trunk, trapped in a virtual reality simulation. Its inputs are piped in from the sensors on the magicyborg, and its outputs are piped back to BCJ's brain to give him some idea of what Moody would say and do in that situation.
  - There are several close calls, as Moody repeatedly discovers that he had been kidnapped and tries to skew his responses to trick BCJ into doing something that would expose him. But BCJ is good enough to improvise, and then Obliviates Moody's brain and keeps going.
  - To keep up with the tournament, Harry has to take some risky temporary enhancers, which last long enough for him to escape the Graveyard (or its analogue), but the withdrawal requires him to be isolated from magic for the subsequent two months.

And so on.
