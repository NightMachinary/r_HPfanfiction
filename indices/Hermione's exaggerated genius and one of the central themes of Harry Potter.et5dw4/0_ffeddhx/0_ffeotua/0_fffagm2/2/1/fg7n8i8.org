More ideas:

- Time-turners either don't exist or never appear. However, students wanting to take more classes than chronologically possible can be cloned and taught a technique for resynchronising mental states between clones. This form of cloning has severe limitations, however. The clones share a soul, and it's an unnatural state of affairs, so it can become stressful. In particular,

  - If both clones try to do magic at the same time, the result can be severe damage to the soul.
  - Some curses---the Unforgivables in particular---will affect every clone if they hit any clone. As a result, having a clone stashed away in a safe location isn't that good a security measure if someone really wants to kill you.
  - Spells exist that if cast on a person who has live clones will give an indication of how many there are and where. (Similar but much more difficult magic exists for horcruxes.)
  - The difficulty of self-enhancement grows exponentially when there are clones of you around, since they need to receive identical enhancements or soul damage can happen.
  - Horcruxes can be used to work around some of these limitations.
  - As a result, it is usual to make a clone for, say, a research project or for taking more classes than chronologically possible, resynchronise periodically, then have one of the clones (often determined by coin toss) autoeuthanise when the project is finished or when self-enhancement needs to be done.
  - As a social convention, clones are expected to designate one (usually determined by coin toss after every resynchronisation) as the "main" clone, who carries the wand and engages in the social interactions, while the others are expected to stay out of everybody's way, emerging only when attending classes, researching in the library, etc..
  - So, indeed, for most of their Hogwarts career, there are two Hermiones, two Percys, and two of various other ambitious students running around, though they are rarely seen together.

- Animagus transformations are very rarely used not because they are difficult but because unlike most self-enhancement magic, it doesn't get quicker or easier with more self-enhancement. No matter how good one is, animagus magic takes up a huge amount of time during which one can do very little else. Nobody has been able to come up with a way to reduce that time (and one such attempt produced the Werewolf Contagion).
