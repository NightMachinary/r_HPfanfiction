Peeves didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He realized that there was a chance, a fairly large chance, that his place as the biggest prankster of all the spectres of Hogwarts had now been significantly threatened. On the other hand, he would no longer be the sole target of the Bloody Baron's wrath. Trepidatiously, he also wondered if he might, finally, have a kindred spirit with whom to wreak havoc on the denizens of the castle.

“Fred Weasley? A Hogwarts ghost?” he sputtered.

“In the flesh! Rather, in the echo plasm, actually, you get my drift, yeah?”

“ Will you be Peeves' friend and ally in tormenting the folk of Hogwarts castle, Fred Weasley?”

“You can dispense with my last name, old chap. Just ‘Fred' works for me. I haven't pranked this school since George and I created that swamp during Umbridge's time here as Grand inquisitor or whatever she called herself.”

“What shall we do first, to initiate Fred We---Fred, into ephemeral pranking?” queried Peeves.

“I have an idea, friend Peeves. Figured we could start small, me being new to ghostly existence and all. Let's mess with Dumbledore's portrait!”

“That's a plan I can get behind, friend Fred, uh, Fred.”

“I have an idea; come on!”

Soon, the new partners in prank were in the Headmaster's office, having drifted past the guardian Gargoyle, to which Fred made an obscene gesture as they passed.

“ I like your style!” said the poltergeist.

“Then wait until you see this!”

Fred handed Peeves what appeared to be a Muggle rifle. “No, Fred!” The poltergeist cowered for perhaps the first time in his lengthy existence. “The Baron will have my arse! He'll think I put you you up to this!”

“Just wait, Peeves.” Fred demonstrated the power of a paintball gun, firing a green and silver splotch of,paint and hitting Dumbledore square in his sleeping face. “Amazing!” Peeves gushed. Let me try, Fred!”

The Weasley twin handed the paintball gun to Peeves. “Hit him; he's awake now.”

“Peeves, please reconsider, my boy. Defaced, my portrait will not hold the degree of distinction that it merits,” Dumbledore pleaded.

“And?”

Peeves aimed and fired, sending a jet of orange paint at at Dumbledore's crooked nose. “Owww, Minerva! Baron!” Dumbledore cried, hoping help would arrive.

Fred and Peeves high-fived each other, and gave Dumbledore obscene gestures as they floated through the door. “Show me your rooms , Peeves. We have planning to do.”
