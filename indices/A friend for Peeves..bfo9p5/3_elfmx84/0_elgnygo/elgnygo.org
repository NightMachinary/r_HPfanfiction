I'll give it a whirl:

Fred and Peeves floated through the gargoyle, gleeful in their success at defacing Headmaster Dumbledore's portrait. Fred relished the exhilaration of mischief, so sorely missed. How many times had he led George down these very halls in their attempts to cement their place in history as Troublemakers-in-Chief?

Of course, George had had a bit of a habit of keeping him grounded. Just a little bit. Making sure the pranks stayed legal. Mostly. And George was the one who used the Marauder's Map most. Not that Fred would need the Map now, of course. Harry would have it...or possibly Harry would have passed it down. To Teddy, maybe? Only right for the Son of Prongs to pass it down to the Son of Moony.

Caught in these not-particularly-pranking thoughts, Fred didn't notice that he and Peeves were about to walk right into Filch until it almost too late. And Peeves had used the paintball gun on a dozen different portraits and three suits of armor.

Peeves wasn't sharing the paintball gun? After all the work Fred had done to get it?

"Peeves!" Filch shouted. His eyes narrowed when he saw the paintball gun. "Graffitiing the fine works of art of Hogwarts? Oh this will be recorded! And I shall summon the Baron, oh yes I will!"

Peeves shot Filch in the chest with a pink paintball.

"Peeves will not allow you to spoil his fun with his friend! No he won't! No he won'!"

"Augggh! I will see you exorcised for this, Peeves!"

Exorcisms? Well, that didn't sound like very much fun at all. Fred decided to make himself known. He had hoped to wait for a bigger reveal, but eh, even with an eternal afterlife, there was no time like the present.

"Hey, Filchy. Did you miss me?"

"WEASELY?!" Filch shrieked in fear. "Here?! How?!" His eyes widened in shock and outrage. "No! No! It cannot be! You died!"

"What, so just because I'm dead, I can't visit my friends?" Fred grinned. "I missed you, Filchy. Can I have a hug?"

"No!"

"But I missed you! Peeves, don't you think Filch needs a hug?"

"Oh yes. Always so grouchy he is, oh yes! A big one!"

Filch screamed something that sounded vaguely like "Mummy!" and tore down the corridor waving his hands in the air.

The chase was on! Fred whooped with joy and he could hear Peeves cackling as they soared down the halls.
