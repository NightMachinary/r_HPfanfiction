Not really, sometimes I do, specially when it can add something new to the fic. But sometimes like the fics with Slytherin Harry are pretty easy to predict, like it's going to be a paragraph where Harry will realize that Slytherin is everything that he wants, it can be because of having friends, power or vengeance.

Most of these don't have any original content, sometimes the songs are fine when they just dropped you a little hint that in the moment you don't realize and at the end you're like omg that was what the hat was saying. But those are really rare
