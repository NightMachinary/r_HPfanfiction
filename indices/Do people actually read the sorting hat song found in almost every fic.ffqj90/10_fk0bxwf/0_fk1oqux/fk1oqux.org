...in my Last Mage HP fics, I came up with a couple of original songs for the second year onwards. Year 3 was set to the tune of American Pie and the Year 4 song to Bohemian Rhapsody, both promptly lampshaded.

The problem with original songs isn't just rhyming, it's getting it to scan as well, hence why I used existing music to guide me. Even then, it took longer to get those songs usable than writing not only the rest of the chapter but the next two chapters combined!
