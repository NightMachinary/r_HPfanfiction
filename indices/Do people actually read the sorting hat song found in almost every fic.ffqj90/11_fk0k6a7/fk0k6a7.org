I find that for in-universe poetry or song, it's usually hard to read. That's particularly true in fanfiction, since the quality of those often leaves a lot to be desired - but I find it hard to read those in most every book. I don't find them particularly fitting, either - if they have a point it'll be rehashed over by the characters at another point, and if it doesn't it's just a wall of text that could be condensed to a line about the hat (or whoever) singing.

That's just me, though (particularly for the non-fanfiction songs)
