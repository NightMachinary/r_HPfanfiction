Not with the pairing, but I think you'd need to find a reason for Dudley to interact with the magical world at all (or Pansy to interact with the muggle one enough to meet Dudley).

I vaguely remember a fic where Dudley got bit by a werewolf during the year in the safehouse his family was in. But like, something like that to drag him into the world he fears so much.
