If the (widely shared, not certain if canonical) idea that Dudley started his conversion to be truly normal after the meeting with dementors leads to anywhere, then I always believed that morally upright Dudley would be a policeman. That would a) utilize his figure and boxing abilities, b) make an interesting link between him and Harry (both being law officers; perhaps Dudley could work as some kind of muggle police liaison?), c) lead fast to Vernon's cardiac arrest (his son working for government!). Pairing with Pansy would be interesting in such case, but I have always rooted for Dudley/Cho ship, sorry (I liked linkao3(651870)).
