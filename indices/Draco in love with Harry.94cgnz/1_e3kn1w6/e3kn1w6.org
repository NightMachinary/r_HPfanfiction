I don't remember the name--- posting in case someone else remembers based on the description. It was a slow burn, almost canon fic from Draco's POV where he had a crush on Harry at Hogwarts, especially sweaty athlete Harry. But was too self loathing to admit it. But then one holiday they sit together at a meal and eat bacon sandwiches and share snarky humor and end up kind of making out . It was sweet and funny and light compared to so much fic so i remember it, even a few years later.
