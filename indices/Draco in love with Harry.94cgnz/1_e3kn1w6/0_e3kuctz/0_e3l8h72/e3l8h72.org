Couple questions:

Do you think any romance is horrible, corny and cliche, or is it only icky if it's slash?

Why would you click on this topic if you despise slash?

This one is really more of an observation. I don't think you can judge the quality of a piece of writing based on a plot summary. The plot isn't the point . Unless you are one of looking to scratch a specific itch (must be time travel Lupin / Luna romance , no Harry, over 300,000 words). In which case I don't know what to say to you.
