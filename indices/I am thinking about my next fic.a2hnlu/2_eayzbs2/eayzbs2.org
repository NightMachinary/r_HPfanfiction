I have a few ideas:

1) How about a story in which Ginny keeps ALL of Diary Riddle's memories and powers? She takes the lead in fighting Voldemort and makes Harry awesome at same time. She, not some Deus Ex Machina, is the “power he knows not”. The good guys should obviously suffer far fewer losses under such scenario.

2) Still postwar, but Harry and Ginny are forced on a big dimensional travel by accident. They encounter all kinds of alternative realities and have to use all their wits and powers to survive. You can even use worlds created in other fanfics.

3) This idea is inspired by Esama's [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/205025][Island of Fire series]]. Basically, they are marooned on a remote Pacific island and have to find their way back. With magic, they have of course a lot easier than Muggles in similar situations, but I still think the challenges are formidable.

4) Inspired by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13111277/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Secret-of-Atlantis][Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis]], linkffn(13111277), but instead of Harry/Hermione and Ron as the main cast, it will be Harry/Ginny with Bill/Fleur.
