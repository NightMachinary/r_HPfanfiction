Also, since you seem to be active in [[/r/HarryandGinny]], why not write something set after the war where the Weasleys are not coping well with the loss of Fred and Ginny can't take the atmosphere at the Burrow anymore. She runs off to Grimmauld as soon as Harry and Hermione are back from Australia (R/Hr had one kiss but that's it, Molly made Ron swear an oath not to leave or maybe he was too deep in his own grief to care about Hermione).

Hermione decides to wing-girl for Harry and organises them a nice evening out in London, maybe add some culture shock for Ginny at the cinema or some ridiculous date idea the pair ditches because only Hermione thinks people would enjoy it. Perhaps they have a few shots and tell each other about their wartime experiences or Ginny finally gets to grief on her own and Harry comforts her.

You could throw Andromeda and Teddy into the mix (just keep in mind that Andromeda would be between 42 and 47, so not the frail grandmother fanfics often turn her into). Or they somehow run into Lavender who has trouble coping with her injuries.

Overall just something which shows that not "everything was well", but there is some ray of hope even if you are neck-deep in the shit life has thrown at you. That having someone who shoulders the burden with you can be a huge help.

Maybe things get hot and heavy when Hermione walks in. Harry is obviously mortified but Hermione just looks at them before turning around and gives some advice as she walks out ("use another finger/your tongue"/"gently bite it"/"try nibbling on her throat").

Or you could turn that idea into a Harry/Ginny/Hermione story by having Ginny join into an established but casual relationship between Harry and Hermione which has been born out of a need for comfort, closeness and any kind of positive human emotion during the hunt. And the war/Hermione's parents only further fueled that need and Ginny is in a similar situation, feeling as if all her family had died during the battle because no one is their former self.
