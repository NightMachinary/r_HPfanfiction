Ginny is a healer. Harry is an Autor. They never met at school. He's always coming for life threatening accidents from his job, Ginny always patches him right back up.

Not sure what the plot would be, but I think that dynamic would be kind of fun. You could have the added drama of forbidden love because Healers might not be able to date their patients, especially if they see them regularly.
