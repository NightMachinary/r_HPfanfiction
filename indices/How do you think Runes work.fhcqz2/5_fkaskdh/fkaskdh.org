In canon, they just seem to be an old written language - kinda like Latin or Greek electives you could take in secondary school. In the same way, Arithmancy seems to be math + divination. But that characterization is a bit odd (eg, if it is just learning the names of the old norse runes, then the professor is garbage). Then again, the pensieve /does/ have runes around its outside, and runes are associated with magic.

However, both of those are boring IMO. I think the fanon of runes being a way to 'write' magic, or help anchor enchantments in, opens it up to a lot of interesting aspects. Runic magic could be less flexible (due to having to work within the runes), slower, but last longer - and perhaps allow for more complex enchantments by taking a long time and carefully layering on runes. It could also act more like an anchor sometimes - helping to keep an enchantment stable and connected to the item it's meant to, or anchoring wards, etc.

For the background of the runes, I like the idea of them having just emerged more from repeated use/belief - eg, ancient Norse runes would have gained their associations through having been used for centuries as magic, kinda like how I imagine a lot of the latin phrases for spells end up historically out. Another interesting approach there would be to tie it into astronomy - maybe adding in a veneer of runes being derived from constellations and thus conduits for magic somehow?

In any case, I find it being a branch of magic far more interesting than just a language - but it shouldn't be the foundation/base of all magic, and it should have disadvantages compared to wand magic.
