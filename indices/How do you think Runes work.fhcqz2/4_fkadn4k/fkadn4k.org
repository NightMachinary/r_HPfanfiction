My headcanon has always been that Runes are for long-term enchantments. For example, the curses in the Egyptian Pyramids wouldn't just be caused by a spell, but via engraving Runes into parts of the tombs and casting curses into the Runes, so that they activate when triggered. Or the cursed necklace we see in CoS and HBP would have needed to be cursed the same way rather than someone just casting a curse on it.

Canonically, however, it's more likely that standard curses and charms are used to enchant places and objects, and Ancient Runes is just a language class. Like how Arithmancy is just Divination using math and not spell creation or anything like that.
