Ive always thought of them like the written forms of incantations. You say the incantion and add magic, stuff happens. You write the incantation and add magic, stuff happens. The benefit of runes being that the "incantation" is permentantly being said sonlong as the rune remains intact allowing you to make magic that sticks around for a long time, possible even forever.
