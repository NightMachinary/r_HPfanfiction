I like it when they serve an actual purpose.

My headcanon has always been that Runes and Arithmancy are basically "advanced magical theory", and that they have uses in most areas of magic. For instance, stirring a potion in a runic shape, or perhaps a runic sentence, has predictable effects. The pattern and number of stirs can be discovered using arithmancy and perhaps a splash of astronomy should the potion require it (wolfsbane, for instance, or Veritaserum, which is said to require a full lunar cycle)

Additionally, I like to believe that runes can basically anchor a charm to an item, by perhaps inscribing the incantation, or a sentence describing the effect, with the alphabet used depending on the items cultural origin (so a vyking-inspired enchanted axe would need futhark, while an enchanted khopesh would need ancient egyptian hieroglyphs.) the difficult part is discovering the best alphabet for the item used - you have to research a ton to get the best result, by for example respecting the details unique to the hieroglyphs and grammar used in egypt when that particular khopesh design was invented.

Arithmancy is numerology, and it can be used to accurately predict the future - that means it can be used to basically "discover" the incantation of a spell. You input your spell, all its details broken down of course, into a complex formula. The unknown details are substituted with variables, and then tweaked until the calculation says it will work. These formulas are ridiculously complex, and jealously guarded by the families of spellcrafters, creating a sort of artificial scarcity because people are greedy. This difference in approaches also explains why there are definite "trends" in the incantations we see. (Stupefy, for example, is just a word in english, same as Pack. Legilimens, Locomotor Mortis and so on are faux latin, while Alohomora is another language all together.)
