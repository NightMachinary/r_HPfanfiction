My preference. I think that Runes were invented by Germanic wizards in a pre Roman era and spread through germanic and nordic areas. When Roman conquerors took most of Europe they supplanted Runic magic with wand and incantation magic. Only nordic countries maintained the runes as the basis of their magic.

British use of runes is like a novelty. They were introduced/reintroduced by the Vikings, though British wizards having been heavily Romanticized by this point don't consider them essential. Runes are powerful enough to be a foundational magic system for enchanting, warding, and foretelling the future, but Hogwarts and other Roman based magical countries don't fully see that.
