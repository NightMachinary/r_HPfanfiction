Not necessarily. Runes being complex/annoying, and less convenient than wand magic, could still have them be magical without everyone having (or wanting) to take them.

It's like how potions seems to be, in the books, almost entirely just following the directions - vs designing/experimenting with new ones. Runic magic to me seems like it'd need more time to use than wand magic, and is probably more inflexible - so in day to day life, just having a wand is more than enough.

But you're right about canon - it doesn't appear to be too much more than a latin/greek analogue for the WW, even if I find that rather boring.
