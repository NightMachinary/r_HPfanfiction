Canonically, Runes are just a language using Elder and Younger Futhark taught at Hogwarts. Its the equivalent of teaching Latin or Greek at many boarding schools in Europe in the last couple centuries. It doesn't possess any magical principles or abilities.

Besides, the problem with Runes in most fanfiction is that to try and make them more useful the authors tend to weaken or diminish normal magic (i.e. wand magic, wandless magic, potions, etc.). This almost always goes hand-in-hand with everyone being implied (explicitly or otherwise) as dumb or foolish for not learning them, or is a way to make X-character look smarter/competent/awesome than everyone else. Not always mind you, but its more common than not. You can mostly blame jbern for that one, but its hard to when his fics are admittedly pretty entertaining if dated.
