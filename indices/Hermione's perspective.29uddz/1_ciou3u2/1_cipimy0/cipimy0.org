For some reason, I had completely blanked on two more fics, these involving sending information back through time:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8127137/1/Palimpsest][Palimpsest]] by Larry Huss: Future!Hermione sends a telegram back through time. Recommended without reservation. Just updated, as it happens.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5724097/1/Kick-in-the-arse-of-the-Wizarding-World][Kick in the Arse of the Wizarding World]] by Alrissa: Also Hermione sending a stuff to her past self, maybe a little too much of a good thing, but a very fun read, branching out in interesting ways.
