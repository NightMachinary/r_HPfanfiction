Off the top of my head, here are some fics that are mostly in Hermione's perspective, Hogwarts years category, that I've enjoyed or am enjoying:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]] by AlphaEph19 (Point of view shared with Harry, but mostly Hermione for now.)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]] by jacobk (Mostly Hermione, with an occasional scene from others' points perspective.)

- [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]] by Couldson Eagle

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] by White Squirrel (It sticks to canon rails a bit too much, early on, but it's diverged quite a bit in recent chapters.)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9323348/1/For-The-Only-Hope][For The Only Hope]] by ausland (Same problem with canon rails until the most recent chapters, and it's SS/HG albeit after years of accelerated aging from using a Time-Turner, but Hermione still has a personality, so it works.)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9767794/1/Hermione-Granger-The-Witching-Hour][Hermione Granger: The Witching Hour]] by Temairine, for the obligatory Video Game fic.

Other than that,

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036056/1/Granger-Verse][Granger Verse]] series of one-shots by jeanne.summers, which may well be too much of a good thing.
