Most likely explanation: useless adults trope in children's literature

Most likely in-story explanations:

- evil!manipulative!greaterGood!Dumbledore who wants to test Harry.
- incompetent!senile!Dumbledore who is too dumb to do some basic detective work (such as asking Moaning Myrtle some basic questions) to clear Hagrid and neutralize this extremely dangerous threat to Hogwarts students.
- Completely uncooperative Moaning Myrtle who absolutely refuses to answer any questions from Dumbledore.
