I don't think I've ever read that people were petrified the first time around. Only Myrtle's death, by unknown way. There are lots of magic that can kill, even without leaving bodily traces. He knows it's not Hagrid, but wasn't headmaster and possessing an acrumantula in a school is grounds for expulsion anyway.

As such, when the petrifications happen the second time he has no reason to suspect a basilisk. He has no reason to even suspect that it's done by the same cause. No one save riddle had ever seen it, and to suspect a 1000 year old basilisk as a cause sounds almost like a Luna theory.

It's Harry's parseltongue that gives the necessary clue. Without, the suspicion that it is not actually a magical beast at all is much more reasonable.
