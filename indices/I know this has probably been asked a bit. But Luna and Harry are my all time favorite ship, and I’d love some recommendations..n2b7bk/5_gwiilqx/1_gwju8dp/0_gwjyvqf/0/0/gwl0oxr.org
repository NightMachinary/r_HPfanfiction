I'm just glad they're keeping with it. It's really frustrating when I really get into a story that's like 200k words or something and it ends abruptly and it hasn't been updated in 6 years. I don't blame people, I know how it is to get burned out on projects. I just hate not knowing what the resolution is to the story.
