I second Lomonaaerren, great stuff even if its not what you're looking for.

In other news, we are going to need more to work with. Was there any specific phrasing that stuck out to you or scenes you remember? Googling that can really help.

For example, googling "Harry Potter Fawkes Exotic" brought up Soulbound ball that I was looking for. And "Harry Potter fealty contraception ward stone" gave me Core Threads.

Good luck searching
