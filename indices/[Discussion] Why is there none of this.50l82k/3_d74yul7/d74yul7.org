I have a story where there could be an eldritch sexual being in my anthologies(the terminator/HP one). I've yet to see it either. thankfully. There is one in one story, though, Tim, In Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood. Oh, also in Nonjon's A Black Comedy, Harry could likely use his 'arms' for such shenanigans.
