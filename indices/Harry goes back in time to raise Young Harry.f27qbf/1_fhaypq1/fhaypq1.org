While it's not a full story, my multi-part one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10280808/28/Little-Whinging-Pet-Shop][To Stop A Thief]] has Harry going back in time to prevent the Pureblood Supremacists from setting a place a spell that drains magic from everyone who doesn't have two magical parents (there were... /issues/ with the proper 4-magical grandparents definition). Harry goes back in time to take out Riddle's Horcruxes and give his younger self a better childhood.
