linkffn(Blood Crest) started updating again recently, to my delight. It has some strong OCs and the best portrayal of necromancy I've seen in fanfiction.

Also, there was a guy around here at the end of last year, promoting a fic he wrote for his kids, linkffn(Tamblin Demosthene and the Artiste's Alcove). It was actually pretty good -- a bit light on plot and conflict, but convincing characters and world-building.

And linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chrysalis) has been updating semi-regularly, but that gets recommended frequently around here already...

Overall, the rate of quality fics definitely seems to be declining, albeit no faster than the fandom as a whole...
