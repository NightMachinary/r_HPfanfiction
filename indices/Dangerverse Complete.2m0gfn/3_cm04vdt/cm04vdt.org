I read the entire series, and I loved it.

Yes, it does drag on in some parts, but it felt like all the loose ends all got tied up as it went along. Given how the series givers so much time and so many people, and how many brand new elements she brought in, that length is absolutely necessary.

The entire series is its own AU for a reason.

If you like stories with an element of 'fates' or prophecy, try it. If you like new magics being explored, try it. If you like original characters who actually have personalities and aren't self-inserts, give it a chance. If you want character development, and conflict, and a bit of chaos thrown in, please try it. Go a chapter a day if you must (but that'll take forever so don't do that), but if you get through the first book, I highly highly recommend reading her whole series.
