I couldn't get far. I think I managed up through parts of book two.

Overall, low drama and (oddly enough) danger throughout the parts of the story I was able to get through. One character can see visions that literally remove all danger from the story. When there is danger, it disappears quickly and leaves everyone just a little scared, but not too scared. Because they're all one big happy, oddly well-adjusted family. It is a journaling style story, with almost every moment of everyone's not-so-dangerous lives mapped out and described in detail.

I'm making a lot of danger puns and references because that is what the author should have been doing. In my opinion, it would have worked better as a humorous and romantic one-shot, but I don't know the later plot so maybe something more interesting happened in the last one and three quarters million words. I may never know, as it couldn't keep my interest that long.

Do you remember that part in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy where Douglas Adams makes a joke right at the climax of an attack on a spaceship by spelling out explicitly that everyone gets out okay, with only a bruised arm and some broken stuff? Then the scene continues and you realize that though there is some tension, it isn't that strong because all the impact was removed ahead of time by a brilliant comedic writer and replaced by the setup for a joke?

That's the Dangerverse, just without the brilliant writer part and the punchline. It is competently written overall, but just so low impact that you are immediately reassured that all the fluffy bunnies will be okay before conflict even begins. Some people will like that. I couldn't be bothered after a while.

Original (AU) content-wise, there is some really weird stuff early on with some fanon werewolf attributes and attitudes and very little kids. It is a hair's breadth away from thematically just being open kink training of children, which is all kinds of wrong, but avoids that by being dutifully non-sexual at all points related directly to them -- while still having a sexual Remus pawing a consenting adult main character in the background. Mixed tones and contexts might be what are triggering those thoughts, at least for me.

The characters who (eventually, after I don't know how many tens of thousands of words) hit Hogwarts still have some really weird personality issues that are played very straight. Like grabbing each other by the throat to establish dominance relationships and the girls being especially submissive to the boys and the "alpha". Again, not outright sexual (as far as I read it) but that sort of alpha-beta, werewolf pack, dominance games stuff is usually in adult porn stories.

I should know. I read and write them.

That odd subject matter choice colored a lot of what I read, while being less interesting than* it sounds emphasized like I'm doing here. /It sounds more interesting than it is/ could be the tagline for this series (at least the first two books). Either that or, /waste the reader's time, the series/.

--------------

/tl;dr/: borderline kink alpha-beta kids early on, low dramatic threat via lots of visions to avoid "Danger", and a right out of the gate cure for everything bad about being a werewolf removing a huge chunk of drama. Otherwise, a happy school days fluffy series with some odd AU choices around a primary OC.
