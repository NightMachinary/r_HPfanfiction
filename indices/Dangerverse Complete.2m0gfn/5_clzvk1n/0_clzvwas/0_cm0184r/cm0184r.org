To begin with, the writing is very good, I came across very few mistakes and it didn't feel like I was reading a piece of fanfiction. Also, I don't necessarily know what well-liked pieces of fanfiction would be, I actually came across the title of this series on this sub over the summer right after I found the sub and just got hooked.

The overarching conflict mostly follows those of the series, with a few liberties taken by the author. The major tweak that makes it so intriguing is that Harry and Hermione, along with a few others you'll meet, are raised as siblings and form a very strong core group that faces the main conflicts of the series together. While Harry's parents are still dead, he doesn't end up stuck with the Dursley's, instead being raised by Remus and Hermione's older sister. However, if you don't like a Good Draco, you'll definitely find it strange.

I'd say that a huge strength is that it does play on a lot of the familiar settings and conflicts of the original Harry Potter series and, to a certain degree with the exception of Draco, keeps the characters familiar to the series as well. They end up with somewhat different personalities but they're certainly still recognizable from the books. A weakness that you may find, depending on what fanfictions you do read, is that there is certainly a lot of story that goes on between major plot points. Not necessarily fluff, but that's a part of what makes it such a lengthy series.

I feel like this is becoming a bit much of an essay, essentially, if you have an inkling toward reading it after this, I'd at least try starting it, you can always stop if you don't like it. I put a solid 4 months into reading the series and I personally believe it was time well spent.
