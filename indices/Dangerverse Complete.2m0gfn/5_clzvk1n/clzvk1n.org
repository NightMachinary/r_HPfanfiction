It's so good. I started from the beginning in June and managed to catch up a month ago. I then finished it as the last few chapters came out for Surpassing Danger. I absolutely loved it, minus the last chapter, which in my opinion was mediocre compared to the rest of the series. Feel free to ask any more questions, it's so hard to sum up such a long and vivid fic. I can almost say I like it better than the original series.

Enjoy!
