I started it a while ago but eventually dropped it.

By the 15th chapter so much prophecy\fate\coincidence and wistful thinking gets stacked on top of each other that when I combined all that with the story's genres (Drama/Humor), it started looking like one of those stories in which everything happens in the author's pretty little dollhouse as long as s\he doesn't think that things need some spicing up to keep readers aboard.

Maybe I was wrong, so yeah---getting some *detailed* reviews from people who've actually read it would be nice.
