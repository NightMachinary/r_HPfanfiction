I think that if you can get through the first story in the series, then it's definitely worth reading the entire series. The first book sets up the backbone. There's some great characters, some creative use of magic, interesting inventions... You won't really get to see that if you don't read the main series. Plus, I found the historic storylines (you'll know what I mean) to be really interesting.
