There are quite a few mistakes with your grammar, and misuse of words (using do instead of due, for example). It might help you to have a couple of beta readers who can point these out for you. There are also some bits I'd edit, and stylistic decisions I'd make differently, but really just fixing the grammar and malapropisms would go a long way to making it better.
