I would think more powple would find it believable if Harry was 16 or at least 17. You say he won't be god like but you have him beat Dumbledore at age 11. It might be hard for him to grow as a wizard if you already have him at the pinncle.

Maybe have him be older than Cannon and have him be summoned to to Hogwarts via the GOF. Then have him duel Dumbledore for stealing him away. Cyrus could still act as his Valet, Annie could be a quasi love interest slash helper with the second task.
