I love this sort-of-sympathetic Cormac and Lavender oneshot, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=289998][It's Only Love]]. They're quite canon, but it's rare to find good portrayals of them in fanon. It's droll and bleak and pretty much how I can imagine their relationship going.

Also [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308522][The Satellite Heart]], which has a Harry who suddenly begins to have dreams of an alternate universe where Voldemort doesn't exist and he's with Draco, and it covers a lot more ground than one would first expect. Harry actually struggling to accept this world and relationship, his meeting with alt-world parents is heartbreaking, and the other character cameos don't really follow fanon either.
