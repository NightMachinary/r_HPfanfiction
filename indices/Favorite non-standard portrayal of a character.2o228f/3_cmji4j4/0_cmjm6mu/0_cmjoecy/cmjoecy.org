I've never read a Lavender like that, probably because if I did I'd nope out of there after reading that paragraph :P

My favorite Lavender Brown story is [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=322079][A Lightness]]; it's an amazing short story whirlwind through her Hogwarts years, a really sensible take on her, too. I've also got a short oneshot [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=314682][730 Whispers]] that defines my headcanon for her.
