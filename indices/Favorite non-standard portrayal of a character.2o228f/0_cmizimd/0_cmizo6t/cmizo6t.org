Yeah, I felt like that Lockhart is one of the more... self aware?... incarnations I've seen. Which is interesting in a way, that in a fic that's tends towards the somewhat ridiculous, Lockhart of all people is made a touch more serious and played straight whereas in a lot of fics that are trying to take themselves more seriously Lockhart is a series of one-off gags.
