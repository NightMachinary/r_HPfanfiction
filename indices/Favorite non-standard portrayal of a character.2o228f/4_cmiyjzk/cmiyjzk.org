In particular, essentially every character in his story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2686464/1/To-Fight-The-Coming-Darkness][To Fight the Coming Darkness]] is a reimagining of canon. The Sorting Hat in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] is another notable character.
