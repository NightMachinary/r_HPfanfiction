I didn't always know Harry was mine, but once I did, that was that. No one else could have him.

When he and Ginny got together after the war--supposedly officially and forever--I couldn't take it. Harry was mine. After all we had been through together, it just made sense. I was the only one who stuck with him through it all. Ginny and her family, sans Ron, always helped them whenever they could, but they weren't willing to take it as far as I had. I gave up everything I had for Harry: my parents, my comfortable life as the dentists' daughter. All while the Weasleys continued their comfortable life and maintained their comfortable identity. Sure things were rough during the war, they were for us all, but they never had to change who they were. I did, and I did it for Harry.

So when Harry told me he was planning on proposing, I had to act. I had to act, or I would lose him forever. So I told Ginny he had confided in me that he felt trapped, that she was his only way to being a true Weasley forever, and that was all he ever really wanted from her. Her place as a Weasley.

They broke up a week later.

Then it was on to Luna, after a year of moping. How he didn't see me as an option--I was there for him every day he wept--I'll never know. And why Luna? I'll never know that either. Perhaps it was her free spirit. Perhaps he thought that would release him from the burdens of war he still felt, the burdens I still felt too and was willing to carry with him. Nonetheless, he chose her, the nutter, over me. But she was easy enough to get rid of--I simply told her I had a lead on a Long-Winged Snallygaster. I almost lost Harry for good in that one; she wanted him to come to America with her. Thankfully he refused, and things ended amicably. She met her now husband Rolf on that trip, and was out of the way for good.

And then he went on to his worst choice of all: Pansy Parkinson. That pureblood bitch hated him all through school and was Draco's girl, before the git discovered his predilection for men. She was nasty to him, and they always fought, but I'll always be thankful to her for putting the fight back in Harry. I was even more thankful for her appearance in Harry's life, because he had started mooning after Ginny again. But there was an easy solution to the Weasley problem and Parkinson--have Ron (who never thought with his head, but rather another part of his anatomy) be caught in a compromising situation with her. Gone was Pansy, and gone was the Weasley problem--this time forever.

And then there was me.

“Hermione,” Harry said. “I think there's something wrong with me. Ginny, Luna, Pansy, especially Pansy. They all left me. Why does no one want me?”

“I want you, Harry,” I said.

“You do?”

It was as if that I was a girl never entered his mind. Pushing the hurt I felt aside, I leaned in for a kiss. “I do.”
