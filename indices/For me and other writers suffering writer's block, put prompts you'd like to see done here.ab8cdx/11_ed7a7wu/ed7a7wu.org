Harry is reborn as Caretaker Filch in the first year of the books. Now he has to try and protect the school, the children and his younger self as a squib and come to terms with the fact that Filch kind of had it rough dealing with all those magical dunderheads and their magical problems, not to mention the stigmas of being ostracized as a squib.
