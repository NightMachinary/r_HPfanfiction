Not so much a prompt, more an interesting pairing that I've never really encountered. Daphne/Hermione.

Another one you rarely see is Harry/Astoria. Especially something that explores the curse put on her, maybe how it affects her during her school life.

Time or AU travel that focuses mainly on Harry's relationship with Lilly.

Anything involving a more prominent Grindelwald in the second war.
