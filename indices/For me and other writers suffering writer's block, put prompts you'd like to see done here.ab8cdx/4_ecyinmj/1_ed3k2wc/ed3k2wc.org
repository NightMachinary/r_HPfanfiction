Harry was tired. Tired of being famous, tired of being Harry Potter, tired of being hounded by his fierce admirers. They had become more and more bold over the years, and one them had actually planted a kiss on him recently! Ginny had not been pleased. But worse than those who loved him were those who wished him harm. Everywhere he went, he had to look over his shoulder with the likes of Lucius Malfoy on the loose still. It didn't matter that all the “bad” Death Eaters were locked away in the reformed Azkaban and that only the “reformed” ones were allowed out in the world--he still felt constantly watched.

Constant vigilance, as Moody would say, was needed.

Ironically is was Moody who gave him the idea, in a roundabout way. Polyjuice, and lots of it. Luckily his best friend was a Potions Mistress and could supply him with what he needed at the cost of producing it, though Hermione was not pleased with the results of his taking it.

They were supposed to be meeting up to watch a Chudley Cannons game; now that Ron played keeper for them, they were no longer bottom of the league...they were second bottom. Nonetheless, the rabid canon fans showed up in hoards to support their team in their newfound, so-called success.

Harry could hardly show up as himself in such a crowded place, so he took some hair off a homeless woman and put it in his now always-carried supply of Polyjuice. Once he was cleaned up and dressed, he shifted through the crowd to find Hermione, who sat next to a shifty looking fellow with big teeth.

Harry shoved himself between them, drawing the big man's ire, and a glare from Hermione. “Really now, Miss, that ain't necessary! Coulda jus' said budge up!” The man stalked off in a huff to the next row of seats.

“Have we met?” Hermione said.

“Of course we bloody well have!”

“Oh Harry!”

Harry glared.

“Harry-Harriet! It's good to see you looking so, so well!”

“Oi! Did Granger just say Harry? Harry Potter's here!” the big man shouted. “He's that knackered lookin' lady!”

Forgetting his disguise and dignity, knowing it was a doomed endeavor, Harry apparated away, to Hermione's disappointment. After all, she was the one who had alerted the crowd to his presence. Ron would not be happy, as he was having a spectacular game that ended up helping the Cannons climb to third-bottom.
