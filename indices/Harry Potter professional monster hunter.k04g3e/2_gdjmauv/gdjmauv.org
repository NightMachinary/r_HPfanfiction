This is a very good idea especially as HP creatures lend themselves to similar moral conflicts the witcher has. Like does Harry spare a family of acrumantula because they are sentient even though they eat people unapologetically and refuse to change that? A wild dragon terrorises the muggles countryside, but they are endangered so instead of slaying it he takes it to Charlie's reserve while staving off other hitwizards and hunters trying to kill it and to profit from its parts. I'd love to see this done.
