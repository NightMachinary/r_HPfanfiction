Dammit, I might have to read that. Someday you're going to have to make good on a few of those solid plot bunnies.

I think my one regret about getting into fanfiction a year ago is that I now know a) that there's such a thing as "mpreg," and b) what that thing is.

When I first ran across the term I thought it was some kind of fanfiction-only compression format, like .MPEG.
