Here I thought "I'll update when such-and-such term is met!" was restricted to bad tween writers. Not that I've read /They Shook Hands/, but I'd pegged it as being something reasonably well written.

From his fb page:

#+begin_quote
  If this page gets up to 200 likes before Christmas, I'll post the first chapter of Y6. I don't like making everyone wait, but I want to make sure the story is as good as it can be.
#+end_quote

Does he somehow expect that 200 likes will improve the quality of his writing?
