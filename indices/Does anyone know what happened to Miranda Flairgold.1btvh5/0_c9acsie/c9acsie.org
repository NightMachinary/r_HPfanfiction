The story really is amazing, however the entire thing is about 10% Harry Potter and continues to fall towards zero as the installments happen.

AU barely describes it, it is almost "this totally different person play Harry Potter on the side".

STILL WORTH A READ...rather awesome, it just is just barely AU HP

As for what happened? I'm hoping she started writing something original, considering the world she put together only paid lipservice to HP anyway.
