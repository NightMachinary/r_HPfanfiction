I honestly don't think that you would be able to. And not because of them not being magical creatures (you see Sirius be a black dog and Peter become a rat). But I think since basically the only animagi you can find are common animals, dinosaurs wouldn't really count. Maybe a part of the animal you want is required to become an animagi, the details aren't too clear on what you have to do to become one.
