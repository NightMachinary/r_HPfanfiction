Look, we get it. You think "Tasmanian tiger" is a silly name. But your opinion on this matter does not supersede the fact that /it is a real name for this animal/, just as valid a moniker as "thylacine".

Zoology and paleontology are /full/ of names that are inaccurate, or else a bit silly. /Basilosaurus/ is not a reptile, the Dementor Wasp is not in fact a humanoid ghostlike demon but rather an insect, etc. Those names are nevertheless perfectly acceptable.
