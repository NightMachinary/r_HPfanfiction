We never learn a whole lot about Animagus(Animaguses?). The magic in the HP series is not exactly explored either, so it's pretty possible someone could be a dinosaur.

This is a world where a potion can make someone lucky, logic kinda goes out the window. And a dinosaur form would be a lot more useful than let's say.. a rat?
