In the fanfic I'm currently working on, it's entirely possible, though given that animal don't get to choose what animal they become, it's extremely rare, with only a handful of cases in history. One of the villains in the story is a bounty hunter whose animagus form is a /Baryonyx/ (a crocodile-like dinosaur from the cretaceous period of England).
