Yeah there are a fair few authors like that, assuming it is why they write fanfiction. If is free so can't complain though, I just enjoy what is there. I think the gold standard author for good ideas that will never be finished is cywscross though, some of her stories are just so good it is heartbreaking they will never be completed, her bleach stories in particular are just head and shoulders above all others.
