I read Athey's linkffn(Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness) and it rather put me off reading any more. The writing is good but the way the characters developed felt very contrived. But what really put me off is that there's a scene where Harry uses Rita Skeeter as target practice for dark magic, torturing her horribly for some time before finally killing her... and later he and Tom chat amiably about how Riddle's goals are actually designed to /help/ muggles, not harm them. These two things don't fit, to my mind. Maybe the author's other stories don't have such massive dissonance but I'm disinclined to find out.
