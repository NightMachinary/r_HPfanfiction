Out of curiosity, is this your first time on a fanfiction community? I'm not trying to be mean I promise, it's just that yaoi (and to a lesser extent its feminine counterpart yuri) are /huge/ parts of any fandom.

Personally I don't read yaoi much either, I grew out of my yaoi phase after middle school. I started reading Athey back then tho, so I keep up with her because she's one of the best fanfic authors I've ever read.
