Here are a few quick tips I've picked up (And still struggle with). Anyone, feel free to offer input or disagreement.

- Show don't tell. This one can be hard, but in general it's better to describe somebody behaving or appearing a certain way that inspires thought or emotion. As opposed to just telling the reader what emotion they are feeling.

- GENERALLY, chapters should be at least 2000 words. There isn't really an upper bound, but some consider it a bit unwieldy to read 30K word chapters. Also, don't concentrate too much on word count. Use as many words as it takes to tell the story, and no more. Longer does not mean better.

- Be careful with using too many adverbs. This sort of falls under the "show don't tell" rules. Also, if you use them too often it seems lazy.

- Understand verb tenses: Simple, Perfect, Participle etc.

- Mix sentence length. Some long sentences, some short and some medium size. Often a short 3-4 word sentence can be way more impact than an 8-9 word sentence.

- Don't use a semicolon unless you are absolutely certain how to use it correctly.

- Go research commas. Don't just guess. Look up "comma splicing"

- Use a thesaurus to learn more colorful language, but don't use a word if you don't understand the nuances of how it's used. Most words you can look up a more specific definition online.

- Outline. Sometimes it's easier to just think of an idea and start typing, but eventually you need to take a step back and plan everything out, otherwise your story will meander.

- Character voice. Even in third person you need to give each character a voice, you should have a unique way you describe them, their dialogue, their thought process etc. compared to every other character. Minor characters don't need as much, if any, voice, but your main characters should be distinct.

- Imagery: You have more senses than just site. Use them all when you write.

- Go read quality literature to learn better vocabulary and look up words you don't know. Use this literature to study story structure, tone, character voice, imagery etc.

- Dialogue tags: Don't use too man, it's okay to leave some out as long as it's clear who is talking. Don't go out of your way to avoid saying "said." Let the flow and sound natural.

- Let characters write themselves for the most part. Don't force them to do something that doesn't represent their personality just to fit the narrative.

- Don't hesitate to re-write something that doesn't sound right, or doesn't fit the narrative or somebody's personality. I often get into this mindset that I've already written this part, so I'll do the best I can to clean it up, but that's being lazy. Go back to the drawing board if you must.

- Learn the Oxford comma

- Learn what the difference between lay and lie and how to conjugate them.

- Learn how to use prepositional phrases, adverb phrases etc.

- Learn how to use and punctuate conjunctive adverbs

- Learn the many uses of "as"

- Practice! And get feedback, both at the low level of grammar and spells, and the high level of story structure, tone etc.

- Lastly, have a thick skin. People will tell you your writing is shit initially, and it's probably true. Accept any criticism graciously and improve.

You can definitely find something online that expands upon these.
