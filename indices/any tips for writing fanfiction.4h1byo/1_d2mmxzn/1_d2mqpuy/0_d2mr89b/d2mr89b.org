If you say something in your story that needs clarification in order for the reader to understand, then you should consider rewriting it, so that it makes more sense.

There are appropriate times to offer explanation such as clarifying intentional deviations from canon, offering supporting lore or information or even translations.

You SHOULD NOT use authors notes to respond to specific reviews. If you do, then that review and its answer need to be relevant to everybody reading the fic. Restate the idea behind the review, respond to the review, and explain why it's relevant to all of the readers.

If you want to see a good example of how to use authors notes I would refer you to linkffn(Shadow of Angmar) chapter 10 specifically.
