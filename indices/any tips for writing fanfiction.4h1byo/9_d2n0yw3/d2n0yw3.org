- Refresh yourself on [[http://englishgrammar101.com/][grammar]], especially if you don't have a word processor that will check for mistakes.

- Keep multi-chapter stories separated into chapters, with each chapter starting on its own page; that will make it easier to keep track of. [[https://www.scribd.com/doc/311002858/Fanfiction-Story-Doc][Here's]] a quick example of that.

- Likewise, an outline that lists chapters will make your life easier. Make sure to note which ones you've already uploaded. [[https://www.scribd.com/doc/311002082/Fanfiction-Outline][Here's]] another quick one I slapped together.

- Place notes either at beginning of chapters or the ends of them. Never anywhere else.

- Edit your work. Even if you have betas.
