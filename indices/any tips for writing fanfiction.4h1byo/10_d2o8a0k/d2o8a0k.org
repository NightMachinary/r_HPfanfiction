There's some good tips already, so I'll try to avoid repeats from the other commenters.

One thing that gets me to drop a work faster than anything else is paragraph errors.

The biggest most annoying thing I ever have the displeasure of reading is when multiple characters speak in the same paragraph. If someone new is talking, new paragraph is needed.

Similarly, actions between characters should be paragraphed out in the same manner. First character actions. New paragraph. Second character actions. I won't say this is an absolute golden rule, as there are some cases where you would muddle action, but if you're a beginning writer then you should probably keep things separated.

Keep in mind those rules when mixing dialog and actions. Dialog and actions can be in the same paragraph, but only when the same character is both speaking and acting.

One time I read (part of) a story where the author /continually/ formatted their paragraphs like so:

#+begin_quote
  "Character A dialog." Character B actions.

  "Character B dialog." Character C actions.

  "Character C dialog." Character A actions.

  etc.
#+end_quote

And it was some of the most horrible to read stuff I've ever read.

Those are the big things. Beyond that, I find paragraphs exceeding four or five sentences to be tedious to read. Maybe this is just me, but paragraphs that take up the entire screen of my tablet tend to make my eyes jump between lines.

I've you've gone ten sentences in a single paragraph, you've probably covered multiple topics and should splice in your paragraphs somewhere.

Again, these aren't necessarily Iron Clad Rules, but should be kept in consideration when starting out writing.

A few other notes:

Pace yourself and make writing a habit. Set yourself an achievable goal based around your personal life. For example: two, 4k chapters a week. That's less than 1.5k words a day. So sit down every day and write 1.5k words. You'll be ahead of schedule.

Slipping on a day is bad. Saying "Ah, I'll do 3k tomorrow" is the start of the end. Procrastination leads to dead fics.

Be wary of plot-bunny burnout. You have this genius idea. Man, no one's thought of it before, its great. You get to writing. One week and you've already got 15 chapters under your belt. Things are going great.

But uh oh! You only thought of that one cool idea that kickstarted your writing. Now you're stuck thinking up an actual plot to go with your idea.

So many fanfics die out early and hard with the author promising that the next chapter is coming out. That's rarely the case. This all ties into the pace yourself thing I mentioned earlier, but just keep it in mind.

Lastly, stations of canon. Be very careful about the stations of canon. We've /all/ read the Halloween troll fight a *million* times. We've all read the Goblet of Fire tasks a million times. So on and so forth. Sure, they usually have variations. But it does get old after a while.

If you're going to follow the stations of canon, be mindful of exactly how samey you're being.
