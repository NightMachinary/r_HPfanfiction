Most of the suggestions that have already posted are very good, and should be heeded by any aspiring writer. So, instead, I shall talk about the intangibles.

*What Do You Want?*

You need to decide what it is you want to get out of fanfiction. Everyone is a little different in this regard:

- Doing it for practice. No-one is born with an innate ability to write well, though we all have the ability to create our own stories. One of the greatest strengths of fanfiction is that it allows for a 'safe space' for growth. You don't need to worry about world building, or character creation, or any of those things if you don't want to. You can, instead, focus on getting better at the nuts and bolts of storytelling. Later, once you have a grasp of those things, you can move on to the bigger game. Do you want to improve? Even if that means you may be hurt by the criticism?

- Doing it for recognition. Everyone loves being recognised. Reviews are one of the biggest drivers for many writers, it surely is a nice feeling to be told how good your little baby is doing. But you must be careful here, sometimes the story that gets the most recognition isn't the story you want to write. Can you handle that?

- Doing it for fun. The joy of creation can be a heady thing. Fanfiction is, in many ways, like rediscovering the pure joy we all experienced as children, as we concocted stories for our teddies, or dolls, or other toys. It doesn't have to be about agendas. Some write simply because that joy is enough for them. But when that joy starts to lose its shine, will you continue your story to the end?

- Doing it because a story needs to be told. Sometimes it's not about what you want, sometimes it's about something bigger. Sometimes it's about telling a story that needs to be told. Maybe, in some ways, fanfiction isn't the best place for this kind of story, but maybe it is exactly the right place.

There are other reasons, I imagine, that I haven't touched upon here. And no-one is motivated by only one or two of these reasons; we all are influenced by them all to some degree. What is important is that you work out why it is that you write, and what it is you hope to get out of it.

I say this because if you write for enjoyment, and you find yourself not having fun, then that is a good time to consider if the story is still worth writing.

Finally, the single piece of advice I'd give to an aspiring fanfiction writer, quite beyond all the technical questions of grammar, spelling, or word choice, is to love your fandom.

It seems insipid, I know, but it's something that many people seem to forget over the years. You are not in competition with the Harry Potter books, it is more a symbiosis. Without Harry Potter you would not be here writing a story (or thinking about it), remember that. And remember why it is you read the books from cover to cover, and why you have found yourself thinking about fanfiction five years after the last movie was released. It is the love of the fandom that is the heart-beat of fanfiction, don't forget that.

Do you dislike Ron? That's fine. But do not declare war on him when it comes time to write your story. It isn't a fight you can win. Your story lives within the fandom, and trying to attack the fandom is like bringing down your own ceiling to get back at the noisy neighbour upstairs. There are no winners, only losers, and your story will suffer for it.

My favourite stories are those that demonstrate an affection for the source material, and communicate that joy to me through their writing. I am willing to overlook a few issues in grammar, pacing and storytelling if that love for the fandom is present.

Anyway, go get 'em, tiger.
