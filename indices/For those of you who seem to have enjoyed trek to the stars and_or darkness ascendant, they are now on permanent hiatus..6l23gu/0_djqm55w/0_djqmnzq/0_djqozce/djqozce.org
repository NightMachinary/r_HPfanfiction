Thats still great! It doesn't need to be a 24 hour, its just more convenient. Even if its only open during the day, its somewhere safe, fun, and sanitary to be.

Something you should also look into is if you're job has a â€˜grief fund' or something similar. When I used to work for a major burger chain that rhymes with med mobin, I paid into a fund, something small like 2 dollars a pay check, so that if something ever happened (i.e., house fire, car accident, etc) they would help me with funds if they could. Losing your home for almost any reason could possibly qualify you if your job provides it! You don't have to pay into it to be eligible either if I remember correctly. Again, best of luck! You can handle this, as long as you sit down, make a plan, and stay focused, even when it gets tough.
