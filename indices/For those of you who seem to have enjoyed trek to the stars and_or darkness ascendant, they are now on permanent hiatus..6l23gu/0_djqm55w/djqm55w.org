Hey, I know its not related to the stories, but some advice for you:

Sign up for a 24 hours gym is possible; they're great for having access to a reasonable environment, showers, wifi, etc.

Public libraries are your friend! Wifi/computers/internet access. Some even offer minor technical training and help with job placement. Also, don't give up! try applying for jobs, but also make sure you look up social assitace programs in your area! See if you can get food stamps/WIC. Every dollar you can save at this point will help you in the long run.

Speaking of that, be extra careful with your bank account. Right now it may seem like it doesn't matter, but DONT overdraft on your account. When you get back on you feet (because don't forget, this is temporary), you will require some kind of bank account receive money.

If possible, ask a friend if you can use their home as a place of address; many companies will not hire someone that does not have a permeant address, or even people that only have PO boxes.

If you need anything, let me know in a PM. Also let me know where you're at, if you're comfortable telling a stranger that is. Honestly, this has got to be super tough on you, but stay strong. You are strong enough to handle this and get out on the other side.
