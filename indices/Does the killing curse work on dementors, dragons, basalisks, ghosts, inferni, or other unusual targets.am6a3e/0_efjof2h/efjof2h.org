I would say that it probably works on Dragons, Basilisks, and any other truly living (albethey unusual) magical creatures. However, if you want to close the plothole of why people ruthless enough to use Killing Curses wouldn't just take them down in one hit that way, you can always say that though it is immune to magical protection per se, Dragon or Basilisk hide's magic-resistance is defence enough against a Killing Curse.

Dementors and their ilk are classified as "amortal", that is to say that while they outwardly resemble living things, they are not considered "alive" for purposes of Magical Theory. This suggests to me pretty heavily that no, the Killing Curse wouldn't work on them.

It /certainly/ doesn't work on ghosts; the whole point of the KC is that it makes you dead when you're not; the whole point of ghosts is that they are dead.

Inferi... I would also say no. They're not alive. Heck, they're not even "undead" to any meaningful degree; there's nothing in them of the deceased's personality. They're just animated puppets that happen to have used human corpses as source material; we know they're devoid of any kind of consciousness, and are instead just running on (artificial) instincts.

That being said, we know a Killing Curse hitting something too thick for it to go through it, but that it cannot kill, will cause an explosion. So maybe a Killing Curse would still be useful against Inferi, who, being "objects", would get blown up by it.
