When the curse is called unblockable, my head cannon says, that means by magic. Wizards seem full of them selves and believe if magic can't do it then it can't be done. I don't remember exactly but when Dumbledore and Riddle fought the AK was block by different objects but nothing that was made with magic. (Maybe the shield thing but I don't remember.) So maybe it should by said that it can't be blocked by magic.
