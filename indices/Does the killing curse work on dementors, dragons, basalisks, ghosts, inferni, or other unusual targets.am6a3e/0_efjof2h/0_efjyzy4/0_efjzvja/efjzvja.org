Ok, but then that kind of implies that a dragon-hide cloak would be an effective defense against the killing curse. Which, on the one hand, it'd be pretty much just a physical barrier, and canonically those can block the killing curse, but on the other hand the spell is supposedly unblockable...

Hmm, now I'm imagining Aurors with dragon-hide spell-proof vests...
