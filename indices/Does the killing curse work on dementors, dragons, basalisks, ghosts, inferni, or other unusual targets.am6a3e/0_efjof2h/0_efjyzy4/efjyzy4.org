Would guess that the size, strength, and where you hit a creature also determines whether they die or not. Like if you shot a dragon normally it's likely the spell would deflect. But if you hit it in the eye it would penetrate their natural resistance, but maybe only stagger it. Same way that giants and dragons need multiple stunners to overcome their natural resistance, would guess the same principle applies.
