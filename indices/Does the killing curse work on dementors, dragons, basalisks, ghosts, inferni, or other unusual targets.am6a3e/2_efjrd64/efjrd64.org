Well, you can't kill something that's already dead. So I'd imagine Ghosts would be, at best, mildly inconvenienced. Inferi might suffer the same fate as inanimate objects struck by a Killing Curse(explosion), so it would probably be at least somewhat effective. Dementors are weird. They're not undead the way Ghosts are, but I don't know if they'd be "alive" in the normal sense. So might not affect them either.

Anything else? If it's alive, it can be killed. In the case of beings or creatures with particularly high inherent resistance to magic, it might take more than one hitting it at the same time(Like with the Stunning Spells against Dragons) to be fully effective.
