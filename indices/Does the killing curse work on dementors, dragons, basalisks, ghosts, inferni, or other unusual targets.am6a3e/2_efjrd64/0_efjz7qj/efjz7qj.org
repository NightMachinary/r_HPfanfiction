  Dementors are weird. They're not undead the way Ghosts are, but I don't know if they'd be "alive" in the normal sense.

Canonically, they are considered "amortal non-beings", a classification which also applies to Boggarts and Poltergeists: beings who bear surprising similarities to either living or undead things, but are not, nor have ever been, "alive" magically speaking.
