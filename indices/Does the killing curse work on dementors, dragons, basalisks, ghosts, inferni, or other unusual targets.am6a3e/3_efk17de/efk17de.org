My personal head canon is that the killing curse is a type of soul magic. Due to it it destroying or removing the soul of the person hit, it would not work against anything that is not human because they lack a soul.

But that can't be canonically true because Hedwig is killed by it.

So probably against dragons and basilisks but not against dementors, ghosts, or inferi because they aren't living things.

Buuuuuut who knows that stupid ass spell should've never been created. AK OP valve plz nerf
