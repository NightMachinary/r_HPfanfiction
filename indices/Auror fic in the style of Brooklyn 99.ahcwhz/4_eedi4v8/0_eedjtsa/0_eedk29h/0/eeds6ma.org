The books don't specify whether “muggleborn” means “wizard born to two non-wizards” or “wizard born to two non-magical humans (muggles),” or whether non-humans who can't use magic count as muggles or not (and, if not, if there's any other terminology to differentiate them from magic-users of their species), so it's kind of a grey area. Would a /non/-wizard child born to a veela and a muggle be a squib or a (half-veela) muggle?
