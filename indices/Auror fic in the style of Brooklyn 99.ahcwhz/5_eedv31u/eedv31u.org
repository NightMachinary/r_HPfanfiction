Now its time to play, match the "younger" characters from the show with characters from Harry's core of friends.

I guess I would go with...

- Jake = Harry
- Charles = Ron
- Amy = Ginny/Hermione
- Rosa = Ginny/Hermione
- Gina = Luna
- Terry = Neville

I really can't decide on Amy and Rosa for Hermione/Ginny lol
