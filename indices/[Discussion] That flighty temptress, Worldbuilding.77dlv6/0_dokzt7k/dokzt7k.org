When it comes to wanting to write an AU world, it might be useful to see the worldbuilding as just the premise of your story, not the plot itself. A good way to focus on the actual writing would be to try writing a plan, so you have a good order of events. You probably want to be showcasing your world through a good plot. I'd suggest keeping the plot fairly simple or not too dissimilar to canon allowing you to highlight the differences as a result of your AU world. It gives you a base to work from and then if your feeling confident you can begin to make it more complicated or more divergent form canon.

I'm just starting a story that's somewhat AU, and I find myself dwelling on some of the more irrelevant details so I'm not sure how good I'll be at actually making substantial progress but I'm trying to set myself reasonable targets.
