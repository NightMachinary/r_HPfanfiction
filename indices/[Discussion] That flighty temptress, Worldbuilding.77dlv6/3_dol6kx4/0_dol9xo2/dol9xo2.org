The worldbuilding certainly makes me happy! :D I mean I do think parts of it are cool, but tbh my main aim is to get it all to /work/ together in a way I find satisfying. As much as I love canon, there are too many holes and too many things that just scream out for development.

I have a reasonable idea of how I want First Year to run, and a very rough idea of how I want the overarching story to go... with lots of specific details to help me along with the bigger events.

I haven't seen Jim Butcher's writing tips, but having read the first few Dresden Files books I'm very glad you pointed them out. I'll take a look now, thanks!
