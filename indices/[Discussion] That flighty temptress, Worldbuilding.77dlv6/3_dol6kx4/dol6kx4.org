I'd recommend you spend a bit more time working out exactly what you want to happen. Spend a bit of time refining what your story is about. World building can be its own thing but if you want it on a story then you have to work out how it is important. Is it background fluff that acts as fillers and details to slow your story at times or is it a constant distraction that adds little but makes you happy? Do your changes have a purpose or do you think they are 'cool'?
