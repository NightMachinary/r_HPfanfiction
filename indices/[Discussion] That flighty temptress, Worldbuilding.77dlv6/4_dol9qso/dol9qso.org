Worldbuilding is great fun.

What works for me is using a program called QuollWriter, which is quite similar to Scrivener (but it's free), and it can track mentions of certain things. As well as having entry options for chapters (with associated planning), you can write in little categories for character, object, location, et cetera. Then, the program tracks mentions of individual characters, objects or the like, so you can easily see where you've mentioned them, you know?

I work in a Harry Potter AU, using JKR's stuff as a sort of base framework, and then I build on it with more adult stuff and making sure that stuff is more complex in the areas it needs to be - like including branches off Diagon Alley and looking more at different magical businesses (like hairdressers, doctors, sex shops, apothecaries, etc.), at branches of magic that are more relevant (like herbology), and referencing stuff that has an effect, like fashion trends and the like.

Plan all you want, but the important thing is that you include what is RELEVANT right now. You shouldn't get sidetracked in listing off different cool ideas - the main people who are gonna enjoy that are like, twelve-year-olds or creeps who just want to read an encyclopaedia of headcanons, and lists of ideas... Those aren't stories.

If you really want to include your details, add them in an extraneous format or include footnotes as if you're writing a history and make it clear they ARE extra details - think about how Neil Gaiman & Terry Pratchett utilised footnotes in Good Omens.
