If you got the itch, I say just give into it. Worldbuild ahead and keep it all noted down. I had this itch for a long time and just went ahead and linked up with like-minded people at [[/r/worldbuilding]] and its related subs.

Its not bad either. If you've thought about many details of your world, the chance to become inconsistent with it lessens considerably. Its one of the greatest points of criticism of Rowling's work that the worldbuilding around her story is incredibly inconsistent and shortsighted (examples are Wandlore only really becoming a thing in the last books when it is convenient. The Timeturners and their many implications and unanswered questions. The existence of Felix Felicis. ...) and I personally delight in reading fanfiction that tries hard to put all those pieces into a consistent whole, instead of just fanon-ing it away.

Its only important that when you get to writing, you write a plot, and not the world. It is very tempting to show off what you made. But a world is best enjoyed in small doses. Nobody likes to read an encyclopedia disguised as a fiction work. When it comes to adding to an existing world, you add the difficulty of having to explain how something fits into canon - without actually writing a paragraph of plain explanation.

To actually get to writing, I always try to see a bit of worldbuilding as a tool. Its worth nothing if I don't work with it. Most important is to just get to writing already, which means that you can just write a scene exploring some detail of your worldbuild. If it makes it in the story, doesn't matter. What matters is that you write as if it /could/ be part of the fiction you want to finish.
