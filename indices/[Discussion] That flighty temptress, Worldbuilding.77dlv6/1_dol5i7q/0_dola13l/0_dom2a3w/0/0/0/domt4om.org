I don't really know where the AU line goes, but figure it's better to err on that side of the line when describing a fic. I posted up the first couple of chapters just after I started writing a few months ago, before I got sidetracked by worldbuilding and more mundane complaints like cracking my ribs >_<

I'm afraid there isn't much of the changes present in the first two chapters, but they should be more obvious as time goes on. I'm hoping to post up ch3 in the next week or so as I started reading back through my writing and plot notes (as opposed to general setting and history) yesterday.
