My focus tends to be a lot later, as the main historical stuff I was looking into was the creation of the City of London (the Square Mile with the weird laws, not Greater London), Parliament and tying in big events from across British history (the Roman invasion bringing wands to the UK, etc). I did have some ideas regarding Merlin but I'm not familiar with the early mythology, so mine ties into how he accidentally invented time travel (in my AU he went to Hogwarts, then sent himself back to Arthurian Britain in a freak accident. His coded writings are later decrypted by the Dept. of Mysteries).

In terms of divergence mine is mainly around setting (read: history) and the nature of magic, but more directly I've changed the decisions of a small number of people closer to the canon timeline (Dumbledore and the Flamels).

Magic in my AU is a lot more "fluid" than in canon, with the short version being that abstract concepts "live" in a weird sense, with wizards using magic to "twist" the narrative of reality to their will.
