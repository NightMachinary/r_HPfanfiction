Storywise the main divergence is that Susan Bones was born on July 31st, and ended up being attacked by Voldemort on 1980 December 31st, and similarly to how it was with Harry in canon she survives, Voldemort "dies" and she gets a fancy nickname - Surviving Susan. That derails a ton of stuff (especially in connection with my setting changes) and thus when action of the fic proper starts in summer of the year 1991, it's a very different situation for Harry than it was in the original series.

Settingwise? I focus a lot of a concept-based nature of magic and how it shapes the magical world. Magicwise there was some rebalancing from canon, loose adaptation of some of fanon concepts, creating multiple available roads to a single goal.

I integrate a lot of random stuff. From popular in occult systems comes the theory of Seven Planes which is mixed with various other esoteric concepts.

There is a lot taken from an early version of Arthurian Legends (without French influences) and it visibly shapes the culture of contemporary Wizarding Britain as many believe that both Arthur and Merlin will return one day (Merlin returned and disappeared a few times already, the last one, being soon after the creation of a Sorting Hat, which according to the legend told him that he would be the best suited to Slytherin).

Hyperborea plays an important role in a political background because ICW created a program to forcibly sent most of the European giants there as a way of protecting ISOS.

Hogwarts subjects are different and so are rules regarding underage sorcery (many students leave after OWLs and they are permitted to use magic at home and at job, before reaching seventeen).

That's the tip of an iceberg, I'm generally setting-obsessed so I tweak, change and add stuff constantly.
