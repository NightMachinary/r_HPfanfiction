Thoughts about the updated premise:

  Edit: As of June 21, 2020 the plot idea I have is that Hermione becomes a master in charms, and decides to use this to help free house elves without them having any magical backlash.

I still think Transfiguration works better, because it would create an interesting mentor dynamic with McGonagall or even Dumbledore.

Regarding house-elves, as far as we know, there is no magical backlash for free elves in canon, so I don't know if you intend to introduce that as an AU element. I don't think it's necessary: consider that if Hermione invents an easy spell that simply snaps house-elf bonds, that could already cause a lot of interesting conflict, since anyone can free anyone's house-elf.

  She cannot date Ron because of pureblood standards, but he still respects her and they are still friends. Hurry and Ginny are happy together, in the pairings are basically the same as they are in the cursed child but Ron is engaged or dating someone else.

This requires a pretty heavy divergence. Either the Weasleys are no longer ideologically opposed to blood purism, which would make Ron to his family what Sirius was to his, or there are actual anti-miscegenation laws in place, which sounds like a very heavy and very oppressive AU, on the level of [[/u/Starfox5]]'s /Patron/.
