I didn't come up with blood status as a reason for Hermione and Ron not getting together; the OP did.

The problem with it is that when you change a significant component of the setting like that, it's going to change a lot of other things. The status of Muggleborns in /Patron/ wasn't just a small tweak to the canon setting but a part of a major and coherent reenvisioning of the wizard society and its power structures.

If the author wants to go there, they can, but the difficulty of the world building is significantly raised, and the challenge of describing the new reality without boring the reader is added, since one can no longer lean on the reader's knowledge of canon as much.

In the and, I actually agree: there is myriad possible reasons for Hermione and Ron /not/ to get together, without having to introduce a setting element that requires a radical rethinking of the whole setting.
