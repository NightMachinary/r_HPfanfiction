I think that Hermione working towards better treatment of magical creatures and equality for goblins, elves, werewolves, etc. Even if we were all skeptical or scornful of SPEW the ambition was admirable. Hermione started this organization with no support and defended it against everything. Along with what she would have learned from Lupin and from interacting with Griphook, I could see her making a big impact. Along with the fact that she is muggle-born fighting against a pureblood, centuries old aristocracy, there is a ton of directions that she could go.
