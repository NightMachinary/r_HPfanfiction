McGonagall would have to take over as Headmaster, leaving the Transfiguration Master position open, and (as I quote above), she had expressed special interest in it early in canon.

That said, I think that Hermione being prepared to /teach/ a subject immediately out of Hogwarts would require an earlier divergence, where she works more on her magical skill and less on the social causes and Harry-related ones.

Hermione mentored by McGonagall is a very underused fic premise, IMO.
