That's an interesting bit of speculation; but it's far more likely that the downvotes come from the far more numerous Harry-centric mavens, who insist that Harry must always be the lead character and scoff at the idea that Hermione could ever amount to anything without Harry's wise leadership.

Also, Hermione as a Transfiguration master is a bit more likely, given this scene we get immediately after the sorting:

  On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (‘I do hope they start straight away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult --'; ‘You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing --').
