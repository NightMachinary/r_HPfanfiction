"B-b-b-but that's /boring!/ You can't make Hermione like her canon self when she can be Perfect!Pureblood!Princess!MarySue!Hermione! And no Draco romance? No Ron-bashing? No secret powers? What a fucking rip-off! I'm not reading this shit!" --- from the thoughts of the hardcore Hermione stans

Personally, I think a unique direction to go in is to make Hermione a Charms Mistress (her favourite class after Ancient Runes). I've read the super tropey Hermione fics (where she's good at /everything/), I've read the Arithmancy/Runes genius ones, I've read the Potions Mistress ones. I haven't really seen a Charms one.
