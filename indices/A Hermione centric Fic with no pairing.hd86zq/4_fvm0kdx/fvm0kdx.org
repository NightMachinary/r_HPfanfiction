I've actually been looking for a fic (for a very long time - though I'm sure that it doesn't exist) similar to what you are describing (except for the professor part). Honestly, after the war, imo - I think its the best time for someone like Hermione to try and do a complete haul over. She's capable - a war hero, best friend of the boy who lived and friends with an old Pureblood family - the stage is literally set for her. Would be nice to see no pairing of her, Ron or Harry or if that is not an option (because it seems to me that fanficiton was created on the sole basis of pairing) then seeing each of them with a pairing that is not often used or new/unique (I know I'll never get that in a fic - but one can hope).
