Indeed. Non-'ship-oriented Hermione fics are hard to come by.

Some thoughts:

- In principle, you don't need any reason whatsoever to diverge from her canon destiny however you want; but in practice, I think it's more elegant if the changes all flow from a single cause.
- By the time the Battle of Hogwarts is over, Hermione knows exactly what she must do: they have a society to rebuild, and so she must go to work in the Ministry to fight for the rights of beings and beasts. In that sense, her post-Battle actions are a culmination of her Hogwarts-era work, starting from her defence of Buckbeak and continuing through her activism for House Elves. There ought to be a way for her to smoothly diverge from her path.
- If you want to play up the pureblood privilege, you could postulate that if she and Ron never worked out (without it being anybody's fault), the purebloods in the Ministry would be less accepting of her and getting actual reforms through the system would be difficult. But, the counterargument to that is that the Order had just won a civil war and were effectively dictating the terms of surrender to the Ministry: anyone who obstructed her could be simply fired.

Combining that with the Transfiguration master mentor!McGonagall idea, here's a possible sequence of events that diverges in Year 3 but that still mostly hangs off the canon storylines:

1. Buckbeak doesn't happen. Maybe Draco's reflexes are better, maybe he slips, maybe he exercises basic common sense. Ultimately, the hippogryph lesson goes without incident.
2. Firebolt still happens, but Hermione is no longer studying wizard law, and so she instead latches on to McGonagall both for emotional support and for magic and gets more deeply into Transfiguration.
3. The ending of Year 3 is as canon, except that they break Sirius out, he just turns into a dog and runs off. Hermione keeps the course load and the time-turner.
4. Years 4-6 are pretty much as canon, but Hermione mostly skips the house-elf plot, keeps up her classwork and extra Transfiguration studies, takes a huge number of OWLs, and gains an Animagus form, though not one that would significantly affect the plot, and it's registered and public, like McGonagall's. Too busy with schoolwork and extra studies, she never gets together with Ron.
5. She has to surrender her time-turner immediately after taking the OWLs, and it gets destroyed with the others.
6. Year 7 proceeds largely as canon, with minor differences, mainly brought about by Hermione being better at Transfiguration. Her animagus form is right there on the Wanted posters next to her human portrait, so it doesn't play much of a role. She pines for Ron less when he leaves, but, again, no major consequences. She doesn't quite figure out how to translate her magical skills to combat ability, so they still get caught by the Snatchers.
7. At the Battle of Hogwarts, she finally manages to let loose with a Transfiguration-based combat style, and manages to kill Bellatrix before Molly intervenes. (This could be either in the first round or the second.)
