I love stuff like this! This is pretty general information for most people who've taken a writing course or read any kind of "how to" article, but it's really good information nonetheless. I'm quite rigid about a three act structure but freely admit that I don't trim the fat from fanfictions nearly as much as would be recommended because part of the fun is that I can let the characters have long conversations that wouldn't work in a piece intended for a commercial audience. I adore long conversations, and fanfiction is really the only place where I can get away with it.

If you're interested in a more detailed guide, I recommend "The Secrets of Story" by Matt Bird. You can find some general notes here: [[https://mentalpivot.com/book-notes-the-secrets-of-story-by-matt-bird/]]

I really enjoy the focus on characters. I think a big mistake a lot of early writers make is assuming that the plot is the most important part of the story. I love good, flawed characters, which is why I can enjoy something like Cursed Child with great characters but an awful plot more than Fantastic Beasts, which has a solid plot but just doesn't grab with its characters (other than Eddie Redmayne's smile, which can carry a whole series).

As a bonus, the author makes sure that his references and examples will be understandable to the majority of readers, which means that a lot of them come from Harry Potter because it's so widely read (or watched). Could not recommend more!
