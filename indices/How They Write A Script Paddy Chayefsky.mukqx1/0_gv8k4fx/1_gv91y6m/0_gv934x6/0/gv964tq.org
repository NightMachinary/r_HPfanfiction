I [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-dorothy-sayers.html][wrote]] about this quoting “[[https://www.fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=20140909][The Mind of the Maker]]” by Dorothy L. Sayers (yes, the author of the Lord Peter Wimsey detective stories), but it is exceedingly weird book and not for everybody (especially, if you cannot swallow a tract on The Holy Trinity). On the other hand, if you can read it, it is just a pure joy to read as any essay by good Oxford don of that era.
