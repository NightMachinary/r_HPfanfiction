There's nothing that's unimportant, but for me the order of operations in designing a story would be overall concept and theme, then you create the characters and get to know them so that you understand what is motivating them and how they'd make decisions, then hash out the plot itself. It's all a matter of preference, of course. I would prefer to read a bad plot with really fascinating characters who are acting in a true way than an interesting plot with flat characters. If you design the plot first and adhere to it strictly, then you'll probably hit a point where you're forcing characters to make decisions that move that plot forward rather than just letting them be themselves, which is my pet peeve.
