I personally never liked all the Lone Traveler stuff. It just seemed, disappointing? It's tedious, everything is too simple and there's no tension of any kind. The lack of tension is okay with something like linkffn(Dimension Hopping for Beginners by nonjon), where the point is to poke fun at how unimaginative and unoriginal most fanfiction is. But the Lone Traveler takes itself seriously and falls short.
