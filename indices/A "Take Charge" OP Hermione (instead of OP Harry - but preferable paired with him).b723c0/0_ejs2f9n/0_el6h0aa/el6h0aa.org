  As for the flames, I suspect that among the people who are flaming you, there will be more Harry/Daphne 'shippers than Harry/Ginny. It's not about the 'ship between Harry and Hermione. Rather, it's about you daring to ask for a fic in which Harry's partner (a woman!) might be more powerful than him.

Oh, yes. Things a male character will get praised for will make some people cry "Mary Sue" if it's a female character doing it. Sometimes Harry not doing everything himself is enough to trigger the hatred.
