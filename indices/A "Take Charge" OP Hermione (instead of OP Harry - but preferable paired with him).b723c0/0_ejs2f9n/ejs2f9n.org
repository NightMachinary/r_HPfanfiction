Off the top of my head, here are several that haven't been mentioned so far:

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer) has exactly that and may, one day, update. Right [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]]?
- Ditto linkffn(Labyrinth by Kroontjespen).
- Ditto linkffn(Rule of two, dreams come true by Darklooshkin). Right, [[/u/Darklooshkin]]?
- /Dangerous/ by BlackLotus went down with GrangerEnchanted.com, but someone has saved it: [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwfE6l6RtZAsYlo4cG9IOG9nWnc]] ; also unfinished.

As for the flames, I suspect that among the people who are flaming you, there will be more Harry/Daphne 'shippers than Harry/Ginny. It's not about the 'ship between Harry and Hermione. Rather, it's about you daring to ask for a fic in which Harry's partner (a woman!) might be more powerful than him.
