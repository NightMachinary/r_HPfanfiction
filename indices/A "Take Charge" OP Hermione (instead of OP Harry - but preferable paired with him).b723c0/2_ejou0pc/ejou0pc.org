My linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor) certainly qualifies for the "take-charge characterization" bit, and if I'm being honest, with the "OP!Hermione" bit too. It's not M at all, on the other hand, and doesn't feature a pairing. Still, I think you may enjoy it. Warning: rampant, gleeful insanity.
