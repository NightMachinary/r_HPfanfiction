I don't know how helpful this post will be without knowing which fandom you're interested in using in your crossover but

I recommend keeping the HP world and crossover fandom's world separate. If this can't be done at least try to keep the other fandom's character(s) in character.

As luminphoenix said don't make Harry a moron when it's convenient for the plot but also don't make him a genius either.

Harry, as he is in canon after his third or fourth year, is already OP enough for many fandoms so please don't turn him into Merlin2.0 before he goes to the crossover fandom's world or interacts with their characters.
