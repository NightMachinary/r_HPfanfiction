In what areas? But important points to remember: *dont remove magic, its an integral part of Harry Potter. Harry without magic is just an oc called harry. *Try to avoid canon rehashes of either world. Harry beeing around will change things, think butterfly effect. *Avoid the plotbased stupid ball (Harry is in a desert, is walking in the sun dehydrating and will barely make it. Because he forgot to transform some sand into an umbrella and a goblet, forgot about the augumenti charm for said goblet, forgot a cooling charm, etc) *hp magic is op if used properly, find a nice medium between curbstomping and forgot-i-was-a-wizard!harry *not all readers have done/will do research to refresh their memory of the crossover, dont assume the readers remember everything.
