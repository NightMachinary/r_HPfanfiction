I mean, who knows what Veritaserum does to a baby? It's not like canon ever explores that, we only see it used on an adult and a teenager.

It's not an unacceptable break from canon to have it do the Obelix thing where exposure as a baby makes it somewhat permanent. Especially given in the fic in question, Harry drinks a whole bottle - in canon, 3 drops is enough for the purpose of interrogating an adult for right around an hour.
