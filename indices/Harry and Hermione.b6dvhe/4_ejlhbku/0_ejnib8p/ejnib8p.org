I really tried to get into Notebooks and Letters, but ultimately I just found it to be canon with Hermione substituted for Ginny. With a certain amount of canon-bashing for promoting Harry-Ginny. Those who are strongly committed to Harmony already would probably like it, but for me it lacked any real hook. I like some stories /with/ Harmony, but not specifically /because/ of it.
