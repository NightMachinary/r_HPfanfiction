If you're curious, my own view is that H/Hr could be considered aspirational. Canon!Harry with canon!Hermione would not work, but if you improve one or both of them a bit, maybe put them through some life experiences that would shape them for the better, then it might. If Harry paid more attention to his friends' problems and tried to help them more (canon!Harry really doesn't do this). If Hermione would really listen and consider others' points of view before judging and speaking. If Harry swallowed his pride more often to take good advice. If Hermione learned to laugh more.

With that being my view, I'm not really sympathetic to the idea that Hermione was robbed and should have been the canon ship all along, which is pretty much what Notebooks and Letters is about. But it's perfectly reasonable to me that fics which adjust characters' personalities can do great things with H/Hr. So a transition from writing Harry/Ginny (more like canon) to H/Hr (branching out) makes sense.
