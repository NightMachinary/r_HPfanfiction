Fair enough. As you said, /Notebooks and Letters/ is definitely a HHr story, not a story with HHr in it. It's been a while since I've read it, but I don't think I'd call what's going on in the story "canon-bashing." Rather, I think the author is trying to tell a more realistic story. It's certainly not a perfect fic by any stretch of the imagination.

Interestingly, If you read chemprof's early stories in chronological order, you can literally almost see his development as an author from a Harry/Ginny shipper into a Harry/Hermione supporter. It's neat to see that mental process play out on the page, as it were.

Anyways, of the fics I linked, both /Notebooks and Letters/ and /Time is the Fire/ are definitely more focused on the relationship, while I'd say the others are more plot-driven with the pairing as a secondary concern.
