Harry/Hermione without bashing or harems? I can do that! Here's some of my favorites off the top of my head in no particular order.

- /Coming Back Late/ by alchymie. Totally awesome fic. Deathly Hallows and politics and wonderful characterization. Sadly, it's been abandonded, but there's enough present to provide an exciting read, the story's climax, and a good bit of the resolution. Several points are left hanging, but what'cha gonna do? One of the best HHr fics ever written IMHO. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471922/1/Coming-Back-Late]])

- /Time in the Fire/ by Odment Tweak. This might be my all-time favorite fic. It's not perfect, but it knows how to hit you right in the feels. It's a time-travel fic with a twist. I've probably read this one 50 times. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6033933/1/Time-is-the-Fire]])

- /Resistence/ by lorien829, or really anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/636397/lorien829][loriend829]] for that matter. She's got several wonderful fics that are all worth reading, this is just my favorite of the bunch. It was written before Deathly Hallows - so there's some differences there. It's from Hermione's perspective in a world where Voldemort won the last battle, and it follows how the surviving good guys continue the fight. It's pretty awesome. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance]])

- /Notebooks and Letters/ by chemprof. This is the fic that got me interested in the HHr pairing years ago. The premise is that the published HP books are an embelished telling of the events that really took place. Hermione sits down with her daughter and gives her the real story through reading her old diaries and letters. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3867175/1/Notebooks-and-Letters]])

- /Harry Potter and the Lost Demon/ by Angry Hermione. Written before Deathly Hallows, so again, some differences there. The author is excellent and her characters are spot on. She also adds some new and very imaginative elements to the HP world. She also plays with the soul bond and love potion tropes in a way that is incredibly creative - it's the only time I can think of that they've been done well. Excellent story. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2993199/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lost-Demon]])

- /Returning to the Start/ by timunderwood9. A time travel fic wherein Harry goes back in time and Takes Care Of Business in a somewhat believable manner. Bonus points for him not getting into a creepy relationship with Hermione while she's 13 and he's mentally 30. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start]])

- [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700][/Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire/]] by Coulsdon Eagle. Origingally published on the now defunct Portkey.org, this fic adds some changes to year 5. Because of some tricky magic with unintended consequences, Hermione's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire instead of Harry's. It's a great story. I remember following it as it was being published and the excitement that came with each new update. [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]]

- Finally, if you're looking for something on the lighter and/or funnier side of things, check out what [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/author/5876][kyc639]] published back in the day - again originally on Portkey.org but now archived. He wrote Harry with a great, sarcastic sense of humor. Well worth checking out. [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/author/5876]]

- And then of course there's my humble addition to the fandom: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9203082/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Knight-of-the-Radiant-Heart]]) It doesn't really stand with the above fics, but I'm adding it anyways.

Enjoy!
