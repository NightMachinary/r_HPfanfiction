I'm not a big fan of Harry/Hermione, but a month or so ago I read Harry Crow and really enjoyed it, HOWEVER I also recommended it to somebody else and yet ANOTHER some else started bashing me for rec'ing it, but I figure, when I story has 22k favourites then it's not just me who enjoyed it. It's very out there and fantastical in many ways, but who knows, you might enjoy it too :)
