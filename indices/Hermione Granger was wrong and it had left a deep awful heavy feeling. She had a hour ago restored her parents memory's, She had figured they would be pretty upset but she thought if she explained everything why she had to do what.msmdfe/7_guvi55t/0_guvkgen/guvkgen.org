  "I've also modified my parents' memories so that they're convinced that they're really called Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their life's ambition is to move to Australia, which they have now done. *That's to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them down and interrogate them about me---or you, because unfortunately, I've told them quite a bit about you."*
