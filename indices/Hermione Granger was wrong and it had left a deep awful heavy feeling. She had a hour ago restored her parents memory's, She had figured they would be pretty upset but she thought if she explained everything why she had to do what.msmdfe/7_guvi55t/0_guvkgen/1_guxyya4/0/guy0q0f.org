The keeping them safe part was her sending them to Australia in the first place. The memory modification is the contingency plan in case they get caught anyway.

More generally though, Hermione is acting like a soldier here. She is trying to fulfill the mission at all costs. It is her usual tunnel-vision at work when she found a cause or a mission to champion. What that means is that yes protecting her parents was part of the consideration, but it was not her main priority at the time.

Like I said in another comment, she is morally gray through and through.
