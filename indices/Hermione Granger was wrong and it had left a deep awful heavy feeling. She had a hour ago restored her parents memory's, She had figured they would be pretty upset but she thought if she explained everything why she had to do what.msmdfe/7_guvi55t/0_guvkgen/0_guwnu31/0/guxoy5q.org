The point about the entire thing is that Hermione doesn't know. She doesn't know how to keep them safe. She doesn't know if her measures will work. She can't be there to protect them, and she doesn't know what the Death Eaters are capable of or how far they'll go. So she piled on protection after protection, each and every single thing she knows for both her parents and the mission.

Get them as far away as possible. Make them forget their names so that they will never slip and reveal themselves. Make them forget so any possible information she might have slipped over the years (whatever that information is) would not come out right even if they did get caught.

I agree it's overkill and dehumanizing but the point is that Hermione is desperate enough and paranoid enough to do whatever it takes to ensure that both her parents and the mission are as safe as she can possibly make them. You are asserting that the more human methods you're proposing should have been good enough for her, but at that stage, /nothing/ was good enough. Hermione was well past taking into consideration things like agency and diminishing returns (which was not something she was good at even on the best of days anyway). In her mind, it was better safe than sorry.

Hermione's decision-making here is both cold-blooded and extremely desperate. She is going to give best level of protection she knows how to give because she can't let herself do any less. And it was a greatly unsavory and dehumanizing method yes, but if that's what it takes to keep the mission safe, then so be it. /It is not good enough/, but it's as good as she can make it.

This is the very flawed decision-making of a brilliant teenager with no mentors or peers to help her out. And it leaves a horrible taste in people's mouths, but at the end of the day, it's a quintessentially Hermione decision - one that is as reflective of her flaws as it is of her strengths. It is decisions like these that make her a complex morally gray character.

(Please note that I'm not saying that her actions are moral or ethical. I'm simply arguing that they make sense given her character and her circumstances.)
