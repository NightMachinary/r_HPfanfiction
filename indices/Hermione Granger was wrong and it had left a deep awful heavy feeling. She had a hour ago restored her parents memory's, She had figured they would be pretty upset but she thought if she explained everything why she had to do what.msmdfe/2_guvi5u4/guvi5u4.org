I like the fics that point out that obliviating their memories and giving them new names, does not give them the proper documentation to enter Australia, which is known for having very strict immigration standards.

One such is The Games They Play, in which a cynical 30-year-old Harry travels back in time and takes over his younger self's custody at the trial for underage magic. In this fic, Obliviate is a permanent spell, so there is NO chance they will ever recover their memories. Double slash: older Harry (known as Blake) with Snape and younger Harry with canon males.

  “They never got into Australia,” Blake revealed darkly, keeping a keen eye on Harry and his spell casting. Each spell the fire grew in small proportions, yet he kept control. He wouldn't be able to continue for more than thirty minutes, maybe an hour. The spell took a lot out of you. “They were refused entry: with Granger's spell, they will absolutely be terrified to come back to England. They could be anywhere, and more than likely, the money they have will run out quickly. They will need to work odd jobs, that will barely get them enough money to get by, that's if they're lucky. They may be dentists but their qualifications mean nothing abroad. That is nothing on the hole in their hearts where their memories were ripped from them. No doubt it will cause depression, perhaps even suicidal tendencies, questioning everything in their lives... She may have meant well but what she did was horrific, really.”

There's also a fic---can't remember which one---in which Hermione retrieves her parents and the end of the war and restores their memories, only for them to completely NOT forgive her. She'd sold their practice for less than it was worth, and liquidated their house and belongings at rock-bottom prices, so their retirement funds are now completely gone AND they no longer have an established practice for income. They confiscate her college fund and tell her that she must pay them back all the money they "lost" through her poor financial transactions.
