If I wanted to portray her as a burgening dark witch, maybe.

Although that's an idea. Hermione going deeper into the darkness because of a combination of a drive for what she perceives as the creation of a better world, and an increasing pushback from the world at large; leading to a vicious cycle of her doing darker and darker things, and the world reacting to it with more and more belligerance.
