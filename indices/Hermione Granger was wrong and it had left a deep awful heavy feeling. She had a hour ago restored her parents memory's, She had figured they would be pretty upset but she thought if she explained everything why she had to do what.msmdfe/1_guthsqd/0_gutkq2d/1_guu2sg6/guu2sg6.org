I mean, that's damn near canon, in my opinion.

Harry and Ron don't feel like doing their homework? Make them.

The house elves are scared to be free and don't want to take the chance? /Make them./

You don't get the DADA education you deserve? Trick your friend into leading an illegal afterschool club.

Someone talks about the illegal afterschool club? Snitches get stitches.

The boy you like is dating someone else? Violence.

The way I see it, Hermione after the war would become either Minister of Magic or a Dark Lord with no in between. Her temperament would require her to bring the magical world liberty, justice, and progress. /Whether they want it or not./
