Not just after book 4. Basically, attitude from the beginning is "I will try to stop you from breaking the rules --- unless it's my idea and then you MUST do it."

First year: tries to stop Harry from getting Neville's remembrall back, tries to prevent them from going to the after-hours duel (and when that fails follows them: how does that make sense?), /petrifies/ Neville and leaves him on the common room floor ALL NIGHT when he tries to stop them ... but instruts Harry to break into the restricted section (while she's conveniently gone for the holidays and can't get into any trouble for it, and is a willing participant in both hiding a dragon and smuggling it out of the country---both not only against the rules but flat-out ILLEGAL. Oh, and don't forget SHE SET A TEACHER ON FIRE!

Second year: illicitly brews (against the rules) a restricted potion (against the law), in order to drug, kidnap, and impersonate other students. Steals the ingredients to do so, by having the boys (again, so they'll take the brunt of the blame if caught) create a potentially-lethal distraction in the most dangerous classroom environment they have. She's have probably done more if she hadn't been petrified for several months toward the end.

Third year: time turners are strictly regulated by the Ministry, so why was she granted one just because she is unable to make a goddamned CHOICE between which classes to take? Granted that's more Dumbledore/McGonagall breaking the rules than her, but she is made very aware of the absolute secrecy she must maintain because it's not actually a kosher use of the device. After academically cheating for the entire year, with the collusion of both of the highest school authorities---yes, it's cheating to be have more time to study than the other students (and she is a big fat hypocrite for giving Harry such a hard time about that potions book in HBP)---she uses it to break the law---that the law is being corrupted in this case and the actions are morally just does not change the lawbreaking aspect. At least in this case she was in equal danger of facing legal repercussions. This was an early sign of the vigilantism---which she was praised for in this instance---that drives her to memory charm her parents. This example is not strictly bullying, but it does show her deciding when the boys are allowed to break the rules (taking Harry with her on the save-Sirius-and-Buckbeak adventure) and when they are not (not telling them about it the whole year, while gaslighting them about her abrupt appearances). Not to mention she punched Malfoy in the face with no repercussions at all.

Basically, every time in this series that the trio take the law/rules into their own hands, they are praised and rewarded. Is it any wonder she has no sense of boundaries? She's being taught high-handedness by the one person in canon who is shown to ALWAYS thinks he knows better than anybody else. Both she and Dumbledore seem to believe, "I'm smart, so I know what's best." She already worshipped him on the train first year, so that she takes her moral cues from him is no surprise.
