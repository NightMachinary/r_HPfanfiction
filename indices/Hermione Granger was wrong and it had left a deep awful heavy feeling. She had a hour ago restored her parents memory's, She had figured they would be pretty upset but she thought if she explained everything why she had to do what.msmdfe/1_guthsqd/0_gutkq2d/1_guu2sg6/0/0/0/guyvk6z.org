You are absolutely right about everything, couldn't agree more. I always thought that she was used like a Deus Ex Machina trope in the scenes so that she could be always pictured right(even when in the start she isn't)/not cruel cause it was justified to do so in that moment/wont take any consequences or even apologize/have a character arc about it. She doesn't grow at all in canon, or if she does but that's a minor thing.
