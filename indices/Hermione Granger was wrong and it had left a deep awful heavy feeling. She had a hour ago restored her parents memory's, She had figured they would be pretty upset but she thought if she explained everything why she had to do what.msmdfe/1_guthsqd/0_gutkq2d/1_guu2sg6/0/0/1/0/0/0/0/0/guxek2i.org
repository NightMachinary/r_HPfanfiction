Also, my school doesn't have class rankings. Why should it have one? While it is true that there are better students, we don't who is. We don't know each other's grades unless we ask. Actually I never heard of a school with ranking, except in anime. That might be because I'm from Brazil.

I'm somewhat sure that rankings, if they are as common as you seem to indicate, are a major cause of bullying. I never encountered bullying before in any of my schools, but maybe I'm just blind.
