  Hermione only gets a few extra hours so she can be in all her classes.
#+end_quote

I don't believe this for a second. She had TWO more classes than could be attended in person. The time-turner allows her to turn back in FIVE-hour blocks --- and is in no way limited to one block per day. With as obsessive as she was about studying and learning, she was NOT only using the two hours she needed to attend the classes, while sticking to "normal" hours for everything else. She was turning back time whenever she felt she wanted to read one more chapter, get in one more trip to the library, add one more foot to her essay. With as exhausted as canon showed her getting, you will NEVER convince me that she only used it to attend the doubled-up classes. (But wasn't clever enough to use it to give herself extra sleep to make up for her extended days---or to go back in time when she accidentally slept through a class, to make it so she didn't miss it after all.)

  Hermione just studied more.
#+end_quote

What the hell kind of school did you go to, where class rank meant nothing? Even just making prefect was a reward for studying more. Teachers give out class points for answering questions which, let's see, more study time gives her a clear advantage. Plus, I'm quite convinced that there was at least one occasion where she used to to avoid being late back from curfew.

Hermione got 10 O.W.L.s, because she dropped two classes (and thus no longer needed the time-turner). Percy and Bill had 12 O.W.L.s each, which meant they both took all the classes. So either they changed the schedule in the two years since Percy's class, or the ministry regularly allows students to have extra time. Do you think Percy's 12 OW.L.s contributed to his early career advancement? Damn straight it did. Thus, *using the time-turner gives a reward*.

But, you're clearly in the "Harry cheated but Hermione did not" camp, so I'm not sure there's any value in continuing this conversation.
