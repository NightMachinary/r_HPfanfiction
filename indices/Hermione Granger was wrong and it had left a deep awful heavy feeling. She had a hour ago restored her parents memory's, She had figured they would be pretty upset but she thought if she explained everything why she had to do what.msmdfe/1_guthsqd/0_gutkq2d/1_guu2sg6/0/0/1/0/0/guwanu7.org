Hermione only gets a few extra hours so she can be in all her classes. She does extra time for the same classes. It should be noted Hogwarts is an place of learning, not of competition.

Hermione has to learn everything unassisted, Harry gets tips.

Also, Harry cheating literally got him a reward. Hermione just studied more.
