Eh. Their daughter was in the front lines of a civil war and has all the evidence to prove the reality of the danger she (and by extension, her parents) was in.

If Hermione's parents are anything like her, I figure the reconciliation would look a lot like how Hermione reacted to Ron returning in DH - a lot of hurt feelings, an unwillingness to forgive, and then forgiving anyway after some time had passed. There would be consequences and lingering hurt for sure, but not a total break in the relationship.

I personally think their relationship would look something like the one in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20618525][Uncle Bobby]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19662142][Tea with Mrs. Granger]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17243501][Trust A Few]], or [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25575292][People Who Never Were]]. There are lingering scars, but they love each other enough to work through them anyway.
