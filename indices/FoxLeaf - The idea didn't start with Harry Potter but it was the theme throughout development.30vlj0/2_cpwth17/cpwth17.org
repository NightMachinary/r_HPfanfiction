Critique Time =D

First, at least on mobile, when you go to books and there are those categories starting with 'fantasy', 'thriller', etc, the books when you scroll down change, but unless you scroll down past the (very large) categories, there's no indication anything on the page changed. I was expecting a new page full of books to load, so I was confused for a minute. Maybe fade out the inactive categories? And/or make them narrower bands, so they take up less scroll-space? ((And the fact that the category pictures are different sizes and don't always fit into their boxes really bothers me. Crop is a thing. Greyspace just makes it look unprofessional, I mean they aren't even centred))

Secondly, I think books should be organised by series (for example, I scrolled down until I found Harry Potter, but it was "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets". Wouldn't it make more sense to have all the art and scenes for all the Harry Potter books (and Game of Thrones books, etc) in one place? It would make it feel much less messy. ((Speaking of messy, am I the only one craving equal-size tiles for the books, that don't vary by how much text is under the cover picture? I mean, I get that the layout is rather Pinterest-style but I'd feel so much less OCD if all the book-tiles were the same size.))

Also, you have a picture of a book above "Ron Weasley" in aforementioned Chamber of Secrets category. Doesn't really go with the stated goal of the website to let people imagine what the characters look like.

Thirdly, I can't figure out the order that the books under each category are in? Maybe you should allow visitors browsing through the books to sort them, by title, author, popularity on the site (aka amount of content), release date.... Etc.

On the plus side, the theme looks fantastic =D and I think it's a great idea, although [[/u/Frix]] is right that you need artists. PMing active artists on DeviantArt to see if they'd consider crossposting their work/linking to your site might be a good place to start, if you're serious about it. Also if you're serious about it, Search Engine Optimisation is a thing =)
