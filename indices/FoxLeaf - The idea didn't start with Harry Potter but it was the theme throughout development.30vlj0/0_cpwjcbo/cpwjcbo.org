This is your typical "chicken-and-egg" problem. Nobody will use this site because there is no content, and there never will be content because nobody uses this site.

In order to break this stalemate you would need to inject it with a starting amount of content yourself. In order for this to actually work. Now don't get me wrong, I didn't say "draw it yourself", but you must get in contact with actual artists (like on deviantart) and convince them to post all their stuff on there. Realistically speaking, we are talking about 10.000-100.000 images of every major fandom before this would be worth the time.

Other problems.

- The frontpage is a giant mess. Why the hell would anyone be interested in a random assortment of random pictures from all kinds of random series??
- Some "drawings" are just scenes from the movies people copied on there. Not only can this not be the purpose of your site, this actually counts as copyright infringement. You will need a system in place to find and remove these types of images.
- Also: copyright infringement in general. Do you know what is or isn't legal regarding just posting scenes from books? And I mean, did you actually discuss this with a lawyer? Because you do not want to face certain authors in court over this. make sure your bases are covered.
- A lot of books added are completely empty. Why? What's the point of adding an empty book?

Just a side-note really, but I noticed there are no ads on this site. While that is nice for me, I must wonder how you intend to pay for server upkeep in the long run? is this just your pet-project that will die out as soon as you get bored with it?
