Okay, I need to say I am not a lawyer.

There are some massive problems with this as others are writing, but I want to focus on a few that really bothered me. The creation of accounts for artists and others without their permission. You have pulled their usernames automatically and link to their DA accounts, which gives credit, but you are also reposting in a way that is not exactly fair use under US copyright law. Again, IANAL, and yet I can tell from the terms of use of the site, that this is not okay:

#+begin_quote
  your account is not named in a manner that misleads others into thinking that you are another person or company; and By submitting Content to FoxLeaf for inclusion on the Website, you grant FoxLeaf a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting
#+end_quote

And this part seems antithetical to what you are proposing this site be used for:

#+begin_quote
  As FoxLeaf asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others.
#+end_quote

It's a great idea in theory, but the way you go about it practice is where the problems begin. There is a site that does this already for HP, which I think is an excellent example of what it seems you are trying to do. The [[http://hpcompanion.com/][Harry Potter Companion]]

Try doing something similar, without making it seem like the content creators are making accounts on your site.

Also, payment to keep the site running was mentioned. As soon as you start using ads or accepting payment on a site that has content you do not own or do not have permission to post, you are entering into a whole other world of legal trouble.

Best of luck with your venture! The site is smoothly designed, but a big mess to navigate and it is hard to know what I'm looking at.
