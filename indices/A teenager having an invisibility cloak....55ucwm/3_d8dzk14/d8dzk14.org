Not quite, but in this fic [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/swords-and-sorcery-fate-stay-night-harry-potter.399084/page-68#post-26471503]]

It's stated that Iris Potter (inexplicably female Harry Potter) was very likely concieved under the Invisibility Cloak, with Shirou from Fate Stay Night doing his analytical power thingy and seeing flashes of... Well... Red hair and flushed faces, to say it genteely.

Is decent fic, for going off the rails of canon pretty quickly, though some bits are strange.
