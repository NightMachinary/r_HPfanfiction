I could picture this happening in a fic where James had to marry someone other than Lily (maybe pure blood politics reasons). Maybe nobody knows that Harry's mum is actually Lily - they just know him as Potter's bastard. Most suspect Harry is the result of a single liaison between James and some unnamed muggle woman.
