  AU GOF. Neutral! Harry. The 'Boy Who Lived' is Harry's older twin. Neglected by his family, intelligence constantly underestimated, his placement in Slytherin house is a shock. Disowning him was their worst possible mistake. Along with his friend Draco Malfoy he faces the challenges of the Twizard Tournament. Beware the Midnight Sun... Part One of a Duology. Mild Swearing, PRE-SLASH, Het.
