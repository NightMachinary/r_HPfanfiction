Do you want the biology? Here's a site that explains>: [[https://www.verywellfamily.com/twins-with-different-fathers-2447116]]. Basically, it's the same as with any fraternal twins. Fraternal twins happen when the woman releases more than one egg, and they are both fertilized, each by separate sperm. It can happen at the same time, but it doesn't have to. If a woman has sex with two different men during the time the eggs are viable, each egg can be fertilized by sperm from a different man. It definitely happens frequently with litters of puppies and other animals!
