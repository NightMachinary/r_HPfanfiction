Yes. the issue with Seer Luna as a whole is A. she's too sane and B. She gets perfect future vision. Give her seizure like episodes where she gets multiple different flashes of possible futures.

make the future a road with multiple paths and Luna is being constantly bombarded with different possible routes. It's only until things start getting closer to a route that she's able to discern what path they're heading on.

Another interesting take that I would love to see would be to make her Like Rikka from When they Cry (Higurashi), make it so she's time looping the time between 1991-1999 and whenever she dies she loops back to 1991 until she achieves her "Happy ending", that way she's seen as a "Seer" when in reality she's just time looping.
