I think it would be less annoying (to the reader, not to the characters) if seer!Luna was like the Quills from Warframe. The Quills see the future with clarity. All possible futures. At once. As a consequence, they exist as some sort of collective consciousness of all their timeline-selves that drifts between past, present, and future. A single sentence walks between tenses at random. Focusing enough to exist in the present moment "excruciates". The scale of the ability would have to be toned down a bit for Luna to not manipulate the best outcome all the time, but that might be a fun portrayal.
