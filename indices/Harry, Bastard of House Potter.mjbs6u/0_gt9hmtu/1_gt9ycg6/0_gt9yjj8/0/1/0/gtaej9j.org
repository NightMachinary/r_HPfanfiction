I feel like it's mostly an issue for people who have been in the fandom for a long ass time. I more or less spent the entirety of high school and uni reading fanfiction, and by now I feel like I've read all the great fics, so going on FFN or AO3 is pretty much browsing through the shit tier fics looking for something good that just didn't get popular.

You don't really notice it unless you dig through the archives a lot, but I'd say a good 50% of the fandom is the same five or so fics paraphrased by different authors. Especially ones written between 2010 and 2014, for some reason.
