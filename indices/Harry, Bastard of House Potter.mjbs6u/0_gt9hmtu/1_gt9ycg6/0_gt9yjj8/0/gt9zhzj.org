The problem is that it's been in so many edgelord and trash fics that it automatically incites a "oh this fics going to be one of those fics" responses in my brain. Magical Cores and Seer Luna does the exact same thing for me as well, along with "Ancient and Noble" and "So Mote It Be" the tropes and names have been in so many garbage tier fics that it colors your opinion of any fic that has them, even if they're good.
