Well, maybe if it`s a time travel fic and he goes to the Middle Ages or even the 1800`s where Harry wasn't a regular IIRC, instead of Hadrian, that's a roman name and would be popular in certain places.

It's just that people think Harry is a too common name(even if it's the name of an /actual/ Prince) and Hadrian can sound noble and posh, and not too out there, while still similar enough to Harry.

Or if Harry needs to change his name, but the author needs the name to look similar, what would be an alternative?

Not like Harry seems to be a common name for purebloods? Maybe Henry would work?
