The Potters use names of Royalty: Henry, James, Harry. Petunia named her son Dudley. Basically, it's Dudley who's more common, not Harry. It's a joke by JKR, specifically for showing that Petunia doesn't really know what she's talking about. Harry was a nickname for many kings called Henry. Much like Henry (Harry) Potter, they were Harry to their friends. I would suspect that some nobles used the name in a similar fashion.
