I'll also accept it if he absolutely HATES being called Hadrian. Imagine growing up with the name Harry and then suddenly everyone expects you to respond to Hadrian.

Or a less abusive Dursleys story where Petunia takes Harry to Diagon Alley to avoid the FREAKS approaching her house. Harry doesn't learn he's Hadrian Potter, since Hadrian Potter has been off riding dragons and whatnot. All those books say so. While Harry would love to joke about their eerily similar names, he clearly isn't Hadrian Potter. Probably wouldn't work as more than a one-shot, but still fun.
