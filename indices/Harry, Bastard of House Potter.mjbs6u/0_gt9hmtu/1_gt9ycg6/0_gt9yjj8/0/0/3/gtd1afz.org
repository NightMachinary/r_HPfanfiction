You do know that actually exists?

I don't remember the title, but the short of it is that Voldemort lives up to his totle as BBEG and Harry needs to buy some time. His response? Break the curse on the ruins (Merlin really didn't like some Roman building a wall on his land and didn't want anyone repairing it) and repair the original Hadrian's Wall, as well as the protective spells on it that laughed at whatever Scots threw at it. Bought a few weeks.
