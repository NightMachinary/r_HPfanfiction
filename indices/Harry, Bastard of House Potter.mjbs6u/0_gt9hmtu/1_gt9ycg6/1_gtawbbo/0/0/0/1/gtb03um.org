By that reasoning, fanfiction should not exist. All we need to know or all that can happen is spelled out in the books, so there's no point. I get not liking it because you think its a stupid-ass name, or because it's associated with fics you don't like, but I don't get the argument that things can't happen because they don't happen in cannon.
