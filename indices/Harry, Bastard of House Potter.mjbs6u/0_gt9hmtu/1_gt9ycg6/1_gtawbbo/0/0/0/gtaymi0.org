Which is kind of all we need to know? Like I get that JK Rowling chose Harry since it was one of her favorite boy names at the time. But in universe it is literally established that Harry's name is Harry, it's not Henry (like it probably should be) or any other weird Har-derivative name. It's Harry, that either means the Potter's are boring when it comes to name choice or they like simple names.
