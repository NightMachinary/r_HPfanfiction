I think it more has to do of how we perceive that person. Joffrey was raised by Cersei to think of himself as almighty and everyone else was an inferior creature compared to him. It's pretty much like we squash a bug (that's a life taken too). Dumbledore always appears superior to people around him through his dominating presence. Malfoys believe Muggleborns are inferior creatures, dehumanized.

Although I think that (and I neither agree with any trope that leads to Dramione, nor do I think it's romantic in nature) Draco has some respect for Hermione. He talks about her to his parents, he copies her tactics from OotP in HBP so there might be a possibility that those words might come from jealousy. So I'll give you that.
