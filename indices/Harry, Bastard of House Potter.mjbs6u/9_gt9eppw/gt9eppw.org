I find it very hard to equate HARRY POTTER to ASOIAF world. But I can stretch things, sure. Let's do it!!

Robert is the king in ASOIAF. The Minister of Magic is Fudge.

Master of Coin is Petyr Baelish. His opposite is Lucius Malfoy.

Grand Maester is Pycelle. His opposite is Dumbledore.

Master of Laws is Renly Baratheon. His opposite is actually his opposite, the Lady Amelia Bones.

Master of ships is Stannis Baratheon. In a complete reversal, Stannis is much better than Madame Edgecombe.

(This is where we learn that the spies are completely fucken useless. GoT side because he wants chaos, HoP side because he wants Harry Potter to suffer.)

Master of Whisperers: I don't fucken Care. They both need to die poste haste!
