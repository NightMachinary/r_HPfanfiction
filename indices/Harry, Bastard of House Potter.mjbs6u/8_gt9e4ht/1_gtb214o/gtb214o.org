I've read the first few chapters and find it kinda odd how Hermione keeps popping up with all this knowledge and wisdom. And she's so perceptive that she understands /everything/ Harry is thinking. And then she leaves ominous warnings.

Is there any reason for this? I mean, Harry said it himself, they never talked before. Yet suddenly she's acting like Dumbledore 2.0

I wanna keep reading but itd be really dissatisfying if all of this is just Hermione being a plot device and it's never explained
