There's the ongoing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13695706/1/Brothers][Brothers]] series by Writing Sins Not Tragedies, which is currently in its second book. It's a flowerpot fic where Harry is the illegitimate child of Sirius and Lily, conceived on a drunken night when Lily and James were temporarily fighting/broken up. James and Lily's son is the BWL even though Harry was there too on the night Voldemort came. It's an interesting read, and I definitely recommend it, especially if you like Harry/Fleur
