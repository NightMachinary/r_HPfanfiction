  Teen Tom Riddle travels to the future where he is known as Lord Voldemort

Worth noting that teenage Riddle already called himself Lord Voldemort among his budding circle of cronies, though obviously he wasn't known by that name to his professors. He probably created the name as soon as he found out Riddle was a Muggle's name.
