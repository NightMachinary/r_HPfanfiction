  It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front.

  He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944.

  She had checked.  [ ALTERNATIVELY - Hermione finds Tom Riddle's diary, but not everything is different. ]

  There is only one person Lord Voldemort trusts to guide Harry Potter through the Triwizard Tournament and into his Muggle father's graveyard at the opportune moment. It is not Barty Crouch Junior. “His name is Professor Riddle, and at least for now, no matter who you ask, nobody knows anything more. Professor Riddle, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher.”

  Hermione has always been a warrior for the Light. But when an attempt to salvage more than a Pyrrhic victory lands her in 1944, she quickly realizes that sometimes it is best to allow a lesser evil to flourish, because defeating it only creates the conditions for a greater one to rise. With conspiracies, schemes, and difficult choices in every corner, and a charismatic young Tom Riddle who is increasingly interested in her, she will eventually have to answer the question: How much darkness and grey in him can she accept?
