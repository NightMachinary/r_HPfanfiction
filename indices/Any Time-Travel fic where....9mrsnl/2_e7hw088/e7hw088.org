Not sure where you stand on Tom/Hermione (Tomione) but there are quite a few that have premises similar to this, some have a Horacrux Tom in a role that puts him in a position against himself.

War Paint is a great one where Hermione gets the Diary instead of Ginny. linkao3(1731827)

Renatus is a WIP: linkao3(14655447)

There's also a TON of Time Travel fics, but usually it's Hermione going back and he learns about what he becomes and his path changes but not really any show downs between past/future selves in these.

Choosing Grey, a bit on the epic side in length; linkao3(5121731)

EDITS: I botched this by accidentally copying the wrong numbers for the fics. I've edited but hopefully FanfictionBot will correct?
