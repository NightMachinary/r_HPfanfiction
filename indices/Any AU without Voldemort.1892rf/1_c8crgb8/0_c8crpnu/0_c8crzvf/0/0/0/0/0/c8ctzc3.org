Well, I don't know! I'd have to do some thinking about it. I'm sure many, many things would be different.

My impression and quick online research suggests that Grindelwald, for instance, has no bias against Muggle-born or Half-Blood wizards--just against Muggles. He also doesn't seem interested in /killing/ Muggles, but rather in bringing the Wizarding World out into the open and gaining /control/ of them "for the greater good."

I highly doubt that a wizard like that would--even if he is fascinated with the dark arts--have done what Dumbledore did: let Tom Riddle, Jr. survive that first interview in the orphanage.

I can also imagine him personally selecting the most talented/promising children to attend Durmstrang, again "for the greater good" -- he'd want /them/ to be brought up with the most power. That could lead to an entirely different core trio. He might hobble other children by sending them to the other schools and offering a sub-par education.

If he beat Dumbledore and there was no LV, then the UK would be firmly under G's thumb by the time James, Lily, and their peers were in school. The entire attitude of many families might be different. Perhaps the changes would be so profound that Molly and Arthur only had one or two children--not the pack they have now. IE, Bill and Charlie, but no Ron . . . Perhaps Harry would exist, and have the tag-along sister that Ginny was at first. It's an entirely open question. An interesting one.

Thanks for the idea!
