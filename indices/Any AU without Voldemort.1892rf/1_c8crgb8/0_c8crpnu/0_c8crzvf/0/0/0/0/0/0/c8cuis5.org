You are very welcome :)

Another thought. We know LV were in London doing the blitz, imagine if you would, that he died doing a bombing.

As for the evil that lurks in the shadows we should think about the era. Grindlewald is the equivalent of the nazi-movement, whereas LV is along the lines of fascism. Were it to be in the 50's to 80's we might be thinking something along the lines of a cold war drama. But the 90's?

Hmm. There might be a huge power gap, but that wouldn't really be something of interest when writing about Harry and Hogwarts.

There's always the old conflict about new and old traditions, where it's a subplot in many fanfics. Damn it! I can't think of any good antagonists from the top of my head.
