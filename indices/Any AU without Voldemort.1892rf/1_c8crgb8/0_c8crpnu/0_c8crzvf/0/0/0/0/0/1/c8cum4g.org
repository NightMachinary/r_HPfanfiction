I think Harry would exist, but grow up with James and Lily.

With every oppressor, there's always a resistance, and I think J&L are the type of people who would secretly be a part of it. Lily, at the very least, would be strongly against Grindlewalds views. But of course, publicly speaking out against him would have.. /unpleasant/ results, so it would be more of an underground movement, like the Order of the Phoenix. Assuming Harry sides against Grindlewald, maybe something could happen, like James and Lily being discovered to be against Grindlewald, and subsequently executed? Then, Harry is left to protect his sister and get revenge.

Major characters in canon such as Draco, Hermione, Neville and Luna could be included also, although I see this story as one that happens more in the later years, with less time spent in Hogwarts. So maybe older characters such as Bill and Charlie would be more prominent. Oh and Tonks! Because Tonks is /awesome/.

I don't know, that's just my take on it. It would definitely be an interesting read.
