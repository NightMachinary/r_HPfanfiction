It's not easy, and there'd be practically no way to have canon characters still be IC in such a different world. I guess you'd have to think of who would have their beliefs most challenged by the different regime.

If Grindelwald is tied to WW2 and the nazis, it isn't a perfect parallel, not if Grindelwald had no interest in exterminating Muggles. So, we can ask--if looking for an antagonist--who would be the /real/ opponents to a world in which Wizards are openly in power and Muggles are subservient.

I guess the opposition would come from two sides: the Pureblood-supremacists like the Malfoys and the Blacks on one side (would not agree with Grindelwald that all wizards are superior to Muggles, even Muggle-borns) and rebel pro-Muggle-abolitionists. It would be strange to see an alliance of that sort . . . it would be very uncomfortable. Kind of like Spike and Buffy's compromise in Season Two of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

This would take very careful plotting and I have a hard time seeing how any of the JKR characters would survive. I mean--Hermione as a witch, but raised by parents who are basically enslaved? Harry raised in a wealthy household? Draco as the son of resistance-fighter (though not for good motivations)?
