[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][Here]] is a story I stumbled across a while ago called /The Skitterleap/. Essentially, Grindlewald won, Dumbledore lost, and now we see the HP universe as it unfolded. It's actually really fascinating. Follows Harry, and we see some other familiar faces as well.

Edit: It has Voldemort in it, but as Riddle, and he isn't the prime enemy of Harry and the others at all.
