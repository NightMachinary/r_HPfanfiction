Sometimes I like those, too. However, other times I get lost in the middle . . . the writing just peters out.

It is interesting how fanfic readers love massive stories, while the trend in publishing is to go shorter, shorter, and shorter.

I've been reading that--if you want to have any real hope of publishing a debut novel--you have to trim it down to about 50,000-90,000 words. Anything longer than that, and it becomes too expensive an investment for publishers to risk on a new, unproven author.
