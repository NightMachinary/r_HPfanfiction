Hermione Granger and the Crystal of Time is one of my all-time favorites. Hermione (33) and Severus Snape (54) (Wizards don't crack) have an awesome murder mystery. Look for it on Fanfiction.net.

The Beggar-Thief starring Hermione and Draco and Scorpius and ...Aliens? Super duper awesome. I don't think it's a crossover it just has aliens and they do NOT come in peace. Look on Fanfiction.net.
