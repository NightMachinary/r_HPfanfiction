I preferred /Those Gilded Chains We Wear/ for the way it handled falling in love with someone who is severely mentally ill. It was intense, and messy, and evocative. /Time Heals All Wounds/ was good, but I felt it got sloppy at times with the writing quality, and I didn't like it as much. Probably have to read it again to figure out exactly what bothered me about it.

High five on the Bellamione rec though.
