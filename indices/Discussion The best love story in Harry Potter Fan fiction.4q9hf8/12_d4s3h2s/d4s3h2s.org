Basically anything Jeconais writes tbh. I also read a fic very recently called linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) which as far as I can tell is basically the best harry/fleur centric fic on the internet. As for the all time best romance? Vox Corporis is definitely up there, I can't think of a better one off the top of my head.
