I've written a couple stories that I think could probably be contenders:

the first one is called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11164549/1/Bill-Fleur-s-Excellent-Honeymoon][Bill and Fleur's Excellent Honeymoon]]. It explores their relationship (and their honeymoon) as well as some adventures they get into along the way as they navigate what it means to be husband and wife.

I won a judge's pick on my story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11334833/1/Snape-s-Last-Request][Snape's Last Request]] which also has romance but is tied to a mystery and the making of the Polyjuice potion.

Then there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11518403/1/A-Knowing-Heart][A Knowing Heart]], which is a Harry/Luna story I wrote for a friend.

I wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11730076/1/A-Thousand-and-One-First-Dates][A Thousand And One First Dates]] for the OTP respect round of the QLFC last year and received a 10/10 on it. I'm not really a huge fan of James/Lily romance stories either way, so it was a challenge to write it, but I think I did a pretty good job.

Finally, I wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11895918/1/A-Taste-of-Fire-and-Ash][A Taste of Fire and Ash]] for my Grindledore-favoring friend.

I pretty much write any pairing, though Severus/adult-Hermione is my favorite.
