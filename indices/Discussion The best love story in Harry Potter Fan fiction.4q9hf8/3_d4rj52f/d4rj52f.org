My favorite is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695][TURN by Saras_Girl]]. It is recommended a lot as being one of the best HP/DM fics, but I would also say it is a great and very creative love story. The premise is that due to some "it's a wonderful life" type magic, Harry gets to live for awhile in the AU he would have had if he had apologized to Draco after the sectumsempra incident. Pretty much everything is better for him in that life (his career and his relationship with Draco certainly), but his kids who he loves so much don't exist. After that glimpse, he has to go back to his regular life with Ginny and make some hard decisions about his marriage and his career. And, maybe try to cultivate a relationship with Draco.

What makes it such a great love story is that after the "glimpse," Harry knows that he and real-life Draco could have had a great love but this Draco doesn't know that and Harry has to tread so lightly in his pursuit of a relationship with him. As the reader, you are rooting for them so hard because you already know how great it could be.
