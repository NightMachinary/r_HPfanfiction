I don't think there's such a thing as the best love story, specifically because fanfic of the shipping variety is so fiercely tied to love for or identification with a particular character or pairing. You may swear by the most beautifully written and persuasive Harry/Ginny or Harry/Draco fic in the world, and it will probably fail to hold my interest. It's not the author's fault. Fanfic tastes are stubbornly personal, sometimes downright irrational.

I don't have much appetite for fluff, or much patience with it. For shipfic, I like my heart to be broken on the way to having it healed. I like imperfect unions. I like obsession and conflicted feelings and passion that persists against the character's will.

I adore Snape/Harry. Those of you who hate the pairing might as well stop reading right here.

Probably my favorite romance fic in all of HP (which feels truer than calling it "the best," while knowing some people would despise it for the pairing alone):

This is a much beloved fic in Snape/Harry fandom, and the comments are a testament to the writer's ability to sweep them into another world. Readers cry over this story and remember it for years.

To demonstrate how different one's ideas of romance might be, here's another Snarry fic I consider romantic, even though the love story is more of a means by which Snape is able to reclaim himself. It presents Harry as gay and entirely at ease with himself, while Snape is a cross-dresser (but not for kink purposes; it's sadder and more complex than that), has almost given up magic, and is paralyzed by self-loathing. It's a poignant story and an allegory of coming out, of learning not to be ashamed of who you are. Harry is marvelous and warm in this fic, and Snape is poignant and fascinating and worn to the bone.
