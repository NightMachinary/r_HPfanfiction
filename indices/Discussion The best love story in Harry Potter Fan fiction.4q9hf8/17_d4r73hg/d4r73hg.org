I hate fluffy. I have never read a very good love story in fanfiction, yes, sometimes there are interesting romances, and the only good quality is that they end in a display of pure unadulterated love, as you said. This is the same quality as cheap novels you can buy on a holiday to read and not think at all. And there are some stories that keep repeating how this is the one big pure love and they would do anything for one another, bla bla bla. Those stories are the worst, I think.
