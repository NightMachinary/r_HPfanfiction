Disclaimer: I read very few outright romance fics.

I'll start by saying I've never actually read a good fic where the predominant genre is romance. Sure, I've seen the recs for linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) and linkffn(Grow Young With Me) but even both of those fics fall under the territory of "enough fluff to make me throw up."

I'm sure there are other fics that have requisite drama and don't constraint themselves to typical shipping tropes. Linkffn(Unlike A Sister) is the only one that immediately comes to mind, but even that eschews all other plot points in favor of Harry and Hermione's forbidden tango.

What I would look for is a fic that is based on romance but uses the relationship to explore a larger problem. It could be anything from adjusting to a post-Voldemort world or the struggles of keeping together a Wealsey-PTSD family or rebuilding the Ministry in the aftermath of a coup. While some fics incorporate those points, an overwhelmingly large majority of fics are focused on resolving the ship.

Yes, they might have elements of rebuilding the Ministry or Hogwarts or trying to put the pieces back together of a family, but the overriding focus always seems to be "How are X/Y going to get together" or "How are X/Y going to stay together" or "How will X/Y get over Y/Z's relationship."

Before this gets to ranty, a good love/romance fic isn't necessarily about the romance between two characters. It's usually about two people finding romance while overcoming other external factors, not two people using romance to overcome external factors.
