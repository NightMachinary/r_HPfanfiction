Sounds a lot like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make A Wish]] where Harry decides that if he's going to be killed by Voldie due to a prophecy, he will at least have some fun first and goes on a Grand Tour.

Things then take on a life of their own (overly-helpful prophetic Shopkeepers, mad scientists, random misunderstandings, accidental magical upgrades, failed assassination missions) and by the end, Harry has inadvertently created a new personae as an Immortal Wizard Atoning For His Past... and he doesn't even realize he's done it!
