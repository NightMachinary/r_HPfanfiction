I love the idea, the SCP-and the Wizarding World are a really good match IMO and you could make an interesting story out of it. I don't know why, I think Iâ€˜m just bias, but I believe the SCP Foundation should keep the upper hand in such a universe. When you think with what they deal on a daily basis, the Wizarding world should be a walk in the park for them.
