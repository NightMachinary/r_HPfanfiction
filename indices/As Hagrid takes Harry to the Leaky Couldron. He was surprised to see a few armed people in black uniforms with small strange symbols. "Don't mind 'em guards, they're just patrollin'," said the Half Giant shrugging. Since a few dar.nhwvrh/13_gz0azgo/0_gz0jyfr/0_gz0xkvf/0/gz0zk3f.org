But still idea of either SCP or GOC or any other organization from SCP-verse simply stumbling upon wizards is ridiculous. The very nature of all of those organizations and GOC's and SCP's definition of baseline normal would be very different from what you see in vanilla SCP-verse. GOC and ICW would be one and the same organization, while SCP would be it more muggle science favoring counter-part. And that is putting aside all other players on anomalous field. Voldemort can't hold a candle in terms of danger to some random douchebag from AWCY? who compensates lack of artistic abilities with murderous anomality.
