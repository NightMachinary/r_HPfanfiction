Item #: SCP-8076

Object Class: +Keter+ +Euclid+ Keter

Special Containment Procedures: As SCP-8076 is largely self-containing and much more extensive than first predicted, containment and/or neutralization is considered unfeasible at this time. Diplomatic contact with the governing bodies of SCP-8076's population, designated SCP-8076-A, is to be maintained. Locations of importance to instances of SCP-8076-A, designated SCP-8076-B, are to be monitored at all times. In the event of a breach in containment, SCP-8076-A authorities are to be notified immediately, and the closest MTF Theta-17 ("Aurors") operatives are to be deployed.

Description: SCP-8076 is the designation given to a population of anomalous energy wielders, and all anomalies related to them.

That's about as far as I've gotten. Writing SCP's is hard. What do you think?
