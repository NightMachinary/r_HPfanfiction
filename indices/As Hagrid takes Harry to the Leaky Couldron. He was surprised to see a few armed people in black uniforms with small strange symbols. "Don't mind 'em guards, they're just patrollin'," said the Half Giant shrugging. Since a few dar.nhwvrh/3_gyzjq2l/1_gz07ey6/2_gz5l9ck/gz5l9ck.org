I'd say the designation would go from Keter at its discovery (likely an encounter with Voldemort or some other seriously threatening figure, like Grindelwald), and then be downgraded to Euclid when diplomatic contact is established. There would be some hullabaloo about muggleborn and how they differ from other natural reality benders, and eventually it would (hopefully) become Thaumiel as they forge alliances and work together to combat some more esotheric anomalies that need more than human science can achieve to contain.
