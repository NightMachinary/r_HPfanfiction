A multiverse in the top five worst places to live, in all of fiction.

The creepy pasta version of Warehouse 13; in which there are dozens upon dozens of fates worse than death; from old gods aiming to destroy all of existence, though a literal Vore Hole, to a world where nobody can die no matter how much their bodies break down. Though if you want just death, there are also pictures that kill you to look at them.

There's a bit of good, too; but it's almost always with a catch. A book that lets you live a wonderful fantasy life in your dreams, but may sour you to reality. Pills that can cure any ill, but not an unlimited number of them. An unlimited role of toilet paper that may occasionally, randomly explode with the force of a large nuke. And so on.

Here's a link to a youtube video introduction to the fandom; given I see the wiki is already linked here: [[https://youtu.be/R9hv6NsWndM]]
