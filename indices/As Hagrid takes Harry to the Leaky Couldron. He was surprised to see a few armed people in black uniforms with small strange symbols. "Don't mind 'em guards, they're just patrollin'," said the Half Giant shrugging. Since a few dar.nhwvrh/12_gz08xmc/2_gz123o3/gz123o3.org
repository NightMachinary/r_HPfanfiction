Here's the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation][Wikipedia article]] on it, and here's the [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/][site itself]].

​

It's a massive collaborative fiction thing where people detail the actions of The SCP Foundation, a fictional organization dedicated to protecting "normalcy" by hiding all anomalies - things that break from the normal laws of reality - from the public eye. Due to its collaborative nature and huge size, there is no one consistent canon, though there are elements common in many of the stories. A large part of the content is a part of the horror genre, but not all of it is.

​

The site itself can mainly be broken down into two types of pages - "Special Containment Procedures" (SCP) files, which each detail one anomaly and how it is contained, and "Tales", which are basically short stories set in the universe.

​

Aside from the site, there are a number of fangames (like SCP: Containment Breach and SCP: Secret Laboratory) and there are numerous related youtube channels (I'd definitely recommend [[https://www.youtube.com/user/TheVolgun][The Volgun]] or [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZj3q_2pHasvlILdU1huHA][SCP Illustrated]] for individual SCPs/tales, and [[https://www.youtube.com/c/LordBung/videos][Lord Bung]] for his original animated series "Confinement").

​

If you decide you want to try to read some of the stuff on the wiki itself, I'd recommend finding a thread on [[/r/SCP][r/SCP]] with recommendations for beginners. There's a lot to take in, and just reading up from 001 isn't a great idea.
