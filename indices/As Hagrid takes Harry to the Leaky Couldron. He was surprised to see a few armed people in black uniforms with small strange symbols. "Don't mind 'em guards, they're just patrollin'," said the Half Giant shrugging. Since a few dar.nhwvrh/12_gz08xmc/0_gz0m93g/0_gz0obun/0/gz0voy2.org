The SCP Foundation fandom is in the top five worst fictions to live in. It contains hundreds upon hundreds of fates worse than death, and plenty of easy ways to die, aswell. (Warhammer 40k is the #1 slot, worst place to live in all of fiction; atleast as a baseline human.)

It's mostly based around the “SCP Foundation”, a sort of secret illuminati-like organization that catalogs effects and items. Ranging from a teddy bear that will nit stuffed organs for people that have defective ones; through a phone number you can call to order human slaves; to a universe filled with demonic monsters the size of planets, that eat all of the stars except our sun and two others, held at bay by magic runes.

The SCP Foundation calls these anomalies “SCP's”, and their main aim is to hide the existence of them from the every day man, and maintain normalcy.

The fandom is comprised of thousands of short stories, most in a report format, with no real rhyme or reason connecting most of them, and no real coherent canon. Multiple timelines, multiple dimensions, and threats big and small. It's /rare/ to see an SCP that /isn't/ somehow horrible, or creepy in the least, but there are a few out there like that. I'd estimate less than fifty that are actively good, with no down sides.
