I can't get over the detail on some of these--especially DH! The points of the triangle of the Hallows having the wand, cloak, and stone; the Founder's relics being held by the animals on their crests; the silhouettes of Death holding the stone and wand on each side of Harry to mirror him possessing the cloak; Hermione and Ron with their bequeathments from Dumbledore and of course, the snitch in front of Harry; Hagrid carrying Harry's body out of the woods; the dragon rescued from Gringotts; Neville with the outline of the Sorting Hat and Sword surrounding him; Harry burying Dobby; and finally, the golden frame around Harry (a repeated motif across all covers) has the lightning bolt symbol.
