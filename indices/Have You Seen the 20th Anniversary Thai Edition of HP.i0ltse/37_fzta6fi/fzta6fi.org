Yeah, I'm liking these. Dumbledore with the beard that just goes everywhere is pretty neat, and the triwizard champions look amazing. Krum's got that daedric armor. And I really like this version of moody. It emphasizes the eye while not overstylizing the rest of his character. It always struck me as odd that the films made him such a ragged and personality-driven figure that his eye basically went unnoticed. But that's a general gripe I have with those, everything in those movies just seems somewhat dirty to me - all the places, all the characters. It's like they've never even heard about combs or sweeping brooms. Even malfoy looks filthy, and Harry himself remarked on how neatly combed back his hair is.
