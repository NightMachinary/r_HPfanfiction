omg these are amazing!! Thank you for bringing our attention to these. I love how the artist packed so many details and clues into each book cover; the Triward Champions all together but Harry still in the center of book 4's cover; Luna on the back of book 5; interesting how Lupin as werewolf was done on book 3, and I like how they made Voldy's skin snakelike on book 7's cover.

I think they made Ron a bit more handsome than I imagine him on book 7, and Cho looks different in my imagination too (book 5 cover off to the side, I think), but that's alright. Great covers! Beautiful, and exquisitely detailed.
