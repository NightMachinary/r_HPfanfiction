Couple thoughts:

Wow these are beautiful.

It looks like the 'villains' for each book are all in the top left corner on the front? Diary!Tom, Sirius (basically the villain for PoA), Moody (would be a huge spoiler if these weren't 20th anniversary versions), Umbridge, Snape (turns out to be working on Dumbledore's orders, but still the villain of HPB), and finally Voldemort in all his glory. Love it.

The only thing is that Dumbledore is in the same spot for PS. Is...is Dumbledore the villain of the first book?
