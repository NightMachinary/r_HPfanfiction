To answer your number 4, sadly I dont speak thai. Also I don't think that's Neville. I think that's the scene after the Dobby death scene. Your detailed comments about each cover made me revisit it because some of the things you mentioned, I missed.

Edit: my number 1 take away still stands. New headcanon images for the cast and I'm adding the fa√ßade of WWW to it.

Edit2: OMG I just reviewed 5 and I love Tonks' art!
