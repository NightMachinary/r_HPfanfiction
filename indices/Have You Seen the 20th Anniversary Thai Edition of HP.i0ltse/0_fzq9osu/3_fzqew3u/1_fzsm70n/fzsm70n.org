I zoomed in, and now I see the little grave. That wand is rather long, probably what threw me off. I now know that's Neville in the top left, so that makes things better.

My image quality isn't great, so I can't appreciate the art of some of the smaller characters, but looking made me notice that there's always something in the picture /curving/ near the title which is also curving. It's way more noticeable in the last 4.
