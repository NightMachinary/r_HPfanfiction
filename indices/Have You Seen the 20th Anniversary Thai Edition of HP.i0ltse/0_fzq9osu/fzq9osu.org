My reaction;

1) Very, very nice art.

2) The artist obviously saw the movies, and then still did their own thing. Impressive.

3) Less going on here, but I'm really starting to love this art style.

4) Ooh, nice composition. There's so much going on, front and back. How is “The Goblet of Fire” only 6 characters long!? Do you speak Thai? Can you tell me how to say that?

5) This. This is beautiful. I'm guessing that's the Ministry. There's a great looking Luna, and a very hate-able looking Umbridge. (Edit: Luna is the only one who isn't looking straight on)

6) Young /Tom/ and old Snape, with +Lily+ Ginny over there with the quidditch team, very fitting. Harry wearing his cloak next to Dumbledore looks so amazing. The Inferi reaching for them, Draco looking at Dumbledore, subtle, and sad. Also, that Weasley's Wizard Wheezes is now my headcanon.

7) There's the snitch, and the Hallows symbol, just combined and I love it. Voldemort has a nose, and is still snake-like. Yes. That, is amazing. The four house animals all leaping together, house unity!! Sword in the hat, and Nagini looks so great, with Neville +crouching there ready to cut her head off.+ Above her with the sword in hat right next to him. (Edit: +The Ron here contrasts so well with the Ron back at book 4+ Nope, that's Neville.)

The sword in the hat made me look back and notice all the fricken details in the embroidery in the solid colours. Just. Wow. Please, someone, publish this in English.
