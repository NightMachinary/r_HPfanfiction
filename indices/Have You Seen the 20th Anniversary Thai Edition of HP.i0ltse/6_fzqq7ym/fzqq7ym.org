...it took this Thai cover art to help me realize that we have 7 books and (arguably) 7 main characters across the series total. And I've been in this fandom for at least half of my life :')

This art is seriously gorgeous in terms of really capturing what makes each book (well) magic and what its key points of focus and introduction are compared to the priors.
