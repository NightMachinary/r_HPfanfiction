Wowzers, that's so bad it almost comes back around to good for the irony. Makes me want to try a defense, here goes!

It's obviously meant to look like a child did it since it's a series for children. That's decently common for kid's books, I think. It's not to my taste, but it's a consistent style, not the kind of thing that happens by accident to people who are actually bad at art. Since this guy is a popular illustrator, I guess people there are used to his style. I do like some of the more unusual scenes he chose, like Hagrid's brother getting attacked by the centaurs and the grindylows going after Harry.
