They look great. They really dropped the ball with the bulgarian ones though. They are absolutely horrible. Apparently they hired some 70-year-old guy who has been defacing children's books for decades. It got so bad it was even on the news. Some people even defended these monstrosities. I'm so glad I learned English years ago so I just ordered the house editions.
