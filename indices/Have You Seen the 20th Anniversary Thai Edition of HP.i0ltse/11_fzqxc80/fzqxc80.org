Very charming art style, and I love all of Harry's outfits. They're awesome. I want these covers on my English books, lol.

SS/PS:

- I love how the Sorting Hat blends with Hogwarts to make it look like Harry's wearing a castle on his head. It's hilarious and adorable.

CoA:

- I love spiders and the movie's ten-foot wolf spiders didn't bother me at all, but that giant weaver is kind of creepy, lol.

- Dobby's adorable.

- So are those pixies.

- So is the Burrow. :P

PoA:

- Buckbeak looks /epic./

- That Patronus is beautiful.

- Tiny Peter-rat running on two feet like a cartoon mouse, lol.

GoF:

- The Quidditch World Cup gets more attention on a book cover than in the movie. Still mad about that. >:(

- They went with the movie direction of making the Horntail a wyvern instead of a dragon, but I guess that's just canon now. :/ Looks great, anyway.

OotP:

- Umbridge looks a little like a cross between my headcanon image and the movie version, and it's awful and creepy, and I love it as much as I can love anything to do with her.

- I'm guessing the tertiary character (to the right of Sirius) is Cho?

- That phone booth just floating there like a red TARDIS, lol.

HBP:

- Pfft ahahaha they did it again with blending the castle into Dumbledore's head. That confirms it's intentional, and I'm glad I wasn't drinking anything when I saw it, because I'd have spat it all over my keyboard.

- Weasley Wizard Wheezes' storefront makes me uncomfortable, but it also makes me want to laugh. So I'm kind of just laughing uncomfortably. :P

DH:

- Snakedemort looks awesome.

- Hedwig looks like a sparrow next to an anaconda. :(

- I love the tiny detail of the House animals leaping into action with the Founders' objects above Ron/Hermione's heads.
