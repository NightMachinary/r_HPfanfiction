That argument doesn't work when you're talking about European dragons, though. I'd be just as disappointed if the Horntail was an Asian dragon and it didn't look something like a cross between a lion and a snake.

And there /is/ a commonly-accepted distinction between dragons and wyverns; dragons have four legs, and wyverns have two. Just because movies have decided to ignore it as of late doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
