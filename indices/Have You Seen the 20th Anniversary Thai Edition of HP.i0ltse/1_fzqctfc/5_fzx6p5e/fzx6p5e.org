Any idea why they are all wearing blue and yellow scarves?

And on the chamber of secrets cover (I assume I don't speak Finnish but its the second one), I assume the person grabbing Harry is Lockhart? And what's with the dark haired guy and boy in the background? If the cover is supposed to be set in Flourish and Blotts, via context that is presumably Lucius and Draco...so why aren't they blonde?

Apart from that they look alright if a bit childish but they're a lot better than the Bulgarian ones. Thailand wins this one hands down though I think.
