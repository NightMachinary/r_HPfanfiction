The covers are beyond amazing!

The only thing I have a little issue with is the face of Voldemort on the DH cover. He looks almost like a snake. Voldemort was supposed to have /snake-like/ features, almost stripped of humanity, but essentially a human devoid of empathy and absolutely immersed in evil. His plans and designs of power, domination and supremacy are that of a human's. It's an important thing to bear in mind while picturing Voldemort.

Kudos, once again to brilliant artwork and design though. I'd definitely buy the books once again if they released them with these covers!
