All right. Details I can remember are:

This was set at Hogwarts, Snape's chambers, where he had a potion's cupboard. I'm fairly sure at one point in time Harry sleeps in the cupboard under a shelf and hits his head, and Snape starts becoming more and more devious about getting him to not sleep in there because he's afraid that some potion might break over Harry.

He also used to sleep on the couch before Snape made a room for him. Pretty sure.

Now I'm gonna search my bookmarks. I'm fairly sure I've got this one, but I need to figure out which Severitus it is.

EDIT:

I went through all my bookmarks for Fanfiction.net and even potionsandsnitches. Don't have it bookmarked anywhere. Very frustrating, wish I could remember more to it than just a Severitus fic. But I know for sure that it is complete, because I rarely read a fic that isn't complete. If I do stumble across, I'll post it, but I think I've got to give up. Sorry.
