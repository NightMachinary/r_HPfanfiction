For all those asking for links, the only two I've read that long in this fandom are the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]] series and the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/993900][Arithmancer]] duology. Though [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1085412][A Marauders Plan]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10691892][Benefits of Old Laws]] come in close at 855-865k each.
