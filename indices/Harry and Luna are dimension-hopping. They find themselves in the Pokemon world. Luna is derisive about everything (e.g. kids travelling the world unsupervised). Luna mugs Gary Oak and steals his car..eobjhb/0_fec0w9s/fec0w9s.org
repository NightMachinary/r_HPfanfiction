Me reading this title:

1st sentence? Cool.

2nd sentence? Neat, Pokémon!

3rd sentence? Um, alright...

3th sentence? WHAAAAAAAT?!

Sorry this post is not helpful at all...

Did some searching, could this be it? From the summary / pairings, I can gather it contains dimension travel, Harry & Luna, the Pokémon world, & Daisy Oaks, Gary's older sister (so Gary is likely in it too I guess).
