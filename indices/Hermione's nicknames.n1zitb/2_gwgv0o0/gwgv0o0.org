Maybe I'm just contrarian, but honestly the name 'Hermione' isn't that much of a mouthful or all that difficult to say, from an anglophone perspective at least. If you are going out of your way to enunciate each syllable sure 'Her-my-o-nee' is a mouthful, but most people don't speak like that. In my accent at least, it gets contracted to 'Hurr-my-knee' and takes less than a second to say clearly.

I thereby petition that the only in character nickname for Hermione is 'Hermy-own-ninny' and I think it's a wasted opportunity to develop the trio's friendship.
