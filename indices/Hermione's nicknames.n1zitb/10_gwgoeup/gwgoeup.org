I have some of my Harrys using ‘Miney', but it only works in a cute sibling way because it's so possessive. To me Harry has so little family himb being able to say ‘you're my person' is nice.

Otherwise I think Mia, but then again. Just realised that I've used that only really as an alter ego, rather than a nickname. It just downs t feel like canon Hermione is a Mia.

Doesn't she canonically hate nicknames? I do too, so it's understandable. some names are just awful for people coming up with ugly names for you.
