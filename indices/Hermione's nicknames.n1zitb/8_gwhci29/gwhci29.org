I was best friends with a girl called Hermione when I was younger, and her nickname was Marny. It was born because I actually couldn't pronounce her name when I met her, which was like 2 years old, and so that's what came out of my mouth and it stuck until we stopped being friends at 12.

To be fair, I wouldn't nickname Hermione Granger 'Marny' though. I actually quite like 'mione.
