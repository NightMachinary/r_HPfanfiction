good list!

I'm going from memory so some of these might not tick every box.

linkffn(almost a squib) a quick retelling of the canon story with a largely magicless Harry.

linkffn(weeb) Harry is a weeb. Largely follows canon with only minor divergences.

linkffn(harry the hufflepuff) Harry is obsessed with attaining the philosophical ideal of lazyness. Follows canon, at least initially.
