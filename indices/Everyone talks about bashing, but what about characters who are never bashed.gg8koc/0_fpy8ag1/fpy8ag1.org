All the characters you named are fan favorites because they are mostly tame/non-abrasiveness in canon or are heavily used in fanon. It'd be like kicking a unicorn.

Especially Luna. I've read fics complaining about every character, but everyone likes Luna. Most likely cause she's the bullied weird girl and that definitely resonated with the Harry Potter kids that grew up to write fanfiction
