I've seen Arthur bashed, and it was mostly because he lets evil!Molly do all that shit and is too cowardly to stop her. The only evil!Arthur I remember reading was when he turned out to be an evil cultist, which was a pretty good oh shit moment imo.

Daphne, I've also seen bashed. It was in Faery Heroes, I think the fic is called? And there are some fics where she is trained by Bellatrix and is one of the antagonists and stuff.

Neville is always bashed in BWL Neville stories, at least from my experience.

Amelia Bones is sometimes bashed in "fuck the ministry" fics.

I have never seen Luna bashing though.
