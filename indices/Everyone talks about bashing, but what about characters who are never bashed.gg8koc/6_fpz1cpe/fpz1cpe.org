I never understood why there were almost no Remus Bashing when all the Marauders have pages and pages against them. Especially when he's the one who was there the longest time and could have done more. (Or less, like let's not use teenagers trying to save the world as an excuse to abandon your child). I've even found more Lily bashing when her only role in the whole series is to love her child to the point of sacrifice.
