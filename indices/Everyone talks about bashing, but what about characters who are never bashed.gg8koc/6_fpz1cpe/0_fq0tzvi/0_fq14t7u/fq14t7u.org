He's definitely bashed less than Sirius, and James especially. I've seen Lupin bashed multiple times though; it seems he's often portrayed as a Dumbledore sycophant in Indy!Harry stories.

I have a theory that Snape-lovers tend to like Lupin more than the other marauders. I think he's seen less as an antagonist.
