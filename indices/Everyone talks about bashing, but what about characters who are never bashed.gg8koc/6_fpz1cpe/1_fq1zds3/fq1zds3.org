The reason for this probably has to do with the fact that Marauder-bashing comes from 3 major tropes: WBWL, Indy!Harry and Snape-redemption. The former 2 bashes all of the Marauders about equally much (alongside other Order members), but fics that has sympathy for Snape generally bashes James and Sirius much more than Remus. For those, Remus is usually the lesser bad person here, not really harassing him the way the other Marauders do and is usually excused with "well he's a werewolf whose only bad choice was picking bad friends" (similar to Snape, incidentally).
