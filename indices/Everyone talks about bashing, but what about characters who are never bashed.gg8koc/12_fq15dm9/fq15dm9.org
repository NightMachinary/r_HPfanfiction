*Saying No* - linkffn(7274734)

Amelia's makes an appearance and is promptly bashed. But this fic barely counts, since if you were over 17, you were bashed.

-

/Sometimes/ Arthur is bashed for being a bigot. I can somewhat understand the reasoning too. He works in the misuse of muggle artifact office and can't pronounce electricity. Then there's the fact the way he talks about muggles being "amazing despite not having magic" it sounds like a parent talking about their child being amazing for being potty trained. It's messed up, yes, but that's how JKR wrote him.

-

Neville is sometimes bashed in wrong boy who lived fics IF he was selected as the WBWL. Even then, I barely consider that bashing, as it shows the possibility of what could be Harry if he was raised in the magical world and pampered for being the boy who lived. But there are cases where the dial is turned up to 11/10.

-

Luna? Don't think I ever saw one. They probably exist somewhere. Maybe.

-

Daphne? There are tons of fics where she's the stereotypical Slytherin Death Eater Junior sycophant. Where she ends up dying because she was marked. But those fics could have been from before she became "popular".
