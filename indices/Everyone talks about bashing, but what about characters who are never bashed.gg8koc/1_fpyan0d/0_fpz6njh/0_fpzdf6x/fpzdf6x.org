Yeah a lot of Slytherin!Harry fics tend to bash McGonagall. I also find that a lot of mentor!Snape fics tend to bash her? It's normally along the lines of she runs Gryffindor house terribly and Snape disapproves or even she dislikes that Snape is the one taking care of Harry because he's not Gryffindor and she should be the one to do it.
