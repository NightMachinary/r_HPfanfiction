I've seen Neville bashing. 90% of the BWL Neville fics are "Neville is a bigger prick than Malfoy, and so far up himself that he comes out the other end"

Daphne is a glorified OC, so she's very rarely bashed because she's one of those unimportant characters that if you don't want her around you just don't add her.

Luna I've seen 1 fic that involves bashing her, because she went along with the "let's treat Harry like shit after the DOM" trope and Harry was like "Fuck you all Peace out suckaz" and left the country. Those tropes suck though. If she's not around, she's just written as some weird bullied girl in the background. If she does get bashed it's probably in the "Hermione is always right. how dare that girl believe in imaginary creatures!" sort of way by insane Hermione fanboys.

Arthur gets bashed less than Molly because he has the look of a man that isn't allowed his own opinion and that Molly only humours him by letting him play with his muggle toys. Have seen a few fics where he's in on the "Let's ruin Harry's life because we're greedy and Dumblegrumble said so" plots though.

You very rarely see Twins bashing outside of Slytherin Harry fics where they're generic bullies that "Prank" the first years and Harry stops them.

McGonagall is one of those characters that you could quite easily bash but she's given WAY too much leniency in fics as being "the most supportive teacher" without any reason for it. Even Canon Harry seems really stupid when he successfully casts a Crucio on one of the Carrows for spitting at McGonagall when she's been fucking useless the whole series, and couldn't cast it at Bellatrix who killed Sirius moments before.
