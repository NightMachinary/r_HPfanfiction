Related to this: could anybody suggest some good anti-Harmony story? I mean story, where Harry would during the Goblet of Fire find out finally, that Hermione is only a fan-girl going after his wealth, status (as Muggleborn she needs to get somehow into the good circles), etc., and his only real friends are Weasleys and specifically Ginny? Finding out that Dumbledore is actually truly good would be just unnecessary cherry on the top of the cake.
