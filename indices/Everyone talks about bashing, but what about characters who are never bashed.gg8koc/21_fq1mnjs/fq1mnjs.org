I would love to see some bashing of Fred and George. I loved them as a kid, but rereading the series as an adult makes me realize that they would definitely be people I wouldn't want to be friends with them.

I personally think they're just as bad as the Marauders; it's just more excused because they didn't have a favorite punching bag and turned their jokes into a profitable business. I mean, come on, the WWW was selling love potions to minors---that's not a good look.

It always cracks me up to see tags for a “bashing Weasleys'” with the exception of the Twins or Charlie and Bill. Do these people not know how siblings work? “Gotta back your brother's play” sounds like a very Weasley mantra.
