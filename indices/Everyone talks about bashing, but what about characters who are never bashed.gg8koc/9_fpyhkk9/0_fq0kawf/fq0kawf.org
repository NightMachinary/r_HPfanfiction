I love Neville. I write a Neville centric fic even. However, I did read one where he was the villain! I can't remember the fics name, but Neville was trying to kill Harry throughout the fic. It was a mystery though so you didn't find out til towards the end that Neville was the one trying and failing to kill Harry and I remember getting to the end where it was Neville and being like “ummm no”. I felt like if the author wanted to go that route some more time needed to be spend on his character development in the fic, because as you said nobody hates Neville so it's really hard to accept him as the bad guy when there was no build up to it. I felt like it came out of nowhere and they just slapped the excuse of jealousy as the reason. Like I feel like it can be done turning a character everyone loves into the villain, but man you have to really work on that.
