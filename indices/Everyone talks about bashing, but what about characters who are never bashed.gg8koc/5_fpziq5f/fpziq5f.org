I've seen Arthur Weasley bashing mostly in conjunction with Molly/Weasley-Family-In-General bashing, where he's passively going along with whatever scheme the Weasleys have cooked up. I remember one fic where he had a more active role, being the guy who smoothed things over with the Ministry and acting like a bumbling dad purely to try and get Harry to let his guard down around him.

Neville gets bashed in a few stories I know of - mostly (W)BWL stories where people think Neville's the chosen one and he goes full Malfoy with the publicity. I've also seen him used as effectively Bashed!Ron's crony.

Luna I've seen bashed in some of the more extreme Hermione-wagging fics - and then mostly in the form of her more outlandish beliefs being treated as if she belongs in St. Mungo's. She mostly just ends up not being mentioned at all if the author dislikes her as a character.

Daphne Greengrass is practically a fanon character to begin with - she gets mentioned once in the whole series. It's hard to bash a character whose entire personality is 100% fanon.
