My go-to examples for "never-bashed fanon princesses" are Luna and Nymphadora. In terms of significant characters in the kind of fics I tend to read (Snape-centric), Lily also comes to mind, but there is the occasional Lily-bash. Those 2 on the other hand -- I cannot think of a single example where either of them are bashed. Sometimes Nymphadora is in the wrong, but it's always portrayed as "she did it for the Order and didn't think it was wrong" and she's excused for it.
