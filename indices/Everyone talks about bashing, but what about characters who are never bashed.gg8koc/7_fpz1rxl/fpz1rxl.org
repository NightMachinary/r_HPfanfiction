Eh, they all can and are bashed. Indy Harry fics can bash Amelia with the rest of the ministry, Luna gets laughed at a fair bit, Arthur can be lumped into Weasley bashing even if it's not as common, Daphne is a fanon character so there's nothing to even bash, and Neville can be on the side against Harry in the dorm. It just isn't common to bash character seen as levelheaded or downtrodden, like every character you listed is (again, except for Daphne who is utterly made up).
