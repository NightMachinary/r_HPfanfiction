Autocorrect has gotten scarily competent. In German (my native language) Google's autocorrect has started correcting parts of "made up on the spot" compound words, so I would not be surprised to see it correcting a "non-standard form of a known word root". In this case it would be correcting the "wrong spelling" of imperious, regardless of the tacked on -ed.

Either way, both my mind and my TTS software read that with the vowel from aroused, which is both confusing and annoying (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
