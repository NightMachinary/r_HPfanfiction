Yeah, I know the fic. It's [[http://members.ozemail.com.au/%7Ebrussell/tea.htm][A Nice Cup Of Tea And A Lie Down]] by Bernice.

Didn't really like it all that much. I thought Hagrid's reasons for turning on Harry and Dumbledore didn't ring true to his character -- yes, being a half-giant sucks, but Hagrid's the sort to step in front of those he loves to take a bullet for them, not to sell them out for his personal safety.

Besides, he should know that any promises made by Voldemort of all people aren't worth anything. You KNOW Voldemort only keeps his promises if they don't inconvenience him in any way -- the moment keeping a promise is the slightest bit of a bother, he'll break it without a thought or concern. Hagrid would have known better.
