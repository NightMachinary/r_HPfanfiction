  "Pick-me-up, that's what he needs," Slughorn continued, now bustling over to a table loaded with drinks. "I've got Butterbeer, I've got wine, I've got one last bottle of this oak-matured mead ..."

The Statue of Secrecy was only passed in 1690, so wizards should be familiar with Muggle drinks that were invented or popularized before their worlds were separated, even if they prefer magically produced equivalents like Firewhisky over whiskey/whisky. This means wine, mulled wine, mead, ale and lager, beer, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_beer][small beer]], and distilled spirits.

As for champagne, modern champagne as a sparkling wine was made popular in the 1800's but "champagne" as a name for a drink was used in the 1600's, so it would be reasonable for wizards to never have tried it, unless they're French or of French origin like the Lestranges (and Malfoys, according to Pottermore). Then again, wizards have a double decker bus for public transport, so post-Statute cultural exchange isn't impossible. As long as wizards aren't drinking Red Bull jello shots, it should be fine.
