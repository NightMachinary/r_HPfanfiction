Same way people rationalize smart muggles in bad fics; I'll have you know that Einstein was a wizard, he just didn't realize that E was failing in muggle schools. I'm surprised you didn't know that the recipe for orange juice was created by a wizard, who's recipe was stolen by a dastardly squib. Without wizards doing it first, muggles would still think showering brought plagues.
