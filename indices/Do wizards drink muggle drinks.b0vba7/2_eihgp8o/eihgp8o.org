For wizards to drink muggle drinks they would probably have to have some unique element that would make it preferable.

In this case, I can safely say that magic can probably replicate any muggle style of food or drink and make it even more special like a chocolate frog.

Therefore I doubt Wizards have any reason to be familiar with muggle cuisine at all considering magic's vast capabilities of enhancing food.
