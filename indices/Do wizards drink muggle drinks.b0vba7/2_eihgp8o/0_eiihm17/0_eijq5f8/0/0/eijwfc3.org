I knew a farmers market vendor who lost a customer when someone finally told her that the eggs he was selling came out of chickens' butts. The customer switched back to supermarket eggs because they don't come from such an unsanitary source. The farmer hadn't been misrepresenting his eggs, he'd just sold them and assumed she knew all she needed to know.
