Step 1: Open all chapters (feature on ao3, don't know about Fanfiction.net)

Step 2: CTRL+F “the greater good/love potion/inheritance test” etc all the usual suspects

Step 3: Briefly skim through a few sentences around the found entries, getting a little bit of context so you can see if the fic is worth your time.

Using this method, you can quickly sniff out whether or not a fic is junk without spoiling too much for yourself.
