Some AO3 fics tag ‘Weasley bashing' or ‘Dumbledore bashing', which is a very handy way for me to know which fics to stay 100 miles from.

If the fic subscribes to lots of other tropes too (e.g. Harry goes to goblins and gets lots of money, Harry goes to Slytherin and there's a ‘Slytherin court', etc) then there's a 99% chance of bashing.
