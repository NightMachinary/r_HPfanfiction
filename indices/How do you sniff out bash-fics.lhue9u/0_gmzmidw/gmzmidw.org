If it's Harry/Hermione and doesn't mention who Ron is paired with or specifically say it isn't bashing anyone, it's probably a Weasley bashing fic.

If there's any hint that it's a gray!Harry or indie!Harry fic, it's almost guaranteed to be a bashing fic. (Hints include Daphne, or any other Slytherin, being mentioned in any sort of positive light, Goblins and inheritances, politics and lordships, and anything about discovering new abilities.) Actually, if any Slytherin character is tagged, it will probably involve some bashing, unless maybe if the story is set post-Hogwarts.

If Neville is mentioned at all, it probably means Ron is getting bashed and Neville is replacing him, unless Ron is also mentioned. Or it could mean Neville is the WBWL and Dumbledore (and probably a few others) is getting bashed. Or the story could actually be about Neville, but that hardly ever happens.

On that note, WBWL stories always bash someone.

Anything mentioning muggles is probably going to go full mugglewank, which is basically bashing the entire magical world. And anything about Harry going to another country will probably bash magical Brittain.

If the word "Dumbles" appears anywhere in the story, summary, or author's profile, it's a bashing fic. You can also search for "screech" and "shriek," and if those words are used to describe anyone but Hedwig and possibly Myrtle (particularly Molly and Hermione), it's a bashing fic.
