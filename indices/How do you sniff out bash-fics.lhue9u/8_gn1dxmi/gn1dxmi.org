- Literally any fic tagged Independent Harry, Gray/Grey Harry, or Dark Harry on AO3. Or using those terms, or the shorthand thereof, in the summary. These will pretty much always bash Albus Dumbledore, occasionally it's easier to list who /doesn't/ get bashed.
- "Fed up with the manipulations..." or anything like that in the summary. In fact, just look for any synonym of "manipulation".
- Summary uses any insulting nickname for Albus Dumbledore.
- Harry/Hermione ship without Ron being paired with someone else, usually indicates Ron bashing.
- Ginny is another likely suspect for ship-war-related bashing. If she's not shipped with anyone, reader beware.
- Neville is tagged as an important character. Ron isn't. That means Ron is getting bashed.
- Any shipping involving a canonically-irredeemable Death Eater means you should expect some degree of "the canonically-evil side is secretly good, so the canonically-good side is evil".
- First quarter of the fic, ctrl-F "Inheritance", "Executed", "Ancient", "Hadrian" (as in inheritance test, "the Potter will was never executed!", "Ancient and Noble House of WhateverTheFuck", and Hadrian being Harry's usual 'real' name in these fics for some godforsaken reason).
- "Slight bashing" is never slight.
