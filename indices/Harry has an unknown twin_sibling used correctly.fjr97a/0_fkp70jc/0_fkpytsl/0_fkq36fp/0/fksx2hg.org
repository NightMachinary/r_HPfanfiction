To be fair in this scenario anger would be the realistic consequence, even more if you understand that Dumbledore is basically only his headmaster and until the sixth book is more an cool but distant figure than anything else, I mean, by the end of the fifth book they had talked only like 5 or 6 times tops over Harry's whole life. It would be like a stranger coming up to you and saying that he had hidden your grandmother from you without any good reason and expect it to go okay.

Don't get me wrong I am honestly quite tired of Dumbledore!Bashing and think there are much simpler, less convoluted and less monstrous reasons for his actions -like JKR needing him to be the type of character capable of fighting Voldemort head-on without nerfing Voldemort or stealing Harry's thunder for the story. If you want to read a fic that actually justifies in a realistic way Dumbledore's character I would recommend Albus and Harry's world trip, it's a good read if you are tired of the old “Dumbledore is Hittler 2.0” trope like me. linkffn(13388022)
