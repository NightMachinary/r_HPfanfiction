I mean, I agree, anger is the realistic consequence, and if you noticed there is a lot of anger canonically released, when Harry demolishes the Dumbledore's office. Also, in the end of my the “Uncovering more of the story” (the working title of a chapter, if there was ever one) chapter, Harry & Ginny leave his office, because they don't want to demolish it for the second time. (Also, Bill later in my story is just one step from demolishing the office as well, and we don't even know what happens when McGonagall and Molly Weasley come to call, the latter promises fate worse than death).

I just think the canonical Harry (and mine as well) are in that point mature enough, that when they cool down, they are able to rationally came to the conclusion that even if they don't like him, they need Dumbledore for his knowledge and power, and that people don't have to be the best buddies to stand on the same side of the war front (see also Sirius Black and Severus Snape).
