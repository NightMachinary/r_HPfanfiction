Potions and herbology (and magical creatures really) are best taken in one package, you need them all to be really good at one.

Astronomy, arithmancy, runes? Sign me up! That and charms (and maybe transfig) are all I really need.

The magical potions and ingredients package open up a powerful and important branch of magic, but I'm not that interested in it and honestly you can always just buy the potions you need. History you can get from a book, muggle studies are useless to me, defense I'm better off with a study group (unless it's Lupin teaching), Divination is too vague to be useful.

Transfiguration is nice but not vital. It's also something you can pay someone else to do it for you if you really need it.

Charms are where you learn 90% of useful spells that you might actually need to cast yourself. Arithmancy is magical properties of numbers, which is pretty close to physics so it should be really useful for understanding how magic works. Runes, magical writing, also sounds really useful and underappreciated. If they can be used to make things do magic, it's 100% must have for any magical engineer. Astronomy, because with knowledge of physics, magic physics, magic engineering and air freshening charms I'm so going to build a spaceship.
