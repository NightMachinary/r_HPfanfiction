To be honest, I doubt there are any good German stories. But many good ones were translated, sometimes well, sometimes by what seemed like a preschooler in his first year of language education. Mind, this is my experience from 16 years ago before I started to consume all entertainment in English. Maybe the quality of translations has become better since then.

I would say to just go here and take the search engine for a spin:

[[https://www.fanfiktion.de/Harry-Potter-FFs/c/103005001/1/updatedate]]

Or just search ff.net with Language set to German and sort by Reviews. The translations of the biggest stories in the fandom should show up pretty close to the top.
