Ah ok, so you are learning German? I would argue that them being good quality is even more important then. Else you might pick up some bad mannerisms from the stories.

So I would say that reading translations of the big stories in the fandom is the way to go. Often those are translated by professional translators that did that in their free time. They should have much better German than pretty much everything that has originally been written in German.
