People from Baveria do write in Baverian tho XD. I live in Augsburg and I feel like they are speaking (and writing) in another language. I had a teacher at Uni who was from Hannover and listening to him speak was wonderful :). My bf is from Berlin and the way he speaks is way easier to understand than other inflections, but I think I read somewhere that Berliners do not really have a dialect anymore.
