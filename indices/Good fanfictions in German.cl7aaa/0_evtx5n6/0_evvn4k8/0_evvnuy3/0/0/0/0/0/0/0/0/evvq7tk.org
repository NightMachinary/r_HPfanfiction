What? Are you actually talking about instant messaging or something? I was thinking books and newspapers when I said that the dialects don't exist in the written word.

If someone writes to me on WhattsApp in his dialect I don't understand I tell him to cut the shit and write normal, and I have been born here and lived here for 30 years. It is commonly considered pretty rude to write in dialect to someone you know was not raised with the dialect. It implies a "Yea, you figure that out! I can't be bothered to translate my thoughts into actual German." mindset.

Also, while I can understand every spoken dialect, I sure as hell don't understand the written dialects.

Well, as I myself have never felt a need to learn to understand the written dialects, I can't really tell you how to go about it. Maybe ask a friend to help you with the most common words? Dunno.
