Well, it is the same in Spain or India or I think even most other countries. While there are many, often very different spoken forms of the language, in the written word everybody uses the standard form.

Just imagine the chaos if people from Bavaria started to write in their insane dialect :D Or the people from Saxony! I can already see the 150 "Sch's" per page :P

Good luck anyway! I think the best you can do is watch TV (I know, it sucks in Germany, but the scripted reality shitshows tend to use slang and dialects to make the people look even more stupid), watch Movies and talk to people.
