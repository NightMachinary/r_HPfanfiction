Well, those translations are done by native German speakers. Even more so, more often than not, by native German speakers professionally trained to stay on Hochdeutsch.

But if you are deadset on reading fics originally written by Germans, my link up there should have tons of them. The only problem is, that the search engine is missing the most basic features, so it might be a chore to find something readable.

Sorry that I can't help with any links to specific stories. Wie gesagt, hab seit 16 Jahren keine mehr auf Deutsch gelesen.
