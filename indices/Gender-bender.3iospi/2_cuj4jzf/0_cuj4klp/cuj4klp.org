  Harry Potter in a new way. A young Harry, raised in an orphanage feels strange in his own body. The caretakers realize this, and help him to remedy this. Trans.Harry, probable homosexual situations, possible lemons. Rated M for mature content, don't like, don't read. No pairing as of yet, please read and review.
