Holding out for a Batfleck scenario, as in Depp being a surprisingly great Grindelwald. I mean, it's Johnny Depp. If we're talking how wizards are supposed to be "off" and quirky, he's got the chops for it, but it's just not what I'm imagining Grindelwald to be. On the other hand, Depp has been agent Sands in Desperado II and was great there, so I'll hold back the lamentations for now.
