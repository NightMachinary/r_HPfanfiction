*This post is speculative but could still potentially spoil the movie for you. Only warning!*

I think I've figured out the ending of the movie, or at least part of it.

One: We know Johnny Depp has a short cameo as Grindelwald in this film.

Two: Colin Farrell's dialogue in the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vso5o11LuGU][final trailer]] is essentially espousing Grindelwald's philosophy. Initially I thought this meant he was a Grindelwald follower. However...

Three: This review in [[http://nerdist.com/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-is-a-textbook-adventure-review/][Nerdist]] states that there's a twist at the end that is lame:

  But most vexing is a certain “reveal” in the climax that earned no gasps but only groans from my audience. You'll know it when you sneer it.

Four: This review in the [[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-review-jk-rowlings-spect/][Telegraph]] states that Colin Farrell's character has been squandered by something at the end of the film:

#+begin_quote
  Colin Farrell is also huskily captivating as Percival Graves, the wizarding world's chief of secret police -- although having built him into something special, the film underestimates his worth and squanders the character at the last minute, a rare bum note that remains ringing in your ears for hours.
#+end_quote

So, taken together, there's a twist ending that ruins Colin Farrell's character, a character who spends the film promoting Grindelwald's philosophy, and Grindelwald himself has a short appearance.

Conclusion: Colin Farrell's character is Grindelwald in disguise and drops the disguise at the end.

If true, this is somewhat disappointing for me. I really liked the idea of an American senior Auror as working with Grindelwald, and I think Colin Farrell is the perfect choice to play such a character. It's a role that he's played before and he's got it down to a T - the antagonistic but idealistic lawman. Eliminating that character as merely a cover for Grindelwald feels like a waste of such a good character. Especially as I'm not a fan of the Johnny Depp casting.
