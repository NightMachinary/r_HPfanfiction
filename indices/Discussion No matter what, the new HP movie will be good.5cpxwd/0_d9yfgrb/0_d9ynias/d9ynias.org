I feel you, but I also saw someone (on tumblr, I think) say that FB can be better than CC because FB focuses on characters we have no attachment to. Because we're all so familiar with the characters from the books, because we develop our own interpretations and headcanons and ideas about them, anything more JKR gives is highly likely to disappoint. We're too invested in them to take everything she says happily.

On the other hand, almost all of the FB folks are blank slates, people we haven't given such massive amounts of thought to. It's also set in a different country so things can be a little bit different and not bother us quite so much. JKR can go all out and do what she likes with them without it conflicting with or spoiling the version of the character we have in our heads.
