Also, I'm still not sure, but since there's no book version (apart from Fantastic Beasts), then I suppose those 5 movies about the Grindelwald conflict will be canon, at least as far as plot goes, right?

Seriously, screw Cursed Child with a piece of rebar. My sister liked the scriptbook and I'm agonizing over the fact that she's not as into HP as I am and isn't receptive of my well-grounded arguments because "I'm taking it too seriously".

I think I know now what comic book people felt like when I asked if Stark gave Black Panther his armor after seeing Civil War.
