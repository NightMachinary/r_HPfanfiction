Not exactly crack but The Carnivorous Muffin writes really good absurdist fiction. They're not for everyone, but for the people that like her writing they're really good.

I enjoy the Naruto crossover one more because the MC has a support structure around for her, while in the HP main series it feels like it's only her against the world.
