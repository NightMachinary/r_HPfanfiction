It's not exactly what I'd call a /hidden/ gem, but you apparently overlooked it in your list of 'classics': linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stepchild). Also not-so-obscure but not on your list, and slightly less bonkers: linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where To Find Them), linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor), linkffn(We, Harry Potter), and the unfortunately-abandoned linkffn(Harry Potter and the Slightly Suggestive Handshake) that was really similar to /Seventh Horcrux/.
