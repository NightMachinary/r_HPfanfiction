Your grammar is fine, but the spelling could use some work. Spell check will work wonders for you.

I was with you until the weird twist situations. The China thing is an odd turn, and something that would not only cause me to roll my eyes, but also to give up on the fic at that point. Every other plot point is fine. The pairing is fine. Even the thing about the centaurs and whatnot is fine.
