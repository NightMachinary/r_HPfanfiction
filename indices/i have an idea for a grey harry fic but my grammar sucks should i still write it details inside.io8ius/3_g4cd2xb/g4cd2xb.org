For the grammar part, I would suggest Grammarly followed by a beta. Grammarly isn't perfect, which is why I suggest a beta after, but it helps a lot with the common grammar, punctuation, spelling, and homonym (their/there/they're, moral/morel, etc.) errors.

I'd say go for it, it sounds like an interesting story!
