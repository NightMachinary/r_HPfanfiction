If you want Grindelwald training Harry, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/][Hail Odysseus]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(10645463;13045929), can offer you some good ideas. I like the second one way better though.

98 is not old for a wizard, but 50 years in a prison can take a toll on his sanity. In "Reformed", he breaks out to avenge Dumbledore, he thinks he's reformed, but old habits die hard. Surprisingly, it's Hermione who's the most enthusiastic about his new cause.

Remember in canon, Xenophilius Lovegood proudly wears the Deathly Hallows symbol, also Grindelwald's sigil.
