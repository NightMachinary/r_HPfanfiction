  Remember in canon, Xenophilius Lovegood proudly wears the Deathly Hallows symbol, also Grindelwald's sigil.

That's because it was the Deathly Hallows symbol long before Grindelwald appropriated it for his own purposes --- just as the swastika was used by many cultures over thousands of years as a symbol of spirituality and prosperity, before the Nazis decided to hijack it. I honestly think it was JKR's intent to mirror that subversion.
