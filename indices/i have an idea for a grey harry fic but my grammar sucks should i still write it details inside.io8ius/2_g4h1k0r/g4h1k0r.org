I don't really dig the China and the youth angle to be honest, I'd probably find it more interesting to read about how he'd overcome being an old as hell dark lord trying to get the young folk to follow him. But it's your work so do whatever, it's your show, you're the captain now. As for the grammar and spelling and everything, you won't get better if you don't write. I'd recommend getting someone to beta your work before publishing. Other then that, if you want to get better, you'll just have to take the plunge and write.
