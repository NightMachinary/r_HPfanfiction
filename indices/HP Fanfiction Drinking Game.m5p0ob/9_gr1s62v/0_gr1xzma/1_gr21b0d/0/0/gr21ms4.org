A fic where Harry is far more independant than in canon. He doesn't need Ron or Hermione, is more cunning, finds ways to learn advanced magic, and keeps secrets from everyone (whether warranted or not).

Has a tendancy to include a lot of Diagon Alley shopping trips, sealed wills, Dumbledore/Weasley (and occasionally, Hermione) bashing, multiple houses, multiple vaults, and of course, the Order stealing money from his accounts.
