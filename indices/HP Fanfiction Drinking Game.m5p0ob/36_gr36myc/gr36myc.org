Okay, do you want to kill someone before they finish the first chapter?

I'm having flashbacks of all the FF I've read and holy fuck. Anything post 2007, consider yourself an alcoholic.

Jeez man, and the fact that these are SHOTS. Deadly my man. I woulda done sips (beer/wine/mixed drink). Cause even then you would put someone in a hospital.

For real though, this is an amazing list and it is hilarious.
