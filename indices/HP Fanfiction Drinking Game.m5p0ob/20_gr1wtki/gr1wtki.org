The one about the OC is my favorite. I have an edit. One extra shot if it's a love interest character. Two extra if it's a love interest for Harry. And add one shot to those previous conditions if the romance is gay

Idea: one shot for every time a character is overly sentimental with a friend to the point that it's out of character. Seen that one with Snape and other characters a few times. Disregard if the sentimentality is because of a crush
