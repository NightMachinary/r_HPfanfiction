I have to ask, when someone uses the phrase "wanking his wand" in a fic, are they talking about his literal wand, like as a sexy foreplay thing, or are they using wand as a euphemism? It's like really important to me to find the answer to this question now.

Real talk, the amount of times I've written something referring to wands and then thought, "No, sounds too sexual, gotta find a different way to phrase it," is absurd.
