Indie!Harry is shorthand for Independent Harry, a catch-all naming convention for stories in which Harry 'Breaks free' from the various things binding him, delves into darker/greyer magic, uses rituals, breaks away from manipulative dumbledore, etc. They generally start in or around fourth year. Often involves Harry getting with Daphne Greengrass, Fleur Delacour, Nymphadora (Your true form is beautiful) Tonks, Sometimes Hermione, or Susan Bones, or on occassion, Bellatrix Black.

While /most/ Indie!Harry fics are rather poor in quality, by the definitions commonly used for them masterpieces like 'Prince of Slytherin', and 'A Cadmean Victory' are also Indie!Harry fics, so like all things there is going to be a positive example of it somewhere.
