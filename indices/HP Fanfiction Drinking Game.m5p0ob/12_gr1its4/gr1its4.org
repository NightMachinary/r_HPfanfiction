This is fckin brilliant. I haven't actually seen a lot of these personally because I don't read indie!Harry and didn't know what it was until a few weeks ago but am already so aware of these tropes.

The ones that really stood out to me:

I deeply hope no one has ever written smut where a character uses "engorgio" on their genitals, and yes, I would like someone to respond if they've seen this before. Is it meant to be a fun, sexy thing to do, or is it in like a dark Tomarry context? I will be pondering this all day.

Ron eating constantly and speaking with his mouth full is honestly very canon. That's why A Very Potter Musical has him eat whenever he's onstage. When my sisters and I read Cursed Child aloud, my sister reading for Ron just grabbed an apple and said all his lines while chewing. And we all love Ron.

Also, respect for anyone writing their own sorting hat song. I have never even tried.

Incredible, though. No one could try this game and live to tell the tale.
