  I deeply hope no one has ever written smut where a character uses "engorgio" on their genitals, and yes, I would like someone to respond if they've seen this before. Is it meant to be a fun, sexy thing to do, or is it in like a dark Tomarry context? I will be pondering this all day.

Both? I mean... there's one where Hermione uses engorgio on her breasts... and was meant as a humour one as well as a smut, I hope. So, guess if the size is very disproportionate, humor must be involved.

  Ron eating constantly and speaking with his mouth full is honestly very canon. That's why A Very Potter Musical has him eat whenever he's onstage. When my sisters and I read Cursed Child aloud, my sister reading for Ron just grabbed an apple and said all his lines while chewing. And we all love Ron.

The thing is... how often did Ron did this in canon and how often does it appear in ffics...
