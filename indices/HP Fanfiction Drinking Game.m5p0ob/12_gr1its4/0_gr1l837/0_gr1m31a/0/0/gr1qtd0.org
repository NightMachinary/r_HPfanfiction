Yeah I'm not so acquainted with those tropes first hand because not my era, but I've heard lots of bacon references on Reddit. It's the availability heuristic though like I haven't reread SS in a long time but I don't think you see him make food other than bacon, so people just latched onto it. You know what I just remembered is that the thing that stuck out to me about Ron's eating is how often he gesticulates with a breakfast sausage to emphasize his point, which may not happen that much relative to how much content is in the books but I guarantee happens more than once.
