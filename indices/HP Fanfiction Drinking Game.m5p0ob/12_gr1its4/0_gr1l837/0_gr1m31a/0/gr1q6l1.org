If you reread the books you will realize Ron doesn't actually eat grossly as much or often as fanfics make us think. It's the same thing with Harry cooking for the the Dursleys, in the books he is asked to watch over the bacon, for a moment, once.

Actually in canon, I think it's more common to see Hermione actually being the one rushing to eat, so she can hurry to the library or something.
