I am so sure there are fics out there where the size is disproportionate with absolutely no humor involved, but I kind of love it for an American Pie-style raunchy comedy. That's hilarious.

I honestly haven't seen it a lot in fanon because I don't usually read Hogwarts era stuff, so there aren't as many scenes where they're all hanging out in the Great Hall (which is where I'd imagine it usually takes place), but he does it a LOT in canon. Also, something that comes to mind with making Ron look stupid is in Order of the Phoenix, when Hermione passes out the DA galleons and Ron gets excited then disappointed when she explains, like... she's obviously not going to be giving you money, man. Such a stupid time to insert a joke about Ron being poor.

EDIT: mixed up "canon" and "fanon"
