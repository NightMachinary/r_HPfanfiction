Well it was a thread about teens with powers and and what shenanighan they would be up to. Someone mentionned genitals injuries, because of course teenagers are going to experiments. Someone else talked about flitwick alerting Pomfrey when he is teaching the spell.

I commented on that thread with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aldjqh/what_kind_of_teenage_bullshit_probably_happened/efdh3ty/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][this]]
