I also really like the idea that none of the trio is prepared for what their kids would get up to as teenagers with none of the stress that they dealt with from Voldemort and other assorted dark wizards. I write second gen, and there's a scene where Ron warns Rose's boyfriend that he approves of the relationship but they should live everyday like a dark wizard is personally trying to kill them until they're eighteen years old that I really enjoyed.
