This is too good. I can't stop laughing. Also even before that starts I think the goblins were apparently misunderstood when Ragnok is their king... And Harry asks to be called Harry. So basically you would already have six shots before Harry is declared heir of anything.

And you'd be at least comatose before the first chapter is over.

This is the best shit I read since My immortal.
