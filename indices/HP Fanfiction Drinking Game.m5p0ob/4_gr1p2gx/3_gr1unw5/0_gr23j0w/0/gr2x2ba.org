With 683 stories written I'm surprised any of them got past 100k words. Although if you look at it, while she does look like one of the most prolific authors out there, I'm going to guess she averages around 4k words, which comes out to quite prolific but not the most. There's a couple monsters out there who have done in excess of 3 million, and ShayneT I think is approaching 2 million and can probably drop 700k+ a year.
