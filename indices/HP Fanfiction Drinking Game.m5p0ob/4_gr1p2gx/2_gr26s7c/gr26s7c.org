I actually decided to read the first chapter once I saw the intro. It's... not well written. But I've read worse, so I decided what the heck and I'd finish the chapter. Then I got to the goblin list. And tried to read it. Then tried some more.

Then it just kept going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going.... and going some more.

So I decided to try and skip it completely and go on top the next segment. But then there was more. And more. And more. And more.

Y'all, don't drink to this. You will die before the end of the first segment of the list. This is brutal. This is madness. And I didn't even make it to the end of the first chapter.

I feel like this was a crack fic that someone took waaaay too Sirius. (Pun intended). I'm going to go find something good to read to bleach my brain.
