  Harry is named heir of the Potter House, 1 shot

  Harry is named heir of a second prestigious house, 2 shots

  Harry is named heir to a third prestigious house, 3 shots

  Harry is named heir to a fourth prestigious house, 5 shots

  Harry is named heir to a fifth prestigious house, 8 shots

  Hope it is not necessary, but if Harry is name heir to more houses, just keep fibonaccing that thing until it ends or you smack the floor
