How many shots is it per evil magic Dumbledore uses on people? Eg, Dumbledore curses the Dursley's into being angry, Dumbledore magically bound fawkes, Dumbledore bound Harry's magical core.

Also an extra shot for everytime someone mentions Dumbledore lacing his lemon drops with veritaserum or reading people's minds.
