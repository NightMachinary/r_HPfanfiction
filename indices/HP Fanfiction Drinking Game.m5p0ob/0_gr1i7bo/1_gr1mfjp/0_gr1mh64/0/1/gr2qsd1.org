The name of a constellation, I guess, keeps with the theme of the Blacks.

Leo Black doesn't flow(unless it's Leonard or Leonidas, but then it doesn't follow the naming rule), closest thing IMHO would be Regulus(the brightest star in the Leo constellation) but that has already been used.

Some people go with Ares Black, due to the connection with the god of war, but I don't know if there's a star or constellation named Ares.

If I had to name Harry as a Black, it would probably be Orion (because it's cool , associated with the hunter, etc)
