I'd understand if she married anyone other than Ron. I'm not familiar with genetics that much, but I'm pretty sure it's hard to have a kid with both red hair and black skin since both are considered dominant traits.

The way Rowling responded to that criticism was "Well, Hermione /could/ be black as I didn't specifically write Hermione as white" nevermind the fact that there have been multiple blatant points about Hermione being white. That's where part of my dislike for Cursed Child comes from; the other part comes from it being considered canon while breaking all established rules of lore.
