Malfoy himself isn't evil...He's a shitbag and a product of his environment who later gains some self awareness, but not Voldemort or Bellatrix evil.

Daphne is literally mentioned in like one sentence in canon. Pansy however, could certainly be called a minion of Malfoy. Being cruel, a bully, and wanting to send Harry to Voldemort is definitely fucked.
