I'm with you that it is very interesting to explore what could happen. Fanfic is great in part because it allows the author to take the story in different directions, including darker themes. As a thought exercise, it is interesting to see what effect Arthur's death would have on canon. Would Harry and Ginny get together or would both be so depressed that neither would notice the things about each other that drew them together? Would Ron become so surly and depressed that Hermione simply couldn't help him, thus breaking up the Trio? Or perhaps would he become incredibly determined to avenge his father's death, which at first makes Hermione happy that he is becoming more serious about his studies but then she realizes she is losing the fun Ron she loves?

It's a plot change that could be fantastic for fanfic but I think could've ruined the actual series.
