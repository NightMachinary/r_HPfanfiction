There are a surprising number of juicy plots that for whatever reason just rarely get written.

Not so much a plot, but I've requested a few times for a Dean-focused fic that revolves around the awkwardness that is Harry dating Ginny while he still clearly likes her and shares a dorm with Harry. I never get any responses, nor have I found much of that story in my searches.
