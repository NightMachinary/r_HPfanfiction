I'm glad she didn't kill off Arthur. Not only do I really like him, moreso than the other father figures of the series, but I think his death would have completely changed the entire Weasley family in a depressing way. I think a lot of the joking around from the twins, or the romance plotlines involving Ron and Ginny would feel out of place, if not removed entirely.

One of the things that made Harry Potter so great was how they made the characters seem normal and real by having them experience things we all go through. It's why I loved Half Blood Prince so much; while the stakes had been raised to new heights, it was also the book that made these magical characters seem most normal and allowed the reader to connect with them on a different level.

The other possible issue with Rowling killing off Arthur would be that she might not actually change much of anything. I think Rowling was not great at accurately showing the impact traumatic events had on the characters. I was surprised how quickly and easily Harry seemed to bounce back from Sirius' death, for example. As such, one would not be surprised to find the Weasleys also not really feeling the impact.
