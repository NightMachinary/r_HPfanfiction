Like I said, understandable. I honestly hate shipping Hermione and Draco. I just feel like it's a waste of time to read about a story where a good character gets shat all over and ends with a broken relationship. I'm probably being a bit dramatic but why don't you just look for good stories instead? Find something where everyone who's canonically good isn't an asshole?
