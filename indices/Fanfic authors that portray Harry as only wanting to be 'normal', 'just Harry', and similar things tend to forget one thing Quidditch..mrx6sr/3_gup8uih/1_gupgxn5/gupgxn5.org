I mean that's more relevant to being a fan, but definitely most people are not star athletes. if we can take high school to be analogous, the star quarterback or whatever is not "normal" by definition, that is an exceptional place to be, with the status of that place being generally desired by "normal" people.

All this is a bit besides the point though, at the end of the day all of this is to rationalize poor writing and characterization on Rowling's part, with the understanding that this originated as a book for children that wouldn't be heavily scrutinized.
