Sure, but I think that some of the relevant dynamics shown (i.e, sports culture) are much closer to the US system than some others, if anything I would say it's even more extreme - in the books, literally /everyone/ in the school watches these games, they hold large parties after victories, that's definitely as much if not more emotional investment than any American school.
