I've never understood high school quarterbacks being touted as star athletes. It's just a school sports team. I had classmates who won regional championships with their sports teams, and in the week or so after a win they definitely got compliments from others in the school, especially from students competing in the same or lower leagues, and enjoyed some gentle ribbing back and forth, but they didn't have any 'status'.
