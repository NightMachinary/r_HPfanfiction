Characters are a sham, we fall into patterns we don't even perceive and also change vastly every day. Just because an analysis viz a story is lighter than some more gritty content doesn't mean it's a sham. The trick to see if the character is done coherently is to see if they're brought to life. And we all personally know harry.
