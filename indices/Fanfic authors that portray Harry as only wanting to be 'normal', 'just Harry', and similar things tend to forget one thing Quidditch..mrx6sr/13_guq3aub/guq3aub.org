What bothers me the most about the "just Harry" fics is that he's too insistent on being called just "Harry". It's too much. Whoever he meets he immediately insists on being "just Harry". Bones, Ragnok, Fudge, everyone with power. He sounds like a schmoozer. Very Slytherin, presenting himself as friendly, young, inexperienced. /Non-threatening/. By all means downplay your fame and power.

"Just Harry" is often used in "Friend of Goblins" fics, often with fix-everything-Gringotts.

There are fics where I want to scream "Shut up!" when he starts to "just Harry". It's freaking /everyone/. And when he starts with Dobby or Winky I feel like it's outright harassment. They're not human, stop making them uncomfortable. Call me Harry and eat at my table. No, Harry, no.

Another thing: This makes Harry single-minded and inflexible. /2-dimensional/. Maybe there are advantages to treating people differently, judging every situation separately. No, not maybe.

Please dial back "just Harry", it's too freaking much.
