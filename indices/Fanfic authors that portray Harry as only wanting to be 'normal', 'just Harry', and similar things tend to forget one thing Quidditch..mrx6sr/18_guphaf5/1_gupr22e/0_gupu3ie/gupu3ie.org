It seems the edition I have available is slightly different than my original one or maybe I am misremembering things but the actual quote is:

/"So it all comes down to this, doesn't it?" whispered Harry. "Does the wand in your hand its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does... I am the true master of the Elder Wand."/

My initial edition, as I remember it, said "the master of death" instead of "the true master of the Elder Wand".
