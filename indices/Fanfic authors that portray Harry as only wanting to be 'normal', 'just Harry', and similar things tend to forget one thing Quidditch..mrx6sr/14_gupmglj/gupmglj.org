Interesting theory. Recently I started thinking that his obsession with normality could be explained as an unintended consequence of living with the Dursleys. He must have internalized at least some of their thoughts and feelings on normality. Because even in winning and celebrating his win in the books it's not as if he's a social butterfly and its seems more likely that as a character he would like everything to return to normal after the adrenalin has receded.
