You're sensing movement more than seeing, I reckon. And it may even be the case that glare from the snitch is more noticeable with glasses on if it angled into the lens badly.

Admittedly, my eyesight's quite a lot worse than it was ten years ago, so I'm not sure this is still true but (a) it was pretty bad then and (b) I could beat my friends at handball without my glasses on. Oh, sure, most of them weren't that good and we played in a line so there were fewer angles to consider but the principle is sound.

Also, Daniel Vettori was, at times, practically NZ's best batsman in glasses... though, of course, it's more catching that is comparable to Seeking.
