I can agree with that, but I can also see an argument for him being /ambivalent/ about fame in general (not resentful, just not caring much) in those same Quidditch matches.

The reason he enjoys the attention when he wins at Quidditch might just be that the people cheering for him at that point are his own House - his family-of-choice, as it were. Every time he wins a Quidditch match and stays conscious to enjoy it, the people whose cheering he focuses on to the point where he tunes everyone else out? His besties, Ron and Hermione.

If he were playing Professional Quidditch, sure he'd enjoy the simple thrills of flying fast and winning - but he might basically just tune out the cheering fans if he had any.
