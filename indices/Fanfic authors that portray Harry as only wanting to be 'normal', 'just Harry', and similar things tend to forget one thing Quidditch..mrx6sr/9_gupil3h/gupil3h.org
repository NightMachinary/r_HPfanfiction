I don't think Harry minded some spotlight. He didn't mind leading the DA and getting praise for it. His choice of career as auror was a bit flashy too. He thought the Triwizard sounded great until he was drawn to compete and everyone freaked out. He didn't mind Quidditch glory. It attracted way more than the usual attention from the student body.
