I beg to differ. In all four of those examples, Harry is doing something which he's almost unwillingly drawn into, but just sees as necessary. I think it's a core facet of Harry's personality that where others see glory, reward or danger, he sees something that just needs doing.

Harry reacted strongly /against/ the DA. He only came to see its usefulness as preparation against Voldemort. His enjoyment in it came from seeing the DA's accomplishments, not their adulation for him.

His choice of career as an Auror is unquestionably shaped by who he has been all through the books rather than fame or money, neither of which he wants. To which I will add that all his adventures starting from dealing with the troll and the Stone, starts with "something has to be done and I'll do it".

Half the subplots of GOF was Harry dealing with /not/ wanting to be in the Triwizard Tournament. To the point of arguing with Ron, remember?

Lastly, Harry's reaction whenever he's unable to play Quidditch is always "damn they have no Seeker". He thinks in terms of what the team needs, not "what about me", going all the way back to him flying for the first time because he took back Nev's Remembrall from Malfoy... and that's also the core difference between Draco and Harry.
