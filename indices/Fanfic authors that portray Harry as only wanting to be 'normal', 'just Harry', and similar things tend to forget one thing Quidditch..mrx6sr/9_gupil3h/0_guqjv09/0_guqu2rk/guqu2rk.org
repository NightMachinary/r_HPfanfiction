These were two of the scenes from Goblet of Fire I was thinking about. To be clear, I don't think Harry is "bad" for daydreaming about this. It's a pretty normal thing for kids (people, really) to want to be popular and successful.

"Harry rolled over in bed a series of dazzling new pictures formed in his mind's eye.... He had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was seventeen...he had become Hogwarts champion...he was standing on the grounds, his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school, all of whom were applauding and screaming...he had just won the Triwizard Tournament... Cho's face stood out particularly clearly in the blurred crowd, her face glowing with admiration...Harry grinned into his pillow, exceptionally glad Ron couldn't see what he could."

"'Speak for yourself,' said George, 'You'll try and get in, won't you, Harry?'

Harry thought briefly of Dumbledore's insistence that nobody under seventeen should submit their name, but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the Triwizard Tournament filled his mind again... He wondered how angry Dumbledore would be if someone younger than seventeen did find a way to get over the age line...."
