There's a difference between being famous for your own achievements and being famous because of something you didn't do and don't remember that was outside of your control.

Harry absolutely does want to just live a normal life. The one forgetting something is you, which is that there's a difference between the kind of fame you get from doing something in a school club and the kind of fame you get when people won't stop staring at a scar on your head and bringing up how your parents died.

Besides, if I wanted to, I could argue that he's not even seeking fame by playing Quidditch: he's playing it because it is something he genuinely loves to do. Harry would play Quidditch even if nobody watched the games and the sport was largely ignored by society. He's not playing it to be famous or to be seen, and if you think he is then you've grossly misunderstood Harry's love of flying and speed.

If anything, I'm surprised he never got the bike or the Ford Anglia back in canon.
