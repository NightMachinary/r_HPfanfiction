Harry's reaction whenever he's unable to play Quidditch is always "damn, they have no Seeker". He thinks in terms of what the team needs, not "oh no I can't play", going all the way back to him flying for the first time because he took back Nev's Remembrall from Malfoy... and that's also the core difference between Draco and Harry. Draco does what he does including join the Slytherin team because he wants adulation. Harry does what he does because he thinks it's necessary, and in reality dislikes adulation.

Like most fictional (and possibly nonfictional) heroes, Harry's thinking when facing any problem is usually "someone ought to do something, and that person is me". (To paraphrase Sir Pratchett.)
