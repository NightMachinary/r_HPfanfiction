Agreed. A lot of people wonder about Harry's Slytherin qualities and how the Hat could've considered putting him there---- I always thought it was fairly clear that he has a very deep desire to prove himself. He might not like the consequences of fame, and is uncomfortable with being the Boy-Who-Lived, but he's definitely ambitious when it comes to things he's passionate about, like Quidditch.
