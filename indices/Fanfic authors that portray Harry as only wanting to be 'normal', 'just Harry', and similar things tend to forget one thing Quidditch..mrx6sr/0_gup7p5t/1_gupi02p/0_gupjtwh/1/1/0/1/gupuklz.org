It depends how you define ambition really. If you narrowly define ambition as desiring to achieve conventionally great things independently of external motivations, then no he isn't ambitious.

But I'd argue that Harry's actions and goals are innately ambitious due to their difficulties regardless of what motivates them.

As for you dismissing the importance of Harry's rebellion against Umbridge, you are aware that Hermione explicitly lays out the reality of the power struggle between Hogwarts and the State and Harry still leads an active dissension despite actual LAWS put in place, explicitly to ensure that his ideology wins the coming three way war. That is ambitious no matter how you slice it.
