Wanting to defeat Voldemort is pretty dang ambitious, though.

I'm wondering if the issue is that 'ambition' is often seen as only being self-serving, but it's literally just a desire to achieve something.

I also love Harry's character. He's my favorite in the books. Average people can also be ambitious.
