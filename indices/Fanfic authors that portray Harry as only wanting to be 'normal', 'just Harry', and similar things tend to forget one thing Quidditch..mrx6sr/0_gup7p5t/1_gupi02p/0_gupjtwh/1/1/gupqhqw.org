It's not so much natural talent. We are explicitly shown Harry having to repeatedly train to do some of the higher level magic he does. The magic he excels at is Defence because that's what he practices.

And besides, you could very easily argue that Harry's desire to establish himself as more than just the BWL is ambitious, and especially later when he wants to take down the most powerful Dark Lord in Potterverse history despite being only an above average 15 year old, or the ambition it takes to strike out against the State as a 15 year old.
