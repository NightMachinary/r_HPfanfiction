Harry was solidly above average at everything when he wasn't distracted by Voldemort or other such things. He maintained a solid EE average on his owls despite his distractions, and was a damn fine wizard in his own right.

He is good at defence, but that is a combination of different magic schools. The reason he excelled there rather than the other classes is because he focused on the direct combat applications of most things rather than academic or other practical uses.

Hell, the Patronus is a charm, and Harry's ridiculously prodigious mastery of that spell is one of his defining traits for many.
