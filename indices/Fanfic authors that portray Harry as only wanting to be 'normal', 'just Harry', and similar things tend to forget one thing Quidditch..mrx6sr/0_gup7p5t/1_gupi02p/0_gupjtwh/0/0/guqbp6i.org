Yea, a lot of people seem to forget this. Sure it might seem an amazing adventure to read while sitting in our mundane life, but most of us would be lucky to even graduate high school if just /one/ of Voldie's plot or Ministry bumbling happen to them.

/Murder/ attempt by multiple teachers? That will be years of therapy. The equivalent of a school shooting nearly killing people you love like your own siblings? Yikes. The /media/ write slanders about you, supported by the government, believed by your schoolmates? Even well-adjusted kids coming from loving families would be reduced to a mess.
