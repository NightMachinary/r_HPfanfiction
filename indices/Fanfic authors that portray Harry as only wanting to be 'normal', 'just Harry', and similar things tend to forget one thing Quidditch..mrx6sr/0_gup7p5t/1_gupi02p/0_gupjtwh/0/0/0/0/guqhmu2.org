I'd actually say Harry is naturally intelligent too. Lily was really bright, as was James (regardless of how many people like to fanon-ize him into a dumb jock). People like to play up Hermione's smartness, but most of that's from hard work. Even after she calmed down a little, she was /constantly studying/.

Home life was definitely a thing though. As I mentioned above, kids from abusive and neglectful homes tend to do badly in academics. That leaves an impact.
