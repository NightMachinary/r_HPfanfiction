How come James is always fanonized into either a dumb jock who Lily got with because he'd "protect" her, or essentially the second coming of Jesus in wizard form who could /never/ do anything bad?

Like, why not make him a guy who gets above-average grades and could be much better if he applied himself, but prefers hanging out with his friends and doing stupid teenager stuff to impress his crush and expose her best friend for being an asshole? Why's it always got to be some extreme?
