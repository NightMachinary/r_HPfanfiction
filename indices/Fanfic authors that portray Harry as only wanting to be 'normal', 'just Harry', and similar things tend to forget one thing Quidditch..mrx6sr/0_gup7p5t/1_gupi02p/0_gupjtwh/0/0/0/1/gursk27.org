That reminds me, I have another pet peeve: fics where Harry deliberately and consciously downplays his intelligence because of his upbringing at the Dursleys. That's not quite how it would go realistically. If anything, it would be on a subconscious level, and more in the vein of basically becoming something of a slacker, coasting through school doing the bare minimum to get a passing grade because "why bother?".
