People always pretend like "average" means "bad". No, it means "average". As in, completely baseline. Ergo, "above average" means "better than most".

I'm very familiar with people who are prodigies without even trying (often only in one area) but who don't apply themselves even though they would be much, much better if they did. James is exactly like that, based on what we know about him. A genius with transfiguration, but much more concerned with his friends and his crush than studying all day.
