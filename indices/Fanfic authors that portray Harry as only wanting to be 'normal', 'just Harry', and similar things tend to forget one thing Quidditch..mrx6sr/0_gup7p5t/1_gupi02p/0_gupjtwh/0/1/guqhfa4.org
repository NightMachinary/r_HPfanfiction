Yup.

Between the distractions and the fact that we really don't see him trying too hard, I honestly think he could have been competition for Hermione in academics if he'd had normal time and more gumption.

Hermione is bright, but she's bright due to work, she works hard. She's not some sort of super-genius, regardless of how fanon treats her.

Harry had to deal with constant distractions and issues from his growing up - kids in abusive and neglectful homes often do badly in academics due to various psychological factors. Ron, even if he wasn't NEARLY as bad as fanon makes him, didn't help as he was pretty lazy and sometimes got Harry to slack even more. See "Divination is an easy class, just take that." Though Percy didn't help, am I getting fanon confused or did he suggest Harry take Divination and Muggle Studies?
