Either the electives are useless, or some people are really disappointed in 5th year when they find out they need an OWL in something they never studied.

It honestly could be the former, ancient runes is canonically just a dead language, divination has a poor reputation and doesn't really work most of the time, and arithmancy is just divination with numbers, only care of magical creatures is relevant to anything.
