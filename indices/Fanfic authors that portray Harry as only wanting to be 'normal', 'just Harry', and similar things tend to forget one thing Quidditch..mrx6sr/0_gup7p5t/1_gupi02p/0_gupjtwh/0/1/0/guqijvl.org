" Ron, even if he wasn't NEARLY as bad as fanon makes him, didn't help as he was pretty lazy and sometimes got Harry to slack even more. See "Divination is an easy class, just take that." "

Honestly, I blame the school more for this.\\
We never see them do any advisement on which classes students should take, and every adult should know one can't trust a 13-year-old to keep long-term goals in mind.\\
Also, the fact that Harry is muggle-raised and wouldn't know the first thing about any of the subjects. Even Hermione suffered from this as she just took everything, clearly not knowing what was best for herself, and didn't wanna miss out on anything.
