Well, we aren't told enough about Runes to know if it's simply a dead language or more. We just don't know. As for Arithmancy, even with the base description, it COULD be something like magical statistics which helps predict certain useful things. We don't know.

But yes. I tend to think all should be useful in some way. As it stands, you're right. Care is the only one of actual, obvious use. We don't see enough about the others (other than Divination, which is useless for sure) to tell.
