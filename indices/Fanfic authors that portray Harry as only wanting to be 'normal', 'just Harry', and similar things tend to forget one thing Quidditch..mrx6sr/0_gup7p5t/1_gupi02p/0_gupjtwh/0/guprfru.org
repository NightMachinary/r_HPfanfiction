  Harry was solidly above average at everything when he wasn't distracted by Voldemort or other such things. He maintained a solid EE average on his owls despite his distractions, and was a damn fine wizard in his own right.

THANK YOU!

I never got that mind set that Harry was an 'average' student.\\
His grades are all quite good and that is DESPITE the constant distractions to his academics that takes place during the story, like Voldemort, dementors, Triwizard tournament, and useless teachers (most Defense-teachers, Snape, Trelawney, and so forth)

Literally, the only exams he failed at was Divination and History.\\
Divination is a given, considering the teacher is actively sabotaging his class by singling him out and predicting his deaths constantly. Anyone would hate such a class.\\
In History, he literally passed out due to a fake vision from Voldemort. That is a valid excuse for a bad grade, and that is not even mentioning the fact the teacher in history is the worst.

In Astronomy, he received acceptable, despite being distracted with Hagrid getting attacked by Umbridge and McGonagall getting send to the hospital by several stunners.

Everything else? EE or above. Even potions, which has a teacher that actively hates Harry and sabotages his education.
