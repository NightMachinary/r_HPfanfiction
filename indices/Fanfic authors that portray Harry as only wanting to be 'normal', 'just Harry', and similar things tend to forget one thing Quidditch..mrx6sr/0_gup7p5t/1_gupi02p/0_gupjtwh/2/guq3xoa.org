Eh, IDK. The thing with 'average' in Harry Potter/Hogwarts seems to mostly be 'bad teachers with non-driven students', which doesn't seem to have particularly stellar results. Harry doesn't really stand out - I think when people say that he's average, that's what they mean (whereas he's certainly above average if we're counting those like Crabbe and Goyle in there).

I don't think any of Harry's magic is particularly extraordinary - like you mention, his success in defense mostly comes down to him having practiced that much more extensively than the other ones, and being fairly driven in the subject - but from the DA, I think we can see that (if they are also focused) other students were also all 'above average' in the same way.

I guess in the end I'd say Harry was above average, but not extraordinary - with his more unusual feats being less due to him being special, and more that most students in Hogwarts (from what I can see) would have been able to do something similar if in his situation and driven. Rather than, as some take it, a sign of Harry being incredibly powerful and the next super genius magic user like Voldemort or Dumbledore.
