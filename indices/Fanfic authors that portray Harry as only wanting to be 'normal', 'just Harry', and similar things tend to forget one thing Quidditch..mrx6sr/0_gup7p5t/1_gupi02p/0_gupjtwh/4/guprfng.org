I'm sorry but I don't think you really addressed almost anything I wrote, other than the correction that he was above average in classes instead of average. Fair enough on that, I believe you, but that doesn't really engage with the meat of my comment.

One thing I will say though, is that I always hear how difficult the patronus is, yet why exactly is that? By the description, it should be fairly straightforward, and I've actually seen some fanon that challenges that canon lore or subverts it by having him teach it to a bunch of other people... In which case, him casting it at such a comparatively young age is less attributed to any innate difficulty or talent, and more to do with the fact that nobody bothers to teach it to anyone else.

Like so many other elements in the book, the supposed "difficulty" of the patronus honestly seems to be one of those things Rowling shoved in for the sole purpose of giving him some easy street cred.
