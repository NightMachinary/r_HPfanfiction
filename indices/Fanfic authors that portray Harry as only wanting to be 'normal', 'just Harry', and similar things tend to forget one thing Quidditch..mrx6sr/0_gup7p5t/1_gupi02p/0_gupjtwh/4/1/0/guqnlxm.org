Yeah, I agree, I personally consider that a great flaw in canon (inb4 magic systems), but if you make this spell out to be such a big deal, you say it's so much more difficult, and that it's proof that he's this talented and skilled guy, don't you think it deserves a little more scrutiny, a little more explanation?

Yeah, you could say that all spells follow a similar framework and aren't explained, but what in particular makes this one different from a first year one? Why does Hermione struggle with it? This should be explained, regardless of the system of magic.
