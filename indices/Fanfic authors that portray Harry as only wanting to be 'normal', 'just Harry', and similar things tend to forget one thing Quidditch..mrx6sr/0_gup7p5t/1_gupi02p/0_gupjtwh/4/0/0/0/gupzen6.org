From what we see, the Patronus is complicated magic because it requires more from the user.

Most magic comes down to intent, mastery of the technique of the spell and perhaps stamina, though that is rather murky.

The Patronus requires immense strength of Will, enough to summon and maintain your most positive memory while being surrouded by soul sucking demons that actively induce depression and bring forth your worst memories, requires just as much mastery of the technique as any other spell, and also seems to have a similar component of stamina.

Hermione was bad at it, because she's terrible under pressure and never came close to the willpower Harry learned from his time with the Dursley's and early Hogwarts. She also never practiced nearly as much as Harry did, didn't have the same motivating factor to learn that he did etc etc.

It's not so difficult to learn. Harry teaches it to the DA in a few sessions. Albeit after they've been learning advanced DADA magic for a while.

But it's a monster to put into practice because most people just don't have the kind of live fire mentality required to do every step of the Patronus at once against a Dementor.

Hell, even Harry at 13 learns it relatively quickly, and summoned a Corporeal when he thought Malfoy was a Dementor, but Lupin outright tells him casting the Patronus in the presence of a Dementor and out is as different as night and day, which the end of Azkaban proves.
