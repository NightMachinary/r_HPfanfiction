I don't think you're grasping my the criticism I made; to clarify, my issue with it is not whether it is /said/ to be difficult or not, it's that there is nothing to back this up. It is just constantly repeated that this is something difficult, yet it's not explained why it's difficult, or why he's better. He just is.

Which really tied back into my parent comment, where my main point is that all of these things rely on Harry having some innate talent.

Take for example karate, or coding. I understand why both of these are difficult, I can understand why someone may fail at either one of them. Certainly, both require a certain innate aptitude to achieve notable success; e.g, good physique and reflexes for karate, good critical and lateral thinking for coding. Both require large amounts of time and practice.

With either one of those, if someone is "really good at karate", or "really good at C++", this is something I can understand and respect. If someone is a prodigious master of martial arts, that's fucking impressive, and I can imagine the rigors they must have went through to achieve such a level of mastery.

Yet what the fuck does it even mean to have a "prodigious mastery" of the patronus? Obviously this is a fictional world, but within that fictional framework, why the hell is he better than Hermione? He practiced a couple times with Lupin, and then at the lake he had a dues ex machina moment where it "clicked" for him and he was able to cast it in the most dire of situations... And wala, henceforth, he is the youngest guy to do it, a prodigious master, yada yada. It's ridiculous.

Can you see my main criticism here?
