  From what we see, the Patronus is complicated magic because it requires more from the user.

What's so complicated about it? I just don't see it. You imagine something happening, say the words, flick the stick - same as with anything else

  The Patronus requires immense strength of Will, enough to summon and maintain your most positive memory while being surrouded by soul sucking demons that actively induce depression and bring forth your worst memories, requires just as much mastery of the technique as any other spell, and also seems to have a similar component of stamina.

  Hermione was bad at it, because she's terrible under pressure and never came close to the willpower Harry learned from his time with the Dursley's and early Hogwarts. She also never practiced nearly as much as Harry did, didn't have the same motivating factor to learn that he did etc etc.

That's a LOT of conjecture, which you kind of did elsewhere as well. I don't know if I agree that this vaguely defined "willpower" is the big difference, or that it's the primary reason for difficulty. I also don't know if I completely agree with all the rest, either... I could and would argue that being a top student and building successful habits requires and builds much more discipline and willpower than being vaguely disliked and put down by your family, if anything that would decrease this nebulous idea of "willpower"

We can agree that it's more difficult in a real world scenario, but I'll get into why the 3rd year thing wasn't nearly as impressive or relevant.

  But it's a monster to put into practice because most people just don't have the kind of live fire mentality required to do every step of the Patronus at once against a Dementor.
#+end_quote

Every step? I don't see any more steps here than with any other spell, even if we agree on the same sort of requirements for all spells..

#+begin_quote
  It's not so difficult to learn. Harry teaches it to the DA in a few sessions. Hell, even Harry at 13 learns it relatively quickly,
#+end_quote

Exactly, which goes to my point about why this is painted as such a big deal. I read a fic once where it was explained systemically, that people just assumed it was difficult and didn't bother teaching it. But that's an in-canon rationalization (albeit one that seems to hold up), I'm talking croma writing perspective.

#+begin_quote
  casting the Patronus in the presence of a Dementor and out is as different as night and day, which the end of Azkaban proves.
#+end_quote

But what does it prove? Remember, we're talking about why his use or mastery of it is exceptional, and what happened at the end? His past self A) completely failed to cast it vs 100, and B) his future self managed to cast one while across the lake and out of their focus.

So again, I fail to see how this is in any way prodigious or impressive, this just bolsters my original criticism.
