  I always thought it was fairly clear that he has a very deep desire to prove himself.

Really? I admit it's been a long time since I've read the books, but I don't remember seeing this at all. Wasn't he just about average at literally everything, with the sole exception of flying and defence? And wasn't his success with both of those things largely attributed to his natural aptitude? I don't know how much fanon has crept in, so feel free to correct me.

Prove himself to be "normal", I guess?

  ...he's definitely ambitious when it comes to things he's passionate about, like Quidditch.
#+end_quote

I don't know if you can really say he's ambitious or passionate there, not when he was almost press-ganged onto the house team after that first lesson.

Obviously he grew to enjoy it and of course everyone wants to win at the games they play, but I doubt whether a natural desire to win at games is equivalent to the definition of ambition most people have. Certainly, if I enjoy playing CS:GO or Chess I would like to win my matches, but that's not really the same thing. If I wanted to be pro, if I practiced extra, if a significant portion of my life was devoted to becoming a Chess grandmaster, then yes that would be ambitious, but I don't remember reading anything even approaching that dedication in canon.
