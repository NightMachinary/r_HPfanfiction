Don't get me started on the Patronus.

It's a prime example of Rowling changing courses midstream.

It's introduced in book three as this uber-hard charm, and Harry is amazing in that he can even produce mist.

Later on, he teaches it to fifth years when allegedly even most adults can't cast it.

You can tell Rowling was shifting from a "Harry is a powerful, talented wizard with self-esteem and laziness issues." to "Harry is an everyman who is lucky." which is what we got especially in book seven. Half the plot is done by Harry being lucky.
