I think it's really that he just wasn't motivated. The Patronus is one of the hardest things to do for both DADA and Charms, and he did it perfectly at 13. And Harry's definitely not the only one who's had his parents die for him and went through a neglectful home environment as a result, and he's also not the only one with willpower, so I think it's safe to say that is an adequate proof that he has a good amount of underlying power and capability. Most adult wizards can't do shield charms, but he did that too, and even taught others (including those older than him, literal seventh years) to do it too. He might favor Expelliarmus, but it's shown repeatedly that his are strong enough to knock people out even when he's literally barely a teenager. He managed Sectumsempra and Levicorpus/Liberacorpus (no verbally at that) the first try.

Even in potions, Harry, while not being a prodigy like Snape who can /invent/ spells and potions before he even hits the 20s, is proven to be more than competent when it suits him, like when he feels sympathy for Snape after finding out his dad bullied him and then successfully makes the Invigoration draught, and even manages an EE on the OWL.

Keep in mind that the books are from Harry's perspective, so what sounds easy in his mind may very well not be.

As for Quidditch--- I mean, first of all, ambition doesn't necessarily mean hard work. You can aspire to great things without having the will to work for it. Second, Harry's life is the most hectic thing possible for a wizard, so I doubt he ever had the time or energy to train for professional Quidditch (though he certainly has enough to study more). There's a scene in GOF where Harry fantasizes about a crowd roaring his name like they do for Krum at the World Cup. I thought that showed there was a part of Harry that wanted to be the best at something, and to have people admire him for it even, as long as it didn't have to do with what his mother did to get rid of Voldemort. Doesn't mean he actively pursued it like Oliver Wood, but he /wanted/ to, and I think that's the point of it.
