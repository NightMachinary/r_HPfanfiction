Harry is borderline fanatic about Quidditch sometimes. He daydreams in Goblet of Fire about being a Quidditch star, with everyone chanting his name. In the same book, he also daydreams about being the Hogwarts champion.

He's definitely interested in being famous, just not for something involving his own parents' deaths. He's also above average in most magic. He just seems average because he's surrounded by people who are even better. Ron is above average too.
