When you actually think about canon magic practically, those Gamp's laws make zero sense. Just look at Aguamenti, the water making charm. You create water out of nothing, water that you can drink. Since water is just molecules, which is really just energy, it is creating something from nothing. And when you have that, you can create gold or any other element ,so long as you put enough of it in one place, (i.e. nuclear fusion).

I think it's best not to be so picky about that nonsense, just go with the flow.
