This is pretty much my own headcanon after considering the issue for a long time. I add understanding and complexity as part of the Z value for the energy needed - you can't transfigure something you don't understand and complex things are a lot more difficult, which makes cloth actually hard to do. Conjured kittens etc. aren't properly alive nor made of meat. They're fluffy little constructs.
