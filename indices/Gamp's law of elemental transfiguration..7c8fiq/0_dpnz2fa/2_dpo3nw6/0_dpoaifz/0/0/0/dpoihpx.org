Just because magic can allow people to exist in an altered form after physical death does not necessarily entail that "life", as a fundamental /concept/, exists in magical theory (in the way that the above comment was implying where you supposedly can't truly transfigure an actual living being even if you get the exact atomic structure right, because it's missing some intangible "life" quality). The two are completely different notions.
