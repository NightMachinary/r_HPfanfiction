All very well thought-out. I don't agree with all of it, because my conception of the magic system doesn't include any nebulous "concepts" like "life" as anything else than the biochemical process known to muggle. Of course, that one's a matter of opinions.

More to the point, I have a slightly more refined theory on the issue of rare metals --- I'd say it's just that Transfigured gold, like all Transfigured materials, can be Untransfigured (alhough it won't revert on its own as some people seem to think). Thus, to stabilize the wizarding economy, the Goblins decreed Transfigured gold (or silver, diamond, etc.) has no monetary value and cannot be bought or sold; and at any gold transaction, it is thus required to perform an Untransfiguration spell on the "gold" to check if it's "real". Meanwhile, Alchemical transformations are irreversible, perenially changing the nature of the object, making Alchemical Gold indistinguishable from mined gold. Because Flamel is a reasonable man, he cut a deal with the Goblins and they allow him to spend his gold freely as long as he doesn't create too much of it at a time (and dock the prices when selling to them).
