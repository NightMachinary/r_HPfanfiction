I don't dislike your attempt at the definition of Gamp's Law (though my own take is more simple: "any object can be turned into any other object"), but I think you're blurring a few lines by making the exceptions an attempt to lay down fundamental rules of general magic rather that specific matters related to transfiguration. We shouldn't try to shoe horn everything we know about magic into a rule of transfiguration.

So, for example, I doubt that the "enchantment" one is actually an exception, because transfiguration doesn't even attempt to do that - enchantment is simply beyond the definition of transfiguration.

Similarly, "you cannot resurrect the dead" is clearly a rule of general magic but "life" is a bad exception to Gamp's law, because we have seen transfiguration used to create life on many occasions (in the form of animals). Of course transfiguration cannot create souls, but again this is not so much an exception than part of the definition of transfiguration - souls are not physical, so transfiguration doesn't deal with them at all.

Gold/currency is a generally accepted good candidate for one of the exceptions, and that's actually a further good reason to avoid treating Gamp's exceptions as matters of general magic, because we know that in branches of magic other than Transfiguration it is possible to create gold (alchemy).

Keeping Gamp's law in its proper place, and not overstating its importance, also helps avoid some problems. For example, we know from OotP and DH that conjuration creates things out of non-being (vanishing sends things into non-being, and in OotP McGonagall defines conjuration as the opposite process of vanishing), so your proposal for conjuration actually being a version of the summoning charm doesn't really fit with canon.

But there's actually no problem to solve: Aguamenti is a Charm, as are Mrs Weasley's cooking Charms. They don't have to obey rules of transfiguration (though they will presumably have their own rules, unknown to us).

Anyway, my candidates for the five exceptions are:

1. Nutrition

2. Currency

3. Creativity

4. Novelty

5. Secrets

To explain:

"Creativity" refers to products of human creativity. Transfiguration can create natural objects without the caster's knowledge of the thing, but it cannot write a book for you, or produce an LP, without your own mind providing the contents.

"Novelty" refers to unique objects. You cannot (re)create something which there is or was only ever one of, such as "the spear which pierced Jesus on the cross".

"Secrets" refers to objects which contain or refer to secret information, such as "a clay model of Voldemort's fifth horcrux" or "a nude photo of 2005 Lindsay Lohan". We know magic already recognises secrets from the Fidelius Charm so it's a nice tie-in, I feel.

All of these are based on what I believe to be the same consideration which led to JKR deciding on food as an exception, which we might call Gamp's Meta-Rule of Transfiguration: transfiguration can break physics, but it cannot break the plot.
