  For example, we know from OotP and DH that conjuration creates things out of non-being (vanishing sends things into non-being, and in OotP McGonagall defines conjuration as the opposite process of vanishing), so your proposal for conjuration actually being a version of the summoning charm doesn't really fit with canon.

  But there's actually no problem to solve: Aguamenti is a Charm, as are Mrs Weasley's cooking Charms. They don't have to obey rules of transfiguration (though they will presumably have their own rules, unknown to us).

That's what I said: instances of Conjuring foodstuffs in the novels are actually the use of Charms. Cedric conjuring the dogs for the first task of the tournament or Draco's Serpentsortia were actual instances of conjuration- the point of my second exception is to point out that those creatures weren't permanent creations. They wouldn't be able to be kept long, taught, bred, or eaten.
