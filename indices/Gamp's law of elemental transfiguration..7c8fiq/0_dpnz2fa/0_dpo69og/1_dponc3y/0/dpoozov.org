It was my understanding that your point extended to transfiguration, not just conjuration. Cedric's dog, for example, was not conjured but rather transfigured from a rock. There seems little reason to think that it isn't a permanent creation.

Further, I feel by committing to the idea that the things created via Charms are not real, you're still extending the Gamp exceptions out of their proper domain. We have no idea what rules govern Charms' conjurations, especially of basic elements like water. When you use Charms to create fire, the fire is real enough. Certainly Harry, after spending an entire year learning about Aguamenti, thinks that it is capable of being drunk and quenching thirst.
