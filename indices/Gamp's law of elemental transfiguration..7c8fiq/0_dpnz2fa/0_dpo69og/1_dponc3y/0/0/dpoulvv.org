I wasn't suggesting that things are ever /created/ by Charms at all; I was pointing out when Dumbledore brought out some Gin from seemingly nowhere or Molly was making sauce come out of her wand or when they used Aguamenti to douse the fire on Hagrid's house, these were Charms. They aren't creating these substances, they're transporting them, which is why they aren't transfigurations and therefore aren't bound by the first exception of Gamp's law.

I don't think the dogs Cedric transfigured from rocks (thought they were conjured, but the Law still applies) would have been capable of being dogs for very long. Cedric treated them like pawns that could be slaughtered without remorse.
