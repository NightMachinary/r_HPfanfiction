Well, not being able to replicate a thing's magical significance I think falls under the same issue as "enchantment" - no, transfiguration can't do it, but that's because transfiguration is the manipulation of physical stuff. So its inability to do so is not an exception to a general rule, it's just part of what transfiguration /is/.

What I mean with novelty is that you would be able to transfigure a generic Roman spear but you would not be able to replicate any particular physical aspects of a particular Roman spear, e.g. having a notch in a certain part of the blade. That is not the same thing as manually creating the notch with transfiguration - of course you can do that - but what I'm getting at is that you can't create the notch merely by reference to some unique historical spear. You have to do that manually yourself.

A consequence to the novelty rule which I quite like is that if you lose your homework, you can't transfigure it back even though you know all the contents. It's not excluded under the "human creativity" exception, as your mind can supply all the detail required, but it /is/ excluded under the "unique items" exception.

And yes, an exclusion for information would be too broad, as the whole basis of transfiguration is that the magic supplies the physical information required - all the wizard needs to know is how the magic works.
