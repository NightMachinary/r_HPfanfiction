The limitations of time and space are covered in general magic. It doesn't need to be in transfiguration as an exception.

I'd /prefer/ there to be patterns in magic. Currency is purely subjective. If it's limited to gold, infinite muggle money. If it's not, I'd like money to have /some/ reason for being an exception.

I like reductionism: food is an exception because it has an unknown non-physical property (or so I wish). Money would be the same. Your exceptions all refer to the same mechanic of transfiguration: reference material, which is what I like about them.

I just thought that every specific item had a unique history, and took that to its logical conclusion. That might prove the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms][Theory of Forms]].

Did you forget magic leaves traces? That should prevent evidence forging. Is there another reason this duplication shouldn't be allowed?
