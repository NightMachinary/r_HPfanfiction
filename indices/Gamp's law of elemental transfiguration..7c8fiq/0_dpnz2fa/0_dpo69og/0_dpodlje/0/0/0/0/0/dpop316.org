  I'd prefer there to be patterns in magic. Currency is purely subjective.

I think you're going to dislike the HP magic system then, which more or less proves that the universe is anthropocentric. The fundamental rules of magic appear to incorporate human concepts.

  Did you forget magic leaves traces? That should prevent evidence forging. Is there another reason this duplication shouldn't be allowed?

The more fundamental point being made was that possession of an item is distinguishable both conceptually and practically from mere knowledge of the item's existence. In that specific example one can of course come up with legal procedures to check against it. But it's not just about that example. The request was for a conceptual difference which demonstrates that the secrets exception does not, in your terms, reduce to the novelty exception. This is that conceptual difference.
