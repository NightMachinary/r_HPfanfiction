  Does this mean someone with eidetic memory could appear to break this rule?

Sure, nothing says you can't transfigure ink on it to form the exact shapes that were on your original homework, since this falls under manual changes. It's probably going to be somewhat taxing to make a shape as intricate as that, though, so even for someone with an eidetic memory it may or may not be easier to just get a dicta-quill or something.

  Wait, now why is Secrets an exception?

Think of it that way: You could have someone use a generic weapon to kill, and it's obviously something you can make a copy of by transfiguring something else, but you cannot do it by transfiguring into “murder weapon” unless you know what exactly that was. So if you know /what/ something is from the role it fulfilled or something, it still is not transfigurable to you if what exact kind of object it is remains a secret to you. The horcruxes are a special case because they are both unique (both as items and as something that holds a piece of a particular soul) and secret (you don't know what they are ... until a certain point anyway) so they fall under two rules.

As for the photo, photos technically aren't unique objects, you could make a copy of any photo you wished and then there'd be two photos, and you can transfigure something into a photo like those, a copy if you'll call it that, but each individual photo as its own object has a unique history of tear and wear that you cannot replicate with standard transfiguration. Think of it that way: if you have a cup that is chipped in a certain place and you transfigure a copy of the cup, then on its own the transfiguration will give you a whole cup with no chipping because it creates a copy of a generic object (a cup) rather than a copy of a unique object (your cup, with its chipped bit). Likewise, you could transfigure a copy of Slytherin's locket, but it would be a generic locket in its shape (generic object), rather than a locket with the specific enchantments that the locket has and a piece of soul attached (unique object).
