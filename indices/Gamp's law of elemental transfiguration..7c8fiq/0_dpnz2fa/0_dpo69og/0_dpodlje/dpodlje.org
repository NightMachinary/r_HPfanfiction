Can you not condense those three into Information? Wait nevermind -- if you conjure a pig you can learn biology. (Or does that violate Secrets? (Assuming a time in which biology isn't known.))

Separate from that: Novelty feels like a specific thing from a larger exception. If McGonagall had that spear in her hand, she should definitely be able to copy it physically. She wouldn't be able to recreate any magical significance -- it's history -- with transfiguration. I think changing Novelty to History or Significance would fit better.
