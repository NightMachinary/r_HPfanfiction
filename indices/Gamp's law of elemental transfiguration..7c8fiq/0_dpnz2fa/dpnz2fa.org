First, 'Beyondhogwarts' is an unofficial website that was active ~8 years ago, and shouldn't be considered as a reference for anything. Both canon and fan theories have developed quite a bit since then.

Second, there aren't five laws, there's one law with five exceptions. While it never is explicitly stated anywhere, there have been several discussions here, on other Potter-related subreddits, other forums, and perhaps even in the author's mind that have explored and extrapolated the rest of what Gamp was trying to say.

Here's my version:

Gamp's law of Elemental Transfiguration = A perfect transfiguration results in an object with the properties and qualities of the intended end-result, with no vestiges of the object's prior state left behind.

There are five exceptions- qualities where magic cannot transfigure or conjure them properly. It can be done, but it doesn't last.

1. Food- life feeds on life; conjured food has no nutritive value and non-consumables transfigured into food are similarly incomplete

2. Life - one cannot conjure sentience, nor can a non-animal be made into an animal with the capacity to procreate. Hearkening back to the first exception, such an animal will deteriorate as the living material that originally had no life fails to replicate new cells

3. Rare elements - darn those leprechauns, turning sod into gold coins to taunt their enemies. The goblins know- it may look like gold (or silver, or platinum, or uranium...) but the fake stuff just doesn't work right. The trick Flamel figured out with the philosopher's stone has probably put him on the goblins' blacklist for the rest of his extraordinarily long life. EDIT: may apply to any material from higher on the periodic table, based upon rarity of appearance on earth. Still, we shouldn't rely on physics/chemistry to explain this...

4. Enchantment - transfiguration in and of itself cannot bestow or remove magical properties; turn a horse into a unicorn and it may be attractive but its blood and horn will have no greater value than that of any mundane creature

5. Magic - magical creatures resist permanent transfiguration while still alive- the effect will wear off, unless the creature is actually happier in its new state (see Quintaped; Animagi 'going native')

People in the habit of 'conjuring' beverages and sauces with their wands are actually using a charm to draw the fluid from a known nearby source- water condensed from the air, mead from a flask, Hollandaise from the pot on the stove or even breathable air from above the surface of a lake (cf. Bubblehead charm)
