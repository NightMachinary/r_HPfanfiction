  I added radioactivity based on the need for such a rule to not be world-breaking. If you could transfigure uranium-235, you could not only transfigure a nuke, but do it by accident if you weren't careful.

Not exactly by accident. Unless wizards discovered nuclear fission by accident before muggles did, it'd be pretty hard to learn that U-235 exists without learning what happens if you get a bunch of it in the same place.

And you can probably already enrich uranium with the summoning charm. Maybe they make muggleborns swear an unbreakable vow not to create atomic weapons or something?
