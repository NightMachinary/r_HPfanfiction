In my stories, the five exceptions are food, money, clothing, life, and magic. (And in The Arithmancer, Hermione discovers a sixth: radioactivity.)

Food and money are basically given in canon. You can't create food out of nothing, and you need the Philosopher's Stone to create gold, etc. The magic cannot create life from non-life in general seems like a pretty reasonable worldbuilding element (Hermione can conjure birds, but they don't work like real birds, etc.), and an extension of magic not being able to raise the dead. And it's reasonable to think that transfiguration cannot create magical items since they have to be made by other magical processes.

I chose clothing for the fifth exception because it's fairly common in fanon, based on the fact that wizards have to buy clothes rather than transfiguring them (although that applies to just about anything else they buy). I justify it in-world based on the structural complexity of spun and woven cloth.

I added radioactivity based on the need for such a rule to not be world-breaking. If you could transfigure uranium-235, you could not only transfigure a nuke, but do it by accident if you weren't careful.
