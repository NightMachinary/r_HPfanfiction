[[http://www.cinemablend.com/images/news_img/70379/mel_gibson_70379.jpg][Mad]]. [[http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/mad-max-game/images/0/0f/Mad_Max_game_(8).jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150618190622][Max]].

[[http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/witcher/images/2/2e/Geraldofrivia.png/revision/latest?cb=20151018005904][Geralt of Rivia]] from the /Witcher/ books and games remains my favourite fantasy hero; [[http://images.amcnetworks.com/amc.com/wp-content/uploads/mt-legacy/mad-men/mm501-502-don-v2-325.jpg][Don Draper]] from /Mad Men/ remains my favourite live-action television character of all time. Last, but not least, I'm really fond of [[http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/cowboybebop/images/9/9e/Spike_Spiegel_Profile.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130731194802][Spike Spiegel]] and [[http://pop-verse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/motoko.jpg][Motoko Kusanagi]] from /Cowboy Bebop/ and /Ghost in the Shell/, respectively, in the animation department.

Edit: And if I'm to do someone from ASOIAF as well, Stannis will always be the Mannis.
