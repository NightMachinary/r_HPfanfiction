Thanks! I remember seeing some teaser that ended with "Introducing John Hurt as the Doctor!" and then the next episode/season started with Peter Capaldi and I was confused. The sequence of events in that show can be so confusing.

My favorite is David Tennant, too, though I haven't seen anything pre-modern Who.
