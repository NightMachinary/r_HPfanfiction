*Dr. McCoy* from /Star Trek: TOS/ - I love how he's so irascible and grouchy, and yet he's a healer. I love his brilliance and his compassion, and more often than not I find myself agreeing with him, rather than Spock or Kirk.

*Bertie Wooster* from the /Jeeves/ books. He's a fool, but he always manages to bounce back from any embarrassment. I envy that. He also fancies himself a man of iron will, but he's actually a pushover. He's actually sensitive and kind under his posturing. He can be an arrogant twat, but he always comes through in the end, contrite and helpful. He never lets a pal down, even if he doesn't particularly like them, and even if it means he looks like an escapee from the local asylum to everyone who doesn't know him.

In their very different ways, they both have a wonderful decency and humanity about them that endears them to me and keeps me coming back.
