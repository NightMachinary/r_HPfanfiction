If you look through my comments I've talked about Dr. Doom in some detail. His motivations at least.

He is by far my favorite character ever created.

He's arrogant with the power to back it up.

He's been a God and a creator.

He also legitimately looks after his people. They aren't living the high life but they want for nothing.

He has his flaws but he can be the strongest there is.
