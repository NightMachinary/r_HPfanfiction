Meruem from Hunter x Hunter. I loved how he was born to specifically fulfill a certain role and yet discovered he was very different than what he and others thought in the end.

Emma Woodhouse from the book Emma. Loved her and the character development. In my opinion, Emma is Jane Austen's masterpiece.

Scarlett 'O Hara, I love her.Maybe it's just because of how deliciously ruthless she can be.
