I've got loads of favourites. Nick Carraway is my favourite novel character. Even though he's probably the closest we get to a decent person in /The Great Gatsby/, he still falls short because of the whole self-centred brooding and private condescension.

Spike Spiegel from /Cowboy Bebop/ is a hallmark of Shinichiro Watanabe's craftsmanship. Spike showed more layers in 26 episodes than an ogre might in... well... four feature-length films. You get it, though.

Zoe Barnes. Just Zoe Barnes.
