  Does this mean that the Elder Wand is simply the /most sentient/ wand, and that's why it's known as the most powerful? That it's just easiest to communicate with, and therefore the easiest wand to use?

No. If it was only the matter of communicating/understanding a spell that the caster was trying to use and the purpose of it usage then Hermione or Bill or Fleur or Ollivander etc. would have repaired Harry's broken wand. I'm sure at least one them possessed a wand that was both sentient and bonded enough to cast the repairing charm reparo.

As for the rest of that paragraph, logic you're using is a bit backwards and hard to understand. I will try to speculate as best as I understand.

All wands do change their allegiance if their master is beaten and they do recognize if their master is beaten. Otherwise why/how could they change their allegiance in the first place.

Draco's wand was not special and Elder Wand does not affect its allegiance. Draco had the Elder Wand's allegiance because he disarmed Dumbledore and then Harry gained Elder Wand's allegiance because he disarmed Draco. It was AFAIK the only example of wizard with two wands being 'beaten' in canon and when Harry beaten the Draco when Draco was using his hawthorn wand he gained the allegiance of both Draco's hawthorn wand and the Elder Wand.

Now does this mean any wizard that have the allegiance of two or more wands would loose all of their wands allegiances when they're beaten while using only one of their wands? Possible. Could it be that it was a special case due to Elder Wand? Equally possible.

All of that aside, if Elder Wand was such a mega sentient wand I would think that it would have known that Draco was a tool in the hands of Voldemort and thus its allegiance would have gone to Voldemort instead.
