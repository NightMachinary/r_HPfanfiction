  'magic is all about intent' is born of 'you have to mean them.'

Yes I know, I just meant that this does not apply to /all/ magic, as clearly pronunciation matters, at least sometimes (see: "Never forget wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and ended up on the floor with a buffalo on his chest." and "It's win/gar/dium levi/o/sa, make the /gar/ nice and long.) and foreknowledge of what the spell does is not always necessary (see: /Levicorpus/, /Sectumsempra/.)

  It goes where the 'power' is, which, I believe, destroys the sentience argument. To the elder wand beaten = more powerful.

Beaten generally does equal more powerful, particularly as this would mean one has to best one's opponent in a duel. No matter how arbitrary, that definition can technically be placed on one wizard randomly hexing (or Disarming) another with no retribution. Why would this destroy the sentience argument? It can't see, so it only has the magic of its master and the magic that affects its master to go off of. It recognises that its master has been Disarmed, so it deduces that the wizard to have done that must be more powerful than its current master, and switches its allegiance to the new wizard. All without ever having been held in said "new wizard"'s hand.
