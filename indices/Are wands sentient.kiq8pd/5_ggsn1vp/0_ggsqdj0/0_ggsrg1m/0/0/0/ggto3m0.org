  magic can differentiate between the intent of the caster (you alone know whether it will harm your soul to save an old man)
#+end_quote

This is only in the interest of the soul, though. That's not, strictly speaking, anything to do with magic as if Snape had taken out a gun and shot Dumbledore through the skull instead of using Avada Kedavra, he would've died instantly and the result would be the same. (Come to think of it, the Elder Wand would probably be able to tell who killed its master in that instance, too, but it's the principle of the thing).

Dumbledore also revealed to Harry that he wanted Snape to become the master of the Elder Wand and that was also a reason (though obviously not the only one) that he told Snape to kill him. The Elder Wand can't tell if the intent behind the spell is malicious or not.

  there was a boat that could asses how "weighted" an adults' magic was.

There's also a spell that can track any magic performed in the vicinity of minors. There is obviously a dividing line where magic doesn't recognise you as a child anymore, but the Elder Wand would only be able to tell exactly that- whether or not they had yet to have their 17th birthday.

  "Skill level" isn't convoluted. It's ability to perform any given spell to a great degree
#+end_quote

I agree with you on that, but I ask again, how on earth is the Elder Wand supposed to know the skill level of any given wizard who casts a spell on its master?
