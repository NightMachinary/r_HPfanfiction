No, it's not a tall order given that magic can differentiate between the intent of the caster (you alone know whether it will harm your soul to save an old man), wands understand the difference between regular magic, and there was a boat that could asses how "weighted" an adults' magic was.

"Skill level" isn't convoluted. It's ability to perform any given spell to a great degree (think the others begging Harry to cast his patronus because there's went as good) than that of the other guy.
