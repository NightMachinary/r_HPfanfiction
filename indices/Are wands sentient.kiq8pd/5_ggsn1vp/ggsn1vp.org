  This completely blows the idea that magic is all about intent completely out of the water
#+end_quote

No, it doesn't as 'magic is all about intent' is born of 'you have to mean them.' 'Them' being unforgivable curses. Harry, himself, only considers the statement when casting the Imperius and Cruciatus Curses.

  Harry turned the book sideways so as to exmine more closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble: Levicorpus (nvbl)
#+end_quote

We only see the incantation, but there are also other words there some of which had to tell Harry to flick his wand upwards.

And while Harry knew what Expelliarmus would do, he didn't read a single thing about it. I believe he also got it the 1st or 2nd time he cast it.

  Does the wand literally choose the wizard? Is it capable of recognising similarities and differences in its own magic and the wizard trying it out, and of rejecting or accepting that wizard accordingly?
#+end_quote

Yes. In a way. I suppose?

Wands choose the wizard. That was stated over and over again and we saw that. Pottermore establishes that wands can differentiate between regular magic, dark magic, and can know when their chosen wizard is using them dishonorably and practicing self-deception. Ollivander on the wand wood page even suggests they can choose accordingly. Rowan (I think) has never chosen a wizard who has gone dark.

  Does this mean that the Elder Wand is simply the most sentient wand, and that's why it's known as the most powerful?
#+end_quote

No, it means the Elder Wand is the most powerful and the least loyal. It goes where the 'power' is, which, I believe, destroys the sentience argument. To the elder wand beaten = more powerful.

All wands don't change in the same way as some wands are more loyal than that. If Draco had three wands, one wand would remain because that wand wouldn't have switched allegiances while sitting in a drawer simply because its master had been 'beaten.'
