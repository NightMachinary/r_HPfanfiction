I personaly see intent as part of a wider picture, it isn't necessary but it helps. It's why some spells can't be cast silently, words help both to shape your intent and magic. I've always thought that there was multiple forms of intent, some are shallow, these being "easy" to cast silently, whilst others like say the patronus are deep and either impossible or highly difficult to cast silently.
