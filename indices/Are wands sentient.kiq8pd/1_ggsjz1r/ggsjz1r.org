I think this is the way where lies madness. Even considering JKR books as canon we have to accept that there are mistakes, because (contrary to the Holy Spirit in case of the Holy Scriptures), [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Mistakes_in_the_Harry_Potter_books][she certainly makes mistakes]]. Introduction of /Levicorpus/ and /Sectumsempra/ are just going contrary to everything we have in the rest of the books. We learnt many times that doing magic is not just shouting the words (that's whole point of seven years studies at Hogwarts, after all), but suddenly one word scribbled somewhere on the margins of Potions textbook (without even the description of the wand movement) is sufficient to almost kill Draco. JKR is just not Tolkien, so her universe has huge holes in it, and if you want to make any systematic theory about it, you have to be ready to ignore some nonsensical parts of it.
