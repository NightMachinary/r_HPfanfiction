My head canon has always been that combined, the three hallows can kick off a Necromancy ritual that can actually revive the dead.

The Stone, to recall the lost spirit.

The Cloak, to sever its link with the realm of the dead.

And the Elder Wand, the only one powerful enough to perform whatever spell or ritual is necessary to bind the spirit into a new body.
