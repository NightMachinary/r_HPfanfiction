The Hallows are an interesting point of division in the fandom. A good chunk believe that Harry returned to life /because/ he was Master of Death, but just as many (inc myself) don't really see it that way. Imo, Harry returned to life because of complex interactions between the magic of his mother's protection and Voldemort's Horcrux:

#+begin_quote
  “He took my blood,” said Harry.

  “Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!”
#+end_quote

That's a quote from Deathly Hallows. So according to Dumbledore, the reason Harry returned to life was because of the blood protection. It did not have anything to do with the Hallows. You could choose to interpret it differently; after all, Dumbledore might be wrong, as he is shown to be a fallible figure in regards to his knowledge and his judgement in the later books. However, as this is one of the culminating points of the story, I'm more inclined to believe that this is Rowling's final explanation for why Harry survived the Killing Curse for a second time, told to us through Dumbledore.

The Hallows' role in Harry's survival is really non-existent, imo. Rowling used them as tools to explore Harry's relationship with the concept of death. I doubt that gathering the Hallows and becoming Master of Death made Harry immortal or granted him a special +1 life power, but only served to tell us readers that to be Master of Death is to accept that Death is inevitable and, when the time comes, greet it as an old friend. In essence, the Hallows' role is more thematic than plot-related.

  Dumbledore even based his plan for Harry on them once he found the ring and he realised he was diying. That is after all one of the reason he had Snape kill him instead of Draco IMO (I think he would have found a way to give it to Harry like he did with the sword)

I don't know whether Dumbledore meant for Harry to gather the Deathly Hallows. That part is never made explicitly clear in canon. As Dumbledore gifted Harry the Resurrection Stone, an argument can certainly be made that he intended for Harry to gather all three Hallows. My interpretation, however, is that Dumbledore gave Harry the Stone for the same reason that he gave Ron his Deluminator. Because he knew that Harry would need it when he walked to his death, to give Harry the final closure so that he could accept, wholeheartedly, that he needed to give his life for Voldemort to die. The flaw in this interpretation is that I can't quite come up with a reason for why he would give Hermione his copy of /The Tales of Beedle the Bard./

  Still in the end, while Voldemort may not have believed the entire tale, Grindelwald and Dumbledore did.
#+end_quote

Here's a quote from /Deathly Hallows/:

#+begin_quote
  “--- were the three brothers of the tale,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road . . . I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death's own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore believed in the power of the Hallows, but I doubt he believed that they were truly objects created by Death. He craved the Stone, not because he wanted to resurrect his sister, but I think he only wanted to ask for her forgiveness, to apologise for his mistakes as he never had the chance to.

#+begin_quote
  I find it interesting that Grindelwald, Dumbledore, Voldemort AND Harry held it at one point or another
#+end_quote

I made an argument maybe two years or so ago about this. I also thought it was an interesting incidence, and particularly, that of all the four to have chased after the Hallows at one point or another, it was Harry that managed to unite the Hallows and Harry who managed to let them go. Grindelwald exploited the Elder Wand freely for power and greed; Dumbledore craved the Stone to atone for his mistakes; Voldemort feared death more than any other. In the end, it was Harry who, capable of both letting go of power and life, capable of accepting his and others' mortality, who united the Hallows, which I found a profoundly symbolic act.

Now, returning to your original question, no, I don't think the discrepancy is because JK Rowling is a bad writer. The Hallows were, in all likelihood, made by wizards and not the entity of Death, and therefore, as fallible as the mortal magics that crafted them. Over time, the facts became distorted as the retelling of stories is likely to do, especially if we consider that the tale of the Deathly Hallows may have originated from a time before Beedle the Bard lived. It's possible that the story was passed down through oral tradition before Beedle the Bard came along and wrote the myth down. The tale is not accurate simply because it was a highly fictionalised, distorted version of an event that occurred centuries ago, of which Beedle the Bard more than likely never witnessed.
