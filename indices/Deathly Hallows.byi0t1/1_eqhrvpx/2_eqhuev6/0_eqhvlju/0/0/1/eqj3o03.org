  That's a quote from Deathly Hallows. So according to Dumbledore, the reason Harry returned to life was because of the blood protection. It did not have anything to do with the Hallows. You could choose to interpret it differently; after all, Dumbledore might be wrong, as he is shown to be a fallible figure in regards to his knowledge and his judgement in the later books. However, as this is one of the culminating points of the story, I'm more inclined to believe that this is Rowling's final explanation for why Harry survived the Killing Curse for a second time, told to us through Dumbledore.

Yeah but even that part has holes in it. After All, Dumbledore always insisted that Harry would be safe at the Dursley's because of the Blood protection, yet Voldemort was resurrected using Harry's blood and even showed that the protection didn't affect him anymore.

  The Hallows' role in Harry's survival is really non-existent, imo. Rowling used them as tools to explore Harry's relationship with the concept of death. I doubt that gathering the Hallows and becoming Master of Death made Harry immortal or granted him a special +1 life power, but only served to tell us readers that to be Master of Death is to accept that Death is inevitable and, when the time comes, greet it as an old friend. In essence, the Hallows' role is more thematic than plot related.

And yet, it is his ownership of the Elder Wand that allowed him to beat Voldemort, because the Wand wouldn't harm it's master. I would have agreed if their role stopped at Harry sacrificing himself, but it wasn't. Harry vanquished Voldemort because the Wand wouldn't harm it's master. After All, I don't think an Expelliarmus would be strong enough to reflect an AK in normal circumstances.

  Dumbledore believed in the power of the Hallows, but I doubt he believed that they were truly objects created by Death. He craved the Stone, not because he wanted to resurrect his sister, but I think he only wanted to ask for her forgiveness, to apologise for his mistakes as he never had the chance to.

But Dumbledore chased the Hallows before Ariana's death. It was a common point between Grindelwald and Dumbledore, they both sought the Hallows, and Dumbledore himself admited that he was rather power hungry.

  Grindelwald exploited the Elder Wand freely for power and greed; Dumbledore craved the Stone to atone for his mistakes; Voldemort feared death more than any other.

It is rather interesting then, that the Hallow most suited for Voldemort's goal according to the tale was Harry's (the Cloak that is supposed to hide one even from death), but that he went after the one most suited for his personality (The Wand) and completely disregarded the one he already had. Another interesting point is that except for Grindelwald, the three Big (Harry, Tom and Albus) each had more than one Hallow at one point or another (Albus even interacting with the 3 through his life).
