  Yeah but even that part has holes in it. After All, Dumbledore always insisted that Harry would be safe at the Dursley's because of the Blood protection, yet Voldemort was resurrected using Harry's blood and even showed that the protection didn't affect him anymore.

I'm not quite sure what plot hole exactly you're trying to point out. Yes, Voldemort circumvented the blood protection by taking Harry's blood, but the protection was still very much active. It was this act of taking Harry's blood that anchored Harry to the living world, allowing him to survive the Killing Curse for a second time.

  And yet, it is his ownership of the Elder Wand that allowed him to beat Voldemort, because the Wand wouldn't harm it's master. I would have agreed if their role stopped at Harry sacrificing himself, but it wasn't. Harry vanquished Voldemort because the Wand wouldn't harm it's master. After All, I don't think an Expelliarmus would be strong enough to reflect an AK in normal circumstances.

This is true; ownership of the Elder Wand undoubtedly gave Harry the edge he needed to kill Voldemort once and for all. I should have made myself clearer - by survival, I was referring to Harry's survival of the Killing Curse in the forest.

  But Dumbledore chased the Hallows before Ariana's death. It was a common point between Grindelwald and Dumbledore, they both sought the Hallows, and Dumbledore himself admited that he was rather power hungry.

Again, true. The reason Dumbledore died, however, was because, in a moment of weakness, he let his desire for the Stone overpower reason. He was power-hungry as a youth, but as an old man, the version we know, he'd more or less shunned overt power, though he obviously still had significant influence and magical power. Nevertheless, he refused the position of Minister of Magic and chose to remain a teacher instead. He had power in spades, but he refused to use it, and in the end, the one Hallow he really craved was the Stone.
