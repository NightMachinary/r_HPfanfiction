  I'm not quite sure what plot hole exactly you're trying to point out. Yes, Voldemort circumvented the blood protection by taking Harry's blood, but the protection was still very much active. It was this act of taking Harry's blood that anchored Harry to the living world, allowing him to survive the Killing Curse for a second time.

I am referencing to the fact that the Blood wards at the Dursley's relied on Harry's (And Lily's) blood and yet Voldemort proved that it wasn't effective anymore, yet Harry was sent back to the Dursley's because he would be "safe" there. If Voldemort wasn't so obsessed by the prophecy, he might have decided to go after Harry...
