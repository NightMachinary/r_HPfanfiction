The blood protection was still active though Voldemort managed to overcome one barrier and could physically touch Harry after the graveyard scene. Yet the Death Eaters and Voldemort still could not approach Privet Drive; for instance, they waited in ambush over Surrey when Harry was being evacuated on his seventeenth birthday instead of launching a direct assault, suggesting they had to wait for him to be a certain distance from Privet Drive before they could attack. Furthermore, there is this quote:

  “--- Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well,” Harry pressed on remorselessly. “Once I'm seventeen, the protective charm that keeps me safe will break, and that exposes you as well as me. The Order is sure Voldemort will target you, whether to torture you to try and find out where I am, or because he thinks by holding you hostage I'd come and try to rescue you.”

So yes, the wards around Privet Drive continued to work, though why exactly Voldemort could touch Harry but still could not enter Privet Drive is somewhat murky. This may be lazy writing on Rowling's part, but either way, the mechanics of the blood protection are kept vague enough that it's difficult to argue that it's a plot hole, simply because we aren't given much concrete information about it at all.
