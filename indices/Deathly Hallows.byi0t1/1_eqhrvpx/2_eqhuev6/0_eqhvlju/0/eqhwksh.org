Yeah I read something like that in a fic once about the Hallows being cursed, about how the wand would make you reckless, the stone would make you suicidal and the Cloak would make you unlucky. All three would attract dangerous and deadly situation for their owner.

Still I think the power of the Hallows is real, if only for the fact that they were a way for JK to have Harry win without any kind of training whatsoever. I mean common! The guy ended up in deadly situation at least 3 times a year for seven years, and he never once decided that he should train or learn anything in order to survive, and yet he was constantly whining or crying if he wasn't told everything! The only times he did something was because Hermione forced him to. So yeah, without the Hallows, I don't see any other way Harry could have won in Canon.
