This was Dumbledore's plan; he never meant for Harry to use the elder wand. His plan depended on Snape helping him commit suicide so that the power of the wand disappears.

But Draco Malfoy disarmed Dumbledore and nearly foiled the plan. It was sheer luck that Harry disarms Draco.

My interpretation of the stone is this: it doesn't really bring back the dead, but rather makes you hallucinate so that you commit suicide. The shades that harry sees are his parents who urge him to go and sacrifice himself. I think Dumbledore knew this fact and therefore gave it to harry to help him accept his fate

Thanks a lot! I also explore how the original hallows were created (like what makes them special), and the main character is Antioch Peverell's descendent
