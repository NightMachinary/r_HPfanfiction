But by the time the HP story begin they are still the most powerful artefacts of their kind. I think it's said in the story (sometimes I don't remember if my facts are Canon or if I read about it so much in various FF, that I started considering it as Canon) that invisibility cloaks in general last just for a few years before fading.

Even the Elder Wand (and now that I think about it, I find it interesting that Grindelwald, Dumbledore, Voldemort AND Harry held it at one point or another). Still in the end, while Voldemort may not have believed the entire tale, Grindelwald and Dumbledore did.

Dumbledore even based his plan for Harry on them once he found the ring and he realised he was diying. That is after all one of the reason he had Snape kill him instead of Draco IMO (I think he would have found a way to give it to Harry like he did with the sword), and also the reason he gave Harry the stone and Hermione the Tales of Beedle the Bard.

PS : now that I think about it, the Marauders' Map in Prisoner of Azkaban and the Death Eater's Homenum Revelio in Deathly Hallows also worked on the Cloak.

PPS : I will gladly read your story
