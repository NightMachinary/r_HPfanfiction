  As for moody seeing through the cloak, moody's eye is most likely a recent invention. The creater of the cloak didn't take it into account

One bit of Fanon I actually like is that Dumbledore himself made the eye for Moody, and because it was made /with/ the Elder Wand, it's that much more powerful.

Of course, Crouch Jr. may have been bluffing.
