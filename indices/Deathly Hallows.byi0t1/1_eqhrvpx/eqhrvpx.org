Ok, so this is my interpretation of it

The story of the three brothers is a legend, most likely originating from when the Peverell's made the hallows. At that time, it was the ultimate cloak and the powerful wand

Now the history tells that the cloak stayed in the line of Ignotus, and the stone stayed in the line of cadmus. So no one outside these families should know exactly how these things actually behave.

Only the wand was visible to the public. And it was the most powerful wand. Jkr just used that fact to show how powerful Albus was as he defeated Grindelwald. Its meant to reinforce his nearly godlike aura

As for moody seeing through the cloak, moody's eye is most likely a recent invention. The creater of the cloak didn't take it into account
