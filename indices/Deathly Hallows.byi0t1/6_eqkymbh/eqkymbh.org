We're never meant to take the legend literally - the first time we hear it, we're told "it's a fairy tale," and Dumbledore later all but confirms that The Tale of the Three Brothers is just that, a legend. And even within the tale, the Hallows have limits on their power. The Elder Wand doesn't prevent its owner from being murdered, the Stone doesn't actually return the dead to life, and the Cloak can't literally hide someone from Death:

  “The Cloak wouldn't have helped them survive, though,” Harry said quickly. “Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn't have made them curse-proof.”

  “True,” sighed Dumbledore. “True.” (DH, Chapter 35)

Ultimately, the Hallows were simply objects created by wizards. Powerful and dangerous objects, yes, but never truly unbeatable. So Moody's eye being able to see through the Cloak is impressive, but not impossible.

(And a final nit-picky detail - we're not actually shown that Dumbledore could see through the Cloak. I think it's more likely he simply heard Harry, as the Cloak doesn't make someone sound-proof.)
