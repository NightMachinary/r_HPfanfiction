My own headcanon is the total reverse of most people's.

I have it in my head that the three brothers were greedy bastards, and Death was someone who created the three Hallows. The brothers heard of these items and wanted them, so they pursued the inventor to a river, where the inventor managed to destroy the bridge across before the brothers could cross.

The brothers rebuilt the bridge and caught the inventor on the other side where he had stopped just off the bank, assuming he had held them up long enough to eat a meal quickly (as he had been running more or less nonstop for several days by that point). The brothers dueled the inventor and nearly killed him, and stole the three artifacts before splitting ways.

The inventor understandably took offense to having his stuff stolen and managed to curse the wand and stone before he lost the initial duel, but never managed the cloak.

Thus the wand and stone each have bloody histories as the curse upon them kills each owner in succession, whilst the cloak protects its owner, but some can still see through it as the inventor did not quite manage to complete its enchanting.

Just my headcanon, and I find it interesting to cast the three brothers as assholes and thieves instead of a group of noble wizards who defeated Death.
