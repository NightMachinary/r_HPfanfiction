My take on it is that Dumbledore approached Grindelwald for reconcilliantion, seduced him, stole the Elder Wand, and then they dueled. Since Albus didn't intend at any point to kill Grindelwald the wand didn't stop him and thus the duel was the epic they say. It give a literary purpose to sharing Dumbledore's sexual orientation, and holds the wand as unbeatable.

What more, if you want to go another step and explain why D-man doesn't kill: He swore an oath to never take another life after his Sister died. This prevents him from killing anyone and has also colored his perceptions from then on.
