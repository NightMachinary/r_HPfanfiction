Ok...hm....ok, here goes (note: I'll include subjects that should be taught in my opinion - except non-magical ones (I think Hogwarts should teach those, but that's another topic!))

Defense - Macros the Black (Raymond E. Feist - Rift War etc.) or Sonea (Trudi Canavan - Black Magicians Trillogy!)

Charms - Jaina Proudmoore (Warcraft)

Dark Arts - Illidan Stormrage (Warcraft)

Healing - Tyrande Whisperwind (Warcraft)

Transfiguration - King Midas (Ancient Greek Legends!)

Arithmancy and Astronomy - Colonel Samantha Carter (Stargate)

Flying - Avatar Aang (Avatar - The last Airbender)

Herbology - Master Apothecary Faranell (Warcraft)

History of Magic - Deckard Cain (Diablo)

Divination - (will not be taught regularly - if someone has a gift for it an instructor will be provided...my pick for this would be: Either Nozdormu the Timeless (Warcraft - Aspect of Time) or Ysera the Dreamer (Warcraft - Aspect of Nature/Dreams))

Librarian and Ancient Runes/Languages - (stealing from someone else, but I don't care - I like this pick!) Indiana Jones!

Muggle Studies - Tony Stark (Ironman!)

Potions - Getafix (The Adventures of Asterix)

Oh and final pick: Headmaster - Gandalf the White
