Your Dumbledore is far more direct than I would expect. Even when he was dying Dumbledore took his time. He was a true teacher. I was once told you can't teach anyone anything, you can only point them in the right direction. Dumbledore in the 6th book was the epitome of that. He made Harry watch the memories, draw conclusions and then challenged them to make sure Harry understood what he was saying. Very rarely does Dumbledore give answers, he's more likely to point you in the right direction to find your own answers. Would he tell Harry all that your Dumbledore told him or would he encourage Harry to ask questions and explore by himself? Maybe the directness is due to time constraints but I can't really think of a time Dumbledore was rushed doing anything.
