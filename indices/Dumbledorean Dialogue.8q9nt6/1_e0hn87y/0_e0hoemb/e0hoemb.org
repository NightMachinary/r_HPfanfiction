I think you and [[/u/herO_wraith][u/herO_wraith]] have nailed it. I didn't see the problem because I've altered things to making Dumbledore Harry's first contact with the Wizarding World. I knew /something/ wasn't right, but it also made sense for Dumbledore to be informative in the context so I didn't pick up on it. I think I'm going to read the suggestions and parts of canon (especially HBP) and then go back over my Dumbledore from the beginning of the story.

The progress I'm making is slow, but it's still better than the zero progress I made in the previous several months and I'm happy :) Thanks so much for your analysis!
