  "Tastes magical, doesn't it Harry?" said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling over his half-moon spectacles. "Barnabus here never had a talent for wands. His family disowned him, thinking him a squib - one from a wizarding background with barely any magical affinity. His magic is rather unconventional, and lends itself well to his love of cooking."

This is better than most Dumbledores. I think it's about 80% of the way there, but it's too information-dense. At this point if Harry doesn't know what a squib is, Harry should interrupt Dumbledore and ask what it means. "A squib, sir?" Harry asked. Etc.

  “Harry, Tilly is a house elf. Her greatest joy is to work and care for people, and she will help you around the house until the start of term. I know you have a lot of questions, and I shall endeavour to answer as many as I can in the next few weeks. If you think of any while I am away working, write them down and we will go through them on my return. With your permission, I may bring the occasional visitor to see you.”

This dialogue seems like it's working too hard to advance the plot. It needs more of Dumbledore's character. I'm realizing as I read your stuff trying to figure out what seems off (and it's just a little bit off, not a lot), in canon Dumbledore doesn't really introduce much new information. We love him because he finally provides answers to questions Harry has been grappling with for awhile. (Or we get frustrated with him when he continues to not provide answers.) When he does introduce new concepts, he takes his time about it. He doesn't, for example, say, "Harry, a horcrux is a magical object into which a dark wizard places part of his soul." He does the whole bit with Slughorn's memory. He takes several chapters! Basically, I think Dumbledore likes to teach via answering students' questions, and when he wants to teach them something new, he makes sure he gets them asking the right questions.

  "There's a lot you need to know before starting at Hogwarts in September, so I apologise in advance if you feel I am drowning you in new information. Don't hesitate to ask me for clarification - although as Headmaster I rarely teach classes these days, I do very much enjoy educating the youth of today." Harry nodded quietly as he absently stroked Sesame's cool scales.

Here you show that he is open to questions, but it would be better if you showed him actually answering them. (Side note, "the youth of today" sounds too much like a modern muggle expression.)

  “When I was a boy, I lived here with my mother, and my younger brother and sister: Aberforth and Ariana. After my mother passed on, I was made head of the family. An accident here led to the death of my sister soon afterwards.”

So much new information! And I doubt it's even been teased at yet. In canon, Dumbledore wasn't used as the infodump character (that was Hermione) so much as the character who handed out the key to the ongoing mystery.

Based on the structure of your story, it might be unavoidable that Dumbledore has to provide more of the basic plot-necessary information, but that's going to make his character feel a little bit off, because that's not how JKR used him.
