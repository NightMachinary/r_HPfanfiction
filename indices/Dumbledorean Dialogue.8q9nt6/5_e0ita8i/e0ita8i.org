A few people have already mentioned this indirectly, but Dumbledore is much more succinct in the books, and Rowling often breaks up his dialog with actions, his expressions, adjectives, or prompts from his conversation partner.

Rowling uses adjectives and expressions to show Dumbledore's mood and provide a subtext, including: pleasantly, gravely (twice), quietly, smiling, raised his eyebrows, and patiently. She also uses a lot of descriptions about where and how Dumbledore is looking to break up the dialog and show Dumbledore's evaluations. For instance, when Dumbledore visits Tom Riddle in the orphanage:

#+begin_quote
  "Well, you were quite right," said Dumbledore, who was no longer smiling but watching Riddle intently. "You are a wizard."
#+end_quote

When Dumbledore picks up Harry from the Dursley's house:

#+begin_quote
  "It is a long time since my last visit," said Dumbledore, peering down his crooked nose at Uncle Vernon. "I must say, your agapanthus are flourishing." There is a long description of Vernon's reaction to Dumbledore, showing rather than telling, then: "Ah, good evening Harry," said Dumbledore, looking up at him through his half-moon glasses with a most satisfied expression. "Excellent, excellent."
#+end_quote

Additionally, canon Dumbledore, even when interpreted as benevolent, is much less open than your Dumbledore. If Harry asked about where they were, canon Dumbledore would be more likely to answer (content-wise) along the lines of "When I was a boy, this was my family home. I lived here after I graduated from Hogwarts. Of course, it was never quite this nice under my care." But presuming Harry asked about the significance of a place, Dumbledore's first bit in your example dialog about Ariana is fantastic- Dumbledore tells the truth without hinting at any of the drama surrounding his sister's death. I think that Dumbledore would be more likely to make his assurances with a lesson rather than a statement about his own feelings. For instance, "Harry, do not worry. It is better we make new memories than dwell on the old."

And as a final point, Dumbledore has a unique sense of humor, which helps emphasize how eccentric he is. And the privilege of being eccentric without consequences is definitely a wise old wizard thing, and makes Dumbledore more believable. I've copied a few examples below:

To Harry:

#+begin_quote
  "Very well, then," said Dumbledore, pushing open the broom shed door and stepping out into the yard. "I see a light in the kitchen. Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are."
#+end_quote

To Vernon Dursley:

#+begin_quote
  "Albus Dumbledore," said Dumbledore, when Uncle Vernon failed to effect an introduction. "We have corresponded, of course." "Shall we assume you have invited me into your sitting room?"
#+end_quote

Visiting Slughorn:

#+begin_quote
  "My dear Horace," said Dumbledore, looking amused, "if the Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark Mark would have been set over the house."
#+end_quote

Adding some more information about Dumbledore's tone, expression, and the situation will make it easier to show his sense of humor and tendency to be eccentric.
