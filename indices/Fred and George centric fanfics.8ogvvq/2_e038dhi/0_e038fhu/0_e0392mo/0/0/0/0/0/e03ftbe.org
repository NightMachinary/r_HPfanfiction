- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12181042/1/Order-of-Mercy][Order of Mercy]] by MandyinKC. This features Bill, Fleur, Percy, and Audrey creating their own Underground Railroad to help smuggle muggleborns out of Britain.

- I like stories where Percy ended up helping a lot of people from inside the Ministry. It redeems him as a character and a person. Plus, it makes his involvement in the war a lot more tangible. These are my most favorites.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916711/1/Accidental-Switch][Accidental Switch]] by Myra109 is a bit over on the dark side of the spectrum and is very graphic at times. Not the best writing in the world, but the story itself is different. Basically, potion mishap with Percy and Fred switching bodies. It focuses on the Twins relationship with Percy. linkffn(11916711) Status: Complete
