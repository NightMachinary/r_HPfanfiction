[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8479548/1/George-Weasley-and-the-Computational-Error][George Weasley and the Computational Error]] by pisoprano might be something you'll be interested in.

Overall, the story is a unique read. Plus there's just a lack of Fred and George fics out there even if they are the popular Weasley's so this fic really emphasizes the Twins differences and their bond.
