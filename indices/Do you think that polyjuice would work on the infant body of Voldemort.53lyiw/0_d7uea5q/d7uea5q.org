I think it might have had bad consequences. That body had to drink a special potion just to stay alive, I think it contained Nagini's snake venom and possibly unicorn blood, I don't think it was strong enough or fully human enough for Polyjuice, and if it wa consumed too close to the other potion maybe they would have had a bad reaction together?

That's my headcanon answer, but it still might be interesting to see it in a fic.
