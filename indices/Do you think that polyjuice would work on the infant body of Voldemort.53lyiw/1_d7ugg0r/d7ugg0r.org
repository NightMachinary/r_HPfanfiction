When I first read the title, I thought you meant adding a bit of Voldemort's infant body to polyjuice to make a Voldemort polyjuice (which I don't think will work). But as for what you're asking, I don't think it would work. I don't think the infant body thing is actually human, and it seems implied to me that polyjuice is for humans only.
