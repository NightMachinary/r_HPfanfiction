Ahem, the Green Flame Torch rumor at least a /year/ prior to the release of /HBP/ when some concept art for the cover was leaked. Even though the rumor was quickly denied, 2004 was a time before the viral power of social media (Twitter launched in 2006) and before we had our go-to HP canon encyclopedias (HP Lexicon launched in 2007). SO, the Green Flame Torch rumor persisted because of webmasters like me who kept it alive in our fansite webrings. The arguments in the forums about the Goblet of Fire making a comeback and being more than it seemed were EPIC. Sorry not sorry ;)

I remember starting to read a couple of fics from that era, that literally took the title "HP & The Green Flame Torch" and ran with it. I think they were at ffn but they were abandoned, and really not that good to begin with. I don't seem to have any saved among my favorite lists or bookmarks. I would probably be wary of any fic inspired by this title. For this I really am sorry :(
