I consider it that goblins cannot sell anything to anyone. Money cannot replace anything that was made with your own time and hands. Instead the internally use a barter and favor system. I can't buy a dinner from a goblin, I can trade something for it though.

They are not human, humans look at that and say "That's just selling things with extra steps" goblins don't see it that way though. It's more "I'm giving you something made by my hands for something made by yours".

At least that's my theory on the matter.
