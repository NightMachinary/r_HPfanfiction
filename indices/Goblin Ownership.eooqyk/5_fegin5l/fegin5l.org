I can't recall the fic, but I've read one where it turns out that goblins basically put a bit of their souls into the items that they craft, horcrux-style, so naturally they consider the maker of an item to always have ownership of it.

Presumably they don't actually put their souls into absolutely every item that they ever make, just the more significant pieces, but it would explain the maker-based cultural norm.
