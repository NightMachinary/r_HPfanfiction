That's very interesting. It could've been a sort of 'magnum opus'-type deal where their 'greatest work' was what got the Horcrux effect. I remember a thing in an official D&D setting where Dwarves would go into a sort of trance and make their greatest craftwork (their Magnum Opus) before never making another thing again - the main reason why most of their dwarfhalls failed economically as their pool of working craftsmen got smaller and smaller.
