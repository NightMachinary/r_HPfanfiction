If you grow food, it's your property. If you eat it then..... /what it becomes/ also must be your legal property since it certainly can't belong to anybody else. Even though you don't want to keep it and will most likely dispose of it in the usual manner.

Possibly the Goblins running a restaurant would view things in the same way. Certainly they view the food they prepare and serve is their property, and view it as forever being their property. But they're still perfectly happy never to see it again.
