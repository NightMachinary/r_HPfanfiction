I think that is just for goblin-made objects, I can't remember the quote from DH, but it said something about goblin-made objects specifically. Maybe they don't consider food an object, or maybe they're more willing to share their goblin-made food with only with other goblins.

I wonder if the goblins in Gringotts think the money they mint belongs to them? Like instead of money going out of circulation it just goes into the vaults of the goblins who made it.
