He dies as a baby in linkffn(Harry potter without Harry Potter). The characters in this story are soooo well done and it's fun and mostly light hearted. Hasn't been updated in a while though. Another is linkao3(the kids who chose themselves by dirgewithoutmusic), but that one is more prose than chapter-based story. It's still really really good (and complete).
