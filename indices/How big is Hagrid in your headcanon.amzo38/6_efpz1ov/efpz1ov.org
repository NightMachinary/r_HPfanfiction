my headcanon matches with canon.

in the first chapter of philosophers stone he's described as nearly twice as tall and five times as wide as that of a normal man.

So for me that's 11 feet but short of 11.5. But I could accept 9.5+, anything less than 9 doesnt seem gigantic enough for me. As for chest and belly, leg, and arm... just big, really really big.
