The movie designers put Robby Coltrane's portrayal of Hagrid at 8'6", or 2.6m tall.

I know it's bad form to use movie canon around here, but my mental image of Hagrid is the movie version. He's huge compared to the rest of the cast, but still "reasonably" sized where it's still possible for him to get his head under the doorframe, and his butt behind the High Table for dinner.
