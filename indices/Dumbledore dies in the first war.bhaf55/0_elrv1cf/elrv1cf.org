1st, I doubt the person responsible for his Death would have ended up in Azkaban. If caught, not even the totally of Malfoy vault would have been enough to calm the masses. Bagnold of Fudge (no matter who was in place at that time) would condemned them to the Kiss. So the killer is either on the run or dead.\\
The position of Snape would be a lot more difficult. Either Dumbledore is killed before vouching for him and he ends up in Azkaban, or it's after his trial but then, would Dumbledore's successor (probably McGonnagal) still accepts him as the potion teacher? She would not know about his activities as spy and less likely to forgive him. And would even Snape still want to spy once Dumbledore dead, he could end up as a recluse potion master, refusing to see anyone and only making an appearance to sell some potions or publish a new discovery.

Nobody would know the position of Harry Potter except Hagrid and McGonnagal. Minerva didn't like the idea of leaving Harry with them, and Dumbledore never explained to her how the protection forced him to be there, so would she decide to move him? I don't think so (the murder of Dumbledore would proove to her the real deanger Harry would face in the magical world, and she would probably feel compeled to respect one of his last wishes) but it's a possibility.

Once at Hogwarts, several things would change. McGonnagal does not have any close ties with the Flammel, so the stone would not be hidden there, and the plot of Book 1 would not exist.

For Book 2, I don't know if a lot of things would change at first (it's been hinted that Lockart may have been the only Defense candidate for this year, so maybe still there), but the absence of Fawkes in the castle would probably mean that Harry would not survive his encounter with the basilisk (and I don't see McGonnagal dealing with Parseltmouth Harry the same way Dumbledore did).

Book 3 would mainly concern Lupin. Would she make the bet to bring a werewold in the castle in the hope he was more suited to catch Sirius Black? And if she did would Lupin still be too shamefull to admit Black is an animagus?

As for the later books, the story would already be too different to make predictions. It's not sure she would try to bring back the Tournament. And even after this, Voldemort did not have the same "respect" for her he had for Dumbledore (power), and could just overpower her (he did manage to take her and 2 other wizard at the same time during the Battle of Hogwarts).

â€‹

In the end, even without all the political repercusions, the only absence of Voldemort in the plot would derail the story so much that either Harry would be a totally different character and win in a different way, or Voldemort would win pretty easily.
