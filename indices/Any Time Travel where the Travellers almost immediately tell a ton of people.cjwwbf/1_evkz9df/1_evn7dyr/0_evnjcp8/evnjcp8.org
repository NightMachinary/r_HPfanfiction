The accidental time travel happens when Neville's misfired spell hits the cabinet full of Time Turners in the Department of Mysteries (5th book). Harry, Hermione, Neville and the two Death Eaters present in the Room at that moment are thrown back in time. That's the premise and Ron /isn't/ there so no, I don't find it annoying.
