Annoyingly, most of the 'smart HP' fics are basically "This is Harry Potter. He reads lots of books. Look! See how nerdy he is. Now, because of the smart, he is now slightly less powerful than a deity of your choice, and also ripped."

The ones that get it somewhat ok are usually ones that are HHR nerd wish fulfillment. Not that I don't like that.

There are very few, if any, where much of the action and plot revolves around actual application and development of the intellect and information.

The fic I'm building is trying to do that. I hope.
