I may as well be hired as the marketer for this fic, but linkffn(Order of Mercy) is an amazing story focused on Percy, Bill, Fleur, Audrey, Oliver, etc. during the 7th year. It is a rollercoaster of emotions and close calls and even if you know how much of the story ends it still is a gripping ride. Really couldn't believe how attached I got to this fic. Someone's already recommended The Changeling and Divided and Entwined, both of which were very good as well.
