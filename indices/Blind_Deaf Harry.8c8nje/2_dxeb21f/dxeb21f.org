A mute fem!Harry due to some exaggerated Dursley abuse. The first few chapters are rather grim and suffer from the lack of dialouge (gets better once a few people learn sign language). After that it's a hilarious, albeit cracky OP Harry story that does not have the cringeworthy tropes usually associated with those type of stories. Harry/Cassandra becomes a likeable badass and not a rude jerk with delusions of grandeur.
