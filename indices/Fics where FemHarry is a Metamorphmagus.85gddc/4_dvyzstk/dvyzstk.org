[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12555630/1/Absolution][Absolution]] by ContraryToEverything might be something you'll like. It's a one shot, however it is a well written one. Harry is still a male here, but he would mostly morph into a girl. And no, it is not a romance. It's more of a reconciliation fic.
