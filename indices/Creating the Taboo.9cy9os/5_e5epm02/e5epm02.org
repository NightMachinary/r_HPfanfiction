For my headcanon, it's not a spell but an artifact that requires sacrifices to power it. In some versions it's a chalkboard and/or map, in others it's a room where snatchers sit and wAit until they're sent off then next group steps in to wait for transmission.

The sacrifices are why it's not used by the ministry to counter the use of the unforgiveables.
