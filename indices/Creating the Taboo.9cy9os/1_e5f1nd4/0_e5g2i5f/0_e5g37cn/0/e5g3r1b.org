The only thing that doesn't perfectly fit with this theory is why in HBP when Draco sends up the Dark Mark do aurors not arrive on the scene immediately?

However that is relatively easy to explain away that Hogwarts is exempt from this taboo. Either due to strong ancient magical protections that the Ministry can't break through or that it's exempt because someone might say it in a class to teach what DE's used.
