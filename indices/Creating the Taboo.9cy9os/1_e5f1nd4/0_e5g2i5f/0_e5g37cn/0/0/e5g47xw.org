Hogwarts protections always seemed to be talked about with greater awe than anywhere else, it's not hard to imagine that the taboo doesn't have the strength to punch through Hogwarts. The aurors might have known it was there, but had no way of getting there quick enough to matter. It's also conceivable that hogwarts was built and protected first and the Taboo was never able to spread to hogwarts in the first place.
