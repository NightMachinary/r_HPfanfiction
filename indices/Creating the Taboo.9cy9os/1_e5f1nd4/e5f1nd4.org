My theory is that it's some sort of pre-existing structure or spell that the ministry controls, but it can only hold one word at a time.

And during the first war with voldemort it was set to something only death eaters would say.. mosmodre. Thats why pretty much the moment barty crouch cast the dark mark at the world cup a dozen aurors popped in and attacked the location.

Voldemort merely repurposed the taboo when he took power.
