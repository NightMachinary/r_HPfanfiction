  But what Snape says there is "Professor Snape, as master of this castle, I demand you" blah blah. He invokes his position as a means to compel the map.

Yes, but is it because the position holds inherent magic powers? Or because he knows the Map is kinda-sentient, and made by Hogwarts student who /might/ obey such authority?

As for Umbridge... hm, perhaps the fact that due form wasn't respected mattered. But I stand by the fact that the most effective way Hogwarts could have locked her out was through the Gargoyle refusing her entry. What else do you figure happened?
