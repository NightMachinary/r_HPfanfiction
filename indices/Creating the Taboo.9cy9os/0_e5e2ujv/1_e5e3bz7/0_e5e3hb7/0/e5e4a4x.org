Considering the Marauder's Map contains copies of the Marauders themselves, I always thought that this passage was Snape hoping that said possibly-sentient recordings would obey. I could be wrong on this one, though.

Umbridge being locked out of her office, however, I'm confident is kind of a counterexample --- she had the official authority but the magical being wouldn't acknowledge her. And unless I'm mistaken, it's the Stairwell Gargoyle that kept her out, rather than sentient-Hogwarts itself.
