In The One He Feared (link in OP), I put forward the idea that the press and the Ministry cottoned on to the fact that there was a single person behind the various deaths and disappearances which preceded Voldemort's first rise. But because Voldemort had not yet revealed himself, no-one had any idea who it was. So the papers started referring to this mysterious serial killer as "You Know Who".

Basically, he was a boogeyman before he was a terrorist.
