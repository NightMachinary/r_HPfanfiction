Presumably he just killed people who did because he thought it was a good way of building up his mystiques. True Name and so on.

There /is/, however, a very amusing (in a bittersweet way) one-shot fanfic where it all started in the very beginning of his campaign as an act of /defiance/. He proclaimed himself Lord Voldemort, and one journalist said: /obviously that's an alias; he's usurping a title to sound powerful and grand; calling him that would be humoring him and we don't want that. Only we have no idea what his REAL name is. So let's only ever refer to that maniac as You-Know-Who, What's-His-Name, etc. until he gives up and gives us his real name./

It stuck, and as more and more headlines like "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named Slaughters Family" and "You-Know-Who's Latest Mass Murder" started coming in, people stopped seeing any humor at all in the names.

(The journalist was later murdered in his own home.)
