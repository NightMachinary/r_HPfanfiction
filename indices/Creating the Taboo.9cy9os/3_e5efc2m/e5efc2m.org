I suspect the Taboo was a large map, much like the Marauders Map. When the name is said an X appears on the map at the location it was spoken with the name of the person who said it.

Over time this would show trails and highlight hotspots for enemy activity.

The map gets cluttered occasionally and has to be erased to make room for more X's to appear.

I imagine the map itself is the floor of a room.
