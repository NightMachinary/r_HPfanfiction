I think, when explaining why it is not used more, you need only consider the uproar a similar power would cause in the Muggle world. The monitoring of certain words as uttered by any person, anywhere, is an extremely invasive, authoritarian measure. Many citizens would oppose it.

Often when people look for limitations to magic, they fail to consider the human/social/political element: that just because something is magically possible, it does not mean that people would consent to its use. Similar things can be said for the use of veritaserum.
