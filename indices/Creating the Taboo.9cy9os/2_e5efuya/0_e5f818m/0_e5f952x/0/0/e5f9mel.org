You're right that it does not pierce the Fidelius (Grimmauld Place in DH). This does make a fair amount of sense: the Fidelius is not a spell on a location as such, but rather on a secret, which is contained within a person's soul. So there's nothing to collapse.

Essentially the Taboo works as normal, it's just that a) there's no protective enchantment on the location, so the Fidelius is unaffected and b) due to the continued efficacy of the Fidelius, the Taboo (not being a secret keeper) is unable to convey the location information to the Ministry.

Incidentally, mechanics like this are the reason why I think it's better to think of protective enchantments as exactly that, rather than the fanon "wards". "Wards" have connotations that cause readers to imagine shield-like protective spells over a physical area, whereas in HP, protecting a location can take quite a few different forms. For example, it's clear that there's no permanent protective shield around Hogwarts (because Flitwick had to cast one in DH). Rather I suspect that the walls of Hogwarts are themselves enchanted to resist both magical and physical damage, which in combination with the "no-flying" enchantment acts as an effective measure against trespass.
