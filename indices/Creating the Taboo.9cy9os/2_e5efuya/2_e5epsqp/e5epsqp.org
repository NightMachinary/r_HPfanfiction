If the unforgiveables are such, uttering the incantations and monitoring thereof should be permissible whereas the discussion of them via their common names (avada kedavra is NOT the name of the killing curse, same as imperio for the imperius and crucio for the cruciatus curse) does not require one to speak the actual incantation.
