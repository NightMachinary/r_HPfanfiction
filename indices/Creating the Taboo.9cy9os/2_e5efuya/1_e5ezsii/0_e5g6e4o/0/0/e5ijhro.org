Oh yeah, several fanfics have Occlumency work as a memory-enhancer, which to me never made any sense. I can see it help with emotional self-control though, but only indirectly (as in, strong emotional self-control is needed to be a good Occlumens, since it helps lower the effect of distractions that can helpfully crash your defenses).
