Wow, that's a really cool endeavour! I've seen some fics that try to do this, but they were all written before the Half Blood Prince was released, so obviously they're no longer canon compliant. Take your time with this, but when it's written, it'd be super cool if you could share it! I always felt like it'd be a really tough thing to get right, so that's really awesome that you're doing it!
