I am actually in the process of making this */exact/* thing - canon compliant, birth to (first) death, in multiple volumes. Unfortunately, I haven't published yet. Getting there lol

I don't know of any other fics that attempt this (for more than a few chapters, and with actual canon compliance), which is why I sort of took it on.
