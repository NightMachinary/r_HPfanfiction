There's a pretty good one on ao3 involving Ron 6th and 7th year where she Rejects Ron for presuming she'll date him, but stays friends. She ends up dating a ravenclaw. I'll take a look after a quick nap.

I'm of the opinion bashing in this case is wrong. I'm not a fan of Hermione, but book 7 where Horcrux-addled Ron presumes she has to choose between him and Harry bothered me a bit.

Hermione attacking Ron with birds in book 6 also bothered me.

Harry just is there. He acknowledges Hermione as pretty, but he really isn't attracted to her.

Sorry for rambling. I like fics like this, but going for canon issues that were glossed over.
