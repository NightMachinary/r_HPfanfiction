It's just too soon, so many of the original cast /could/ remain the same and it wouldn't make a difference. Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Warwick Davis, David Bradley, Ralph Fiennes, Jason Isaacs, Emma Thompson... The only ones that really need recasting are the children or younger adults, and the actors who have died.
