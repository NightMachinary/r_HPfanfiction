Never read it (well maybe 1st chapter but "Indi Harry does his shopping" is so overused that they tend to blend together in my mind), but I would guess that the plot will be "fixed" around chapter 5, then 80 or 90 chapters of "Harry has fun with his harem while Ron is bashed to oblivion"before the author remember about Voldemort and prepare a "confrontation" where Harry can have a monologue about how attacking the Potter was stupid bla bla bla before obliterating him.
