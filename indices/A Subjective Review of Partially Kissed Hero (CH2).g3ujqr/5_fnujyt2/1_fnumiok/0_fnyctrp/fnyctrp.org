They only ever post at the exact same time, and then vanish again at the exact same time. Their writing styles are also very similar, along with their use of language. One profile just uses a lot more smut than the other. They're also both liars, both vanished for years before popping up at the exact same time, only to vanish at the exact same time again and they both reference the other all the time.

They're either very very very good friends/lovers or the same person keeping their smut separate from their other stories.
