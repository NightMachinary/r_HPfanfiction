Well the only one that I know of is a crossover with MLP. I know enough of MLP that I'm not completely lost, but some events go over my head. Basically the MLP world contacts the Muggle world first, starts trading resources/information with them, and the WW gets salty when they find out. The story is complete and a sequel is in the works.
