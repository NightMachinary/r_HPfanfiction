Considering the monster is already 950 years old in the 1940s (causing one confirmed kill), I would highly doubt another 50 years would considerably reduce the killing potential of the creature.

I could see (oh dear) having the film if it had trouble before with additional petrifications, but as far as I know Myrtle was the only victim during that first period
