I haven't read your fic, so I maybe missing context. My first thought was it could work but feels like an unneeded stretch. The basilisk killed Moaning Myrtle like 50 years before CoS. If the basilisk has really been around since nearly the school's founding, 50 years seems like a relatively small time period for old age to set in. Since reflections are the explanation everyone is familiar with, people accept that readily, so you'd have to explain your change well enough to convince people.
