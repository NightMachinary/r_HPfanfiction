  The whole thing is the constant "oh, reflection/object in the way saves the day" thing has always bugged me.

Maybe you've already encountered them, but there are explanations.

The first is that Diarymort /purposefully/ had the Basilisk only Petrify people because he remembered that the last time someone died, it nearly closed down Hogwarts. So he'd follow his victim around and only tell the Basilisk to open her eyes when they came in front of a reflective substance.

The second is that Ginny retained a bit of willpower even when Diarymort was possessing her, and she managed to stop him from ordering the Basilisk to kill, blocking his orders except when they were looking at a reflective surface.

The third is that we're actually witnessing those "ancient magical protections" on Hogwarts: not a literal shielf/ward like most fanfictions make them out to be, but a /Felix Felicis/-style field of "good luck" that prevents bad things from happening to the students as much as possible.
