Not fanfiction, but you just came perilously close to describing, and therefore may enjoy, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magicians_(Grossman_novel)][The Magicians]] by Lev Grossman.

(There is also a very good chance you won't enjoy it. Reactions are heavily polarized, so if you check it out and aren't immediately taken, /don't/ wait for it to get better.)
