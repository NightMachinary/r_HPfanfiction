I also really want more stories. Susan would be the best protagonist, given how she was vilified. I feel like the Wood Between the Worlds is the perfect way to connect crossovers - for any fandoms, really. Middle Earth, Westboros, Alternate Earths - it's an excellent plot mechanism.

An alternative story idea is the Neitherlands, from The Magicians series. I'd love one where the Ministry Six create their own world, like Quentin did, and have a world building fic. Ministry Six plus Rolf and Hannah.
