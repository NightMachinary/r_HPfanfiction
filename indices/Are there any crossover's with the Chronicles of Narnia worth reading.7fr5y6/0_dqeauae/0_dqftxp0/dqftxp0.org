I agree, Susan is the obvious choice of a protagonist. Maybe something after The Last Battle would be good. And yeah, The Magician's heavily borrows from Narnia in regards to how the universe was made and whatnot, with Fillory and the Chatwin's being so close to Narnia and the Pevensie's. I think that was why the author decided to not mention Narnia in the Magicians books like he mentioned Harry Potter. The Harry Potter parallels are mostly cosmetic, but the Narnia ones are more substantial.
