This was a plot point on the second year of Prince of Slytherin, and was continued in to 3rd year.

Obviously it isn't the main thrust of the series - it is just significant enough to be considered a B plot. But the only way you're getting this as the main plot is if it's from the twin's POV, and I've personally never even heard of such a fic (Although I'm sure they exist).
