Even before then, there's subtle differences.

George is the more aggressive Quidditch player - there are more mentions of him hitting Bludgers, elbowing other players, and one or two mentions of him "venting" by hitting the Bludger extra hard.

Fred is more of a jokester than George is - usually, Fred is the one who instigates the practical jokes, with George following along. Fred will also crack slightly insensitive jokes, which George is then left to smooth over (see: Ron angsting over Scabbers' supposed death).

George, meanwhile, is more sympathetic - whenever things need to be smoothed over and feelings un-hurt, George is usually the one doing the talking.
