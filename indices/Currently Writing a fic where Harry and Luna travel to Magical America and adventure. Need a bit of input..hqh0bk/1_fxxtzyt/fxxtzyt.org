I'd say Luna is at her best when she's aware of and understands everything, but understands it in a way very different to typical people. Basically, where typical people would say "1 + 1 = 2", Luna would say "1 + 1 = Window". It's still technically true, from a certain perspective, but will confuse anyone until they work out what the heck she's talking about (if you draw 1, a plus, then a 1, then draw an equals over that, you get a square bisected by two lines, which is a 'window').

So, if you have her approach every situation like she knows exactly what is going on, but came to a completely different conclusion about it than everybody else would, you'll probably get a good Luna.

Plus, sometimes those conclusions can be dangerously wrong and lead to her doing dangerous things, so that might help you get some more plot drama out of her too. :)

EDIT - Oh, and I definitely wouldn't try to explain her weird. Just make her weird and leave it at that. Explaining it always kills it, just a little, no matter how it's done.
