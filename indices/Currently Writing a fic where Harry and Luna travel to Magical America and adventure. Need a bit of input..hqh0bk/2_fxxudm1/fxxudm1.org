You can have a conversation where harry is drunk and Luna is sober. Harry asks her whether the creatures were a coping mechanism she created at Hogwarts because of bullying(general fanon) . She replies that she was like this since the death of her mom. You could go a bit off cannon in saying that her mother was a magizoologist and the creatures she talks about are what luna found in her mothers notes after her death. So if you still make the essentric luna you would have less criticism from readers. The reason some readers hate escentric luna is because the authors generally don't give a good explanation about her charecter. So even in a serious fic sometimes luna becomes a sort of a crack charecter.

PS what is the link of your fic. Would love to read it.

PPS English isn't my first lang so there may be some grammatical mistakes
