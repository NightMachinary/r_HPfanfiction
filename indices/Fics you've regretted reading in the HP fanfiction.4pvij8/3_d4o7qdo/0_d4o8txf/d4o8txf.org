I genuinely enjoyed the first 4 books of that series, but the following books just...sank. Twice I've attempted to finish it and twice I dropped it at around the 5th or 6th book. It's not that I hated it or anything--I just found the latter books too boring to continue. Also, I really came to dislike the the person Harry became. So much.

I don't regret reading it, though, despite the fact that my interest in it waned.
