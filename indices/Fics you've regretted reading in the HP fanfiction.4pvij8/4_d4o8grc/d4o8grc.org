linkffn(Harry Potter, Wizarding Savior?):There was a shit ton of Dumbledore and Weasley bashing which I could overlook in a fic if it weren't for the fact that Harry was turned into a Gary-Stu and Daphne a Mary-Sue. Harry becomes all powerful, on par with Voldemort's magical ability at 16 and more powerful than Dumbledore. He has loads of money, political and magical power, a beautiful betrothed, popularity and intelligence. I mean, at least try to make him into something realistic. I kept reading, hoping it would get better, but it didn't. Thank god it was 'short' enough with only 21 chapters, but it was dreadful.

0/10, would not recommend.
