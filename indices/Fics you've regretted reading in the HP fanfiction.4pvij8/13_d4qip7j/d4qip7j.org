There was this one fic that I read back when I was searching high and low for femslash of any kind - /Written In The Body/, the pairing is Hermione/Ginny, and both are just utter wish-fulfilment Mary Sues. I sorta looked past that at the time, because I needed the femslash "fix", but it had this weird lasting effect where Hermione/Ginny fics became less and less enjoyable because of it. A year ago or so I tried re-reading it and I simply could not get past the first couple chapters; I still have a hard time reading Hermione/Ginny because I just cannot get that awful crap and its ridiculous scenes and clunky dialogue out of my head. Why the fuck did I waste my time with it?
