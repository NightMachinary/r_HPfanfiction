To regret something means that I think about a fic after I've stopped reading. For Harry Potter there is just too much out there for a single fic to impact my world view that much. I've started and dropped a lot of fics, after getting angry at characterization, plot, grammar and spelling or just being bored. But then I just read something else and move on.

Can I regret ever learning about the Cursed Child instead of a fic? Because that /does/ affect canon, and many plot points as so damn stupid.
