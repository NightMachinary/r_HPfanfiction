Some fic where Harry is so upset at Dumbles, that he "marches up to him, and yanks him to his knees by his beard". THAT HAPPENED IN ONE I READ. I don't know why there are so many fics with this sort of occurrence. The adults, are "too stunned by the protagonists obviously superior and logical actions, that they can't respond". And the worst part is, many of them are fairly good up until that point. So I'm 30k words in, and have to abandon it.
