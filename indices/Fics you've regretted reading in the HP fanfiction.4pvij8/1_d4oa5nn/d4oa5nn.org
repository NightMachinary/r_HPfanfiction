linkffn(To Fight The Coming Darkness by jbern)

It started off okay, and about halfway through everything went to shit. Neville's vampire ancestor manipulated him into enslaving Pansy Parkinson, forcing her to spy for him as well as blow him(Ginny walks on the act and reacts as expected, causing Neville to order Pansy to stop her. Pansy ends up hitting Ginny with piercing hexes and a bone crushing curse, sending her flying down a staircase to her death) and slaughtering tons of Slytherin students in their common room. At least 10 characters died with zero impact or consequences within like 5 chapters.
