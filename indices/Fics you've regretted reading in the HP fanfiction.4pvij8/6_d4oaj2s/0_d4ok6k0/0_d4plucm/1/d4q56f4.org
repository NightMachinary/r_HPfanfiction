Oh boy. So much to sum up in a comment (especially typing it out on my phone...). Look up Abbey Willson's blog (kumquatwriter.wordpress.com) for her account of her time living with Andy and the cult he created. For a good overview of all things Andy, theteablogger.tumblr.com has a good timeline that covers all the major things. Another woman who was in one of cults wrote a book ("When a Fan Hits the Shit") but it's certainly biased and missing information which you can find all of and more online.

Biggest points: charity fraud; created(is still creating) cult(s); "channeled" fictional characters including but not limited to Frodo Baggins, Orlando Bloom, and a whole host of OCs from the 1940s; compulsive liar including fun things like faking an Irish accent or telling everyone his son was taken from him (his "son" was a pet sparrow...); basically integrates himself into fandom communities to prey on vulnerable women, and so much more. Honestly there are so many things all of which sound more unbelievable than the last, so I'm sure I've missed big things so check out either of these sources, but it's a WILD ride. Personally I just can't support something/someone that pulls in young and especially vulnerable fans and exposes them to someone with a proven history of abuse and manipulation.
