This times a thousand! I read the whole thing and then started Sluagh and then realized that it was horrendous and quit. I even followed the author on tumblr for a bit, though I remember finding him annoying and conceited after a while and unfollowing. Then I found out about everything, and damn.

I know some people don't really care about who an author is or what they do as long as the work they produce is good (Orson Scott Card is a great example of this) but I generally do. And wow. Also, the fic wasn't even that good. Honestly, it was just horrible. I was in a shittier place in my life when I read it so maybe that's how I excused it? But damn...it was so violent and awful and so many other things.
