THANK YOU. I so wanted to love this fic. The premise is A+ and I can get on board with going darker than a children's series wanted to go. But there is a difference between "more mature/adult than the series; swearing and sex and descriptions of violence" and gore porn, which DAYD and especially Slaugh tipped into. Plus the characterisation of the female characters is... kinda gross.

And it pisses me off that anyone else who tackles the DH year from the Hogwarts perspective is compared to DAYD, usually unfavourably.

Plus, well... I was around for the Victoria Bitter days. So, there's that.
