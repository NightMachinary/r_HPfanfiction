Oh yeah, that's perfectly understandable (though I can't say I experience that myself--I read a lot of crossovers with series I'm unfamiliar with and usually rely on wikia to fill in blind spots).

The first HP+KHR crossover I read was cywscross' /Raison d'Etre/. I'd never no so much as seen an episode of KHR prior to that, but I was on a cywscross fic-binge and was desperate. That's the fic that sparked my interest in the series.

TBH, I still haven't seen more than a few episodes of KHR, but I'm at the point where I can speak to most fans about the series and still keep up.

Cywscross is scary.

Also, this totally got away from me. Sorry 'bout that.
