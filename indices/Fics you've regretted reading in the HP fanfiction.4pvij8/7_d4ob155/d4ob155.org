/Black Sky/ by Umei no Mai, a HP+KHR crossover featuring fem!Harry/Xanxus.

Whoo, boy. I'm not even going to start on what a huge disappointment that fic was. Let's put it this way: I /rarely/ leave fic authors negative reviews. If I come across a fic I end up disliking, I simply flounce and look for something else. No point in wasting my time writing something that the author will either ignore or get pissed at, right? Well, after reading /Black Sky/ I ended up writing an incredibly long review detailing almost everything I found wrong with the fic (I actually just hunted down the review and cringed my way through it--the whole thing was shamefully blunt). I honestly couldn't help it--I was just so goddamn frustrated by the story, not to mention disappointed. It started out so /well/, and then it plummeted faster than a hijacked plane. What's worse is that I forced myself through 62 friggin' chapters because I still had hope that the author would turn things around, but she didn't, and the story just kept getting worse and worse.

I don't often regret reading fics since I'm the type of reader who can usually determine whether or not I'll like a fic from the first few chapters, but that fic screwed with me. 62 chapters, and all of it a huge waste of my time. I still get a bad taste in my mouth when I think about that fic, haha.

This is all just my opinion, of course. The fic is listed first in the HP x KHR category (when filtered by reviews) and has a shit ton of faves, follows, and reviews, so clearly it's not an opinion shared by many.
