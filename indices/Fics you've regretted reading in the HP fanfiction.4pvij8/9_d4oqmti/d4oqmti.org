I'll nominate Dagger and Rose by Perspicacity.

It's good prose, interesting magic, good prose, reasonable characterization...and then it's slathered with an unhealthy dose of rape. Magically backed version of "being raped ruins you forever". Torture. Mind control. Let's take all those rape-related tropes and target Fleur with them.

The reason I'm specifically nominating it as a regret is that it started well and had potential, more than potential, and then shat on it in the second half. By comparison, there are plenty of low-quality fics that didn't disappoint me because I expected less of them -- but even then, they typically aren't that terrible in terms of sexualized violence, rape, and all that crud.
