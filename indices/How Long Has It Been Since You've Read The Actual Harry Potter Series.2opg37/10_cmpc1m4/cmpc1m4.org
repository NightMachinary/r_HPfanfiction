I did it this spring! I had a great time. Definitely interesting to go back to the source after the fan fiction.. changes my perceptions of some characters a LOT.

The biggest thing I noticed is that the whole series is told from Harry's POV. Duh, yes, but it's strange to go back to that after reading fics that swap around or focus entirely on other characters. It definitely got me interested in reading fics about side characters (LUNA, you guys) and side stories -- e.g., Hogwarts during the 7th book when Our Hero wasn't there. I read a lot more canon-consistent stuff right after re-reading all the books.
