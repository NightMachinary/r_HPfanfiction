I havn't reread it in a while, but my cousin and I just watched the first movie for the first time in years. My god they did such a great job with the casting and capturing the wonder of the world. Also, I realized I had developed a hatred of Hagrid and Ron through fanfiction, which makes him out as a dangerous fool, and of Ron who is portrayed as useless.

I would be honored to know someone as kind as Hagrid, and Ron sacrificing himself at the chess board hit me hard.

Fanfiction has warped me, I need to reread and watch everything.
