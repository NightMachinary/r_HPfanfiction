I got into fanfiction around 2005, coinciding with a general slowing down of my rereading of the original series. While I've read every volume multiple times over the years (even having read the first five volumes aloud to my son a couple of times when he was younger), I've actually read the whole series in one go and still haven't read any of the HP Apocrypha (/Tales of Beedle the Bard/, /Quidditch through the Ages/, etc.) Probably the last time I read a HP canon book cover to cover (figuratively) was 2012, when I was stuck waiting in an airport and realized I'd grabbed my son's Kindle instead of my own.

I do reread sections when writing fanfiction in order to make sure I have the general sense of events (sometimes they get mangled or misordered in my head otherwise). I probably read sections of /Goblet of Fire/ a half-dozen times when writing /Dagger and Rose/.
