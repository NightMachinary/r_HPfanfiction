This is a highly readable fic that I found entertaining but is riddled with imperfections and annoyances that make it "Almost Recommendable" rather than Library material. The update rate is also impressive: 63k words since it was published on August 14th (I still need to read chapter 15, published today).

Ignore the summary, it bears no real relation to the fic - it's got nothing to do with Peter Pettigrew. What we're dealing with here is a GoF AU that gets going very quickly - no never-ending summer here, we jump straight into things. There are two main divergences: firstly, Harry has become significantly more studious over the summer (referenced but not shown, as the fic starts at the end of summer) and Barty Crouch Jr is killed at the Quidditch World Cup. Point of view is Harry-centric, but with occasional Fleur-centric chapters.

The author avoids a lot of indy!Harry pitfalls, largely because he skips the summer almost entirely. It's almost like he wrote an indy!Harry summer training fic then cut out all the training part. The result is rather jarring, in that Harry feels like he's had an almost complete character transplant, and his magical ability has jumped up out of nowhere, simply explained by Harry having reread previous years' schoolbooks over the summer. This stretches belief massively and is continuously immersion-shattering, but it's still better than the indy!Harry standard of going through the tedious training routine step by step. At least this way it's more efficient -- you just have to buy the divergence and go on from there.

The author's choice of specialism for Harry -- Transfiguration -- is particularly strange, as it's the subject Harry struggled with most in canon. You'd expect either DADA or Charms specialism. Again this breaks immersion. We also have the old standby "Harry switches to Ancient Runes and Arithmancy and is suddenly great at them", better even than Hermione (if fact he's now better than her at basically everything). At this point the author's desire to super Harry up begins to feel massively excessive, but the author kinda gets away with it because Harry's main antagonists in the fic won't be his peers but Triwizard contestants. Still, the complete character assassination of Hermione gets repetitive and tiresome. Not only does the author downgrade her abilities in every area other than essay writing, she's also made far more petty and less loyal than canon.

Changing things from canon is fine -- this is fanfiction after all -- but you have to make sure your changes are actually for the better. Unfortunately the majority of DarknessEnthroned's changes just make characters shallower and situations less complex with less conflict/challenge/room for character growth. It doesn't roam into full-on bashing (yet) but it could be said to be "bashing lite", i.e. it commits the same sin that makes bashing bad, which is that supporting characters are artificially downgraded in abilities, intelligence, depth and independent agency in order to make the protagonist (and his chosen allies) look better by easily knocking down these cardboard cut-out character conflicts. The "Gryffindor turns on Harry" storyline after his name comes out of the Goblet is the perfect example of this.

But really, the biggest problem with the fic is the aforementioned character transplant for Harry. He's significantly more studious, aloof, and disinterested than his canon self, and there's no real motivation for these changes or growth to reach this point. Harry just starts the fic like this: disinterested in Quidditch (he falls asleep at the World Cup), disinterested in the Triwizard (both the tournament and the other schools), so obsessed with reading that he can't even put a book down to eat during meal times, etc. It's extremely frustrating to read, and a lot of it can only be got away with because it's fanfiction so the author can rely on us already knowing about things Harry is ignoring. That's just lazy writing.

There are certain elements of the fic that make me wonder if the fic would have been just as bad as regular indy!Harry if the author had written the skipped summer. In particular, we have some alarm bells ringing in the Dumbledore zone, where we're dangerously close to manipulative/incompetent Dumbledore territory. It's strongly implied that Dumbledore either entered Harry into the Triwizard tournament himself, or directly allowed its occurrence. We haven't really had enough Dumbledore interactions to tell for sure, but the signs are not good. The author has already arbitrarily changed things from canon to cast Dumbledore in a worse light - for example, Dumbledore doesn't believe Harry about not entering his name into the contest.

Other indy!Harry warning signs include Harry getting a new uber wand with a liquid basilisk venom core, which is of course created in the space of a single day on demand, thus bypassing the potential for interesting and tense conflict while Harry is wandless. Similar "superspeed advances" occur elsewhere, such as when Harry completes two significant rituals in a single day, with zero preparation. He literally reads about them then performs them immediately after, reaping huge benefits with no cost. Assisted, of course, by the portrait of Salazar Slytherin and our old friend "Slytherin revisionism" where Salazar wasn't against Muggleborns or racist, he's just misunderstood. Making such huge gains without cost (especially the cost of hard work and time) cheapens Harry's abilities and makes you wonder why he's the only person doing this. Another example of everything happening easily and conveniently for Harry is his just happening to stumble upon the Room of Requirement and immediately figure out its use. If it was that easy, far more students would be using it.

The magic in generally disappointing, on several fronts. First off, we have magical cores and all the well-discussed problems that come with them, though fortunately they're not a major part of the fic (yet). Magic is generally just too easy/simple, with Harry often picking up spells without any effort, on first try. The fic is completely vague on the links between understanding theory and being able to practice magic... like canon, there are hints that knowledge of theory is required to properly cast powerful/advanced magic, shown by the fact that Harry's new-found skill corresponds with increased reading, and yet we never see any kind of knowledge requirement when Harry uses magic. Often he just waves his wand around a bit, thinking hard about what he wants to happen and it just happens. The fic is very inconsistent on that front - it seems committed to "knowledge magic" in principle, but is happy to use "wish magic" in practice.

Still, the fic has some nice visuals, such as Harry's "elemental basilisk" spell, and also some moments of originality, such as how Harry dealt with the First Task (though technically it was against the rules, as he took more than his wand into the arena).

The final big problem area in the fic is Fleur and her interactions with Harry. Now, the fic feels like it's trying to do something new with Fleur, but without leaving the comfort zone of fanon Fleur tropes which sabotage any attempt to make her interesting. I'm not sure if the author even realises how unoriginal they're being with Fleur -- one gets the feeling that the author is quite proud of the direction he's gone with her. We have a greater focus on her canonical snobbishness/haughtiness, which is a welcome change from “nice Fleur”, but we're stuck with this tiresome Veela narrative which reduces Fleur's character to her heritage. For once I'd like to see a fic that explores who Fleur is as a person, not as a magical creature. A fic which realises that she's a witch first, and any “Veela identity” she may have is a distant second. She's a student at Beauxbatons, not a mascot for a Quidditch team. The way the author write Fleur's history and interactions with other girls suggests that the author doesn't really understand friendship dynamics too well, especially female friendship dynamics. The tiresome “allure” as a magical aura that can be adjusted at will is present here too, and once more is something which directly manipulates the minds of others rather than enhances Fleur's beauty (and thus her attractiveness to others) to supernatural levels.

The line taken with Harry is just as well-worn (and it wasn't a good line even the first time). As usual, we have a Harry who isn't interested in Fleur, not even how beautiful she is independently of the magically-enhanced elements of her beauty. he acts like a eunuch around her... and Fleur, for some reason, finds this interesting/attractive. It's yet another popping up of this incredibly neckbeardy idea that women are attracted by noble intentions/”being nice”, a rather misogynistic idea about women that perpetuates double standards of sexuality where women are expected to be “pure” or “modest” and find such traits attractive in others. For (unfortunately not) the last time: women (and men) like feeling sexy. People like being desired. Of course unwelcome advances can be irritating, but that's a different thing from being seen as desirable. The vast majority of women find confidence and directness attractive. Harry being noble and nice and treating Fleur as a friend rather than potential partner isn't going to make her lust after him, it's going to make her place him in the “friendzone”. For once, please, someone give me a Fleur who embraces her sexuality, who appreciates confident, direct men. You know, canon Fleur, who was attracted to the rough and ready, talented and confident Bill Weasley.

As usual, this review focuses on the negative, but I do advise rereading the first paragraph of the review: in general, this fic is entertaining and readable. It's just that there's a lot of areas where it could be improved, and several warning signs for problems in the future.
