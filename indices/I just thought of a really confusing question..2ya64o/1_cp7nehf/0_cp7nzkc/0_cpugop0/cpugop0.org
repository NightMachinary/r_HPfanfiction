Now hang on just a second. I read tht and realised something.

Lily's blood protection is active as long as Harry considers his home as the same place where another with Lily's blood lives an so therefore; if Harry decided to live in Voldemort's house then none of the death eaters would be able to harm him because Voldemort used Harry's blood.

Or sm I missing something?
