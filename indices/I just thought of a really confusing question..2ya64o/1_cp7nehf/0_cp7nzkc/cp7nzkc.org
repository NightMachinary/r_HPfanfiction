This last part really bothered me while reading the books. Voldemorts new body contains four things and is hold together by the magic of the ritual: His fathers bones, Wormtails flesh, Harrys Blood and his soul (fragment). Either those protections are not blood but intent based, and only blood powered, or Voldemort could've walked through the door.

It is however implied (through book 7) that the protection the blood protection stems from is the same protection Harry gives everyone with his almost-sacrifice. Which again is directed only against the effect of Voldemorts magic...

- Books 1-3.8: Works
- Books 3.9-7.9: Doesn't Work with the info we got thus far
- Rest of Book 7: Kinda works with what we know now

Meh.

I'll just put it down to bad planing - and poor choosing/planing of the term "blood protection" (that in itself is canon, right?) to create a plot device to force him to stay with his relatives.

/shrugh/ By far not the first messed-up plot device.
