I'd say that you've hit upon one of the weakest plot devices used by JKR. The "blood protections" are very poorly defined. Many fanfic writers have taken the apparent weaknesses to fuel Dumbledore bashing.

Maybe you'll soon wonder why Harry had to go back after his fourth year, when Voldemort had overcome the blood protections.
