  Lily's sister accepted Harry into her house
#+end_quote

I think that's an important point in itself. It protected Harry while he's in *Petunia's* house, not his own house. Vernon lived there before Harry, so when the protections went up he was automatically included as an accepted resident (or he was added by Dumbledore or however it works).

Also I would argue about the lack of protection against non-Voldemort enemies; the dementors attacked outside the house (on a different street, even) and all the wizards Harry met as a child were met out on the street. The protection seems to be limited directly to the house itself, and doesn't appear to prevent anyone /finding/ it, just from gaining unlawful entry. On the other hand, Voldemort and the Death Eaters never try hiding in Little Whinging and attacking Harry when he leaves Privet Drive, which you think they would if they could, but the Order is standing guard in OotP and presumably HBP (and by DH Voldemort's probably just gone "fuck it, I'll wait for his birthday") so maybe that's enough to deter them.
