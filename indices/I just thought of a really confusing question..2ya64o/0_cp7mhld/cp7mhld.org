You'll get different answers here than in the main [[/r/HarryPotter]] section, but it's still valid to ask.

The 'blood wards' or Lily's protection, extended by Dumbledore to be valid so long as Lily's sister accepted Harry into her house, operated to keep Harry from being captured or killed by Voldemort or his forces. It offered no protection against non-Voldemort enemies, as shown by the Dementors finding and attacking Harry and Dudley at the behest of Dolores Umbridge. The protection also did not extend to preventing Harry from being found by other wizards, as Harry had seen a few very grateful old people waving to him as he grew up.

One might say that the protection extended to anyone trying to /kill/ Harry, in that Vernon received a severe shock when he tried to choke Harry at the beginning of Order of the Phoenix. That could also be attributed to accidental magic on Harry's part, though.
