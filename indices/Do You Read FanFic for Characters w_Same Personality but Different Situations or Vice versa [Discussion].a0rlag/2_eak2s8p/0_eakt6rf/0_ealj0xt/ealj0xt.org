I've got zero problem with that kind of thing cuz it's in the realm of possibility for the characters. However, I won't bother if Draco suddenly becomes a kungfu badass and Hermione is cracking jokes. I especially won't bother if the dialogue doesn't really sound like how the characters would talk even with divergent events or character growth, which is a harsh line, I know, but given how much HP fic is out there I say why bit be picky.
