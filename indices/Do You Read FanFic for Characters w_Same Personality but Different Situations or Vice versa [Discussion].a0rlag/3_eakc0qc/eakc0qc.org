As you already said: If its laid out to me /why/ they are different, then I'm fine with it.

I'm not a fan of fics where the authors assumes canon before his fics beginning, and then every character starts with an incredible character change for no apparent reason. If you change characters, give it a reason. There needs to be some incentive for it.
