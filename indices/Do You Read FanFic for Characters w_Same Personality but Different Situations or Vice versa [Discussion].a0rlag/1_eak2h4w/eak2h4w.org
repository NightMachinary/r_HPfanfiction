In my opinion fanfiction is about playing in the author's sandbox. This means either you keep the characters similar to canon and throw them into a new situation or keep the story the same but change the characters (eg Harry gets political power). The latter runs the risk of making the characters feel like an OC with a canon name tag.

Obviously, there is some freedom for interpretation. Relationships, dating and sex for example are basically non-existent in canon, so adding fangirls doing the "Naked Man" wouldn't be unrealistic, even if untrue to Rowling's spirit. But turning Harry into a pureblood supremacist fits neither canon spirit nor plot or characters. Or randomly making everyone smoking hot because you wank to your own story. Half the appeal is that the characters are relatable, and the tits of a Playboy cover model combined with the lethality of Simo Häyhä and the academic achievement of Stephen Hawking are not.

Tl;dr: Play in Rowling's sandbox but don't build magical swastikas or naked supermodels.
