For me it's ok to write a character that will act OOC from his canon character. Ex: fic!TomRiddle is a lovesick fool; Petunia cares for Harry; Draco isn't prejudiced against muggleborns...etc. BUT the author should come up with a backstory as to why the character is like that; and the logic and consistency of why the altered personality acts like that should be plausible.
