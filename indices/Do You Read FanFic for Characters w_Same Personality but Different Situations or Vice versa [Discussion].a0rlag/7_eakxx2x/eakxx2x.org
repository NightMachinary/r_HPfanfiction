Personally, I'm with you. For me, what made Harry Potter great was the connection to the characters, not the world building or the good vs. evil plot. Completely changing the personality of a character but still calling them by their name is a cop out, a way to draw an instant connection between the reader and the character without having to do the work. It's how writers try to justify pairing Hermione with Draco or Snape or whoever. It totally ruins the basis of that character yet the reader is supposed to maintain that connection with the HP universe.

Putting a character in a new situation but keeping the essence of their character true is actually quite tough. And some of the best stories are great because of how well they do this. The Changeling is one of the best examples; Ginny is certainly different but the author is able to keep her true to her canon characterization. It's completely logical that if you place a character in a new situation, they won't be the exact same, but to make them completely different makes no sense either.
