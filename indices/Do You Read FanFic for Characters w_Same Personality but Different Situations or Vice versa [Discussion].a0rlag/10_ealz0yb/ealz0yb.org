within the realm of their canon personality, in different situations. some of the things you're against are just because of your own biases. harry will never be a genius, or a political wunderkind. that's not in the vicinity of his character. snape isn't an incorrigible asshole, and his being attractive is subjective. ginny...is good at quidditch, canonically really hot, and talented. i can see her being most of the things you mentioned, depending on your definition of super-wizard. i don't think draco will start being a passionate advocate for equality, but he does stop being a bigot and raises his son as such. ron isn't a DE, nor is he very smart. he's a professional sidekick and Average Teenage Boy. it also just has to be coherent within the fic.
