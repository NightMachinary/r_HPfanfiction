Snape spends the majority of the books being extremely rude and demeaning to everyone so yes he's an incorrigible ass. Ginny is regarded as good looking and a competent wizard, not so incredibly beautiful that she'd be a literal model and so talented she's the next Bellatrix. And even in the series, Draco's change was pretty ridiculous given he was still trying to give Harry up to Voldemort within the last fifty pages of Deathly Hallows.

So to the extent any of those are possible you have to squint your eyes and accept opaque character development or something.
