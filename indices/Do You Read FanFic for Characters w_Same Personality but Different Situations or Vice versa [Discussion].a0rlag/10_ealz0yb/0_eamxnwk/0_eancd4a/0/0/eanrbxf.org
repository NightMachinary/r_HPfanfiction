well, it depends on what you mean by being portrayed as an incorrigible asshole. if you have a fic. where snape only interacts with people he likes and wants to, then he wouldn't be an asshole in that fic., which is what you seem to be against. regardless, i don't see what's incorrigible about his behaviour

yeah, and my point is that i don't see anything OOC with people reacting to ginny that way. i have no idea what your weird hangup with ginny being a model is

draco entire arc leads up to his abandoning his prejudices and becoming a not-bad person, something you can't seem to comprehend. either write about him after DH, or something to trigger his change during the series
