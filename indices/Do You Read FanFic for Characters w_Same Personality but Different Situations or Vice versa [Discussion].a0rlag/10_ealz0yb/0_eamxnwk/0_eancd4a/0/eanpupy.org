It's like you don't read what I'm saying. Yes, Snape is an asshole. As you agree, why did previously say:

  snape isn't an incorrigible asshole

Anyone can be "supportive" to those they like. Being rude to nearly everyone else (even bullying students) makes one an asshole to their core. It's even worse if they're intentionally doing it.

Come on. My point about Ginny is that some stories will either make her one because she's apparently that attractive or have people constantly mention she should be one. I said she's supposed to be attractive in the stories, talented as well. But not the silly exaggerations that I listed in the OP.

Oh sorry, I forgot that Draco only just then tried to give Harry up. Silly me. Must have been a one time thing, I'm she he never did something like that befor- Oh wait, there were six books before that one...
