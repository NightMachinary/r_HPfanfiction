snape spends /all/ of the books being rude and demeaning to people he feels like being rude and demeaning to. i'd say he's like house, except house is intentionally an asshole to his friends, whereas snape was only ever unintentionally so. he's supportive and kind to the people he likes- the slytherins, draco, lily, etc.

i don't think you know what a 'literal model' is. ginny is regarded as very attractive. enough for it to be mentioned by pansy, a bigot, and krum, an international quidditch player who goes after 'good looking' girls. bonnie wright is a 'literal model', and a lot of people regard her as less attractive than book!ginny. she's not the next bellatrix, but she is talented, enough to be noticed by slughorn.

draco tried to give up harry out of cowardice. he was only half-heartedly going along with his parents when the trio were caught at malfoy manor

  So to the extent any of those are possible you have to squint your eyes and accept opaque character development or something.
