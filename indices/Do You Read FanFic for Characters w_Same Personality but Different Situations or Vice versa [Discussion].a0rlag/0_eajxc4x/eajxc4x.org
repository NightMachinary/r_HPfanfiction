I think the point of fan fiction is for people to explore these differences and I find it interesting to see these different “versions” of canon personalities. Some of the things you mentioned - Snape being attractive or kinder, Ron being secretly a genius, etc - I'd be fine with reading these if it was the catalyst of the story and the plot focused more on how the other characters change as a result of this change. But if the focus of the fic is just Harry being OP as fuck and never losing a battle ever, then it kinda defeats the purpose of a story for me.

However, I'm a sucker for fluffy romance AUs so I end up reading a ton of fics where the characters' personalities are bent a lil to make the romance work, ie Draco not being a blood purist or being less cruel than his canon counterpart as a result of being raised not by “Lucius the Death Eater” but rather a different version of him that's more feasible in a normal universe that still parallels canon.
