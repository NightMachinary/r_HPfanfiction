The question suggests that you can only read and write fanfiction for one of those reasons. I'm not interested in either. I want the 'missing moments' we didn't see in canon and I want post (or pre) canon development. (And a plot, but that may be going a step too far.) I do want to recognise the canon characters but I'm a fan of a well developed OC too.
