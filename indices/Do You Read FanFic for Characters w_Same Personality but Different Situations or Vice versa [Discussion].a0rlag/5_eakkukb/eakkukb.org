I prefer fics where characters act more or less like their canon counterparts. Just recently I came across a fic where Remus Lupin had sex with a student. I stopped reading it because I refuse to believe this would have happened in canon. Maybe I'm close-minded too, but I don't see fanfic as a means to completely change canon characters. In my opinion then it's better to call it original fiction because characters are unrecognizable there.I mean, I read fanfic because I already enjoyed the original work. I could enjoy a fic where Snape isn't as nasty and vindictive as he is in canon, but only if the author shows how this hapened. I even dislike when, for example, Tonks, upon hearing Lupin is werewolf during their very first meeting, is like,'great'. How did this happen? Does she happen to know another werewolf? In other words, I want motives and reasons, not some perfect behaviour out of the blue.
