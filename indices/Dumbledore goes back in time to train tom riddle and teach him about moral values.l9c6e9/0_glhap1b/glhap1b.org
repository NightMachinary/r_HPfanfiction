There is a collection of short stories with sort of like that prompt: "There's Nothing to Fear"

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368]]

Not time-travel but alternate history in which Tom ends up in Gryffindor and has Dumbledore as a mentor trying to teach him values. He still becomes a radical terrorist though but now he fights for the rights of those oppressed by the Pureblood families.
