linkffn(11761312)

Fem Harry H/Hr femslash, is a sequel to a well-written story linkffn(11251745) that. though can get a little wordy, has realistic depictions of a growing teenage relationship with all the angst and self-discovery needed for a mature outlook. At the very least, it is written from a female perspective and tries to give more weight to the problems that witches face, which is a perspective that could be explored more in HP fics. It can be a little less descriptive and suffers from some bland writing. That said, the author has had an update schedule that she has kept for at least 10 months, so if you do like this WIP fic, you can have a little confidence of seeing this to the end
