Depends on what you're looking for.

It isn't /really/ a Harry Potter fanfic, as several characters diverge significantly from their canon personalities and arcs, with many OCs taking up quite a bit of screentime. Plus, while it nominally uses the canon magic system, it doesn't stick very strictly to it.

That said, I adore the story and would jump in joy if another update dropped. I like the warfare, the nation-building, and the intrigue it contains, as well as some of the things the story does with magic.

If any of what I mentioned above makes you roll your eyes or groan, you might not enjoy it very much, but if you thought it sounded somewhat interesting, then I would definitely recommend checking it out.
