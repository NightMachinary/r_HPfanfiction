That's fair.

The first half of the story is sixth year. The seventh year is rather short because nothing happens. There's a middle section with all of the setup (and most of the political things)... and then it's conquest.

The story isn't without faults, but a lot of the concerns you had with the prologue just... aren't really a factor. Y'know? (Or in the case of the three wives, they're a factor but in a different way: they're utterly pointless and irrelevant to the plot and barely even mentioned in the narrative.)
