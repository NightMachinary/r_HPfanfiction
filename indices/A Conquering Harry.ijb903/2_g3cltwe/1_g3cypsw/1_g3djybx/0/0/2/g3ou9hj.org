Okay, so. Reading the terrible prequel and judging this fic on that is... not exactly fair. The prequel is /awful/. The fic itself... is not. Think of the prequel more as a chapter that was cut from the actual story because it didn't fit the tone of the rest of it. At least that's what it seems like to me.

I just finished this story aaaand... the 3 ancestry thing was mentioned once, in the prequel as a way to piss off and distract Hermione (these laws are outdated, gotta get them scrapped!) It was never talked about again, and isn't in the actual fic. Does he eventually get married to three women? Yes. About three quarters of the way into the fic. Why? Politics for Gabrielle (her father is the French minister - marry my daughter and I'll do this thing you want) and Ginny is included because she's in a relationship with Gabby. Again: the ancestry thing was there to tweak Hermione's nose and to distract her lol. It's an obscure and mostly forgotten law that nobody gives a crap about or takes advantage of. And Harry doesn't even want to marry them, but alliances and politics and blah blah blah.

As far as Dark!Harry goes... it does a decent job of explaining it, and a lot of his attitude comes from misunderstandings with Dumbledore. His disdain for Muggles also develops in a mostly reasonable way, and he's... not okay with what he had done after going along with one of the muggleborn kid captures. Accepting, yes. Comfortable with it? No. He still has a moral compass, even if its a little skewed. Speaking of that law... spoiler: Nobody bitched because well, blackmail. Among other politicking things.

Dumbledore is also surprisingly bash-free - he's played as not that effectual, yes, and Harry loathes him by the time he dies... but he isn't bad or 100% deserving of that loathing. He's just an old man with plots that aren't working out as intended but he's trying his best. Hermione... Hermione is bashed. Her narrow-mindedness is turned up to eleven and she's a nose-in-the-air I-know-better-than-you caricature. Ron just goes along for the ride, mostly, and isn't subjected to much bashing at all.

--------------

For those who are thinking of reading this... I would toss out the prequel unless you really, really, /really/ like powerwank or are in the mood for some that's over the top. The story itself is... probably on the better side of average? It kept my interest longer than others I've tried to read recently because it was something that I haven't seen fifty times before. The first half or so of the story is sixth year, the fall of voldemort, and seventh year. It narrates the horcrux 'hunt', and the distancing between Ron/Hermione and Harry - which was caused, mostly, by a lack of communication and some misunderstandings, with a bit of jealousy thrown in (oh no, my best mate is friendly with Neville now, oh noes).

After seventh year, the story moves faster and in total covers about 130-140 years (which is the rise of the wizards part). And talking about that is... spoilers.

Overall, I enjoyed the magical technology, I enjoyed the new take on The Order of the Phoenix, the conspiracy theories... it was a nice brainless read. I was also rather impressed with the way the author handled Dumbledore: he's flawed, he made mistakes but he was trying his damnedest to adjust with the information that he's given while dealing with a self-righteous (and /somewhat/ justified) teenager. Generally, if you get a dark!Harry trope, you also get Dumbledore bashing - he's evil, or he's incompetent, or... and that isn't the case here.

Things I didn't like include... well. In the final confrontation, the 'new villain' that was introduced is kind of just... forgotten about? And the dude was originally a big deal (to one of the people in that confrontation). So that was odd. The marriage with Gabby and Ginny was... It was there, it happened and... we didn't see a goddamn thing about it. Gabrielle had /zero/ lines. In the second half of the story, Ginny had zero. They're barely even in any scenes (in fact, I'm pretty sure that Gabby isn't in any. At all. Not even a wedding.) We're introduced to Gabby's kid (and Ginny's is mentioned but never appears 'on screen') but like... what was the point? They have roles (eventually), but that could've been filled by kids from Daphne just as easily. It's also power-wanky in places, but not nearly as bad as some I've read.

Edited because I grammar good.
