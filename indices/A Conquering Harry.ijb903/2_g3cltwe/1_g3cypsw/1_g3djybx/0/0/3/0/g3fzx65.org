I know that it is something true in many cultures, as you say, but does that make it good?

If a woman had 8 husbands I would also consider it bad writing because if she can get 8 husbands but each is only entitled to one wife and cannot ever openly love another, the relationship is problematic.

If someone has 3 wives who can only ever sleep with him and never have the same privilege to choose another 2 husbands or wives, it's problematic for me.

If a fic has Chad Chaddington who looks at a woman and she falls madly in love with him and begs on her knees to join his harem and wait all day for him to notice her while chatting with his other wives who do the same, I consider it something not only unrealistic, but also bad writing.
