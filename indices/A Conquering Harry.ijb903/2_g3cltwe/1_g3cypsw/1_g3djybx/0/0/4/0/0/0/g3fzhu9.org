Alright, thank you, let us simply agree to disagree.

But please do not tell people to "keep an open mind" and read things again, it does come off as a bit rude.

And I agree that while having a rant once in a while is actually healthy AFAIK, and unless it's basically the same argument that gets posted every 5 minutes ("Snape bad," "Snape good," "Unpopular opinion:" /insert a very popular opinion/) though I might have gotten a bit... passionate in my speech.
