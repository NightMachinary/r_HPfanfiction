Thank you but no, thank you.

The fact that he would have 3 wives itself is really bad, O despise harems.

I stopped reading because it was terrible for me.

I will not "try again with an open mind" because I will not enjoy it. I looked at the description and kept and open mind already.

I hated it.

Please stop saying it as if I came in close-minded and just skimmed through the first paragraph.

You can like this fic but I can criticize it without you saying my description is wrong.

Dark Harry who merged with the Horcrux could be interesting, but in this case it just wasn't for me.

I described what I saw had happened and my feelings about it.

I would understand you saying that if I said that "I saw him being an heir of 3 houses, dropped." Or "I saw it used this or that name which is automatically bad writing." Or "I saw that the main couple is one I don't like so the entire fic is shit."

But I didn't do that because I understand that fiction can be good even with a trope going on.

Alas, this wasn't good.

Also, you said "keep an open mind" twice, yet did not keep an open mind when reading my criticism.

I understand, though, anyone can get a bit defensive when someone criticizes a fic they like.

Still, please do keep an open mind yourself.
