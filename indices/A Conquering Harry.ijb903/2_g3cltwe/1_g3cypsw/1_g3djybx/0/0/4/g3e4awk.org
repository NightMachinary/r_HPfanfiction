i really do not think you gave this fic an accurate description, especially if you stopped reading it. Give it another try with an open mind keeping with the fact that he merged his soul with the horcrux, causing a darker personality. he isn't downright evil with sadistic tendencies. he does stuff for a reason. try again with an open mind, you might enjoy it.
