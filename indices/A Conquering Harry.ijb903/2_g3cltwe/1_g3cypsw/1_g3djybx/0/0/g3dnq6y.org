It is in fact bad, I stopped when he said he had 3 ancestries and thus would have 3 wives who were absolutely fine with it (Daphne Greengrass, Ginny and Fleur at the same time) because wtf.

Like I get a polyamorous relationship but having 3 wives who are just fine with it while only he is allowed to sleep with each from the implications is kind of...

Also he wanted to take infant muggleborns from muggles regardless of personality, obliviate them and then have the muggleborns adopted and blood-adopted. And Wizengamot just... Voted for the bill without a single vote against it with Harry just saying a few pretty words.

Like yeah his speech seemed pretty good if it wasn't advocating for what it was advocating for but there is no way this would happen unless he mass-Imperioed them all.

I do like well-written Dark Harry fics, and do not at all mind ridiculous ancestries with 80 lordships and 590 centillion galleons, but they have to be well-written at least to some degree and not just outright ridiculous right from the first chapter.

It just reminds me of the fics I tried writing when I was 14 but worse. Way worse and that's something to behold.

Although I do have to give credit for good writing quality when it comes to vocabulary and grammar at least.
