  I remember this ridiculous fic where he beats Voldemort by making a Light Horcrux by sleeping with a Witch from every house

Yeah, that does sound like the cringiest shit I've ever heard as well.

I think I have read a part of Harry Crow, but dropped it for the sheer ridiculousness of the entire thing, including the part where he starts dating Hermione when they're 11, still children, and where he attacks and threatens Hermione and then she still likes him after and everything is fine.

Which it really is not.

I agree harem really sucks though.

I remember once reading a Fanfiction named Core Strings, IIRC, where it started out amazing.

Harry, who was really young, one day got a broken bone and suddenly, a green light appeared, and he learned to control it properly and discovered it to be magic, so he just cultivated it until he had thick green ropes if magic bending to his will.

He literally remade his entire body with magic, which was a bit much but fine and something new, and made his own mindscape where he discovered the Horcrux, destroyed it and absorbed all the memories and abilities.

There was a funny sort of Occlumency where he made thoughts into small ducks with vampire teeth that would guard his mind.

He even gave his aunt weak magic because he unwound her strings.

The Dursleys became better because the Horcrux had been influencing them and didn't hurt him anymore.

He got a wand, but he chose it as his string control made him able to connect with any wand perfectly.

Then he met girls on the Hogwarts Express.

It went downhill real fast.

So he helped them connect with their wands perfectly but of course it apparently felt like he was trailing kisses down their arms, at 11.

When he went to connect Neville's wand it apparently felt "wrong" but he connected the wand if every girl he could find, and apparently it felt like kisses way because of mutual attraction.

At 11.

It also felt extra intense to those he did it to later because he knew them longer and at 11, I cannot stress this enough, he held romantic intentions towards them.

And /all/ of them liked him back.

What. The. Fuck.
