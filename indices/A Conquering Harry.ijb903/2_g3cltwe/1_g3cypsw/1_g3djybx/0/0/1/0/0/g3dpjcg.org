I really want to know your take on Harry Crow now.... The fact is I've never seen a well done harem fic...ever, through all the books or fanfics I've read. The harem part of a story caused me to drop the longest HP/Marvel crossover.

Was just getting into it because tbh I enjoy a relatively OP Harry. Then boom, harem. I remember this ridiculous fic where he beats Voldemort by making a Light Horcux by sleeping with a witch from every house. Cringiest shit I've ever read
