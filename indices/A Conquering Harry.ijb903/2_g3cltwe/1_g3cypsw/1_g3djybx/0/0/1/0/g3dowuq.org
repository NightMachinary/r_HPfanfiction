Thanks, I will.

I apologise for the text wall, I just really dislike the "harem but only I screw all the women/men while they all wait for my attention and chat amiably" trope really much.

If it was at least "harem but all my boyfriends and/or girlfriends also do each other because it's a polyamorous relationship and not a literal harem," then it would at least be something fresh and sort of realistic (unless the relationship is between all the members of Hogwarts from 5th year up that always grows the second a new batch of students become 5th year students who start doing the do with each other and 6th years, then become full members in adulthood and screw what has by then become literally half of the wizarding Britain, alongside a few thousand foreign students who decided to join in)
