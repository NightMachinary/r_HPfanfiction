Awesome! That sounds interesting. I'm still working on my long story (not posted anywhere yet) but I got a lot delayed by major life changes. It's nice to have a project to come back to. Haphne as well.

I found another Haphne story to add to the above. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19193497/chapters/45627454?view_adult=true][to refuse the givens]] It's a completed story with good writing so it's a top ten for me as that's unfortunately very rare for Haphne. Romantic and canon compliant with no bashing. I hope you enjoy. If you ever stray from Haphne, my other recommendation is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] which is perhaps the best dark lord Harry I have found. Let me know what you think. Good luck with your story!
