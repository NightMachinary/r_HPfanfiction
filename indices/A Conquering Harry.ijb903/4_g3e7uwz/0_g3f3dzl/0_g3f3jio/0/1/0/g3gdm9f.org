Unfortunately, well-writted Haphne is hard to find. I've put a couple of links below for you to check out. I only have one similar to the above so I gave you a few other stories to check out if you like. If your a Haphne fan then I think you'll have had read some already. Hopefully there's something that you like.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5835213/1/The-Marriage-Contracts-Redux][The Marriage Contracts Redux]] This is another well written Haphne as close the Contractual Invalidation as I know of.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8262940/1/Unatoned][Unatoned]] Great writing. Complete. Noir. Very much noir and so it will be different from Contractual Invalidation. Personally I love it but may not be your type.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9774121/1/The-Legacy][The Legacy]] My favourite Haphne for realism. Marriage contract wasn't a good idea. However, this story stops just short of the penultimate battle and hasn't been updated for a few years...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/A-Fine-Spot-of-Trouble][A Fine Spot of Trouble]] An enjoyable post-war story. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4334542/1/The-Grass-Is-Always-Greener][The Grass is Always Greener]] Quite a good story if my memory serves me correctly. I enjoyed it when I first found Haphne. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8769990/1/Second-Chances][Second Chances]] This one is part of a complete series. I remember it having some bashing so take care if that's not what you like. It was well written and had some very original ideas.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent][Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent]] This is a popular Daphne story. Not the greatest writing but it's complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5598642/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Betrothal-Contract][The Betrothal Contract]] This is another completed story. Very popular. I read it a long time ago and can't remember much about it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10649604/1/The-Legacy-Preservation-Act][The Legacy Preservation Act]] Another James Spookie story. Like the one immediately above, it's not brilliant but it's not awful either. Just a plain Jane Haphne story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244813/1/A-Champion-s-New-Hope][A Champion's New Hope]] Another completed story. Not bad just not amazing. I liked it at the time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5012016/1/Partners][Partners]] Another popular one. Not great writing. Is pretty popular though so it might be your cup of tea.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9750991/1/Angry-Harry-and-the-Seven][Angry Harry and the Seven]] Bashing fic. Indy!Harry. I can't remember much else about it as I read it a long time ago and my taste changed.
