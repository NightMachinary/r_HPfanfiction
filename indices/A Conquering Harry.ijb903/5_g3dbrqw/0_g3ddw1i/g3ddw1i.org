[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10784770/1/Harry-Potter-Geth][Harry Potter: Geth]] is fairly similar, he kinda just gets a starting workforce of subordinates power then he runs with it.

I enjoy it because despite the power fantasy, Harry's interactions with the galaxy around him are hilarious, it's like movie-Harry in Felix Felicis the entire time.
