Spoilers spoiled, but please, it's legitimately awful.

​

If anyone wants to read a fic where Harry literally invalidates every single possible threat to the story, is able to 1v1 destroy Sovereign with a sword (even a SUUPPPERRR MAGICAL SWOOOOOOOOOOOORD), is nonsensically immune to indoctrination, is able to effortlessly change any characters' mind, is able to completely invalidate the entirety of the struggle of the series, give it a go. It's tremendous shit. And I'm being honest to shit. It's a story that, literally, has no stakes at all. The conflict is, literally, reduced to "welp, Harry's here!!!" It's... really bad. I would have enjoyed it in my early teens. I don't think I can ever criticize this shit pile enough. It's a legitimate 0/5 star story. Oh, but at least he is able to cure the quarian race and fucks the quarian girl and the geth aren't responsible for anything! To this day, I cannot read any story where Harry is referred to as an Emissary. I cannot castigate this fic enough. I would rather unironically re-read My Immortal.

​

The worst part is that Harry's power could be expressed purely canonically!!! A Harry Potter wizard in Mass Effect would be a force multiplier on a level a master biotic could only dream of. But it's just so fucking bullshit.

And here's a protip to any author over the age of 14, if your main character is able to invalidate the entire struggle in a crossover, if he is able to make every single main character irrelevant because he's just so awesome... please do some self-reflection. I'm still angry that I read it to its entirety. I hate this story. It was a wonder I was able to even speak about it outside of incoherent screeches of hate. Even if you want to read some word-ramble about a god powered Harry doing work, you can do better than this.
