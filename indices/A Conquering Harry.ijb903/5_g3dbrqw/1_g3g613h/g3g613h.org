Holy fucking shit lmfao. I'm reading through this one right now. It has some interesting ideas but god. fucking. damn. it. I just got to the chapter where the Anakin bashing reached levels of ludicrous fucking hilarious shit. Lol. Harry just said that Anakin wasn't really a slave. Harry was the real slave. Anakin was just a "prisoner.". Oh, my god. I was hoping against hope that the story was going to play that nonsense straight and have literally every character chastise Harry for even uttering such nonsense. But no. There was borderline agreement there. What a trash pile of a shit fic.
