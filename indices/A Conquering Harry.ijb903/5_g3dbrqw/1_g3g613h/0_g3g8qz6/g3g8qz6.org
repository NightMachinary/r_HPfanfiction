Some further comments:

If you want to read a story similar to the Geth abomination up there, go for it. Harry here completely invalidates every single threat he comes across. He defeats Maul in a few seconds, immobilizes and captures Darth Sidious in seconds, and manages to capture Darth Plagueis OUT OF SCENE and presents him to the Jedi Council. Because that's what we want in a Star Wars Prequel story. We want the entirety of the Sith Great Plan to be neutralized and every single Sith Lord to be captured within a week. With Zero Effort. Oh wait, Harry had to come to grips with the fact that Maul could deflect a stunning charm. But wait! The reductor charm doesn't have visible light! Therefore the force sensitive Maul was completely vulnerable and had his legs shatter! Jesus Christ. That a witch or wizard can be invisible to the force is a... decent story telling technique. That that power completely invalidates the prescience of the force users so they can be taken out in three seconds is complete nonsense.

>! All because the great conflict of the story is the nonsense awkward "chemistry" between Harry and Tali (OH WAIT sorry, Not Tali. Padme. It's the same shit) God what trash. Maybe in the next chapter Harry will blush when he realizes his love interest accidentally looked at him :) What suspense is there here? Harry could take out every single jedi on the council in 2 seconds and then hunt down the rest. He could go to the senate and use the blasting curse to kill them all with no consequence. And then he could give out a super special Indy!Harry speech to the holonet denouncing them! Christ. This one is just as bad as Harry Potter: Geth up there. -0 out of 5.!<
