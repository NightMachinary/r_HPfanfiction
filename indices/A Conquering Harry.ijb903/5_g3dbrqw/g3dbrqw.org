I guess it would be a spoiler for the story itself to suggest this one, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13569941/1/What-s-a-Gungan][What's a Gungan?]] by mjimeyg has this sort of form as an unintentional case, so I guess it wouldn't count on the "*/seeks/* to take control" aspect but Harry doesn't shy away from taking over otherwise when it is the best solution to solving a problem. Not a dark/evil Harry either.
