The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/37557][Charming Universe]] series by Lomonaaeren has Harry getting fed up with the ministry and takes control of Hogwarts. He and Draco manipulate the public so that Draco is seen as the only candidate for Minister of Magic that can work with the newly declared Dark Lord. I didn't find it as crack-ish as the author's summaries made it out to be.
