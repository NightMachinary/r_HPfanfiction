"Not too quickly" meaning like 200 chapters in before they even hint at anything official from what I remember.

It's a really well-written fic, a perennial favourite, but /by Merlin/ when Breanie says "slow burn" they mean it.

Breanie's other works are also very good, OP. I recommend you check them out.
