A lot of canon-pairings and Harry/Hermione shit on each other and the authors try to prove how wrong the other alternative would be. IMO if you want to show how good two characters would be together, you should show exactly that rather than trying to make some strawman argument about the wrongness of an alternative. Often, it is not even thinly veiled.
