From what I've seen, it's about 50/50. Some are truly nasty in regards of their almost missionary disdain for Hermione, the others are true to canon in regards to their friendship.

I like both, but I find Harry/Ginny difficult to enjoy because it almost inevitability comes with Ron/Hermione, and that's not a pairing I see lasting longer than a weekend. Especially since a lot of the fics I've read had a dynamic very focused on their fights as some twisted, misguided expression of love inspired by RomComs rather than real life. Which is a shame because there are almost no fics with Harry/Ginny, a strong friendship with Hermione yet her not fucking any Weasley (or even worse, Death Eater).
