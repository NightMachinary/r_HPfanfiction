In some sense, any 'shipping-centred fic that rewrites one or both partners' personality from scratch is an argument /against/ the 'ship. For example,

- /Harry Crow/: Harry and Hermione could be a lovely couple... if Harry were raised by goblins.
- /What We're Fighting For/: Harry and Hermione could get together... if Harry were an emotionally stunted killing machine with a heart of gold and Hermione were isolated and helpless.
- /Unsung Hero/: Harry and Hermione could happen... if Harry were much more hard-working, ambitious, intelligent, and level-headed.
- Majority of Dramione fics: Draco and Hermione could fall in love... if Draco were suave and steadfast and Hermione were a flighty ingenue with no personality or values.
- Majority of Haphne fics: Harry and Daphne could be a real power-couple... if Daphne were a smart, cunning, skilled pureblood who is proudly neutral about Voldemort (as if it were a good thing) all is about Pureblood Culture and Traditions but is not at all prejudiced against Muggleborns.
