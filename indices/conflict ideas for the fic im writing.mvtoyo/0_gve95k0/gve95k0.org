Can you give any more information for what you're writing, like time period, main characters, major themes, etc? I'd love to help, but I don't start my fics based on the conflict. The conflict arises from the world and the characters.

EDIT: I'd bet a lot of suggestions you'll receive will be about magical creatures, because they're always interesting, but let's see if we can find something tailored specifically to what you want to write. What ideas are you kicking around so far?

EDIT NUMBER 2: Okay, so I'd still prefer to know what your interests are, but I have a few more specific ideas:

(1) Something that I really enjoy in my fics is exploring either populism or the idea that when you cut the head off the operation, an even more dangerous and disorganized movement might spring up to take its place, which is often shown by what the remaining Death Eaters would do if they were loyal to Voldemort's mission but accepted he was gone. I like to follow Fenrir Greyback, who did survive the war, because I think he's the most interesting remaining Death Eater, but you can write an AU or focus on someone else like Thorfinn Rowle.

(2) Relating to magical populism, I like the question of what would it look like if a dark wizard viewed muggles as an asset to be exploited rather than vermin to be exterminated. This is the focus of my current fic, so I can give more specific details if you're interested. Basically, I have one dark wizard who has invaded the muggle government to gain control of the military and take down the Ministry/MACUSA and one dark wizard who wants to create a utopian muggle-wizard coexistence at the cost of advocated forced breeding (based on the idea of racial whitening).

(3) Anything that relates to wizards losing their magic or children being born without magic is always popular. This is most commonly depicted through a disease outbreak but could also be the work of wizard or muggle extremists.

(4) This isn't an example, but if you're interested in writing a romance or ship-driven fic, then the ship would be very valuable information because that tends to drive the tension. My fic about magical populism/muggle exploitation is Albus/Scorpius because it's centered around the idea that Scorpius has been forced to learn from his family's mistakes and has built his life around atonement whereas Albus is desperate to escape his father's shadow and is less instinctively wary of anything that might be considered dark. The central theme of the first fic (which did use Voldemort as the villain) was the way in which Scorpius related more to Harry and Albus related more to Draco because they both had such different upbringings from their fathers. This is just a long way of saying that every ship comes with inherent tension, and I'd love to hear what you enjoy writing.
