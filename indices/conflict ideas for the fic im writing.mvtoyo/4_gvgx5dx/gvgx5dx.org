Natural disasters? Armageddon? Aliens? Gods? Zombies? Vampires? Oh, that reminds me of a fic where Harry as MoD is reborn and is the prophesied savior of all creatures (incl houseelves, merpeople, goblins, ...) and leads a rebellion against wizards and witches! That was a fun one. So maybe a creature/beings rebellion?
