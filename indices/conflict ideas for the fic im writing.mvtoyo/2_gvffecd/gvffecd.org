You can have an outwordly or demonic being. Many, many years ago I was toying with this idea that I would likely never use so feel free to do whatever you want with it. The Chamber of Secrets was actually created as prison for a powerful demonic being that appeared as a physical manifestation of the dark arts practiced in the early days of Hogwarts. The founders banded together to imprison it under school and each of them placed powerful protections so that no one could accidentally release it. With Slytherin's protection (the Basilisk) gone, someone overcomes the others as well and accidentally releases it. This being is called the Mother/Father of Dementors and wants to enslave all humankind and use them as food source for its children.

The other one you might use could be a competent, but overly-zealous minister that tries to fight the rising threat of Voldemort by implementing powerful spells to monitor the usage of dark arts. While successful at first, the wizarding world soon becomes an Orwellian dystopia where every little transgression can be punished with years in Azkaban or even death. Furthermore, from the amount of information, the Minister soon goes mad, while also becoming an omniscient Big Brother-like figure.

Feel free to use any of this.
