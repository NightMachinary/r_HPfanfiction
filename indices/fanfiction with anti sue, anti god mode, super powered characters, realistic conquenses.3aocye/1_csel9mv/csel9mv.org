I am trying to claw my way through [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/Renegade-Cause][Renegade Cause]] (W: 507,606; Complete), and it seems to be the type you're looking for. I can't decide yet though whether it has a good plot and world-building but annoyingly vast amount of dialogues or if it's just a story about /everybody/ being idiots, so that Idiot Balls will not apply because it's not out of character for them.

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]] (W: 232,797; not updated in a year), where Harry is put in scenarios that he feels are beyond him and in which he often has to make almost-panicked decisions in the face of zeitnots.
