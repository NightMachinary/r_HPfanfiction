Hey there! I felt the same way when I first fell in love with the HP series...like I was afraid to let anything tarnish the experience! Then my best friend introduced me to a few stories and I fell in love!

It looks like you've already got a lot of suggestions for cannon-compliant fics, so I'll give you a few that are AU (alternative universe.) My personal favorite is A Year Like None Other by aspeninthesunlight. It shows a completely different side of Snape, and I loved seeing his character be developed in a whole new way. It's an eventual Snape-adopts-Harry fic, which is KNOW sounds crazy, but it actually works really well and is super cute in the end. Lots of violence in parts, though, just so you know.

I've got a million other fics to suggest as well if you want. Just comment back and let me know who your favorite characters are, and I'll see what I can come up with!

I also run a Harry Potter fan fiction blog, called The Magic Word, with my best friend, and you could wander by if you want more suggestions right away. You can find us at hogsmeadebooks.wordpress.com.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you want more recs! Always happy to help keep the fandom alive and strong! :)
