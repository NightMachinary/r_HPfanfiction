Yeah, this is definitely a good one to start with. Stick with canon stories to begin with and you'll have less to complain about.

I would also highly recommend stories centering on the Marauders - my absolute favorite fanfic of all time is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2598097/1/][Moments of Bliss]] by moonymaniac on Fanfiction.net. It centers on Remus, so if you're a fan of his, it's perfect. Personally, of all the fics I've read (which is a lot), this one captures the personality of the canon characters the best. I really can believe that this is how the Marauders would have acted as teenagers - please read it!! :)
