I must recommend [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledores_Army_and_the_Year_of_Darkness][Dumbledore's Army and The Year of Darkness]] on fanfiction.net. It takes place during Deathly Hallows while Ron, Harry and Hermione are away from Hogwarts. When I read it, I really felt like it could have really taken place, and I have always wanted to know what happened at Hogwarts while they trio was away.

I think this would be a great step into fan fiction because it is very close to canon and is really well written.
