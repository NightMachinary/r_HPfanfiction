Reading fanfics won't change the experience although it is a shame you waited so long to start. I started reading them after book 5 I think and they really opened my eyes to minor characters and potential plot directions. Now I don't read nearly as many, but they are still fun and I would recommend just jumping in (find a high review story featuring your favorite character or one you would like to learn about).
