It has changed the way I read the books, but I think they way I read the books was changing anyway. Reading them as an 11 year old and on through all the releases was different that re-reading them now as a 22 year old. The way I see it, my experiences on reading the books was going to alter as I grew up anyway.

By allowing myself to read a veritable world of backstories and more intensely themed stories, I'm "controlling" that change and feeding my love for Harry Potter. I usually read fan-fiction and the books themselves at the same time. I often take my hard copies of the books on the bus to work, and my relaxation time after work is coming home to a new fan-fiction. Why can't we have both? (:

Sometimes I read a fanfic that is /so good/, I feel like I'm cheating on the original seven books... but without JKR's original works, none of this wonderful fanfic-world would be here. So I try not to think of it as cheating, because each author is just lucky JKR lets other people play in her sandbox .

Take some time to get to know side characters - this is one of my favorite things about fanfics. In my top 3 stories is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A_Difference_in_the_Family_The_Snape_Chronicles][The Snape Chronicles]], which I recommend in here probably way more than is necessary. This is the best fiction about Snape that I have ever read. The author goes to great lengths (in my opinion) to keep things as close to JKR canon as possible. Start out with a canon compliant fic, and see if that's your cup of tea. Or, if you feel like that is too close to the books you already love, go completely AU (alternate universe) - AU is a great way for you to experience more stories about the characters you love without being too uncomfortably close to the books. Another great thing about fanfics is their ability to completely ignore that epilogue. Pick your favorite characters, and I guarantee someone has written them in love at least once. Don't be scared off by the weird pairings off the bat, though... There are some stories I just won't read! haha

Ok, phew. I just wrote a novel. Sorry for dumping all that and rambling. But I've felt something at least similar to what you're feeling, and this is how I've sorted it out.

TL;DR - Think of fan-fiction as a way for embellishment on the world we already love. Start with well-written stories that embellish on canon (like [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A_Difference_in_the_Family_The_Snape_Chronicles][The Snape Chronicles]]), and go from there. (:
