I don't know of any where Harry goes to Beauxbatons instead of Hogwarts, but in linkffn(Harry Potter: Unchampion) he transfers there after 4th year. There's another one, but I can't remember the name, in which Harry unlocks metamorphmagus abilities, and he and Hermione both go to Beauxbatons as girls.
