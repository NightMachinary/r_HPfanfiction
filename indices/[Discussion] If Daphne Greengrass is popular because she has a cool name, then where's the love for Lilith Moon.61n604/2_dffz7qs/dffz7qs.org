We know even less about *Lily* Moon, than we do about Daphne Greengrass. We don't even know her house, or (if we go strictly by the books) her first name and gender.

I've seen Lily, Laila, Lilian and Lilith Moon appear in various fics and authors can't agree on her personality -- for obvious reasons, since canon gives absolutely no indication.
