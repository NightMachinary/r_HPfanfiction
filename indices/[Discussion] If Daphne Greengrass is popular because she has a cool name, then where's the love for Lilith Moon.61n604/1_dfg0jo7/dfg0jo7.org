There were some good reasons named here, but I think the main is that she is a Slytherin, female, not ugly and not bad.

About all the other female Slytherins we know either nothing or something 'bad':

- Pansy is an asshole
- Milicent is ugly
- Tracy is never mentioned in the books, and isn't a pureblood

Since you can't redeem Pansy (that only works with male characters, right?), can't have Harry date an /ugly/ person, and Tracy isn't pureblood and not mentioned in the books by elemination the only hot, eligible Slytherin is... Daphne Greengrass!

We don't know Lily's house, so she isn't really a factor.
