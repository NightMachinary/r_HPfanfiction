Because EVERYONE uses it. Open a story, book smart. Open another, book smart. Open another, greatest witch of her age. It's a stupid fucking cliche. HOW CAN YOU FEEL IT'S APPROPRIATE WHEN THIS IS FANFICTION!? She's a side-character; whatever persona, hair, eyes, looks, you want to give her is possible because aside from a name and a house, this is fanfiction. You see how easily I can do the same for Hermione? BTFO.
