I mean, this is fanfiction, and almost every fanfiction I see has Hermione portrayed more or less the same, she is always book smart, whether that is good or bad. I think that establishing a characterization with Daphne Greengrass isn't a bad thing, it allows us to understand the character, rather than having her be an OC placeholder.
