In fanon, she's frequently an ice queen, yes. If you wanted to write a different sort of character, you might as well use somebody else. It's not all that different from wanting to write a bookworm and using Hermoine.

Besides, it also gives a certain expectation to readers. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It lets people know what to look for, /and/ it gives skilled writers expectations to subvert.

As for why, I imagine it's a combination of the ice queen archetype being fairly popular, both for the obvious character appeal and the ease by which it adds layers of complexity to the character (it's almost in the name itself). There's also the aspect of taking the house system too seriously (also a problem in canon), so the writer may want one of the few intersections between hardcore Slytherin personalities and likeable characters.

The way I see it, it's like getting upset at the self-sacrificing and short-sighted hero. You get to that personality in a main character through a similar process.

Of course, if people want to write Daphne as an ice queen, I don't really see a problem with that. If a lot of people want to, it's still not a problem. It's not as if there's a council of fanfiction that determines what gets written. If it bothers you /that/ much, there's nothing really stopping you from writing Daphne some other way.
