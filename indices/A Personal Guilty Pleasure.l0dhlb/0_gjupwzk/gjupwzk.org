I'm going to suggest [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19328290/chapters/45976822][The Archeologist]] because Harry does epic stuff and really undersells it, but it is technically femslash. The pairing is irrelevant to the plot, sort of just shows up in the last chapter/epilogue with some pretty minor hints previously. If you are okay with that, then it's an amazing read and is complete at around 90k. One of my favorite fics to reread.
