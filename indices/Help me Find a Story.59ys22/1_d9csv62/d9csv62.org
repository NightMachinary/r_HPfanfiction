You could try the Cunning and Ambition series. The author wrote a story for every school year but abandoned the series in year 6.

It features Slytherin!Harry, some Snape mentoring and the new trio includes Draco. I don't remember if I read the entire series but I read the first story and I remember the plot was almost a straight canon retell. But if you want a canon retell with Draco as part of the trio instead of Ron, then this is for you. Also, I believe the later stories will feature slash but there's definitely no slash whatsoever in the first story if you're curious about the story but slash isn't your thing.

  One small gesture and one simple sentence change lives, and through it, history. A Slytherin!Harry AU.

Another series you could try is the Leo Inter Serpentes series.

This one is similar to Cunning and Ambition where it is a canon rewrite with Slytherin!Harry, some Snape mentoring and Draco is part of the trio but this series is slightly more original than Cunning and Ambition. Leo Inter Serpentes' plot heavily follows the events of canon BUT some things play out a bit differently than in the book. This isn't true all of the time though, as events play out much more differently in some stories than others. This is also abandoned after the 5th year. Harry and Draco have a relationship by the 4th book.

  Just one conversation between two eleven year old boys goes slightly differently, and the world changes. Just how much will be different with Harry being sorted into Slytherin, and how much will stay the same?
