This is the only one I can think of off the top of my head, but HPMOR seems to fit most of your criteria.

If you aren't familiar with it, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) is a pretty well known fic where Harry's Aunt married a biochemist instead of Vernon and so Harry was raised as a scientist. Harry is friends with Draco and Hermione (with H and D having a rivalry/friendship going on) and there's no yaoi except for jokes that others make about them. Harry's not really dark but not really good either, I'd say he's Chaotic Neutral. The universe in general was also changed a bit and more explanation is given to a lot of background elements.

If you ask around here, you'll get some people who love it (me) and some who hate it with a passion.

The only criteria it doesn't meet is that Harry is the obvious main focus (not sure if that's an issue) and it not taking place from years 1-7, but it is a complete story and has a good length. There are a few unofficial sequels to it and Significant Digits is the best imo and even surpasses HPMOR as a serious story.
