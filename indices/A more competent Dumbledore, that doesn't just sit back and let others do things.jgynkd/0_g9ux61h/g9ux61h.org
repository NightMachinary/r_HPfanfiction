That fits a number of of my stories - my Dumbledore generally hates killing, but would rather kill the guilty than risk the innocent. He's a central character in "Patron", "Divided and Entwined", "The Dark Lord Never Died" and "Uncle Quentin's Spy", and often has similar, if less prominent roles, in my other stories.
