As the Dementor pulled out Sirius's soul, he managed to cast a Patronus Charm. It was enough to keep him alive, but...

He saw his reflection in the window. Paler skin... freckles and... "Oh bloody hell I look like a Weasley" he was Ginger. It turns out that if you stop a Dementor's Kiss and survive, you DO lose your soul, and as we all know, Gingers have no souls.

"Well, at least no one will be looking for Sirius Black. Polaris Weasley on the other hand could adopt me" Harry teased, causing the now ginger Sirius to snort with laughter.
