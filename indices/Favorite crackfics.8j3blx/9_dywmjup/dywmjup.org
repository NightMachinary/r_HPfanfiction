I second linkao3(The Very Best), but the number-one spot cannot fail to go to linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stepchild). Also an honorable mention to the one-shot linkffn(Harry's Wand Gets Around).

Note: I didn't forget /Seventh Horcrux/, but I consider it more of a humor fic than an actual /crackfic/, much like my own story.
