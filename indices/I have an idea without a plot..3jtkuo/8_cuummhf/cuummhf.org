Figure out what /would/ stay constant from canon and then just wind your characters up and let them go and write what happens. If Harry is a person in your head the plot should reveal itself as you go. So, assuming you don't re-write the past:

- Harry survived Riddle's attack as a baby. Assuming events with the philosopher's stone play out as they did in canon, wraith!Riddle is due to return with Quirrel in Harry's first year.
- Harry will arrive in a Slytherin House known as a celebrity, famous from infancy for somehow defeating Voldemort and the heir of a reasonably well-known old magic family (Though the vast Potter fortune, manor, etc. are largely a product of fanon). Though his mother was muggleborn, she was also talented and popular, and was Hogwarts' Head Girl. Even a bratty 11-year-old like Draco's first instinct was to try to cultivate Harry, knowing that he would have social cachet.
- Harry enters a Slytherin House run by Professor Snape, who presumably harbors the same canon grudge against james and by extension Harry. Their proximity will presumably exacerbate the intensity of their relationship; there are many different ways to play this both positive and negative.
- Canon Harry, while friendly, is not especially out-going and his friends are largely thrust upon him. Who in Slytherin will thrust themselves upon him in the absence of Hermione and Ron? (Many fics bring Harry and Hermione back together using the plausible if overly-convenient excuse that with Harry in Slytherin Hermione would be something of an outcast in her own House, while Harry would be the same in his, leading to them meeting in the library or whatever but you don't /have/ to do this.)

Obvious there's lots more you could add, and you pick and choose what you want to emphasize, but that's what I thought of off the top of my head. [edit for spelling]
