  Usually, I find some issue or other with it, either because I'm picky or just have bad luck in the fics I choose to read.

No, it's because vast, vast majority of them are crap. Of course, Sturgeon's Law applies, and 90% of everything is crap, but the trouble with Slytherin!Harry is that, like 'shippy Harmony, Harlequin-style Dramione, indy!Harry, etc., it has a sizable constituency that will read/review/fave /anything/ in that category that is even remotely readable (and a lot that isn't), which makes it practically impossible to find the 10-20 fics from the category that are actually decent.
