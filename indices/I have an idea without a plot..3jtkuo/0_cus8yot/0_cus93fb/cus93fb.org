Oh heavens no. I want to write the story exactly to avoid the cliches I keep seeing in these kinds of fics. Everyone's human (except, well, y'know, house elves and such), whether they're a hero, a bullying prat, or a Hufflepuff.

I think, maybe, I'll start off doing some short little bits. Scenes I'm imagining and such, taking place in the same AU. Maybe do a full-on plot-driven story once I've gotten a bit of inspiration. Not having to start at first year is good advice, though, I hadn't even considered that for some reason.
