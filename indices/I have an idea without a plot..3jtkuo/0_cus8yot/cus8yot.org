Take your time, write notes about everything you want your story to have - not only in relation to Slytherin, but everything you want to see happening in the HP world. Open your mind to the possibilities, and plot bunnies would just... slither in. (he he)

If it's that hard to come up with a narrative, try going through books/shows/films you like, and think of how their narrative could work in the world of Harry Potter. It doesn't necessarily have to involve Voldemort. Results can be very interesting.

Just remember that you don't have to start the story in first year. This is a common mistake that many authors, including me, make. Writing detailed seven years is /hard/. Pick a period of time you want your particular plot to take place in, and squeeze in whatever general elements a story like this would have (trials Harry has to go through to find his place in Slytherin, for example). You can show background/earlier events through subtle references. Also remember that you can discard canon plots if you like. Lucius Malfoy doesn't have to unleash Tom Riddle's diary and so on. Don't let it limit you.

The concept of Harry in Slytherin is interesting, though it's usually poorly executed and overrun with horrible cliches. Please no ice queens or disproportional bad treatment.
