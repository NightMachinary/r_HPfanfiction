Interesting. It's funny that we've got such a different idea of a Slytherin Harry.

I think you've got some good points as well, but we have different purposes to the story. I want Harry completely isolated in the wizarding world, kinda like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4883260/1/Down-the-Rabbit-Hole][Down the Rabbit Hole]]. Putting him in Slytherin and thus getting rid of his Boy-Who-Lived title that made people see him as a hero came to me while writing and it works well. The same simple good-vs-evil worldview that made Harry a hero now makes him evil in the public eye.
