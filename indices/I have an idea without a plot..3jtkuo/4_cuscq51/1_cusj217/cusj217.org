... Heh. Well, I can certainly tell that our fics will be vastly different. (Which is fine - to each their own and all that).

I actually disagree with a lot of that. First of all, I don't at all percieve Harry as distrusting. Rather, I see him as starved for affection and friendship, which is why he's so quick to open up to Hagrid (about a day) and Ron (half a train-ride or so), and even Sirius in PoA (immediately agreeing to go live with a man you only just found out wasn't a mass murderer). I'm also probably keeping his friendship with Ron, who I think is a reasonable enough person that he'd realize, if they got to talking, that Harry's alright. Obviously, it'll be a much slower process since they can't spend every day together in class and every evening together in the common room. Could easily take years. So yeah, no surrogate Weasley-family.

As for Malfoy, my Harry's gonna realize pretty quickly that he's all bark and no bite, so there'll be a lot less "Malfoy is up to something" and a lot more "Shut up Malfoy". They might have to come to some kind of grudging truce so their arguing doesn't disrupt classes too much or something. But yeah, I'm definitely not going the "Malfoy and Harry are bffs" route that I've seen some people do. 'Cause Malfoy's still a dick.

I might have to make up some older Slytherins who aren't quite as dickish as the ones in Harry's year, so there's someone who's at least reasonably polite around, even if they're not outright friendly.

Personally, my focus is gonna be how most of the wizarding community is incredibly spooked by Harry - there were, after all, a lot of people who thought he'd be a dark wizard even greater than Voldemort after defeating him, and being put in Slytherin is definitely going to confirm that belief for a lot of people. I'm also gonna have Harry learn, over time, that Slytherin isn't quite as bad as he thought, and that he can actually learn from his house-mates - putting a little bit of a damper on his hot temper, etc.
