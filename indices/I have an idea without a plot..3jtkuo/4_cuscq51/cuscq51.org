Currently writing a fic where Harry's in Slytherin (and a whole lot more happens, it diverges a lot from canon after the second year).

You've got to work out the idea of /how/ he got in Slytherin in the first place. Did he miss the Weasleys on the train station? Is your Harry a lot more distrustful and independent than canon Harry, therefore not believing Hagrid when he talks about Slyterin?

Then there's Harry himself. I guess he doesn't make best mates immediately on the train, so he is very lonely. You could use this very well with the Mirror of Erised. Have Harry be completely starved for friendship the first months, so that when he sees his parents in the mirror, he gets a much stronger reaction.

In my fic, Harry gets bullied a lot by his fellow Slytherins because he is the Boy Who Lived and he's a half-blood. That makes Harry research a lot of spells to protect himself. He builds up a lot of knowledge, and I use this as a means to get Harry and Hermione together as friends in their second year, even though they didn't have the whole troll incident. They kind of become working buddies in the library.

As for relationships with the others, think logically. The Weasleys are completely out of the question as a surrogate family. They are fairly prejudiced (especially Ron, who has a temper to top it off) and Molly and Arthur are very protective of their family.

My fic does have Ginny and Harry becoming friends after the CoS and I use that as a sort of "forbidden friendship". Fun to write.

Snape is very important to get right, for obvious reasons. my guess is that at first, Snape is furious at Harry, but later on he starts to realise that Harry is not like his father. In fact, Snape sees a lot of himself in Harry: lonely, bullied, grew up in a hating environment. I don't think Snape would be forever a bully to Slytherin Harry.

As for Harry's dorm mates, it's Malfoy and his two bodyguards and two fairly blank sheets.

Theodore Nott is the son of a Death Eater and a blood purist, so I don't think he and Harry become friends, but Blaise Zabini is very blank. Do with him what you want, but I don't think he and Harry are best mates. Blaise is a Slytherin. He's not going to befriend the most hated person in his house.

Malfoy is still the son of a Death Eater and an arrogant ponce. Yes, he redeems himself (sort of) at the end of canon, but don't forget that he looks up to his father, who is a ruthless Death Eater. He'll probably instigate a lot of hate against Harry and rally Slytherin against him.

As for girls, well, you have Pansy Parkinson and Millicent Bulstrode, who are not very nice in canon. Tracy Davis and Daphne Greengrass are two blank slates. Maybe have Harry crush on one of them?

Slytherin Harry is very interesting to write, because you have so much you can make up yourself, so many blank characters and divergence from canon. Just keep in mind that Harry still grew up with the Dursleys, and is thus very shy and distrusting.
