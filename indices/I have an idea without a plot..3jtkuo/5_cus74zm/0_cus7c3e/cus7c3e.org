Well, in the stories I've read so far, Slytherin!Harry usually takes about five chapters or so to become a cynical, overanalyzing brat who comments on everything as though his internal monologue is being written by Malfoy. That or all of Slytherin house is whitewashed to be wonderful people who put up a mean exterior. I wanna do something where Harry is still Harry, and Slytherin is still Slytherin.

I'm not horribly keen on OCs, but I might do something like that, yeah.
