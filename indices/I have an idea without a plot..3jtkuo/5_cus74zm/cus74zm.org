I'm not sure about what Slytherin!Harry is normally like because thats generally not my cuppa tea. But why not ignore cannon? Or just barely follow it, because while Grandpa whiskers may still keep the stone in Hogwarts, Harry and whoever his friends are may seek other ways to get it.

Maybe have it be more political? Make your own OC in an older year. Here's an idea that literally just popped into my head. Older Slytherins often mentor bright and promising younger students, to forge new connections. A tradition that Slughorn REALLY excelled at and one he continued on well later into life. Harry is the Boy Who Lived! Surely some older Slytherin would want to mentor him and train him up?
