Yes! Personally, this is my headcanon for Slytherin house - first years spend all year looking for a mentor among upper year students. They're encouraged to find someone that does magic that they're interested in, that they look up to, that has interests and personalities similar to their own. And it's a big deal. Mentors and apprentices ( I don't like "mentee") become close friends, and so do their families. Feel free to use this if you want.
