As someone who had much the same experience and just went ahead and wrote something; don't. Wait. Take your time, write some chapters, write a few different chapters, take a look at the first chapters you wrote a few weeks later, wince at the quality, and then rewrite them. Think about what themes you want to have, and plan around that.
