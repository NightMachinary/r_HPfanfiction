Don't get caught up in pre-Hogwarts stuff. You don't have to go into detail into Harry's childhood to understand his sorting. 'Slytherin will help you on your way to greatness' is enough motivation for an 11 year old who has had a shitty downtrodden life, doesn't require expansion or explanation.

How you structure Slytherin is important. Fanon dictates /house rules/ of some sort, do they apply and how so. Harry's acceptance into the house is important as well.

If you're doing a first year fic remember they're 11 and 12 years old. Wizards have a very sheltered life and all they know if what their parents tell them, but they aren't evil. Draco is still a spoiled shit though.

Rehashing can be fine, so long as you fit an adapter well. However if the story is a rehash it has to be less about the events and more about the characters.

I love the idea of Ginny following Harry into Slytherin, if it fits your story of course. Even if that isn't an eventual pair or anything. Also Ron Weasley is not going to be friends with a Slytherin without significant events changing his opinion.
