The way I see it, you have two choices:

A) Come up with a plot.

B) Write a drama.

It's only really genre fiction that has a "plot" in the traditional sense. A lot of literature doesn't really have a plot as we'd think of it. Rather, it's a character sketch, a look inside the life of a person, the events that made them the way they are, often showing either a character transformation or an inability to change.

For examples of this, I'd recommend reading Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegut, or A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini, or The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro. They're all fairly short stories that can be read in a day.

You could try to do something like this: a character piece showing a crucial part of Slytherin Harry's life, maybe even just a couple of days.
