Even our intrepid unreliable narrator would probably notice a giant staircase, and use it rather than having Fawkes carry them up the pipes. That said, I think that all we can say for sure from canon is that any other exits are non-obvious as Harry doesn't make mention of them. There's plenty of wiggle room for other hidden means of egress that require parseltongue to open or other such things.
