Linkffn(What Would Slytherin Harry Do? by Big D on a Diet) is pretty similar in format, though following a Slytherin Harry instead. It has Blaise filling in the role of Harry's best mate.

If you're looking for Harry and Ron bro teamups, the only other one that I know of is Linkffn(Gryffindors Never Die by ChipmonkOnSpeed). It's a time travel story having borderline alcoholic Harry and Ron come back to the past right before the Tri-wizard tournament. Unfortunately Ron seems to be bashed far more often than other characters, so finding good fics with him playing a major role is a challenge.
