I made it through the first chapter, as that's all the time I have at the moment. It is looking pretty good so far, and I enjoyed the chapter. There were definitely interesting (and I think more realistic) changes to the story. So far all I would critique is using a few less direct quotes. We read the books and know what happened in them. I have to say a good start so far.

Sidenote : How long are you planning on making it?
