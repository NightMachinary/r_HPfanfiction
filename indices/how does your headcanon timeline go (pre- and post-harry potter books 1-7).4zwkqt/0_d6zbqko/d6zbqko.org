The Voldemort Era - 1970s - Because a serial killing, mass murdering terrorist is much more of note than a bunch of pranksters.

The Lipstick on Pig Era - 1980s - Because peace was an illusion.

The Harry Potter Era - 1990s - Because Harry Potter was the most controversial figure of the decade.

The Harry and Hermione Granger Era - 2000s - Because Ronald Weasley was only an Auror for 2 years, and someone must have made all the changes to the Ministry of Magic that JK Rowling told us about.
