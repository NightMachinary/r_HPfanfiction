You should try Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond by Keiramarcos. Its available at keiramarcos.com.

I was a bit reluctant to dive into a Soulmate fic but I am really glad that I read it. Its the best written Soulmate fic available. It doesn't have all those talking in mind, power increasing as if he were Merlin tropes. This fic takes everything best that can be about a soulmate genre and lays it best across the story. It takes place during the NEWTS. Also it's Harmony.
