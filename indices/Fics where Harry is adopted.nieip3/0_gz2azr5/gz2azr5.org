Harry is adopted by the Grangers in linkffn(The Accidental Animagus). The abuse is worse than in canon - Vernon hits him with a belt once - but it's not cartoonish evil like some fics get.

I haven't read this but I see linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) recommended a lot. Sirius takes Harry from the Dursleys and raises him.
