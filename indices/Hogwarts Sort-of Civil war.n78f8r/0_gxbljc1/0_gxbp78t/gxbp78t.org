it was more a focus on the dangerous parts of Hogwarts like what is in the forest and the constant dangers the students are in.

And you can't really deny some of the teachers are just plain bad. Binns literally bore 99 % of the class to sleep, Trelawney is generally considered a faker by the majority of the student population and a joke, and while Snape has the skills, his personality ruins any attempt, or lack thereof, at teaching and imparting knowledge to students.
