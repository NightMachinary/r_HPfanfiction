There's a great series of fics, I think the author is MarauderLover7. They retell the whole series as if Sirius raises Harry. I'm on my phone so I can't confirm but I THINK the fic is called “Innocent”, a sequel called “Identity” (they go through pre-PS, up to POA at least, last time I checked. Excellent series, I almost prefer them to the actual series!)
