Note that there hasn't been any particular mention of Harry being an heir of anything beyond his parents' vault, so if the OP particularly wants him to be the Potter-Black heir, maybe this isn't the right story. But it does a really great job of showing Sirius raising Harry from age eight onwards. It's sweet to see Harry get at least a few years of actual childhood, and a parental figure who, for all his flaws, cares very much about Harry's wellbeing.
