Well, I once read a fic in which the Wizarding World knew about gods. They were aware that not only were gods of various religions real, the religious writings were more or less rooted in fact. It's common knowledge...

And wizards are absolutely pissing their robes at the idea! After all, while some believers might want to focus on miraculous healings and message of love and understanding, wizards have detailed records of genocide, floodings, lightning from the clear sky... And invoking a name means drawing attention of one of those immortal, untiring juggernauts.

Naturally, that means the deities get the You Know Who (Asshole in the Sky) treatment, since in a rare moment of rationality, the wizards unanimously decided they want nothing to do with that!
