In my story I tell this about religion in the wizarding world:

Since the wizarding and Muggle worlds separated in the late 17th century, before that their cultures were very similar. In Britain, wizards were Christian. Remember that the Hufflepuff house ghost was a friar in life. Actually, many very high-ranking priests and ministers were wizards, because it's so easy to fake miracles with magic. The blood purity dogma was originally justified by stating that magic is a divine power and that wizards are descendants of angels of Christ himself. Some pure-blood families were influential aristocrats as well. For example, the Malfoys owned vast land areas and had subservient Muggle peasants who paid taxes for them. They opposed the Statute of Secrecy, because they lost so much of their lands and income. Later there was no need to maintain any act of religiousness, and many wizards lost this part of their cultural heritage. They still celebrate the Christian holidays, but usually they have no religious aspects anymore.
