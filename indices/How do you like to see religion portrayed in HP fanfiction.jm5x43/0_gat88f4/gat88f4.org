1. Talking just about the situation in Europe (perhaps just Western Europe, there were not that many [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt][witch hunts]] east of the Holy Roman Empire).

2. If anything, then I don't see any alternative religions in the canon, but thorough /secularization/. There are still Christian holidays and feasts celebrated, but not many really take them seriously. I would suggest, that the effect of witch hunts lead to acceleration of the secularization processes which happened in the Muggle Europe post Enlightenment so the wizarding Britain is mostly similar to the current Muggle one. Of course, our views may be distorted by Harry, who obviously didn't touch any religious among Dursleys ever, so he may ignore any religion already happening at Hogwarts (I believe most large boarding schools in UK still have at least nominally chapel, and perhaps there was one at Hogwarts as well, but Harry just ignored it).

3. However, there are almost two centuries or more of the period where the already secularized wizarding Europe lived next to still religious Muggle Europe. I would believe that with Muggle/magical marriages (and Muggleborns coming to the magical world) some Christianity was brought back to the Magical world. One almost canonical example is Minerva McGonagall, a daughter of the Presbyterian Minister. Another religions could be brought by children from nations where secularization didn't happen to the same extent as in Europe/America (e.g., Patil twins, a child of Pakistani immigrants). So, I hypothesize that in the general secularized background there are some fiercely religious families which stick to their faith for relatively long time.

4. I have more comments and list of religiously-related stories on [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/religionless-universe-of-harry-potter.html]]
