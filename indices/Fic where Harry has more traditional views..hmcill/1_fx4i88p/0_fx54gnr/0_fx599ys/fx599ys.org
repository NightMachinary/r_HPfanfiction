Yeah, In fanon writers tend to white wash Voldemort's side with the whole “preserve Wizarding traditions and culture”

In canon most of the hatred towards muggleborn was because of their background. There was only one line I think where Malfoy talked about how they didn't know traditions and the wizarding world. Afterwards that stance seemed to be dropped by JKR and she was pretty explicit that most of the hatred was because of bigotry. We don't really see any more lines about Wizarding culture being erased, etc

So a more traditional Harry would be less accepting of Muggle culture and ideas (ie not listening to Muggle music or wearing their clothes).

He might also have a more negative view of muggles and those with muggle relations as well
