Alternatively, a more traditional Harry could have a pretty positive view of muggles and those with muggle relations, and egalitarian ethics. However, he would explore wizarding culture more than in canon. He may be more interested in History of magic. He would have probably read "The Tales of Beedle the Bard" before the Deathly Hallows. He may participate in old rituals (that have cultural significance, not huge magical benefits - if they had huge magical benefits, everyone would participate, traditional or not). Learn wizard folklore songs and dances.
