  I mean, Wizarding Tradition seems to mostly be 'kill all the muggleborn' in canon

That's rather fanon, actually. In canon, the pureblood faction doesn't actually fight for the sake of tradition. Instead, we see plenty of Wizarding traditions, and Harry and co do participate in them. Hogwarts alone has a lot of traditions: the express, the first year boat trip and ghost scare, the sorting ceremony. In society in general they have a unique dress style - robes, traditional sports - Quidditch. Using parchment and quills for writing is probably for tradition's sake as well. Likely there are plenty more, they simply aren't the focus.
