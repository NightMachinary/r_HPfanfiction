True - I admit, I was being a tad facetious to make a point that 'traditional' is vague and subject to interpretation. Though Tradition is definitely one of the more interesting aspects of Rowling's world, given the longevity of wizards - culture passed down through the generations takes on a different tone when your great, great aunt could still be alive and active in government while you're in school. I do wonder what that kind of multi-generational pressure to conform might've been like.

Huh. Now I think about it, that might actually make for an interesting fic. Snippet-scenes of the static, stagnant wizards watching the rapid advancements and changes made by muggles through the muggleborn arriving in their world.

Anyway, I would also argue that 'kill all the muggleborn' is partly tradition as well, given that it was so prevalent 'muggle-baiting' was a thing (ie. it was a solid presence in Wizarding Culture, like Mafia Activity was a tradition for the Corleone's in The Godfather) and that level of bigotry has been passed down through the generations (Abraxas-Lucius-Draco, for one example, the Blacks for another), so it fits the definition of tradition as well.
