I mean, Wizarding Tradition seems to mostly be 'kill all the muggleborn' in canon, so could you be a lil' more specific? Might help folks find some specific stuff for you.

Like, do you want pagan-rituals level traditional, pureblood bigotry level traditional, medieval-gentry-esque traditional views, thinly-veiled-Christianity traditional, etc?

And do you want those beliefs to play a large part in the plot/character development arc, or is it being a secondary or minor passing issue okay too?
