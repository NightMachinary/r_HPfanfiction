linkffn(Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven) and its sequels focus quite heavily on tradition, with it being a rift between Harry and Sirius for a while. It does an interesting seperation between blood purism and traditionalism (i.e. actually having Voldemort shit on tradition, with his followers being visibly displeased by it, but too afraid to speak up.)
