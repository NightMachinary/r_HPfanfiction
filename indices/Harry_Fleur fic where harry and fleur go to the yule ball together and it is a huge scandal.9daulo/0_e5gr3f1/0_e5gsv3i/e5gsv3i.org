There's a few, few that they are that make them meet at/during the Quidditch finale and their relationship begins before the drawing of the names. There's also other stories that have them be basically pen pals and they meet each other in person for the first time when she arrives at Hogwarts. And lets not forget those that just have Harry ask her out because... reasons, I can't recall right now. Think it was: Part - because they lust after her because of her heritage that makes us so similar. Part hot girl that turns down everybody, might as well try.

In that subsection of the pairings story, it's rather usual for that to happen.
