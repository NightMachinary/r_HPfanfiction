Gonna have to wait till friday evening/saturday morning. I've got a paper I've only found sources that's due tomorrow. And then I've got another thing due monday that I at least have only read the assigned material from one book (The other one's swedish and few/no norwegians manage to read that easily- frustratingly it's also the one with the most material to read) So I'm cramming one 2 week assignment into one day and a week assignment into 2 days. I'm so fucked.
