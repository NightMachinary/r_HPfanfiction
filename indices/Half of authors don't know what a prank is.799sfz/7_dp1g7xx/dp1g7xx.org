You know what I think would be a funny practical joke? Filling the Great Hall with tropical flying fish. Let them flit around while people are eating, swimming through the air and being pretty and beautiful and getting in people's faces. If creating air-breathing levitating fish is too much work, fill the hall with colourful parrots instead.

...Or! Enchant a bunch of musical instruments to follow people around and provide backing music! One instrument per target, but if they meet another target, the two instruments play the same melody! Full on orchestra if you get a couple of dozen people in the same room!

...Wait, I've described these ideas before. Well, how about a new one? Put out a bowl of Complimentary Mints in a common room or outside a classroom or the Great Hall or anywhere. Naturally, each one contains a little bit of potion to cause whoever eats one to be complimentary to people.
