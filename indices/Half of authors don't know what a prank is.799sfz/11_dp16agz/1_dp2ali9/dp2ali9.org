Some more 'Totally Harmless' pranks

Extreme confidence: Give a friend in need a sip and see their confidence skyrocket. They of course don't become idiots because they are confident. They just don't see how it possibly can't go their way.

Outstanding recollection: For those people that just can't seem to remember anything they are supposed to. Hit them with this and they won't forget anything happening in the next hour for a total of 13 days. After that, it is a very foggy memory, but still there.

Philosopher: Have a need to say interesting information, that isn't really important. Like how it is strange how wizards haven't been to the moon, when there are dozens of stories about how wizards has been to the moon.

Lucky plague: Make the house elves mix a little Felix Felicis into the food. See the chaos spread around the hall with everyone going about fulfilling their dreams. Like asking out your crush, only for your crush to have left to win a contest, so you have to follow.
