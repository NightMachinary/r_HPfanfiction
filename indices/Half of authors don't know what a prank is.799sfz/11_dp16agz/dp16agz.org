Pranks:

- sticking charm on everyone's socks and shoes. delayed transfiguration to shorten robes and turn everyone's socks and shoes into hosiery and high heels.

- spike drinks with potion that gives a nice singing voice. also makes them have to sing whatever they want to say.

- knickerknacker - enchanted box. touching it teleports your underwear inside. can also be applied to a pair of gloves that steals underwear by touching someone. happosai would be proud.

- swap professor trelawny's magic ball for one that only shows porn

- carmen sandiago hat and wig combo. enchanted with Gemino Curse and switching spell. taking it off spawns a copy back on your head and switches the original with the copy so you're wearing it again.

- billowbust - charm that causes someones robes to inflate at the front so it looks like they have a comically large chest.

- pillows that self-transfigure into a [[https://i.imgur.com/EMF6NkZ.jpg][puffskein]] at midnight.

- lewdglass - shows the last person someone got off too. stash mirrors around the halls. someone will figure it out eventually. alternatively whomever is standing in front of the mirror their reflection starts putting on a strip show.

- enchant the great hall so that farts are opaque. serve gassy foods.

- gigantic expansion charm on the entrance to a common room so the doorway is now a quarter mile long tunnel.

- transfigure every seat in history of magic into exceedingly comfortable reclining chairs. too easy to fall asleep and not wake up, lots of delays to the next class.

- double the number of butterflies in a room once a day as long as nobody is in the room. cast a charm to lure butterflies into the room. it's going to get ridiculous eventually.

- transfigure a gallon of water into a spider. have it sneak into someones room and end the spell once it's in position.

- serve everyone caffeinated drinks for dinner

- enchanted plates that occasionally make food twitch like its alive

- self-serve food. i.e. donut holes, creme puffs, or jelly beans enchanted to serve themselves to people by flying into their mouths.

- spell that conjures a cat between your feet every 5 minutes. cat will then proceed to exit the room (or best effort) as fast as possible and run through any open doorways it sees.

- tea that makes you find both sexes attractive for 24 hours. call it earl-gay.
