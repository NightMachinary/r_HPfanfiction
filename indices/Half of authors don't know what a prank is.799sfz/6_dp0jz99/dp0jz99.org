Considering one of my stories is built on humor and Weasleys, I have tried very hard to ensure that all pranks are actually pranks. That is, mildly amusing antics like seeding the Dursley's garden with gnomes or turning Dumbledore's hair pink instead of trying to kill someone or just get better grades than them.

That said, I'm pretty sure even my characters realized that busting people out of Azkaban went beyond just a prank.
