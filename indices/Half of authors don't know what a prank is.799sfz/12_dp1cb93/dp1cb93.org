Any prank I've ever read in fanfiction is terrible. It's honestly astounding how many authors think pranks are either beating someone up or an elaborate-over the top plan to destroy them. Even the more moderate pranks aren't that funny in fanfiction-a good prank should have all parties involved laughing.
