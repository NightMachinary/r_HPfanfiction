Yeah, I don't think you know enough about how girls/young women interact in school to generalize about it.

For that matter, men - or more often, boys - get harassed and bullied by other boys all the time. My brother was bullied and ambushed throughout all four years of high school. Years later, he encountered one of his former bullies (who was working as a butcher in a grocery store, which is nicely symbolic), and the guy didn't remember his own behavior being cruel at all. To him, it was no big deal, just what boys do. Bullies don't usually think of themselves as such. Even bullies who run in packs.
