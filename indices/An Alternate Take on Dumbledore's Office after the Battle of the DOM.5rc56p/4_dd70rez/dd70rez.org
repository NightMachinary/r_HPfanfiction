I really like this. I'm a huge fan of mentor!Dumbledore fics and this feels like the beginning of a good one.

I'm not sure why others are so confused. I clearly understood you were diverging from canon in this scene but a lot of other posters seem to think you were rewriting the scene but keeping the aftermath canon... idk.

Anyway, is this just a one-shot or do you actually plan to turn this into a longer story? I'd definitely follow it if you do. Great job!
