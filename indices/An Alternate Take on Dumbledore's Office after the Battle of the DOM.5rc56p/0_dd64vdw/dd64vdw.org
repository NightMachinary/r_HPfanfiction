I'd like to point out that in canon, prophecies are explicitly not binding; they have about as much ability to force people to act as an ordinary weather forecast.

That said, this is really interesting! A Dumbledore who's aware of the binding effects of the prophecy and is trying to set up Harry to win with the limited freedom he has.

I wonder if it means that Voldemort is bound by the same prophecy and never had a hope of not being a dark lord in the first place?
