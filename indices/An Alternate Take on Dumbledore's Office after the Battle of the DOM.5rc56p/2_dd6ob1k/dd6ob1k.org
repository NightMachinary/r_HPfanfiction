I like this. I'd be interested to see it extended. I never even thought of the "Protection of Blood" possibly repelling Dumbledore and other good characters. My one caveat is that canon Dumbledore figured out Tom was dark and dangerous after the Chamber incident, unless you deliberately changed that.
