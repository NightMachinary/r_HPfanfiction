I like the idea, but your dialogue and general grammar is a little wooly. If you get a beta/proof-reader on board, this has the makings of a particularly great mentor-Dumbledore super-Harry fic...which happens to be one of my favourites. So if you have the ideas to flesh it out, I'd say go all for it!
