[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663][Blackpool]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13719279][Still Life with Skull]], and a few others of TheDivineComedian's works have a similar sense of unreality that Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus has.

Idk if you've read any of The_Carnivorous_Muffin's other fics, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675435][October]], while more serious, has a lot of the same elements.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6997183][the train station]] by dirgewithoutmusic is about Ginny and is similar in that it is very surreal.
