The worst part about the canon Gamp Laws is that the fanfiction trope of "getting a massive power-up from reading a book on household charms" is now literally true.

Any witch or wizard who memorized some basic householdy/survival charms and transfigurations becomes a hundred times more competent, more dangerous, and more difficult to track down or control. Even if you only know how to turn rocks into potatoes and how to summon chicken gravy with your wand, that's still enough.
