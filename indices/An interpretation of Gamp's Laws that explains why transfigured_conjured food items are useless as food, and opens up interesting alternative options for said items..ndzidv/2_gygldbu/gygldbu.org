Gamp's Law doesn't say it's impossible to "transfigure" food. Gamp's Law says you cannot create "good food" out of "nothing."

We can't have a discussion about the laws until you at least get the laws right.

Here's what you can't do:

- Just make food out of nothing. Conjure food. You can't wave your wand and make a loaf of bread.

Here's what you CAN do:

- You can transform things into edible food. I.e. turn a stone into a loaf of bread via transfiguration.
- You can summon or call food to you if you know where some is located.
- You can duplicate food if you already have some. Anyone who knows the Doubling Charm/Gemini Charm can turn one piece of cooked fish into two pieces of cooked fish, or one cup of milk into two cups of milk.

For reasons that are not explained, certain substances are explicitly excepted from the making food out of nothing rule. Here are exceptions to the rule of what you can't do:

- Water: you can conjure an infinite amount of fresh, clean, potable water.
- Alcohol: wine and various other alcoholic beverages can be produced in much the same way water can be.
- Gravies and sauces: for some reason you can make sauces and gravies out of nothing.

There are some questions we don't have answers to. This is a brief list:

- We don't know if you can conjure the substances to create food, such as flour and salt and yeast, and then make it yourself.
- We don't know if conjured animals can be killed, cleaned, and used for food.

The limitation seems to be that you cannot create "good food," or to put it another way, a real substantial meal, out of nothing. You can use magic to create beverages and even trimmings, you can transform other objects and substances into good food, and if you have a small amount of food you have an effectively infinite amount if you know how to double it. But you cannot simply make good/edible food out of nothing. You must have something to start with.

This is, for the record, yet */another/* reason that Deathly Hallows is an awful trainwreck that honestly shouldn't even be considered canon. Rowling introduced these rules and explained how they work in DH, and then elaborated on them some more afterwards in Pottermore. And yet, according to these rules, the only reason Harry, Ron, and Hermione were starving while on the road is because they were all incompetents. One single edible berry or a single sandwich can become infinite berries and infinite sandwiches with a single charm. Likewise, you can literally pick pebbles up off the ground and turn them into loaves of bread or transform sticks into roast chickens if you know the spell to do so. Even if Hermione was the only one who could cast the Gemini Charm, or who would know these transfigurations, she's the only one who needs to. It only takes one person to know how to do this, and they could take care of a huge group of other people.

So the conflict that existed during the camping in the woods segments of DH was only a problem because they were stupid. Harry or Hermione could have, if all else failed, stolen or purchased a very small amount of non-perishable food from somewhere in the muggle world, like an energy bar, then duplicated it out over and over again. Boring, but practical and perfectly serviceable. Problem solved. They now have infinite food and infinite clean water.

Do keep in mind, these are Rowling's rules. She made them up, so she could have made them be anything she wanted them to be. She's actively choosing to joss her own plots and make her characters look like idiots.
