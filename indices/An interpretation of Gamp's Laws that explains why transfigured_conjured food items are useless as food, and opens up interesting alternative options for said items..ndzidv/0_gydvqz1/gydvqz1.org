My interpretation is that conjured foods don't have the essential amino acids, vitamins, or calories necessary to be considered nourishing.

Kind of like the unreleased Mythbusters experiment where they tested whether cereal was as nourishing as the cardboard it came in.

They used lab mice for it and they started with many mice. They compressed the cardboard into food pellets to feed the mice, left for the weekend, and came back to several mice skeletons and one fat mouse.
