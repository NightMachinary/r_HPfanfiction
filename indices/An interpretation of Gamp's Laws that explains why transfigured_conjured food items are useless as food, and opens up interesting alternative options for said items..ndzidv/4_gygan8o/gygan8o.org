I like the idea of it being about durability. It's a good spin on the old 'permanent-impermanent' limitation dispute.

I always went with 'Transfiguration is Magical Change, and Magic overwrites Mundane always.'

Thus, a transfigured wooden plank can be burned with incendio, but not with matches.

This would mean that magical food could be magically digested, but not mundanely. So, a magical creature with 'magic stomach acid' might be able to digest transfigured food, but a human with 'mundane stomach acid' would not.
