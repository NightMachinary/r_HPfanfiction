I headcanon it as no transfiguration is permanent. How much magic you put in determines the extent of the change and the duration, but ultimately it is still the original object under the magic.

An object transfigured into food may look and taste like it, if you are good enough, but you can't pull the calories out of thin air, because that would be creating energy.
