No, I just now defined food as something else. I defined food as something you can eat right away, a ready-made dish. You asked how a bird could not be food -- that is how.

Beyond semantics, I think this is a fair definition too, since in everyday life we don't call birds "food" but birds. When I buy food, I buy things like steaks or bread. Not a live pig or bird. And given the conceptual way HP magic works, and /in particular/ Hermione's full quote (can't conjure *good* food), I personally also think it's the better and more fitting definition, but again, YMMV.
