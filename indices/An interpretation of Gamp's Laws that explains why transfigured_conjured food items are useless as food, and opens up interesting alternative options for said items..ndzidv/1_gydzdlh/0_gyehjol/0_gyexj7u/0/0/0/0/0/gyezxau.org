Okay, it's a fair way to interpret it.

I do still think that the trio were being really dumb to not summon birds and other animals (I imagine that it's not only birds and snakes they can summon) and cook something with that. Or use a summoning charm and summon fish from the lake (something they see dean and ted do).
