I guess yeah, but I'd rather eat poorly cooked fish and birds then poorly cooked plants and fungi which seems to be their primary source of sustenance.

The thing that annoys me the most is that one time it says they steal eggs and bread, and was able to have a nice meal and I simply just do not understand why they didn't just keep a little bit of that and just make more of it when they needed it. I understand eating the same thing constantly can be bland, but int heir situations...
