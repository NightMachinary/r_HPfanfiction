To be honest, when I first read it, and still when I do now, my takeaway was that they are just terrible cooks.

Don't forget, they /did/ catch fish. I love eating fish, it can taste great, with almost nothing else to go with it. And yet, they still produced only food they hated. Why was that? I can only conclude none of them can cook (and isn't /that/ the most funny inversion of the "Harry loves cooking"-trope I've encountered).

But if that is so, then all the conjured, summoned, or otherwise magically acquired fish (or even worse, other animals -- fish is /easy/ to prepare) wouldn't help -- because they're still terrible cooks XD

And Gamp then prevents them from magically whipping up a three star meal.
