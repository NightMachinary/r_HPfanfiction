Eh, don't take it as me defending DH. I think it had the dumbest plot decisions in the series. I can think of a dozen ways to improve their time on the run, and regularly getting food from Muggles (stolen, bought, or -- revolutionary concept, you three -- canned, as in, "provisions", like what any reasonable person does when outdoors ...) is just the start. With how broken the Fidelius in DH is, they probably wouldn't even have needed to go camping in the first place, just pick an empty Muggle home in central England, and apparate wherever you need to.

Just the Gamp bit, that's not my problem.
