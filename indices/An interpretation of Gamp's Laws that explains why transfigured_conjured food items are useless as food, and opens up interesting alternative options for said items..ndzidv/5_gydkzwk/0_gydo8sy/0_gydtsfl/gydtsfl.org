As I don't remember the full story, I would guess it was all part of some plan. There have been plenty of stories where Harry comes to some accomodation with the Dursleys and this was probably part of it. All I can tell you is that it fit the story--proper set up and explanation for the plot.

Ok, checked with my husband. It was a story he had read, although he can't remember which one. Dobby was there, helping Harry (so he may have been doing the Transfiguration), and part of it was possibly to show magic has its plusses. But one or the other was changing the salads into pizza and pub food for Dudley and Vernon, while slipping Petunia her favorite dishes (french radishes and crostini, for example). According to him, she was the only one acknowledging Dobby; the others didn't want to see any active magic or magical beings. My husband does not remember any more than that.
