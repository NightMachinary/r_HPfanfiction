Getting what someone thinks is the truth is still incredibly valuable.

I'm assuming the memory charm can be detected and (in minor cases) undone. If so, then Veritassium should be the standard for all trials.

You first make sure no one's under a memory charm. If they are try and break it (unless it would harm them). Then you have multiple people give Veritasium testimony. If their stories don't match up then there might be something going on. Either way, you combine Veritassium with other corroborating evidence to make a case.

With a case as high profiles as Sirius Blacks, it should have triggered major alarm bells why James Potter's ex-best friend considered it the truth that (1) Peter Pettigrew was alive and an animagus and (2) Peter pettigrew was the rea secret keeper.
