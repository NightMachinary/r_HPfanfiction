Well, /some/ dodging ability is canon as there are scenes in the books where spells are avoided by moving. That said, in those scenes the characters didn't as much “dodge” as “moved all over the place”, which can interfere with casting accuracy even if we assume that spells are hit-scan because it's a tad hard to hit something moving erratically.

But some people don't pay attention to the details, and so “spells were dodged” and thus “dodging is uber-awesome protection technique”. It doesn't help that enough people's main exposure to the series are the movies and those don't do justice to a lot of stuff, including mechanics of how magic works. And, on the topic of movies, heroes dodge automatic weapon fire in action flicks via dodging so ... yeah, it may be a bit of a stretch but I say it is likely enough for people who've seen the movies but not the books to have watched action flicks and internalised that kind of nonsense.

Dodging is good for disturbing your opponent's aim, but in that case your dodging would have to consist of moving all over the place like a deranged squirrel. Just moving your body a feet or so and dodging a spell in a ballerina whirl does not constitute adequate dodging when it comes to spellfire, unless your opponent simply does not expect you to move at all and does not really pay attention to you and you move much more than that foot in the time it takes them to cast the spell and then notice you are a few metres away from where they are aiming (which takes us back to the deranged squirrel thing).
