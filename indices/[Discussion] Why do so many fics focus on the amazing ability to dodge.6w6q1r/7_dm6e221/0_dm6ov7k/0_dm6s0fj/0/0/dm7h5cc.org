And yet, throwing yourself to the ground is not exactly what I'd call a standard-issue dodge. It's not a smooth dance-like movement that oh-so-many-people think is tantamount to dodging and oh-so-many-writers write as dodging when it comes to fights with spells. It is an abrupt move that changed quite significantly where he was, and it is executed basically at the same time that the spell is cast.

There is nothing whatsoever in this bit that proves that “dodging”, as interpreted by the person who'd asked the question in the post we are commenting on, is involved here, nor that is works. Throwing yourself to the side or to the ground or behind something while the spell is being cast, sure, but not slightly moving once the spell has already been cast, no.
