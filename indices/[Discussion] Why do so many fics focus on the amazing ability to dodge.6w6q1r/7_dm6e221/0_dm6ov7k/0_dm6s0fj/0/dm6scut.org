From the duel in the graveyard (Goblet of Fire):

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort raised his wand, but this time, Harry was ready; with the reflexes born of his Quidditch training, he flung himself sideways onto the ground; he rolled behind the marble headstone of Voldemort's father, and he heard it crack as the curse missed him.

So, canon says that moving will work, even against Voldemort.
