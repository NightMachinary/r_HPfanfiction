That is your opinion. We actually don't know whether the spells are projectiles that move at some speed or if they are basically hit-scan, nor do we know if aiming the spell requires the wizard/witch to angle the wand exactly where the target is/would be or if “more or less the right direction” is enough. And I will point out that, outside of what the movies did, we never got proof of either of those being correct or incorrect, but we also never got to see anyone use normal -issue dodging as a viable duelling technique which could be taken as somewhat telling.

Since I wrote that comment with the assumption that spells indeed are hit-scan, which I noted in the comment itself, and your reply seems to assume it not being hit-scan, I don't think there's any point in this because operating on completely different assumptions tends to make any attempts at discussing the details useless. And if you have grievances with the assumption that spells are hit-scan then take it to Taure, he is the original proponent.

PS. No, I am not trying to be hostile. But I really don't want to waste time on a useless back-and-forth which could happen if we tried to discuss this when our fundamental assumptions are different.
