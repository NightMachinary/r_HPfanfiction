I am not saying that Harry is good at hand to hand combat, I am saying that he got beat up enough so that he learned to dodge the hard way. And I am not saying that the purebloods are fat, I am saying that they are lazy and fling curses around like they are going out of fashion and don't move much while doing so because they expect that the first volley of lethal curses takes down the opposition.
