Well I can't fault you on the laser analogy, but there's a few discrepancies on speed in the books, the stunning spell must move relatively quickly as Professor McGonagall didn't have time to react during the astronomy exam in OotP.

I would agree with the idea of a lot of purebloods being lazy about physical exercise, but I'd also like to point out that the only overweight wizard we really get told about in the books is Professor Slughorn. It's a bit of an assumption but I'd imagine there's some small magical health benefits that might prevent weight gain. In any case we can't really say that purebloods are hugely unhealthy or not, as there are several sports in the wizarding world, and the books don't really imply that they are.

Also I'm not too sure about hand to hand fighting in regards to Harry. In the Philsophers Stone it's said that Harry mostly manages to run away from Dudley, so I'd agree with the agile part, but in all likelihood he probably got punched in the nose a few times. Doubtful that he'd be great in close combat. And I don't think he's severely malnourished? (Don't know whether that's canon confirmed off the top of my head) But if he was malnourished he definitely wouldn't have the strength required to really do anything to a large, fully developed adult.

I can definitely understand your points though, and I've read plenty of fics that try to make use of the same ideas drawing from Harry's upbringing. In all seriousness Harry's an average wizard who might be able to hold his own against some of the weaker death eaters for sure.
