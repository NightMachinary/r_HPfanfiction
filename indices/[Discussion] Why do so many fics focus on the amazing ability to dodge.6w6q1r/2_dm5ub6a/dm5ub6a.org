Because most people imagine spells (visually) as jets of light which move slow enough to be seen (like the "Laser" shots in any SiFi movie). Spells need to be aimed (otherwise you could point your wand in the air and still curse someone in front of you). Therefore they are a relatively slow moving projectile that can be dodged.

Now from what we know of the magical world, the pureblood elite does not sound like people who have ever done a day of physical labour in their lives (with the exception of McNair). They are lazy and probably use the "brute force" approach to defeat their opponent, relying heavily on the offence.

Meanwhile, Harry has years of experience with hand to hand fighting (being on the receiving end) and dodging thanks to his cousin and Harry hunting. The conclusion is that Harry plays to his strength and uses his mobility and small size (years of malnutrition do that to somebody) to get into an advantageous position to win because he has no hope of winning a head-on duel against people who have been practicing the dark arts for longer than he lived or are at least proficient at killing. Unless you want to make Harry overpowered or stab people from behind his invisibility cloak there are few options how an author can make Harry strong enough to win. These tactics might not work against people like Bellatrix Lestrange but are enough for your average Death Eater.
