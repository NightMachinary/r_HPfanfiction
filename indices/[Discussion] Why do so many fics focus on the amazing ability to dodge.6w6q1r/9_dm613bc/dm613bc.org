It's mostly an efficiency thing. You can take the time to cast a shield spell, or you can take a step to the side and cast a stunner instead. You can put up a shield that might not work against a strong curse, or you can take a step to the side and cast a stunner instead. Then there's the Killing curse which necessitates dodging or blocking it with a solid object, and guess what blocking it with a solid object entails? You got it, casting a spell. Much easier to take a step to the side.

Of course, people take this out of proportion. It's simply one asset among many in a wizard's arsenal. There will be times when you don't have room to move, or get grounded to a single spot by an opponent's spell. There are also spells which can be animated to seek you out, I'm sure. There are dozens of things which can counter simple dodging, but simple dodging can counter dozens of things, so it evens out.

There's also the idea that, if spells really are as fast as they are in the movies, your bodily reflexes can be just as fast as putting up a shield spell. It really depends on the wizard. Younger wizards would not have the knowledge and experience to make a shield spell viable in a high pressure combat scenario. Much MUCH easier to just train them to keep moving instead, until they've learned to cast a shield charm without having to think about it.

EDIT: One thing that just struck me about HP magic is that the combat magic that is shown in detail to the readers is very... Stilted. Point and shoot. It's single target impact spells. Making spells work together is a big deal, and making more spells work together is a bigger deal. The hallmark of a master is being able to do more with a single spell, so young wizards can only really use one spell at a time, much like revolver will only fire one bullet. Because of this it is very easy for curse heavy duels to turn into Wild West shootouts.
