I would've thought so for the shielding idea. You see that a lot in the movies as well, almost every time a spell is blocked you see them throw out a shield. I'm pretty sure Harry dodges the killing curse in the graveyard against Voldemort in the books right? So I guess it's definitely doable, at least with some spells.
