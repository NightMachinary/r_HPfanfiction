Yeah, he dodges it by diving behind a tombstone. You could also throw up stuff in front of you to intercept killing curses, but I feel like that kind of accuracy would be tougher to do than to simply dive out of the way.

I've always assumed some spells were faster than others. Some are colored differently, some have no color, some are faster, some slower, maybe some zigzag to confuse the enemy. I dunno, I just like to think there's all kinds of ways spells act.
