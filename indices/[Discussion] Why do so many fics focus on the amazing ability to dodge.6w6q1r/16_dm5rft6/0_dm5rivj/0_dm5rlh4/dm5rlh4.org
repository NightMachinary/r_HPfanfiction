That's probably why people say dodging is important, because they make up their own spell speeds and all that. I'd say learning to dodge is important, if only to be ready to dodge any possible unforgivables. But seeing as there's no magical cores or exhaustion in canon, throwing up a shield should honestly be much easier. It would just a flick of the wrist, wouldn't it?
