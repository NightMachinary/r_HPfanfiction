I think it was 20 feet for Neville, which emphasizes the whole wizards being sturdier than muggles concept (I think you're right, that is canon). However with the Beaters, I'd imagine either the bats or the bludger, or both, are enchanted in some manner to be more durable.

I have no idea if magic could boost a wizards reflexes, and I don't think the books make any mention to it, but I agree that it would be quite plausible, especially if there was a spell for it.

Maybe its to do with the witch or wizards knowledge and magical skill, as you say Dumbledore might support himself consciously or unconsciously with magic to help him out in a fight - we just don't know.

I think a lot of the problem has to lie within the definition of magical skill and power. If you're highly proficient at a shield charm, enough to bring one up and deflect major hexes and curses, then there isn't much need at all to dodge, but rather come up with clever ways to slip past your opponents defense. As far as we can tell from the books, familiarity with a spell makes it stronger overtime, as showcased by Harry's protego which is canonically shown to improve. The fact of the matter is we haven't really got enough information to ascertain what the best dueling methodology really is.
