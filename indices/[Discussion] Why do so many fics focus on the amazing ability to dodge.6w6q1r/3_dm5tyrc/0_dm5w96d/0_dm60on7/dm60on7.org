  I think a lot of the problem has to lie within the definition of magical skill and power. If you're highly proficient at a shield charm, enough to bring one up and deflect major hexes and curses, then there isn't much need at all to dodge, but rather come up with clever ways to slip past your opponents defense. As far as we can tell from the books, familiarity with a spell makes it stronger overtime, as showcased by Harry's protego which is canonically shown to improve.

Yes. Dodging seems to be more a beginner's thing while a skilled duelist has better options.
