I always thought that magic was all encompassing. You ask yourself what that has to do with anything?

If magic is all encompassing, then it empowers movement as well as everything else. this is proven in canon actually. A fall from 10 feet up as a slightly overweight 11 year old, would do more than break a wrist. A bludger, an iron ball moving at high speed, would SHATTER a bat, and the arm that tryed to hit it, and should kill those who it hits. Yet, we do not see it.

I mention this because in the comments below we are seeing human physiology being used to dictate if it is possible to move out of the way. While for a normal human, thats up in the air, we have many instances of humans dodging paintballs and such. I doubt a spell is moving as fast as a bullet, except maybe the messager patronus.

But that is moot. It doesn't matter if a human can, because we dont know if magic impacts human physiology when it moves. If magic boosts reflexes? Dodging suddenly makes so much more sense. If it has no impact I agree with the OP.

The thing is, canon is so contradictory here. We have Dumbledore, a person who openingly admits to being slower than he used to be, but pulling off moves that shouldn't be possible for a person in their prime. Not to mention we KNOW that magic helps sustain a human being because Dumbledore is over 100 years old. In fact he is over 110, and is capable of easily moving around a stone castle.

There is also the fact that Dodging is EASILY taught. Reflexes are trainable. In fact, in the israel millitary, they are trained to improve reflexes. Sports do it all the time. If we humans can do it, so can witches and wizards. If that result is magnified by magical power, then dodging just became a revolutionary concept.

There is also the dueling culture we see a glimpse of in the Chamber of Secrets book. It seems fairly stationary, and even the "duel" between Dumbledore and Voldemort supports this. It was fairly stationary, with movement only to the sides, and rarely into the others personal space. If we take that as an aspect of ALL duels, learning to move is vital to survival.
