I must admit I've never been in military service so I couldn't comment on that, it's just that we have some canon examples such as the Dumbledore and Voldemort duel where there's zero evidence of the conventional duels we see. I was mostly curious as the books show dodging as more of a rarity than the norm that FanFiction purports to be.
