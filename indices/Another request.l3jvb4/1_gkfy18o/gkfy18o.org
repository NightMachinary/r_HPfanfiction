Well, apparently I'm just recommending this fic all over the place today, but if you want a War Mage Harry fic, you've got to read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7888873/chapters/18019618?view_adult=true][The Mirror of Maybe by MidnightBlue]]. It's an abandoned WIP, which was started in 2002. It's the fic that hooked me on fanfic.
