I think we can all agree that JK Rowling hadn't thought through some of her ideas. And that's fine. Harry trusting Hagrid, Molly Weasley are acceptable if only because that was a story book for children and Harry is also young with an absurd good streak. Some of the other things are indeed ridiculous wizards game world ideas: forbidden forest, Filch being the caretaker, and many other things not in that link like the third floor corridor, half the teachers being unqualified, lack of syllabus, lack of support structure including counselling, the clearly corrupt government, the discrimination against many citizens and beings. I will say that I did shake my head and disagree with the link in many cases. The one that stuck out for me was the time turner. It doesn't rewrite history. History still moves forward. So if Lily and James Potter are seen dead, it means regardless what you do with a time turner at some point in the recent past, Lily and James Potter will die. This is carefully crafted in book 3 by JK Rowling making sure no one sees Buckbeak die allowing for him to have NOT died when they go back in time. Similarly, Harry saw an amazing patronus and knew that when he goes back in time it will be there at the same time. He doesn't realise that it is his until he is forced by reality to cast one himself.
