Ok, so this illusion stuff had crossed my mind as well. You're absolutely right in thinking that time turner magic should be based on the concept that facts stay facts, so events occur in the same way in every viewing of the event. This can be therefore, fooled by illusion magic and the fact that what we see may not be fact. At the same time, time turners are rare and so people like Sirius or Hagrid showing up at Godric's Hollow may have used credible magical means to confirm identity and life status before realising that not knowing allows Dumbledore to fix things in a certain way. I wonder if the Fidelius would have messed with that though. But realistically, this is JK Rowling we're thinking of here and she would have never looked this many levels deep.
