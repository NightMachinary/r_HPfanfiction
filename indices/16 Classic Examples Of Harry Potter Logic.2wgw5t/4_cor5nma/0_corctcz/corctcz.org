I think that the time turner complaint is still valid, James Potter's body could be a fake. Lily has to die because we already know that Harry survived. History keeps on moving forward but that doesn't mean that things are as they seem. Dumbledore could have, say, gone back and stunned James and created an illusion of him to fight Voldemort. Really, it all depends on how effective conjuration and illusion magic is. Is it realistic enough to fool somebody into thinking it was real. Yes, I do put too much thought into these things.
