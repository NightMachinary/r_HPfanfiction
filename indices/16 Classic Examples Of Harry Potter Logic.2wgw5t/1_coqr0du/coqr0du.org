I feel the need to challenge some of these.

1.  Eyes are infinitely more complex than bones, so of course it will be more difficult to fix them.

2.  Fair enough.

3.  Enforcing it in any school, especially one the size of Hogwarts would be impractical.

4.  THAT'S NOT HOW TIME TURNERS WORK! FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, THEY'D NEED TO HAVE SURVIVED THE FIRST TIME.

5.  ...

6.  See 4.

7.  When the big man does magic, and the story is confirmed by your Aunt and Uncle, it is legit.

8.  He saw others do it.

9.  The magical world is rather small, so there won't be that many red-haired families.

10. Fair enough.

11. Fair enough.

12. Fair enough.

13. Does Filch really clean the whole castle? /Really?/ I would prefer to think that the castle is mainly self cleaning, with Filch performing maintenance.

14. Ever heard of blood protections?

15. He's a show off, sue him.

16. Permanent sticking charm, b*tch.
