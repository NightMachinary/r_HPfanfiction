I don't have an english version of book three (only 1,2,4,5), but my translation basically says "they heard bunch of murmured male voices, then silence and suddenly the unmistakable whirr and muffled impact of an axe". And on "run two" the executioner indeed hits the fence. Although I actually think that sound wise, the movies pumpkins make a bit more sense!
