Eh, the whole "give Harry tons of points" thing is ok for me. In the first book, he does manage to confront Voldemort, and he does protect the stone. Granted, he wouldn't have had to if he hadn't gone. In the second book, both he and Ron did go after Ginny in the Chamber of Secrets. Harry fights off a basilisk (which had been threatening the entire school) and unknowingly destroys a horcrux. Not to mention you could counter argue with Snape. "Huh, Potter is alive. Better take 10 points from Gryffindor."
