And then Draco wouldn't have been caught, and Slytherin would still have won. Also, Harry using the cloak (and later the map too) to completely disregard rules goes largely unpunished. I think that Slytherin got shafted and that it was a very damaging thing.

In essence, the point change at the end of the first year sends the message that school rules mean little, and a house-wide effort means nothing compared to a single person willing to throw his house under the bus for his own agendas. Slytherin, who for the past few years were a well-oiled house cup winning machine, suddenly see that Gryffindor is rewarded for Harry Potter, a first year, doing something exceptional (youngest seeker instead of any punishment, house cup instead of punishment). Anyone with any ambition would say "screw the house effort as it means nothing, I want that kind of glory".

I don't disagree with the fact that rules can and should be broken if it means doing something great for everyone. I do disagree with that being the academic standard as set by a headmaster, especially with regard to 11-12 year olds.
