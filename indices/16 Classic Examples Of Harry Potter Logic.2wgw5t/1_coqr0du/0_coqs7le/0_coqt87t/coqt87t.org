I get that Harry deserves recognition for what he did, but throwing away an entire house's work for the full year just because one person did something amazing doesn't seem really fair. Harry probably should've gotten special services to the school or something, because the entire Slytherin house shouldn't have been punished just because Harry managed to save the stone.
