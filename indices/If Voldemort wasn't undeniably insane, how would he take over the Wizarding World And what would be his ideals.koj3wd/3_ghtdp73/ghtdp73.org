Yet again I must recommend linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) :). The original divergence point is that Riddle created a political party and launched a campaign instead of making Horcruxes and launching a war.

As a result, the whole political and social landscape is altered. More people are alive and have had children, including Harry's parents and all the Marauders. But blood discrimination is legally enforced; Harry, as a half-blood, isn't eligible for Hogwarts, and non-Purebloods are unable to work in government or publicly listed companies. And Riddle isn't finished there...

It incorporates some canon elements, and does it well, but it's really a whole new storyline of its own. Riddle is working to discredit Dumbledore in order to pass more legislation, this time restricting halfblood marriages so he can control the next generation (and it turns out that he actually has partially sympathetic motivations for doing that).
