linkffn(Renegade) has this BUT it's abandoned and the story is non-linear, so you only find the redemption arc at like the last two chapters. He initially makes friends with Ron, Hermione and Neville because he thinks they'd be valuable followers, so he blatantly manipulates them, only to realise that he came to care for and even love them.
