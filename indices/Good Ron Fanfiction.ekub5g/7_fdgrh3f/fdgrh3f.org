Have read The Red Knight, The Chessmaster Series and I read Fate like a couple of months ago, but thought it was abandoned- will retry. The Granger principle and How Ron Weasley Saved the Chudley Cannons sound interesting. I do especially hope the author of Mummy's Gone Crazy continues. It's got an interesting premise, though it needs A LOT of improvement. Thx everyone.
