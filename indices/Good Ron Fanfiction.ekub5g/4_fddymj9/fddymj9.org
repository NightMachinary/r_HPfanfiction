Ok, so. Here's the deal, you guys. Listen, you guys. No seriously, listen! BASICALLY. This is what's up, you guys. OK, I'm going to stop now, but that WAS funny.

I found a pretty good Ron fic, recent too. It def needs to be longer and they use and too much, but its got an interesting premise. I would personally rate it a 6/10 for execution and 8/10 for plot. Here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13471827/1/THE-CHESSMASTER-Mummy-s-Gone-Crazy]]

It's pretty good.

AND on a different not, I'm in dire need of a beta for a new story... HELPP
