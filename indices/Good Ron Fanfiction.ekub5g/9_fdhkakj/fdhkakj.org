Always on the lookout for good Ron fic, simply because I'm so damn tired of Ron!Bashing, moreso than others.\\
I found Ron/Daphne interesting when I read a bit of Red Dragon (i think?), will have to get back into that and find more of those.\\
Another one I was reminded of is an ensemble piece, but its highly political with a Slytherin Ron (actually, all three of them are Slytherin), and as time goes on, Ron'll have some hefty House/Wizengamot responsibilities (do we have spoiler tags? i can never remember). The Chessmaster series, currently updated through fourth year. linkao3(11543934)
