I think you're going a bit off here. I don't much care about how scientists consider mathematics, I care about what mathematicians say about maths. What you describe mathematics as is roughly nominalism, which is only one view about the nature of numbers and other mathematical objects. Funnily, it's slightly less popular a view than mathematical Platonism, in which mathematical objects are not mere abstractions, they are bona fide objects, abstract ones yes but not merely a way to describe things. So I don't think your analogy holds up.

Intent doesn't make it subjective. Intent merely means how one wants it to work will have an influence on how the magic works. As an extreme example, we are outright told by Bellatrix that Unforgivables require specifically ill intent ("you have to mean it Potter!"), and that the Killing Curse in particular needs one to have strong enough magic to put into the curse. In other words, intent could arguably play a significant role in allowing, say, the wand to grasp how you want the spell to be used, since they're somewhat sentient.
