  I can't imagine (yeah, argument from ignorance) any way in which the property of "brokenness" could be determined without sentience and even omniscience

Now we cross over from philosophy of mathematics into philosophy of biology. Again, this is not a problem unique the magic.

There are numerous analyses of the status of "function" and accordingly "malfunction" (analogous to "broken"). We want to be able to say that the function of the heart is to pump blood, and a heart which does not pump blood is malfunctioning. However it is difficult to find an epistemological basis for these ideas with reference solely to the natural world and not to human perspective. Difficult, but not impossible.

One example is systems analysis. The heart is part of a system and the function is what it contributes to the system. This still struggles with a few things, such as what defined the correct functioning of the system as a whole? Reference to the human normal? That doesn't seem right, because if some virus created heart problems in over half of the human population, then the malfunction would become "normal" and therefore, according to this analysis, would in fact be the function of the system. That's not very satisfactory. Nonetheless it's one approach.

Another example is evolutionary analysis. The function is the evolutionary advantage which the thing bestows on the organism. That also has problems, however, because evolution is not a linear narrative towards a goal. Frequently a mutation will be co-opted for a different "purpose", such as feathers initially evolving due to their providing insulation but later enabling flight. We want to say the (or a) purpose of feathers is to help birds fly, because that is their present purpose - what they contribute to the system - but it is not what they evolved to do. So again, not very satisfactory.

The important thing here is that our failure to provide a satisfactory analysis does not displace our strong intuition that it is correct and valuable to say that the function of the heart is to pump blood, and that this is true independent of human understanding of biology.

Anyway, moving away from that tangent, the point I am trying to make here is that even in the Muggle world there is some sense to be had of the idea of "malfunction" being a true fact of the world, independent of thinkers who define the function according to their subjective intent.

In the magical world, where things like secrets and job positions are real objects upon which magic can be cast, surely this holds all the more strongly.

Magic does not need a mind to register that an object can have a function/purpose, or numerous functions, or a "correct" form. Accordingly neither does it need a mind to recognize that a thing is failing in its function.

A further solution to this problem is that of Platonic ideals, which is less credible IRL these days but I think fits quite well with the HP magic system. Each type of object essentially has a correct form which exists abstractly, and all objects in the real world of that object type are merely (flawed) derivations of the ideal. the reparo spell therefore moves an object closer to what is its magically recognised ideal form. A book with a cover loosely attached is not the ideal book, so the reparo spell attaches the cover to the book to move it closer to the ideal of a book.

This is my preferred analysis of Transfiguration, so I like it less for the Reparo Charm since that is supposed to be a Charm not Transfiguration.

Anyway, just because a concept has its origin in a mind, or a group of minds (i.e. a societal convention such as "a job"), it does not mean that magic itself needs a mind in turn to treat that concept as real. Nor does it mean that literally every thought you have will "make it" as a magical concept. If that were true then you could use Reparo as a "turn any object into any other object" spell simply by changing your intent with respect to what object you think it /should/ be. No, the spell must have objective limits which have been explored by wizards and written down in the form of magical theory. My suggestion is that those limits take the form of a definition of what an object is and a definition of "broken".

To be honest, I feel like your problem is less with the HP magic system and more with all non-physicalist understandings of the world and what is "real".
