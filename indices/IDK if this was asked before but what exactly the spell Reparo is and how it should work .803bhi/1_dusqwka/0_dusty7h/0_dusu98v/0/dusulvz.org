  It's not sentience, it's simply that human concepts are part of the objective world.

The debate about numbers is an interesting point to bring up, but I think it would take way too much time to discuss it in full. Suffice it to say I don't believe that it is a complex concept or that it is a "human concept".

Whether something is "broken" or not simply has no - even tangentially - objective basis. It's entirely dependent on context and purpose. The same object can be "broken" in one situation while being the perfect tool for the job in another. If I rip a piece of paper in half because I need two pieces of paper, it is not broken. If I do it by accident it may be broken... I may also realize that the two pieces are more useful to me (happy accident) and suddenly it's fine again. Maybe this is a too simple example, but I leave it to you as an exercise to come up with more. Is a piece of tape broken after I rip it off the tape-roll? Or is it only broken if I accidentally ripped off too much or at a bad angle? After deleting Windows and installing Gentoo Linux on my Laptop it is now broken (of no use) for the vast majority of people, but much more useful to me. In fact, I'd consider it broken if it suddenly booted up to Windows.

I can't imagine (yeah, argument from ignorance) any way in which the property of "brokenness" could be determined without sentience and even omniscience. You'd have to look into people's heads to know what they want... and sometimes they won't even know what's best: [I know reparo doesn't apply to medicine [[why?]]; I can't come up with a better example though] A medieval man might cast reparo at 'fever' not realizing that it is actually helpful to the body.
