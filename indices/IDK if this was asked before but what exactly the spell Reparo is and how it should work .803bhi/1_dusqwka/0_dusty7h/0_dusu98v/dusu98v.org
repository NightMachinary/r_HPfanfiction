It's not sentience, it's simply that human concepts are part of the objective world. This is a fairly standard part of pre-modern understanding of the universe (consider Platonic dialogues which attempt to establish the "true" meaning of a concept like justice, which is considered to be an existing but intangible ideal). Indeed this type of thinking still survives in certain areas, such as how most scientists consider mathematics. Consider numbers - they are a second-order abstraction created by humans. By second order I mean that the numbers themselves do not exist. You will never find the number 1 in the world, floating out behind Jupiter. Rather it is an abstract structural concept which we have created to describe things. Nonetheless many (maybe even most) people consider numbers to be real.

In short, the idea that the real is not limited to the physical is not something which is only relates to magic. It's also a fairly common way of thinking about things in real life. This does not require that the universe itself has sentience/a mind.

The problem with using intent is that the HP magic system frequently goes against this idea. If you mispronounce an incantation, you get the wrong effect regardless of your intent. Harry cast Sectumsempra in HBP successfully without knowing what it did. The vast majority of spells seem to require no mental performance at the time of casting. More fundamentally, the idea that intent is an important part of magic flies in the face of the whole system of Hogwarts, which is all about study of magic as an objective system that exists in the world, and where the students who understand that system best (Dumbledore, Tom Riddle, to a lesser degree Hermione, etc) are also the best at using magic in practice. An intent-based system would be far more subjective and undermines the need for study and knowledge which is constantly emphasised in canon.
