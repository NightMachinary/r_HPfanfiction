Wouldn't it be simpler to explain it by channeling the intent of the caster? That the caster considers it 'broken' and how it should be if it is 'fixed' and Magic just resolves that desire?

Giving Magic such a high degree of sentience is just weird to me. "Broken" and "forbidden" are so very different tags than "green" or "hot", they are mindbogglingly complex.
