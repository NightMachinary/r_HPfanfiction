My personal theory although it would seem weird is that it depends on the casters view of what the broken item should be. For e.g. in the fanfic, I still haven't found what I'm looking for, harry gives ashoka some parts for her to create a light saber and then realises what ashoka basically did was a reparo charm in slow motion and I know this isn't canon but In my opinion the reparo charm should world in the way that the end result is what caster believes the final product would be. For example and this is quite overly simplifies I'm given a broken pencil and then I imagine the size aka how it should look once it's repaired, so when I use the reparo charm I get that pencil but when another person comes looks at the same two broken pieces but imagines the end product to be slightly longer and then casts the reparo charm, his is a bit longer than mine. So going by that I would think that the reparo 'charm' could use a bit more magical usage as the one who visions the broken pencil pieces as longer when fixed than the first person will have to use a bit more magic for him to succeed as he is in theory basically conjuring little pieces of wood/lead. Or it could also be engorging it which would also require more a bit more magic as it's not simply repairing the pieces to be in their original but in the state the caster believes the original should be.
