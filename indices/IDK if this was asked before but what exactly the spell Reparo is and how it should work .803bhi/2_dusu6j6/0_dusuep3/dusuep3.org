AGAIN I REPEAT THIS ISNT CANON AND I AM MERELY STATING THAR I WOULD LIKE FOR THE CHARM TO WORK THIS WAY AS IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO ME----------------for example let's take a 5 year old who can somehow use a wand and cast reparo so then I take perhaps a toy the 5 year old hasn't seen before break it cast the charm hence it repairs itself but when I give the same broken pieces to the child he casts the same charm and again remember he doesn't know what the end product is so when he is casting the charm his eyes fall on two pieces which coincidentally fit together(however not how they should fit) and thus when he casts the charm those two pieces more or less make up something new.
