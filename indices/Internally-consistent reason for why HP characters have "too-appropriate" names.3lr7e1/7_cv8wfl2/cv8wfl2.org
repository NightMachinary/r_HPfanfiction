I think the most important reason is indeed that JKR loves mythology.

For the rest: the wizarding society is very old-fashioned and has hints of romanticism (large manors, realistic sculpting (fountain in the MoM atrium), the portraits are realistic as well). So ancient mythology and Roman/Greek history is very popular with witches and wizards, which is why they give their kids such names.

It's the same with names now: football is very popular, so people call their kids after famous football players.
