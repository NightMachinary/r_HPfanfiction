It's quite simple in my mind-magic. More exactly, a burst of accidental magic released by the child at the instance of birth. Being slightly atemporal and maddeningly obtuse as the existence of prophecies has shown, the burst of accidental magic released by the newborn at birth influences the parents' decision-making mechanisms when it comes to the child, specifically in the areas of naming conventions.

As a result, the naming provides hints as to their future destinies, attitudes and behaviour-Severus (latin for 'stern') Snape is a particularly apt example of this in both its latin meaning for his general attitude as a professor and head of house as well as for its close relation to the word 'sever', since his actions lead to the severing of ties with lily, severing of his loyalty to Voldemort and, ultimately, the severing of both his and Dumbledore's lives in the final books. He is distinctly unable to either make amends or reconcile his differences with people he has either offended or who ended up offending him despite his extremely well-hidden and quite possibly heavily occluded positive feelings towards said people.

Then there's Lily, whose flower can be symbolic of motherhood, though the red spider lily is commonly associated with, well, [[http://wordpress.tokyotimes.org/the-beauty-of-autumns-red-spider-lily-japans-flower-of-death/][Death with a beautiful capital D]] in Japan-all of which are aspects of her character's actions in canon. Death + Mama Bear = Voldemort goes whoosh-poof for thirteen years.

As for Draco? Dragon of Bad Faith... Yeah, kinda can see that.
