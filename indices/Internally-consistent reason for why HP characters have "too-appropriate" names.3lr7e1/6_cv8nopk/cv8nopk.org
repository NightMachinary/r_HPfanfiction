For the sake of the muggleborn or those who were given uninteresting names, there may also be a tradition of taking an 'adult' name to signal your commitment to your career (or your fate). Perhaps John Lupin renamed himself Remus to acknowledge his condition and Sheila Sinestra took the name Aurora when she became an Astronomy instructor.

There may even be some enhancement to one's spellwork in this way: by choosing to take the name Remus, he was able to gain a small measure of control over his changed state.
