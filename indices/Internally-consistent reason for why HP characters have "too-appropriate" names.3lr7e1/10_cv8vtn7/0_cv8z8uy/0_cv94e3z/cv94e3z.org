Part of that is because the Dutch commoners didn't, as a rule, have last names until the French occupation. Instead patronyms were used: Dirk the son of Jan was known as Dirk Janszoon etc..

So when forced to choose a last name by the French, most people used sensible names such as professions (Bakker -- Baker, Slager -- Butcher, etc.) or toponyms (Dijkstra - lived near a Dyke) others used joke names like "De Koning (the king)" or "Naaktgeboren (born naked).\\
Unfortanately for them and their descendants, when the French finally were kicked out... the last names stayed.
