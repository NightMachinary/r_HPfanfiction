Nominative Determinism... Like how the fastest man in the world is Usain /Bolt/, or how there's an editor on this series of The Great British Bakeoff with the surname /Egg/.

But seriously, I think the best way of looking at it is to also take into account the sheer number of names that aren't "too approiate" as well. Harry Potter, any of the Weasleys, Lavender Brown, that Patils, Rubeus Hagrid, Aberforth Dumbledore, Oliver Wood, Neville Longbottom, Peter Pettigrew... The list goes on and on.

We see more of these names that mean something than we might in real life, yes, but how many wizarding characters have boring or unrevealed names?

But to actually provide a theory, I'd like to suggest that some of them (like Sprout, for example) are names that were acquired by reputation. That is to say, Pomona Sprout's ancestors were all great at herbology so they got a plant-based name.
