Dumbledore didn't have reverence for the subject. His approach to it is described in HBP: he only gives credence to the prophecy because he knows Voldemort will, and then later on because he knows that it's in Harry's character never to rest until Voldemort is defeated.

As for Voldemort, I'm not sure that he has respect for Divination so much as a healthy level of paranoia which results in him trying to stamp out any hint of a vulnerability, no matter what the source.
