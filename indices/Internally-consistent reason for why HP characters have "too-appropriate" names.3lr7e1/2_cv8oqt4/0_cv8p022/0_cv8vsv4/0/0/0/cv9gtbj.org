I think if only people who were 'true seers' could use divinations, there wouldn't be an entire class dedicated to not just learning /about/ it, but learning /how to use/ it. Maybe true seers are the only ones who can make huge important prophesies, and everyone else can just to really simple name-prediction like stuff. And then there are people like Hermione and McGonagall who can't use it at all and are skeptic of the subject.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯ but this is all fandom speculation anyway, so your explanation could work just as well in a fic as mine. Who knows what the divination class was like before Trelawney taught it? Maybe they just learned /about/ divination and didn't try to use it. We can keep making up details to fill in the blanks that explain our theories, and that's one of the reasons why I love fanfic, because it leads to so many diverse and different ideas.
