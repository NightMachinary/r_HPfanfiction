Like you, I think that some wizards and witches just have a touch of skill in divination. They might not know it consciously, but some of them, when confronted with such an important decision, do what feels right. And what feels right is in essence creating a mild form of prophecy. It's not the full-on seer stuff, just some thing they can brush off as coincidence.

Divination isn't complete hogwash.
