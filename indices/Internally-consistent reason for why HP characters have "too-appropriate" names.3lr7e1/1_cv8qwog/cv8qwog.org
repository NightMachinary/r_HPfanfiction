I like it.

I will say though, Perenelle and Nicolas Flamel aren't JK Rowling's characters. They were real people who lived in France in the 14th century. Some 200 years after Nicolas' death in the 15th century rumours arose that he had created the Philosopher's Stone.

Also, Rowling loves alliteration: Pansy Parkinson, Padma and Parvati Patil, Peter Pettigrew, Gregory Goyle, Luna Lovegood, William Weasley, Dudley Dursley... The list can and will go on: Gellert Grindlewald, Belletrix Black, Quirinus Quirrell, Cho Chang, and /all/ of the bloody founders! It's nuts!
