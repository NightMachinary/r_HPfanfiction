I always had a minor headcanon that continuous patterns tie in to a deeper ritual in magic. Like, names are very important and influence the named's life.

And having recurring types of names in a family build on magic ... I picture some Black thousands of years ago began a ritual using the stars to strengthen the family and the family magic, and each subsequent child named a star builds on this ancient ritual. And maybe the Evans accidentally activated this ritual (which doesn't require conscious effort to begin) by naming their progeny after flora, until it culminated in the birth of a magical child in the most recent generation.

On a side note: This is why I'm always really bothered by a fem!Harry or AU!sister that doesn't have some flower name.
