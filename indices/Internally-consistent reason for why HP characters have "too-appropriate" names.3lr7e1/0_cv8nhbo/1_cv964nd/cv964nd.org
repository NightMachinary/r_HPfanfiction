This makes sense in Alexandra Quick as well, what with all the daughters of Thorn being named after ancient Roman women (and the son being named after a Byzantine emperor), as well as the middle names of the Grimm sisters being the Furies' names. Likewise, the Old Testament biblical names of all the Thorns prior to Abraham's progeny. I think thematic naming is very appropriate.

More to the point, however, is all the Weasleys being named somehow in a "royal" manner. William, Charles, Percival, Frederick, George, Ronald, and Ginevra (variant of Guinevere), as well as Arthur (obvious) and Molly (pet name for Mary).
