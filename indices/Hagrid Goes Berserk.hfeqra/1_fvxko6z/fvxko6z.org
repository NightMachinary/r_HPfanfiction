Rather reminds me of my own response to a prompt, which I was the only one to respond to.

The prompt:

#+begin_quote
  Harry is in the Chamber of Secrets and terrified as the Diary Riddle calls to the ancient Slytherin monster in Parseltongue. As he begins to run he hears a strange, eerie song of sorts. It was... a rooster, crowing. The Basilisk immediately collapses, dead.

My response:

  “Tha's for Aragog, ya right bastard!”

  Harry and Tom whirled in shock.

  There stood Rubeus Hagrid with a giant rooster in one hand, and brandishing his pink umbrella in the other.

  “How-“ said both Harry and Tom at the same time.

  “The trick is, you need ta know ‘ow ta calm ‘im. If ya can't calm ‘im,” he turned his beetle black, normally gentle eyes, but now, hard as obsidian onto the specter of Riddle, “Yeh've got to know ‘ow to kill ‘im.”
