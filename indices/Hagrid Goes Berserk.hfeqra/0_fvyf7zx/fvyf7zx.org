British Half-Giant Man Literally to Angry to Die!

------

Hagrid watched shocked as life left Harry's eyes and he fell, and the Death Eater's laughed, they /laughed/ at the boy's death, and Hagrid remembered Harry, as a baby, as scared kid that he rescued in one of his proudest moments, who risked a lot helping him with Norbert, and who kept going to his class despite him not being a good teacher(and Hagrid knew that), the boy who always defended and befriended him.

And now that monster had /killed/ Harry.

"Y'eh killed Harry" he whispered, and something raged inside, a fire he always tried to quench, but now he let it burn, and his blood sang, for, unknown to Hagrid or anyone else, he not only had simple giant blood, but Jotunn blood, blood of the smaller but magical giants that battled /gods/, and the righteous fury he felt awakened that blood boiling rage that gave pause to even deities who weren't carrying a magical hammer.

"Y'eh killed Harry." he said, louder this time, and his muscles started straining and his beady black eyes now had a red undertone while he cried, the ropes, magically summoned, started straining, whatever magic Hagrid began releasing started weaking them.

"Y'eh killed Harry!" he said much louder now, and one of his minders turned with a sneer to silence him but stopped on seeing the rage on his face and a faint red haze around him, he had no more time to think because Hagrid's bounds snapped like tissue paper and with unbelied speed the half giant wrapped his hand around the Death Eater's head and /squeezed./

"Y'EH KILLED HARRY!" the others were startled by his sudden movement and shout and came out of their celebratory haze only to be surprised by their fallen comrade and even more when the large man punched one so hard his torso exploded, and then spun, quickly disposing of the other three holding his ropes in a similar manner.

It turns out Death Eaters weren't good at close quarters.

By this time, the whole clearing reacted, Voldemort threw a Killing Curse at him, but Hagrid threw a body in it's direction before throwing another at the nearest group, which distracted them for just a moment needed for him to bellow loud enough to scare off birds and animals for miles around(while making their ears ring) before running so fast he was almost a blur of black with a red outline reaching them in the blink of an eye, swiping his arm breaking ribs and arms on impact before throwing them at the tress with such strength the bark cracked.

He heard the snake approaching, he instinctively knew not even it's venom could kill him now, but it was Riddle's snake, the damn thing jumped at him but he caught it by the throat just in time to use it's body to block yet another Killing Curse by it's master, who reacted as if struck when Nagini died, seeing his friend's killer, Hagrid's rage doubled and now his eyes shone a furious red, he squeezed the snake's neck before throwing it at it's master who barely managed to deflect it before jumping back to avoid a furious swipe, how had he moved so fast?

Hagrid was literally seeing red now, Voldemort threw more curses(for some reason avoiding the Killing one) but Hagrid either dodged them or used Death Eaters living and dead(he had killed the ones who could cast Killing Curses early and now the remaining ones' curses were just bouncing off his skin) in one moment of distraction at seeing Bellatrix being ripped in half like she was a fish caught by a bear, Voldemort stumbled, and was even more shocked when the half-giant used the opportunity and /ripped an entire/ /tree/ from the ground and swiped at him, the Elder Wand refused to cooperate and his arm began aching terribly, but all that was forgotten when the tree trunk hit him, cracking his ribs and breaking his arms and legs.

Broken, Voldemort raised his head to look at one he had dismissed as inconsequential and who had just dismantled his inner circle in matter of seconds, only one question in his mind.

"H-How?"

The large man didn't stop in his strides, and Voldemort noted the red haze around him and the way the veins in his hands where flashing red, "For Dumbledore, for Harry!"

Hagrid reached Riddle and silenced his screams by ripping his head off in a single movement. He then bellowed to the skies, with such strength the trees rustled, he barely noticed the answering thunder, or two crows congratulating crowing, because he heard a weak voice calling him.

"Hagrid?"

He turned and his heart soared at seeing his friend alive and well, if a bit pale, Harry looked around the clearing seeing the destruction and carnage, before turning to Hagrid with a smile and a raised eyebrow.

Hagrid's remaining rage dissipated and he looked a bit sheepish, looking around as if seeing the place for the first time, before he turned to Harry with a smile.

"All 'ight the're Harry?"

In the end, the power he knew not was Hagrid's friendship.
