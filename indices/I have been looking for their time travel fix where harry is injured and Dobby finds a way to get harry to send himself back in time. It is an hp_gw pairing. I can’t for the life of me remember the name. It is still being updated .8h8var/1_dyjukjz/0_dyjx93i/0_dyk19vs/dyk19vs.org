I won't lie, I don't really have an ETA at the moment - Real Life^{^{TM}} has reared its ugly head and royally messed with my free time and drive to write. I have no plans to cancel the fic or call hiatus officially, and I have the next chapter almost fully written (technically the chapter after, as I write one chapter in advance) but it still needs some work.
