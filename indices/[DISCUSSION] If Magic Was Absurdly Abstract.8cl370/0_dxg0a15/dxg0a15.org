I'm not sure where I read it, but there was a fic in which the greatest wizard always were hopeless loons, super flamboyant, mad as hell and so on and so forth. Dumbledore, Grindelwald, Voldemort,...

As in: there is power in thinking around twenty corners at each given time.

I kinda took that into my headcanon. I like writing powerful wizards and witches as a bit mad.
