The rapid succession of spells and effects could just be a lot of training. Complex thought and movements so internalized that they come as second nature. If we go down that path, we could cite many activities done by humans in the real world that would lend themselves to a comparison. Playing an instrument, dancing, the Arts, acrobatic sports, and so on and so forth. Many things require fast processing of commands to the muscles combined with creative thought either during the practice or beforehand. You could argue that this also requires some form of insanity - the mad commitment to reach the apex of whatever it is you do.

Its just that I find the thought funny that in order to be a groundbreaking wizard or witch, the continuos need to think abstract and creative eventually rubs off on your personality.
