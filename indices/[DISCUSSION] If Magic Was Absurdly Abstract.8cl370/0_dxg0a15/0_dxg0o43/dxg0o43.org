It makes sense. Canon sort of supports this theory, in that sufficiently intelligent/skilled wizards can alter their spells on the fly (see D vs V duel in the ministry). Assuming that each spell (or continuous stream of magical effects like in the ministry duel) requires a given amount of mental discipline to produce, then this kind of spellcasting would require the caster to rapidly switch between mental states, which in my mind, does not exactly contribute to someone's mental well-being.
