I had an idea about how there are no muggles, everyone has magic but only those nutty enough to believe they can work magic can. This leads to the nuttiest being the most powerful.

Purebloods grow up in a household of magic nutty people so they believe they can do it and the statute of secrecy is there to stop more 'muggles' from figuring out they can do magic.
