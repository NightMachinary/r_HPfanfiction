Other's have touched on it, but to me, Hermione's backstory is "terrible" because we largely see the world through Harry's eyes. He doesn't go to Hermione's home over the summer or during the holidays; nor does he have heart to hearts with her, so we don't know.

In a similar vein, I would have loved to see how a seemingly traditional pureblood home like Neville''s worked, but once again, the story is seemingly Harry centric so it didn't happen.
