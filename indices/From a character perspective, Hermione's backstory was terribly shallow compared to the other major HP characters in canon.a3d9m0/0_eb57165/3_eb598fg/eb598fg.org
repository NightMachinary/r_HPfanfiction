My problem is that if Hermione can be seen as the Everyman, why do we never get to explore that further? We are told Hermione is a muggle-born and see her nameless muggle parents for all of a page or two in the second book, but after that, nothing.

I feel Rowling missed an opportunity to really explore what the family life of a muggleborn would feel like for the child and the parents. The most we get is Hermione saying that they can at least understand what being a prefect means, suggesting that her parents don't really understand her. It would be interesting to have explored this further, such as what Hermione thought of her parents not understanding her, or how her parents felt about their daughter becoming so distant from them over time.

I'm not saying that very character needs to have some super-amazing backstory or anything, but Hermione was one of the main three characters of the series. Like Sakura Haruno in the Naruto series, there are basic expectations that main characters have better, fleshed-out backstories than side characters. If Hermione was just a side character (i.e. Ginny or Luna), then I wouldn't be making this topic. But I feel that Hermione's character should be more than just "girl who is smart" and "girl with muggle parents" since it feels shallow and weak compared to the side characters with far more interesting stories (e.g. Ginny, Luna, Neville, Sirius, Lupin, Snape, etc.)

If Hermione was meant to be the Everyman, I feel Ron and Luna in particular were both far more suited for being the Everyman to the most likely demographic of readers than Hermione. Ron was a boy from a poor family who didn't put in as much effort as he could since he felt overshadowed by the rest of his family, and had his family tarred as "blood traitors". Luna was a girl who experienced parental loss at a young age, experienced bullying from other Ravenclaws, and was considered illogical even by magical standards.

By contrast, Hermione is an upper-middle class girl who is the smartest in her class with two loving parents, was never bullied or discriminated against until she entered the wizarding world, and was based on Rowling when she was younger. By comparison, Hermione is far less relatable than Harry and Ron to the majority of readers, is even less relatable when compared to Ron and Luna, and somehow gets even less relatable in the movies when her only "flaw" of being an average-looking girl was non-existent.
