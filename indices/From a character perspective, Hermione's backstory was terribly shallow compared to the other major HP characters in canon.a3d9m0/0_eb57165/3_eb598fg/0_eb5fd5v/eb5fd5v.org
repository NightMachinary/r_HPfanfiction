Hermione is not relatable to readers? The bookish girl who responded to learning about the magic world by reading EVERYTHING about it? The girl who was teased for reading too much? The girl who tries to be the voice of reason when Harry or Ron tries to go off the rails, not rolls her eyes when they are immature - but still enjoys their escapades?

Perhaps you were just not the target demographic when you read this book.
