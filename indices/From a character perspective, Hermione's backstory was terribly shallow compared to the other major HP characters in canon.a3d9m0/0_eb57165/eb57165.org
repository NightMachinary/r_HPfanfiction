I mean... not all character development is in backstory, though. If anything, Hermione could be seen as the Everyman for the most likely demographic of readers, as someone from a normal family who never knew about magic and then dove fully into learning everything about it that she could; her development, instead is in what she does /during/ the story. Hermione isn't about her background or some prophecy; she's about how a lonely girl made friends, learned to break the rules when she needed to, and eventually grew into the most serious (and ruthless) warrior at Harry's side.
