Oh, I definitely feel the same! Hermione is one of my favorite characters because I related to her the most, but as far as being an everyman, I don't find her to be. She always knows the information before everyone else, because she's taken the time to research it.

I mean, if I suddenly got my Hogwarts letter, you can be damn sure I'd read every scrap of information I could get my hands on before showing up at school, because that is what I'm like. I'd also be bitter if everyone always expected me to review their homework, because that's happened to me before. (I even have the hair!)

But we never get to see from her point of view that spark of revelation as she reads a new piece of information, or feel the triumph as she's reading something that proves a theory, and only know that's she's been studying from Harry's perspective. From that viewpoint, I'd say she's more of a mentor/font of knowledge character with a good bit of voice of reason thrown in.

This interpretation may just have to do with my personal take on the definition of everyman. I understand the everyman to be the bridge between the new and unknown world that the reader and the character have been thrust into, which in this case I think is Harry.
