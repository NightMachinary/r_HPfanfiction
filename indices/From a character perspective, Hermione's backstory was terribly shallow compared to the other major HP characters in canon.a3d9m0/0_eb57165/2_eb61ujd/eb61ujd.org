I'm not sure I agree with the everyman theory. Most everyman characters are the ones we experience the story through: Watson, Bella Swan, etc. They tend to be inexperienced in the world they're suddenly a part of and we as readers get to experience and learn things about the world as they do. In this case, Harry's our everyman, even though he's the chosen one, because he knows the least about the wizarding world. Although he's very famous and the focus of a prophecy, he still reacts to this the way the average person would. Hermione, on the other hand, knows more about the wizarding world than even Ron, a pureblood, does on many occasions because she reads.

Rowling has acknowledged that Hermione is most like herself on many occasions, and I think what we're seeing is a more or less a self-insert. Hermione doesn't have the most fleshed out backstory, because Rowling knows her too well. And this isn't a dig against Rowling in any way, even Bilbo Baggins is a self-insert with no backstory!
