  I mean... not all character development is in backstory, though.

I agree with this and it's /because/ of Hermione specifically that I decided this was true. I can only speak for myself, but I really do think Hermione is one of the best written characters in this series, and sure, I'm interested in her backstory, but only from a world-building perspective, because from a literary and character-arc perspective, she's got the most reasonable and consistent arc out of anyone and it's an absolute treasure to read her scenes. She runs off to the library so often it's practically a joke, except that it never is used as a cheap gag, because her running to the library is /always/ related to the plot. Her characterization interacts with the plot and the plot interacts with her so effortlessly, and I think that is just one of many signs that she is a very well-written character.

Everything she learns and every mistake she makes actually advances her character. She starts off believing everything she reads, but discoving Lockhart was a fraud made her realize the written word is only as good as the author. /Hogwarts, A History/ made her realize that books gloss over history and facts by not mentioning house-elves, which reinforces what she learned with Lockhart: that just because someone wrote it, doesn't mean it's true, something that helped Hermione handle Rita Skeeter's threats which gave Hermione room to discover her revenge streak, which prepared her for Umbridge when she came into the first day's class not only having read the entire assigned book, but also with a plan to peacefully undermine Umbridge's agenda, and this prepared her for Dumbledore's Army, which prepared her for the war. Another branch of this is the HBP, she is skeptical of the Half-Blood Prince not because his spells are bad, but because she's known for years that the written word can't be taken at face value and there's worth in understanding the author (fiction works aside), and she accepts the HBP's spells only after she knows the context of how the book was written. And it's this aspect of her character, her need to understand the context and the author, that Dumbledore recognizes in her and why he gives her the Tales of Beedle the Bard.

I think it's a bit short-sighted to overlook seven books of characterization to say that because we don't know much about her life before Hogwarts that she is an example of bad-writing. Backstory can be absolutely the best part of some characters (Dumbledore, Snape, Lupin, and many others are great examples of this), but in Hermione's case, what makes her interesting is how she develops in real time.

I do agree with OP's statement that Hermione's backstory is bad compared to the others, but I disagree with the implication that this is necessarily a problem or a sign of bad writing.
