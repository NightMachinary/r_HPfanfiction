As a fic writer, I've got to say that a character like Hermione, with virtually no backstory but exquisite character development in the text like you've just described, is an absolute gift. There are so many possibilities to explore with regards to how she got to be the person we meet in PS, it's brilliant.

So yeah, Hermione having no fleshed-out backstory (but coupled with arguably the best character arc in the entire series) is definitely a feature, not a bug.
