I think Hermione's wants got a bit lost in the bigger picture or bc it was through Harry's eyes, but I always felt like she cared the most about righting wrongs she saw, like the treatment of house elves, Rita Skeeter, etc. and that's why she eventually went into the ministry. It's there if you look for it, and it's probably why she was sorted into Gryffindor.
