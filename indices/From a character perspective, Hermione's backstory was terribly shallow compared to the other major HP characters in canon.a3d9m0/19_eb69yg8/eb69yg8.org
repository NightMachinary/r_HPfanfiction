Not even just the shallow backstory, but where are Hermione's desires? What does Hermione want? We know Ron wants to be his own man: He is sick of being overshadowed by his brothers. Harry wants to belong to the wizarding world and to kill Voldemort. Luna wants friends and/or acceptance. Ginny wants to be with Harry. But what do you want, Hermione? To do nothing but acquire knowledge? If this was so, she would be in Ravenclaw? Maybe Hermione wants nothing but to do good in the world, but if this was so, it wasn't illustrated very clearly in my opinion.
