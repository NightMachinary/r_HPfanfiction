Ok, Ron and important? Those two words don't fit the same sentence! Seriously!

​

I agree when it comes to Hermione (I would have loved to know more about her - what does she read for pleasure (I don't think she re-reads 'Hogwarts - A History' constantly!)? What are her dreams? etc. etc.), but not about Ron! Seriously, when did Ron ever do something absolutely crucial? Seriously, I am coming up empty! (No, stepping in front of Sirius Black and telling him if he wants Harry he will have to kill him first is brave, but not crucial!)

​

Also: We don't know if Hermione is the best in their year! We know she has high marks, but is she truly the best? I don't know about that! Show me a quote, if you have one!
