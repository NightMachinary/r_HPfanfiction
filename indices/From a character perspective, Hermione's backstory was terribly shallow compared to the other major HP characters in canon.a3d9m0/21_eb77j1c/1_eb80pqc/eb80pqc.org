When I say Hermione was the best in their year, I'm mainly referring to the fact she got an Outstanding on all of her O.W.L subjects except for DADA. Its pretty hard to one-up getting nine Outstandings and one Exceeds Expectations.

Its more about how Hermione was portrayed compared to other students in Harry's year. Not once are we shown a single student who does comparable to Hermione in their year across the board. Sure, Harry is much better than Hermione at DADA and Neville is presumably better than her at Herbology but across the board, she's presented as being the best in their year.

Between making Polyjuice Potion in her second year, learning the Summoning Charm months several months before Harry, using the NEWT-level Protean Charm in her fifth year, and basically everything she did in DH, there just isn't anyone else in Harry's year that could be considered equal or better to Hermione all-around. Its not just that Hermione gets high marks, but that she is consistently shown to be ahead of her peers in all her subjects (unlike, say, Neville who is only good at Herbology, or to a lesser extent, Harry, who only notable skills are DADA and Quidditch).

However, I must stress that *Harry's year only having one noteworthy student is seemingly an outlier if the Marauders generation are anything to go by.* Yes, James and Sirius were the best in their year, but at least they had competition who did comparable to some extent. Lily, while not as good as James and Sirius, was regarded as being very talented, as was Lupin to a lesser extent. Not to mention Snape, who was even more skilled than Lily. *Hermione, as skilled as she was, was far inferior to James, Sirius, Snape, and Lily were at her age*

The problem with Hermione is that she never had the desire to innovate the same way other genius witches and wizards have done. She learns faster than her peers, but she just learns from the textbook, a flaw Snape called her out on at least twice. She always lacked the desire to experiment and innovate with magic. Even one of her best feats, the Protean Charm, is impressive because its NEWT-level magic done in fifth year. But the act of using the Protean Charm on the DA Coins is merely using the charm for the purpose it was intended for: magically linking objects together.

*TL;DR: Talent-wise, Hermione is a medium fish in small pond. James, Sirius, Snape, and Lily all vastly outclass Hermione in every way. Aside from Hermione, the students in Harry's year aren't really that good at magic across the board, and are only really shown to be good at one subject and then being average or below average in every other subject.*
