#+end_quote

Sacrifice himself in a real life chess match and open the Chamber to get a basilisk fang come to mind. There's also his wand having backfired on Lockhart. If it was any other wand, that's where the story ends. Oh! Reminding Hermione she's a witch to use a spell to take care of the Devil's Snare a few minutes/ hours before his sacrifice as well.
