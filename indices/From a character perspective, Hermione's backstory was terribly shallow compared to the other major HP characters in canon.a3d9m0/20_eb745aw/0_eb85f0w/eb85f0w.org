  A character's importance is NOT based solely on their backstory. And how in the world is she not as important as Ron? She's been alongside and helping out ever since the first book. Like... I'm not sure how a character that wasn't the protagonist could be MORE important. She by far outclasses Ginny, Neville and Luna.

I'm well aware that Hermione outclasses those three in terms of usefulness. She's the best student in her year and one of the main reasons Harry and Ron didn't get themselves killed by Death Eaters (especially in DH).

However as another user said, Hermione has no desires or dreams. We know Harry wants to stop Voldemort and belong in the wizarding world, since he doesn't really belong in the muggle world he grew up in. We know Ron is overshadowed by his entire family and feels like the least favourite child, and how much he wants to become his own person who isn't just "another Weasley". But what exactly does Hermione want? Since Hermione's only defining traits are being the only girl in the main trio, being the only muggleborn in the main trio, and being very smart. As one of the main character, she shouldn't be that bland. Minor side characters (e.g. Pansy Parkinson, Terry Boot, Dawlish, etc) are allowed to be bland and simple because nobody really expects them to be that important anyway.

Compared to Harry and Ron's fleshed out characters and desires, Hermione feels like a third-wheel with zero desires and zero motivations. A character purpose and role in a story should be more than just "being smart for plot convenience" (i.e. Hermione). The closest she gets to having desires and wants of her own is when she made S.P.E.W... which she not only forgot about after GoF, but the entire S.P.E.W arguably weakened her character by having her ignore the wishes of the House Elves to push her own agenda (effectively implying that she thinks the opinions of a human witch are more valuable and superior than the opinions of mere House Elves).

I think Hermione would have been more likeable if she actively tried to get involved in politics within the wizarding world early and more often. It would have been great setup for Hermione's goal to become a politician so she could use her influence within the Ministry to speak for the voiceless in the magical world. Sure, Rowling had her become Minister for Magic in Cursed Child (the questionable canon of that play, aside), but her joining the Ministry was basically because she (along with Harry and Ron) needed to help Kingsley reform the Ministry following the events of DH. The fact that she became Minister would have been a bonus for her, but not really the reason she worked for the Ministry originally. I think it would have been interesting if Hermione ended up as Minister for Magic at some point prior to the Epilogue of DH, rather than in Cursed Child.

*TL;DR: Hermione really needed desires and goals of her own, especially early on. Having her goal be to become Minister for Magic would have made her seem more fleshed out since it could have allowed the exploration of topics that a Harry-centric narrative would otherwise gloss over due to Harry's ignorance and apathy towards said topics.*
