To be fair, the story is fairly Harry-centric. There wouldn't really be a need to give Hermione such a backstory as the narrative never really points in that direction. We see the Weasleys so much because that is the way the narrative points, not because they're more important.

A character's importance is NOT based solely on their backstory. And how in the world is she not as important as Ron? She's been alongside and helping out ever since the first book. Like... I'm not sure how a character that wasn't the protagonist could be MORE important. She by far outclasses Ginny, Neville and Luna.
