backstory... who needs back story on a character that we apparently did not even know her real race until after 7 books and 8 movies? and even then only from an interview.

JK just sat back and said nothing when Watson was cast for the role, then after it was all over she was like, 'oh by the way...' personally I think she just wanted everyone to remember she exists... if only for a few seconds.
