Can we like, not do this today? The Hermione's race argument is like the most tiresome, boring and annoying thing ever. She was white in the books cover and JK Rowling gave greenlight to Emma Watson, so she was white, then they casted a Black Actress for The Cursed Child and JK Rowling said she loved Black Hermione too. Like that's about it. The fandom has been blowing this argument out of porpotions.
