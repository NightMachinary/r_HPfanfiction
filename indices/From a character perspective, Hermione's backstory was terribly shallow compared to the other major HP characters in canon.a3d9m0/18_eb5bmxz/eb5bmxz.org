Great Observation.\\
Now, consider this problem through the eyes of J.K Rowling.\\
You have a character who is going to end up moving into a magical world. She will fall in love with Ron who's family mostly ignored the squib accountant as well as generally ignorant about Muggles. Hermione herself will mostly spend her summers with Weasleys. Because that's where the plot will occur.\\
So, you wouldn't focus on characters who wouldn't be significant to the plot.

Personally, I don't think Hermione had a very meaningful connection with her parents. As in, we never see her ponder that she was starting to spend less and less time with her family. Maybe all muggleborns have to desert their family if they're going to live as magicals.
