Hermionie's conflicts all happen in the magical world.

She had a nice normal middle class life, as the beloved only child of two healthy, responsible parents. That is boring to read about in a sidekick, and as much as I love Hermione, it is Harry's book.

Neither Harry nor Ron would be able to relate to much of any of Hermione's “backstory”.

And Harry's own backstory was so socially repressed he wouldn't have even know the questions to ask, so we the readers, never get them looked into.

I get your frustration, and I agree that I would have liked to know more than the glossing over we got, but I can see why it would get edited out. I think others share that sentiment, which is why there is a-lot of in depth Hermione centric fiction.

On the upside of that vagueness, it allows the reader's imagination to have full license to create their own satisfying head cannon.
