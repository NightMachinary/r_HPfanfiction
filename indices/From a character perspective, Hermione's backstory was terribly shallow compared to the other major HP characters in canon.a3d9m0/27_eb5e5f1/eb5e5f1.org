Hermione's parents are in a rather toxic relationship Hermione doesn't like to talk about. They don't beat each other, but they should have divorced long ago. Hermione grew watching them quarrel and inflict mental harm to one another - that's why she grows to be a bit of a sociopath (ask Marietta!).

Anyway, McGonnagal had quite a bit of work (and maybe a few confundus charms) in convincing Hermione's parents to send her to Hogwarts (how many parents would trust their children to a stranger who will take them for months to a school they can't even see, it's outside muggle law and where they have no control?). Hermione, like Harry, saw Hogwarts as the opportunity to leave a troublesome home and, since she was given the letter almost a year before she could attend, put an initial effort in learning magic to impress her parents and make sure they'll send her. Make no mistake, Hermione loves her parents, but the three of them have a bit of a strained relationship, between their fights, magic and Hermione's puberty (and it's emotional baggage)

Since she was often at Diagon Alley before going to Hogwarts (she lives in London, right? She only needs to take the tube to the Leaky Cauldron), she quickly understood she would be seen as a second class citizen and, powered with a thirst for knowledge, worked hard to become an overachiever. Just like Harry, the Hat wanted to put her in Slytherin at first, but declined because it knew how hard it would be for her there. Unlike popular opinion, the Hat's second choice was Hufflepuff, but she ended up in Gryffindor anyway.

She was never able to bond with Lavander and the Parvatti twin because of her unspoken emotional issues, which only become worse until the troll incident.

Anyway, she built a house of cards of lies after book 2 to explain her parents why she was out of touch for so long (when she was petrified), but it held. By book four, she got into a relationship with Krum and even though they had regular sex, she was torn between her crush on Viktor and the nagging feeling in the back of her head remembering her about her nascent feelings for Ron. She hesitated to take on Krum's offer to go to Bulgaria because of that. Also, would she explain that to her parents?

Things turned a turn for the worse when she arrived to King's Cross. While they were waiting for her on the muggle side of the station, Hermione's parents overheard wizards talk about Cedric's death. Her house of cards fell during the trip back to (her parents) home, even her very edited version didn't hold up to scrutiny and their parents took the rational choice of pulling her out of Hogwarts and enrolling her in whatever options she had as a British teenager who had been absent from school since the age of twelve.

An emotional train-wreck, Hermione abandoned her home that very night, grabbing her stuff and taking the Knight Bus to the Burrow. By chance, she met Albus Dumbledore there, who was about to meet Molly and Arthur about relocating to Grimmauld Place. In hera nervous collapse, she spoke her hearth to Dumbledore. The old man, understanding how valuable Hermione was in the fight against Voldemort (as a prop for Harry, but valuable nonetheless), made a bit of a deal with her. She would of course be going back to Hogwarts, on a scholarship if needed, and he'd arrange to have her live either at the Burrow or at Grimmauld Place. In return, he asked her for her trust - that's the reason why Hermione didn't contact Harry over the summer, despite desperately wanting to do it. She kept all this from Harry in part because of shame and in part because Dumbledore told her he feared Harry would imitate her and leave Private Drive if he knew, and Dumbledore insisted it was important for Harry to spend some time there.

She tried to rekindle her relationship with her parents through the school year. By Christmas, she wasn't with them, she was with Krum but the relationship wasn't working out. Through the rest of books 5 and 6, she managed to get into a polite distance relationship with her parents, but never returned to live with them. She didn't put a memory charm on them (she had never done one before the fight at the cafe) but an Imperious curse to convince them they were the Wilkins and were happily married. If she died, the curse would lift by itself. If Voldemort was defeated, she'd lift it. Distance matters in Australia. They didn't go France, they went to Majorca - she said Australia just in case Harry or Ron were captured and interrogated. The "Wilkins" marriage failed, just like the Grangers did, because she only gave them general directions with the curse. She didn't tell Harry and Ron just in case they'd try to imitate her and because she knew how wrong her actions were (maiming Marietta is ok. But the books say the Imperious is Unforgivable!).

After book 7, she remotely lifted the curse and restarted contact with her parents, but the relationship between the three of them was permanently damaged. They love each other, but the pain and betrayals are just too much. They can't trust each other again.
