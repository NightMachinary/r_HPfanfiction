Rowling uses her characters as instruments to advance the plot, and nothing else. There are too many instances of character development refusing to happen, or conveniently happening whenever Harry isn't looking.

If you want to use Occam's Razor to analyze a series of novels, go ahead - the answer is: Rowling didn't think about it.

With that said, Hermione abandoning her house after GoF makes sense.
