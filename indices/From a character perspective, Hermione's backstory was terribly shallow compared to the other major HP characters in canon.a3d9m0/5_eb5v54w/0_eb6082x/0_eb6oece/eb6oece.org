Molly "the adoptive mother" Weasley's first reaction to her children retrieving Harry from the house where he was kept behind bars and starved says it all:

  “Have you any idea how worried I've been?” said Mrs. Weasley in a deadly whisper.

  “Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to ---”

  All three of Mrs. Weasley's sons were taller than she was, but they cowered as her rage broke over them.

  “Beds empty! No note! Car gone --- could have crashed --- out of my mind with worry --- did you care? --- never, as long as I've lived --- you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy ---” “Perfect Percy,” muttered Fred.

  “YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY'S BOOK!” yelled Mrs. Weasley, prodding a finger in Fred's chest. “You could have died, you could have been seen, you could have lost your father his job ---”

  It seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on Harry, who backed away.

  I'm very pleased to see you, Harry, dear,” she said. “Come in and have some breakfast.”

"I'm very pleased to see you, why don't you have a scone and a cup of tee... now that you're here, which inconveniences my simple life". Oh and she wants them to be more like Percy the Prat. The child who basically betrayed his whole family. What a wonderful mother, Percy would probably let his entire family starve before doing something that could get him in trouble... but of course:

  “I don't blame you, dear,” she assured Harry, tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate. “Arthur and I have been worried about you, too. Just last night we were saying we'd come and get you ourselves if you hadn't written back to Ron by Friday. But really” (she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate), “flying an illegal car halfway across the country --- anyone could have seen you ---”

She doesn't blame him for being rescued. How nice! And her and Arthur totally would have done something!!! They were even talking about it! Be amazed at the amount of caring this woman has to offer for Harry. Incredible!

  “They were starving him, Mum!” said George.

  “And you!” said Mrs. Weasley, but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting Harry bread and buttering it for him.

She's even buttering a bread for the starving child! WOW!

  “You can go up to bed, dear,” she added to Harry. “You didn't ask them to fly that wretched car ---”

"... but if you had, you'd get yelled at too!"

PS: How tiny is Molly if her 12 year old child is bigger than her?
