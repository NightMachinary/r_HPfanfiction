It's the fact that Molly implies that she is worried about Harry's environment to the point where she considered intervention and yet nothing ever comes out of it later on. Harry is not picked up as soon as the protection is recharged, he is picked up just in time for the world cup. Oh, his guardians are starving him? Better send some cake instead of, I don't know, inform the DMLE. Her husband works for the government ffs. And after Harry gets traumatised she gives no fuck and doesn't even write a letter three years in a row.
