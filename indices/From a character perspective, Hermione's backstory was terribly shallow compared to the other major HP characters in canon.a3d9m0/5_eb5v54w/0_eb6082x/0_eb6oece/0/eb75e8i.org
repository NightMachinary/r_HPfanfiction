Just about everything you said sounds like you're misinterpreting Mrs. Weasley's tone. Do you know why she was angry? Because her youngest sons (the oldest of which could not be more that thirteen) took an illegal, dangerous, flying car out to Surrey, which by estimation is FAR, on some half-cocked rescue attempt that nearly failed. They COULD have died! (Fallen out of the car, crashed into a building/plane, ect.) If you have children, you'll understand that this would TERRIFY any mother. It's tough love. She yells at them because she loves them, duh.

Where the hell does Molly Weasley ever say (or even imply) that Harry inconveniences her simple life??? That response is just pulling nothing out of your ass and you know it.

As for Percy, he was only a FIFTH YEAR at the time, and he was a MODEL STUDENT! Any mother would be damn proud to have a son like that and hope that her younger sons WOULD follow in his footsteps, especially if they got into the kind of trouble Fred and George got into. AND Percy actually learned that he was wrong and CAME BACK to his family in the end. It's almost like he can learn from his mistakes!

As for your next comment, I'm not entirely sure what to make of it. You seem to be trying to make a villain of Molly and Arthur. Like, they talked about it because they were getting worried because of the lack of correspondence. It's almost like they knew nothing of Harry's home life or anything that was going on because his POST WAS BEING INTERCEPTED. And this woman cares a damn lot more than many after only meeting the boy ONCE PRIOR!

HOW THE FUCK ARE YOU MAKING THE SIMPLE ACT OF BUTTERING BREAD PRETENTIOUS???

PS: Small. She's been described as "dumpy" before.
