  It's tough love. She yells at them because she loves them, duh.
#+end_quote

You missed the entire point. Yes, she clearly loves her children. I was trying to juxtapose how she reacts to the children she loves vs how she reacts to Harry (i.e. not at all). Harry is barely on her radar even if he is right in front of her. Does Harry even have a single personal conversation with Molly in the whole series?

  especially if they got into the kind of trouble Fred and George got into
#+end_quote

Except Fred and George are much smarter and more successful than Percy later on. *And* they have their heart in the right place. They don't need to learn from their mistakes because even at 14 they know better than their grown-ass mother what is right.

Molly is just a terrible judge of character or maybe she herself doesn't really know what's right and instilled these terrible values in Percy with her terrible standards. It's probably not his fault alone that he thinks the most important thing in life is to stay in line and care about cauldron bottoms.

The good Weasleys: Bill, Charlie, Fred and George "Get me the fuck away from this woman and out of this house"

The shit Weasleys: Percy, Ron, Ginny, probably got a bit too much of the Mollywobbles love.

  HOW THE FUCK ARE YOU MAKING THE SIMPLE ACT OF BUTTERING BREAD PRETENTIOUS???
#+end_quote

I just think it's funny how the height of what she aspires to when confronted with an abused/starved child is to butter him a bread. It's not like after this day she goes to the Ministry or Dumbledore and fights for different living conditions for Harry and becomes a constant presence that cares for his well-being. No, what the boy needs is a buttered piece of bread.
