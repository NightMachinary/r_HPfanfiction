I strongly disagree that backstory = character depth. I don't even think we know the weasleys so we can “understand” Ron - they're more about showing the reader magical family life, and giving Harry an adopted family. What we are told about Ron is pretty brief.

But I guess Hermione does have less emotional issues than Ron. She kind of just... gets shit done. We don't know a lot about her goals beyond “get good grades”. The only real drama in her life is her romance with Ron, and that's so poorly developed I still don't really see why she liked him. (Nothing against Ron, just their relationship).
