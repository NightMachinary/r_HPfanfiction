Right, but throw away lines can add a huge amount of information for the reader. For example, Ginny is /always/ mentioned, even though probably 1/2 of them are throw-away lines in the first few books. But it means that by the time Ginny comes into focus in the later books, the reader already knows who she is. There's nothing like that in the books for Hermione's back story.
