I'm guessing Hermione's story wasn't covered because J.K. Rowling wanted to focus on the magical stuff. When it came down to it, Hermione's backstory was put on the back burner in order to make room for plot relevant stuff.

The whole Sakura and Hermione comparison stops at their lack of backstory and being the studious ones in their respective groups though. Hermione's development through out the story was good, far better than Sakura's.
