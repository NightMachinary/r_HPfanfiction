Interesting points. I don't fully agree but do feel that JKR dropped the ball by not showing any positive muggle familial or even, mentioned, external supporting characters or positive influences to her muggleborn characters. With the result that, in a series that strongly claims muggles are just as good as wizards and people shouldn't be prejudiced, the only muggle characters we see are 1 or more of: ignorant, baffled and confused by the magical world, actively vile and abusive. With the reveal of the odd but nice Mrs Figg as part of the wizarding community, literally the only positively-portrayed muggle characters are Hermione's parents, who aren't even named and who appear (iirc) for a single scene across seven books.
