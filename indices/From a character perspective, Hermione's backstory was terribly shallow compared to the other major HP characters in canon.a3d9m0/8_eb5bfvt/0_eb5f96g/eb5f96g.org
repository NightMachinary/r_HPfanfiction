  She's wrong about the elves.

Please don't tell me you are talking about "Elves need bonds", which is entirely fanon.

You forgot one more thing she was wrong about, btw: The location of a Horcrux in Hogwarts.

Smart people are wrong all the time. Stupid people place high value on being right and stop learning, because they are too afraid to voice their opinions.

If it turns out that string theory is wrong, do you think that Hawkins ore other physicist who spent a large portion of their lives working on it are less smart?
