I didn't imply the fanon theory. Only that the elves were not willing to be free. Hermione does not do what the elves want, but what she thinks the elves should want.

Secondly, why would Hermione be less smart for being wrong? I never claimed that. My claim is that it is a misconception that she's too perfect and is never wrong.
