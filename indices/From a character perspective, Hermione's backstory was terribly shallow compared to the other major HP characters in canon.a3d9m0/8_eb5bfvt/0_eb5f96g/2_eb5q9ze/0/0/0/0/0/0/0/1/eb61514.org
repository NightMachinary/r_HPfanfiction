Bruh, the Hogwarts elves are offered pay and/or freedom, and they refuse it. That seems pretty Uncle Tom of Rowling to me, but it's what happens, so in-universe, they are choosing to stay in their situation. The choice was an informed one - they see Dobby in the proposed situation, and they already know what the other choice is. I am respecting their choice as thinking creatures.

The fact that they /should/, by my morals, have some sort of ambition beyond that has little to do with the situation, because my morals shouldn't dictate their choices.

Also, you're correct, he's covering for his son of his own free will. Still, choosing your blood relative over a servant is hardly being abusive toward the servant.
