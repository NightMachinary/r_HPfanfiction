  an internship with slavery besides the fact that you can quit if you want to.
#+end_quote

Uhm, why are you saying this as if it's some kind of minor difference?! Yeah, that's what makes the one thing unethical and the other thing not. Do you understand why people object to slavery?! I feel like I'm talking to a wall here.

#+begin_quote
  freedom meaning the ability to make decisions in one's life
#+end_quote

Which Elves don't have, which is why they are slaves.

#+begin_quote
  and freedom meaning the state of a house elf not currently serving a wizard
#+end_quote

That has nothing to do with slavery. You can serve in all kinds of ways without being institutionally enslaved. How do you not grasp this?

#+begin_quote
  You're conflating the two
#+end_quote

I'm not conflating the two. I'm repeatedly telling you that freeing the slaves has nothing to do with forcing anything on them. That would be the opposite of freedom? Do you think Hermione wants to put the Elves in shackles and carry them away from their wizard masters in order to stop them from working for them? Again, that would be nonsensical.

#+begin_quote
  My statement was that you are forcing the state of not serving a wizard upon them.
#+end_quote

No one is talking about that. I never have. Put away your strawmen. They can serve wizards as much as they like (as free people).

#+begin_quote
  Again, it isn't slavery.
#+end_quote

*Of course* it is. If you can't recognize this blatant display of slavery you are clearly incapable of recognizing any kind of slavery. I'm not surprised by this, since you seem to be confused about what slavery even is.
