  Elves as a society don't want to be free
#+end_quote

And you get that from what? The Hogwarts house elves? Who are probably the best treated elves in all of the world? Is there some kind of survey I can look up?

We have two strong examples of House Elf abuse (Winky, Dobby) and even if the whole house elf society (if such a thing even exists) were totally in favour of their own institutionalized enslavement (which I don't belief) it needs to be abolished anyways. If they really want to be servants their enslavement can be replaced with a system that protects their rights and helps them to do whatever they want (like serving a family). It's pretty hard to want to be free if you have no legal recourse and no assets to survive on your own.
