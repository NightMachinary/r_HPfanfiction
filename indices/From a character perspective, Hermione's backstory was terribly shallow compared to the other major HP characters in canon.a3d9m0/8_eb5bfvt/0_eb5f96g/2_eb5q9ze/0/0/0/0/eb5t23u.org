  And you get that from what? The Hogwarts house elves? Who are probably the best treated elves in all of the world? Is there some kind of survey I can look up?

Uh, the only elves that we see in anything resembling normal working conditions, yes. Winky was very well-treated and regarded until Barty Junior wound up in control and started abusing her to cover his own crimes. Kreature was apparently well-treated by the Blacks until Sirius, who clearly has issues with his family. Dobby was with the most abusive pureblood family we ever see, and his anomalous behavior makes it clear that most House Elves don't react that way.

  even if the whole house elf society (if such a thing even exists) were totally in favour of their own institutionalized enslavement (which I don't belief) it needs to be abolished anyways.

That's some serious cultural bias, there. You don't get to decide for them, or else you're controlling them to an extent that Dumbledore does not.

  It's pretty hard to want to be free if you have no legal recourse and no assets to survive on your own.

The Hogwarts Elves are offered wages and freedom with Dobby as a model, and openly disparage the idea. You can imagine any reason you like for that, but at the end of the day, that is their decision, made while they are not being coerced in any way.
