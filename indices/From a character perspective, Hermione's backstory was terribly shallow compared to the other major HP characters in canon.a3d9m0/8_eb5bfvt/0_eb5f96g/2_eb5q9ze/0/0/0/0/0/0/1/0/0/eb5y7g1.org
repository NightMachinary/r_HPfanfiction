  You deciding for them when they've already made their choice is the height of elitism and hypocrisy

I really love this underhanded arguing tactic as if me or Hermione or anyone arguing *against* slavery would force upon them anyone that they don't want. The entire point is to give them freedoms. No one is forcing anything on them.

And no, you can not meaningfully consent to being a slave (outside of BDSM play).
