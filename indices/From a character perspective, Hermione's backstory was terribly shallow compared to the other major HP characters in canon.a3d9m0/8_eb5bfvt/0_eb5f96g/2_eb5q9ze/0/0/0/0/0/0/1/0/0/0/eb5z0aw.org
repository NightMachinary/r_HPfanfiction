My issue is that, in order to be a slave in the first place, you have to be forced to do something you don't want to.

House elves are much more in line with the concept of vassals and retainers in older nobility. Their status and honor would be bound to the person they served, but it /would/ be considered an honor by both the retainer and society at large. Rather than receiving an explicit paycheck, their living expenses would be seen to out of their employer's pocket.

House elves, when well-treated clearly consider it an absolute honor to work for their families, and they love them. The Hogwarts elves enjoy their job and, when offered the ability to be paid for their service or given clothes in the wake of Dobby doing the same, they choose not to.

Also, and here's the kicker - YOU ARE FORCING FREEDOM ON THEM. You haven't been arguing for the idea of giving them 'an option.'

  even if the whole house elf society (if such a thing even exists) were totally in favour of their own institutionalized enslavement (which I don't belief) it needs to be abolished anyways.

From the second comment you made to me. Even if they were totally in favor of their own society, it needs to be abolished. What the fuck.
