  Winky was very well-treated and regarded
#+end_quote

Yeah, Crouch Senior treats here very well and regards her highly:

#+begin_quote
  “Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed possible,” he said slowly. “I told her to remain in the tent. I told her to stay there while I went to sort out the trouble. And I find that she disobeyed me. This means clothes.”

  “No!” shrieked Winky, prostrating herself at Mr. Crouch's feet. “No, master! Not clothes, not clothes!”
#+end_quote

What are you smoking?

In any case, the same chapter gives us some more insight into the brainwashing and oppression going on:

#+begin_quote
  “Freedom is going to Dobby's head, sir,” said Winky sadly. “Ideas above his station, sir. Can't get another position, sir.”
#+end_quote

[wanting to be free sounds like you're fucked and unemployable]

#+begin_quote
  “Paying?” said Harry blankly. “Well --- why shouldn't he be paid?” Winky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed her fingers slightly so that her face was half-hidden again.

  “House-elves is not paid, sir!” she said in a muffled squeak. “No, no, no. I says to Dobby, I says, go find yourself a nice family and settle down, Dobby. He is getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is unbecoming to a house-elf. You goes racketing around like this, Dobby, I says, and next thing I hear you's up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, like some common goblin.”

[there's actual institutional reprisal if an elf 'acts up' and they have to face legal consequences]

  “Well, it's about time he had a bit of fun,” said Harry.

  “House-elves is not *supposed* to have fun, Harry Potter,” said Winky firmly, from behind her hands. “House-elves does what they is told. I is not liking heights at all, Harry Potter” --- she glanced toward the edge of the box and gulped --- “but my master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.”
#+end_quote

[notice how she doesn't say that they can't have fun... they aren't 'supposed' to have fun]

  Kreature

That's not even his name, are you sure you're an expert on elves? The poor guy has lost most of his marbles due to the terrible treatment as a Black Elf and even Sirius (a sympathetic and likeable guy) has the mistreatment ingrained into him.

#+begin_quote
  That's some serious cultural bias, there
#+end_quote

I don't believe in cultural relativism.
