  Except, again, they do, and choose not to. I continue to say this, and continue to reference the choice that they had, but you continue to ignore it.

I do not follow. What sort of choice are you talking about?! They can not choose not to serve Hogwarts, they wouldn't find employment anywhere else. It's a disgrace to an elf.

What does refusing pay have anything to do with it? As Winky says, accepting pay and "acting out" can have serious consequences for an elf. Why would they risk that?

They aren't free, they can't make any meainingful choices. Making a choice with a gun to your head isn't a choice. You are arguing like a Mafia boss: "Would be a shame if something were to happen to your fine establishment. But it's your choice!!!"

I don't think you understand the concepts of choice and freedom at all. They are institutionally (and culturally) enslaved. Do you not understand what this means?
