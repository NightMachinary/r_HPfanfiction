  Yeah, Crouch Senior treats here very well and regards her highly:

You know he's under the Imperious Curse there, right? Barty Junior is making him do that.

/edit:/ No, he isn't. Crouch Jr. is free of the Imperius curse at this point, but that's a temporary state of affairs. Crouch Sr. is just choosing his son's freedom over Winky's. Thanks, [[/u/hchan1][u/hchan1]]

  “Freedom is going to Dobby's head, sir,” said Winky sadly. “Ideas above his station, sir. Can't get another position, sir.”

  [wanting to be free sounds like you're fucked and unemployable]

Again, Dobby is highly unusual by House Elf standards. Harry's basically his best friend, and even he's put off by Dobby's outfit and behavior post-freedom. Winky confirms that he never shuts up about Harry, too.

  He is getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is unbecoming to a house-elf. You goes racketing around like this, Dobby, I says, and next thing I hear you's up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, like some common goblin.”

*He is getting up to all sorts of high jinks*... *You goes racketing around like this*

He's being disruptive. It's not asking for pay - in that case, a simple 'Yes, I'm looking for a house elf and I'm willing to pay,' or 'No, sorry, can't afford that' would be fine, and wouldn't constitute high jinks by any definition. He's probably wearing garish outfits and talking about Harry with his usual enthusiasm, along with openly punishing himself out of reflex. We've seen how disruptive that can be when the Dursleys are having Vernon's client or boss or whatever over during Chamber of Secrets. Note that Ron thinks that Dobby asking for pay is unusual but clearly has no problem with it, nor does Dumbledore, meaning that in some corners of Magical Britain things are perfectly okay for a paid elf.

  “House-elves is not supposed to have fun, Harry Potter,” said Winky firmly, from behind her hands. “House-elves does what they is told. I is not liking heights at all, Harry Potter” --- she glanced toward the edge of the box and gulped --- “but my master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.”

  [notice how she doesn't say that they can't have fun... they aren't 'supposed' to have fun]

...? I don't understand what you're trying to imply here.

#+begin_quote
  That's not even his name, are you sure you're an expert on elves? The poor guy has lost most of his marbles due to the terrible treatment as a Black Elf and even Sirius (a sympathetic and likeable guy) has the mistreatment ingrained into him.
#+end_quote

Sorry I misspelled the name of a fantasy character, whose name is a misspelled word. I clearly have no idea what I'm talking about. On the other hand, even I know that Sirius doesn't like Kreacher because he was openly hostile, constantly referred to his guests as Mudbloods and blood traitors (including Sirius himself), and worshiped Sirius's abusive family.

  I don't believe in cultural relativism.
#+end_quote

Awfully enlightened attitude, there. If you're throwing around comparisons to slavery, white slave owners thought they were doing Africans a favor, since Africans didn't have any of the foibles they associated with true culture and intelligence. Good thing you're saving those ignorant house elves from themselves - they clearly aren't intelligent enough to know what they want when openly presented with the choice, free of consequences.
