  What are you getting at here? Imperius isn't a remote control mechanism. Crouch Junior would have had to implant the command to treat Winky poorly explicitly. Why would he do that? Winky was instrumental to his escape.

Barty Jr. wanted to cover his trail. Winky was actually following him, trying to keep him out of trouble. He couldn't have that anymore, so he made his dad free her.

  Right, same as Wizards think that Elves are naturally servants and incapable of being on their own. How can you think that kind of attitude wouldn't have an impact on the self-image of elves (aka brainwashing).

  But they aren't!? They aren't presented with the choice and it certainly wouldn't be free of consequence!

You'd have a point if the elves weren't openly offered pay without consequences, with proof that there were no strings attached. Unfortunately, they were. Dobby is paid by the same person who employs the other elves, and clearly comes out of it with everything he wanted. The fact that none of the other elves do the same when offered is their informed choice, having seen the proof of concept.

You deciding for them when they've already made their choice is the height of elitism and hypocrisy. You're whitewashing their culture because it doesn't conform to your morals.
