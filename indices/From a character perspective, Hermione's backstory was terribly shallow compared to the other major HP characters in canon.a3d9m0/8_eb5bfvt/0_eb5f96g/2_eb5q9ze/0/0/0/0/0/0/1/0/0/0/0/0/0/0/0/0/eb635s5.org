Am I shouting into the wind, here?

When Winky says that about Dobby, she's referring to his weirdly garish clothing and aberrant behavior (he still reflexively punishes himself whenever he does something the Malfoys wouldn't like, and talks up Harry like he's the Messiah).

They are offered pay while continuing on as Hogwarts house elves, the same as Dobby. They refuse. They can *see* Dobby in the same arrangement, perfectly happy. They still refuse.

There are no consequences. No thugs breaking their legs, no 'serious consequences from the Ministry,' Dumbledore, or any other wizard.

I honestly think the part where you said you wouldn't respect their choice if it went against what you thought was best for them demonstrated pretty clearly that you're the one with the problem understanding choices.
