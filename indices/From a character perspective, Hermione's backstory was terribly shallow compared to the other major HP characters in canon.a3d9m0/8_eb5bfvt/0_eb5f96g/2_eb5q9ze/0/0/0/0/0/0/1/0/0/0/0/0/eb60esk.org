  I disagree with your definition of slavery.
#+end_quote

You're free to disagree, but there's nothing differentiating, say, an internship with slavery besides the fact that you can quit if you want to.

#+begin_quote
  That's ridiculous. Vassals and retainers had - outside of their duties and obligations - vast amounts of personal autonomy. House Elves have none.
#+end_quote

They do, actually, as I continue to repeat. The fact that they don't take advantage of this to leave or seek pay is them exercising that freedom.

#+begin_quote
  You would have been right along with the white slave owners in the 19th century who argued that this was the natural order and good for society.
#+end_quote

I literally just showed you how I disagreed with that, and how your own argument was worryingly close to the very same attitude.

#+begin_quote
  That's an oxymoron. I refuse to discuss nonsensical statements.
#+end_quote

That's because we're using two definitions of freedom in the same conversation - freedom meaning the ability to make decisions in one's life, and freedom meaning the state of a house elf not currently serving a wizard. You're conflating the two, I'm saying there's a difference. My statement was that you are forcing the state of not serving a wizard upon them.

#+begin_quote
  OF course I have. If you are free you can do whatever you want.
#+end_quote

Except, of course, continuing to stay the course and maintain your society the way you chose. This is what the Hogwarts elves tried to do, and what you openly stated you would not accept.

#+begin_quote
  Of course Slavery needs to be abolished. Why are we even arguing about this?! Slavery is unethical.
#+end_quote

Again, it isn't slavery.
