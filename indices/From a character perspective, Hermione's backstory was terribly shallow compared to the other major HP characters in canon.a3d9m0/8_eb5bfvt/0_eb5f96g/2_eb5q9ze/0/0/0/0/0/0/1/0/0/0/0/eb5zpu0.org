  My issue is that, in order to be a slave in the first place, you have to be forced to do something you don't want to.
#+end_quote

I disagree with your definition of slavery.

#+begin_quote
  House elves are much more in line with the concept of vassals and retainers in older nobility.
#+end_quote

That's ridiculous. Vassals and retainers had - outside of their duties and obligations - vast amounts of personal autonomy. House Elves have none. The House Elf slavery depicted in the books is one of the most hardcore systems of slavery I can think of and yet there's people like you who want to sugarcoat it somehow. You would have been right along with the white slave owners in the 19th century who argued that this was the natural order and good for society.

  Also, and here's the kicker - YOU ARE FORCING FREEDOM ON THEM.
#+end_quote

That's an oxymoron. I refuse to discuss nonsensical statements.

#+begin_quote
  You haven't been arguing for the idea of giving them 'an option.'
#+end_quote

OF course I have. If you are free you can do whatever you want.

  Even if they were totally in favor of their own society, it needs to be abolished. What the fuck.
#+end_quote

Of course Slavery needs to be abolished. Why are we even arguing about this?! Slavery is unethical.
