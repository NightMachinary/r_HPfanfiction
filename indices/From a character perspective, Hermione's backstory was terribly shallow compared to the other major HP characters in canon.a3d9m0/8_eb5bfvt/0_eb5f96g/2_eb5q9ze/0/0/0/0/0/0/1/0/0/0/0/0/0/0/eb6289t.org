  Uhm, why are you saying this as if it's some kind of minor difference?!
#+end_quote

That's the point. It's a huge difference. The Hogwarts house elves choose not to be free or continue working with pay. They have the choice, therefore it isn't slavery.

#+begin_quote
  Which Elves don't have, which is why they are slaves.
#+end_quote

Except, again, they do, and choose not to. I continue to say this, and continue to reference the choice that they had, but you continue to ignore it.

#+begin_quote
  That has nothing to do with slavery. You can serve in all kinds of ways without being institutionally enslaved. How do you not grasp this?
#+end_quote

Yes, and they CHOOSE this way.

#+begin_quote
  I'm repeatedly telling you that freeing the slaves has nothing to do with forcing anything on them. That would be the opposite of freedom? Do you think Hermione wants to put the Elves in shackles and carry them away from their wizard masters in order to stop them from working for them? Again, that would be nonsensical.
#+end_quote

Jesus, do you even remember what's been said two replies back? The house elves. At Hogwarts. Choose to remain in their current living situation. Despite having Dobby as an example of the alternative.

Forcing them into Dobby's situation is making a decision for them. I'm taking the incredibly controversial side that you shouldn't get to make other people's decisions for them. And again, you implied that you would do the shackles thing when you said you wouldn't accept their decision! What would your alternative be, if they said 'No, I really like working here, please leave me to it?'

#+begin_quote
  No one is talking about that. I never have. Put away your strawmen. They can serve wizards as much as they like (as free people).
#+end_quote

Again, they had that option, and chose not to. Please adjust your arguments.

#+begin_quote
  Of course it is. If you can't recognize this blatant display of slavery you are clearly incapable of recognizing any kind of slavery. I'm not surprised by this, since you seem to be confused about what slavery even is.
#+end_quote

Yeah, the ability to make your own decisions regarding your station and the direction of your life. YOU seem to have some kind of problem with that.
