She's wrong about the elves mostly because she doesn't think to ask the elves what they want.

Hermione had an admirable goal there (she's absolutely right to call out house-elf slavery as exploitative bullshit) but didn't necessarily choose a good or effective way to achieve that goal, and outright ignored it when presented with evidence to suggest that her methods were offensive or hurtful to the elves she wanted to help. She was, in a way, prioritising her good *intentions* over the reality of a not particularly good *outcome*. Good intentions don't cancel out bad action or bad outcomes, and doing something to another person without their consent (as she does when she hides hats under rubbish to free elves when they pick them up) is pretty bad.

Part of that is probably just that she was fourteen. Fourteen year olds always think they're right, and for a girl like Hermione who was so used to being the smartest person in any room she entered this trait is probably even stronger. She might have mellowed and become less dogmatic later on.

But the bit we see in canon *is* something she got wrong.
