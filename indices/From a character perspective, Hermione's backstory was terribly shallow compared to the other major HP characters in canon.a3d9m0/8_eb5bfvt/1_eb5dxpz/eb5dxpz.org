  Having a normal family and upbringing should not count as the lack of character development
#+end_quote

I never said that a normal family and upbringing was a lack of character development. On the contrary, I think Hermione's lack of character development is entirely because we never explore Hermione's family and upbringing whatsoever. All we got of Hermione's family was one comic-relief scene in CoS and then they faded into non-existence for the rest of the series.

Harry's story had stakes because he was the main character. His parents were killed by Voldemort, and he was considered the chosen one by the prophecy. Harry was Voldemort's primary target above everyone else. Ron's story had stakes because Voldemort could have very easily had his family wiped out. One of the main themes of DH for him was how he felt his family was in danger while he was off with the Trio, given that Ginny was under the DE-led Hogwarts and the rest of his family were being monitored by the Ministry.

But for Hermione? We don't really know her parents other than knowing they exist. There is no true stakes for her since if her parents were murdered while she was at Hogwarts, there would be zero emotional impact since we, the reader, never knew her parents. Sure, as a muggleborn she is directly impacted by the actions of the Death Eaters, but literally everyone on Harry/Dumbledore's side was at risk of being targeted by Death Eaters. No matter what her blood status was, she was always going to be personally at risk by her close association with Harry, albeit not to the same extent as the Weasleys (given the context of the First Wizarding War coupled with the Malfoys' view of them).

My problem wth Hermione's backstory is that, as one of the three main characters, she is expected to have a backstory with similar depths as both Harry and Ron. In reality, her backstory is shallow and overshadowed by not just Harry and Ron's backstory, but also by those of Ginny, Neville, and Luna.

There is a reason that people began to enjoy Snape as a character around OotP and HBP, and it wasn't entirely due to Alan Rickman. It was because OotP and HBP (and to a far lesser extent, so did PoA) fleshed out his character beyond "horrible teacher who hates Harry". Snape's past being explored in OotP fleshed out his character and made him a bit more relatable to the reader than he was in say, CoS. *Imagine how bland and pathetic of a character Snape would have been if we never got to see his childhood in OotP and DH, or if we never knew that the Marauders bullied him or that he had an unrequited love for Lily. Imagine if we knew as much about Snape in DH as we did in the very first book. He would have just been a very dislikeable character with basically zero redeeming or relatable qualities.* Exploring his backstory not only made him a more relatable character, it objectively made him a better character compared to how he was in the first two books. If Hermione's backstory was explored more in regards to her parents, how she views the muggle world, and how she was treated by muggle kids before she got her Hogwarts letter, she certainly would have been a better and relatable character than she ever was.

*TL;DR: Having a normal family is not "lack of character development". Having a normal family that only appears in like two pages of the entire series for comic-relief is "lack of character development". We know as much about Hermione's family and her backstory in DH as we did during CoS.*
