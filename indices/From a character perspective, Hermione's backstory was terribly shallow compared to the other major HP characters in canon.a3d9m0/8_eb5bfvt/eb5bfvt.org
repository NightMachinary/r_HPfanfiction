Having a normal family and upbringing should not count as the lack of character development. Hermione is much more of a lead character/hero during the majority of pages except the climax portions. It is she who often raises the conflict or is labouring to resolve the said conflict that is the essential part of the story. And I don't buy this bs that she's a lesser character because she's too perfect or is never wrong or is the author insert. Firstly, she's the typical nerd who can't make friends and is always a little asocial. She never fits in with any one other than Harry and Ron. That too after an almost-tragedy. She's stubborn and wilful and cruel when she needs to be(her treatment of Rita and Marrieta). She's also fallible, she's wrong about Lockhart, she's wrong about the broom, she should have figured out a way to contact Sirius when Harry couldn't, she's wrong about Malfoy in HBP. She's wrong about the elves. For a fairly smart person, she's wrong about too many things. Despite all these flaws and shortcomings, she never quits. I love that about her the most. Unlike Harry and Ron, Hermione never entertains the idea of quitting or blaming other people for her losses. Imo, Hermione does not get a colourful past because her present, the here and now, is already too strong compared to other characters. If she was given more importance than she already had, the series would be needed to renamed as Hermione Granger and the Orphan Boy.
