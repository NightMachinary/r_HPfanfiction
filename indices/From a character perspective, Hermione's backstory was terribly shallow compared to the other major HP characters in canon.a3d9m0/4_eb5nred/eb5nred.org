Part of your problem arises because the story is mainly told soley from Harry's point of view and Harry himself never really interacts with Hermione's homelife because 1, he is kept at the Dursleys or else in the magical world in a place he can be monitored, and 2, He doesn't want people digging into his so he doesn't dig into other people's homelifes.

Simple put we never really seen it brought up in the story because honestly it isn't super important outside the chunks we get to the central narrative of the Harry Potter series.
