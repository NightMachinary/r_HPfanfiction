This doesn't seem like poor writing on JKR's part. Harry is, in general, oblivious. He doesn't seem to go out of his way to ask people for personal information (or perhaps trivial conversations like "How're your parents?" don't make it to the books)

People are mentioned in the story when they're relevant to the plot (eg Xenophilius Lovegood/ Frank and Alice Longbottom) or if Harry spends a lot of time with them (the Weasleys). The Grangers fall into neither of these categories.

I agree, though, that Hermione's relationship with her parents is an interesting new angle since it's bridging two worlds. Many fanfics touch on this subject, but overall not very satisfactorily.
