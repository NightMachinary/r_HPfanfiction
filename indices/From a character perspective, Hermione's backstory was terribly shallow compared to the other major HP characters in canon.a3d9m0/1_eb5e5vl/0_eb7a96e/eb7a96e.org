And Muggles are never relevant to the plot.

Much as you punish someone who kicks a puppy, wizards who abuse Muggles are to be punished. And just as you love your dog, wizards may have great affection for Muggles. But a Muggle is never /useful/ or /important/. This is the position not only held by wizards but also endorsed by the narrative itself, in that the three main characters (including the one who is Muggleborn) all hold this attitude.

Hermione is just as important as Ron to the story. Her "backstory" isn't mentioned for the sole reason that there is nothing worth saying about Muggles.
