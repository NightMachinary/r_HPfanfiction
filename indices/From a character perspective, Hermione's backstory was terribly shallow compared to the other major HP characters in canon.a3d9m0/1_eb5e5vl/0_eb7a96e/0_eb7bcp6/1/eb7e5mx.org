Not to mention that one of the major world building aspect is the statute of secrecy and the concept of hiding from muggles. Harry is almost thrown out of Hogwarts for exposing magic to muggles.

Clearly the narrative and the world cares a lot about muggles.

That a presumably entirely ordinary pair of muggles who want the best for their magical child are entirely irrelevant to the plot is a different issue.
