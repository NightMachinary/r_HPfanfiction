Well. Hermione is the Mary Sue of HP. That is why readers like to identify with her. She perfectly combines the positive traits from all the houses with absolutely nothing about her that weighs this out, that alone makes her the perfect example of a Mary Sue.

Her character is not rich and interesting, because that would mean giving her actually negative traits.
