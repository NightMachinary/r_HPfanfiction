Okay, that works. Yep, my issue is that your definition of 'importance' is completely different from mine. I view what the character actually does in the series as more important than what their backstory is. Hell, I consider Hermione's lack of a dramatic backstory to be a strength of the series. Not everyone has to have a massive, impoverished family or a tragic origin. This is given weight to the idea of an 'everyman' protagonist in literature and fanfiction, especially in the realm of Self-Inserts.

This is also why I felt the comparison to Sakura was totally unfair - Hermione contributes a lot to the actual plot, and has lots of attention paid to her character development. Sakura... cuts her hair and learns medicine.
