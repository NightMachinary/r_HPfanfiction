  Could you please provide your definition of 'importance?' It sounds a lot different to mine.

By importance, I mean in terms of what they are and what we learn about them rather than what they actually do in the series. What I really mean in terms of importance is their role and backstory, though in almost all examples of media, the main characters with the most appearances are often the most important characters in said work. Logically, you'd think that the most important character would be Harry, and then both Ron and Hermione would be tied for second, given that those three are the main character. Yet as readers, we learn much more about so many other characters than Hermione, and it doesn't make sense given her importance as a main character.

Obviously Harry is the most important of those six I mentioned, since he's the protagonist and the character whose perspective we view the series from. Following that would be Ron, given that we know more about him and his backstory than the aforementioned characters minus Harry. Ginny is arguably equal or slightly below Ron, given that she doesn't appear in the series as much as Ron and Hermione do. We learn quite a bit about Neville's life pre-Hogwarts like how he was dropped from a window and bounced, and that he lived with his grandmother, and Neville's importance only increased following GoF and even moreso during OotP. Finally, Luna's backstory makes her a bigger character than Hermione but that doesn't say much. The problem with Luna is that she debuts in OotP, meaning she's appears the least out of all six of these characters by far. However we learn enough about her life to actually flesh her character out a bit from being just a generic character.

On a related note, I enjoyed "The Other Minister" chapter of HBP because it touched upon a commonly-wondered topic at the time: How was the muggle world impacted by the wizarding world. We see how the Muggle Prime Minister is powerless to stop these things that seemingly happen unexplainably, only for Fudge to inform him of magic and the magical world. The prime minister's dialogue with Fudge and then Scrimgeour shows a muggle perspective of magic not from the perspective of someone who hates magic (i.e. Vernon Dursley) but from someone clueless about magic yet holding a grand position of power. He thought that magic, rather than something to fear, was something that could solve any problem. Though, as Scrimgeour told him, didn't take into account that the other side also has magic.

Given that Hermione is more intelligent and knowledgeable than Harry, it would have been interesting to see a very-early chapter from her perspective (i.e. similarly to chapters like "The Riddle House" and "The Other Minister"). The muggle world is understandably not presented that positively by Harry due to Harry's own childhood under the Dursleys coupled with the far superior experience of Hogwarts and the Burrow. I think that seeing muggles and the muggle world from the perspective of an actual muggleborn raised by two parents who love her would provide a different take on muggles and the muggle world than we would get from Harry.

Because the narrative describes people and things based on Harry's own perception of them, a Hermione-focused chapter would have likely give us insight into Hermione's view of things. It would show what she thinks of her parents and their ever-distancing relationship, or perhaps Harry and Ron are described differently in her perspective than they are from Harry's perspective, or what she thinks of muggles and her own childhood experiences in complete contrast to Harry's experiences with the Dursleys.

*TL;DR: We as readers get very little of Hermione's backstory or family in canon despite her being one of the three main characters. It stands out so much when comparing her to Harry and Ron, let alone characters like Neville and Ginny, or even someone like Fleur who appears in canon far less than Hermione.*
