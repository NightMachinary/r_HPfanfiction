Not sure I buy this, honestly. We do get a few throwaway lines of the Grangers interacting with the magical world - I'm pretty sure there's a scene or two about them needing help with changing money at Gringotts and getting Arthur Weasley all worked up. That said, characters get explored in HP when they have something to add to the narrative. We don't learn much about what it's like for the richer purebloods, because it doesn't add much to Harry's story. The Weasleys and The Burrow get explored because that's how Harry experiences a loving family for the first time.

In terms of viewpoint, Harry provides the same attitude and biases that the Grangers would. Ron is the street-smart kid who knows everything wizards are expected to know about wizard culture, Hermione knows everything books would teach you, but not much about unspoken things, and Harry is a complete newcomer who's overawed by everything. The Grangers would have just been two new Harrys or Hermiones, depending on how much they read up on everything. So they aren't contributing anything in terms of narrative or viewpoint. Why bother exploring them? Sure, it would be interesting to see, but given how much of any manuscript ends up on the cutting room floor, I can totally see an editor saying "Why are we focusing so much on the dentists when you have an entire wizard world to flesh out?"

  We are told Hermione is equally important as Ron, yet if you look at the HP series objectively, the order of character importance would probably be closer to Harry > Ron => Ginny > Neville > Luna > Hermione.

Could you please provide your definition of 'importance?' It sounds a lot different to mine.
