I'm really defensive about the idea that being bookish and talented and the literal embodiment of everything Voldemort thought was dirty (Muggle-born) is not enough backstory. Partly this is because of the fact that women often are given trauma as backstories (at least hers was story appropriate, here) or romance as what makes them interesting.

Let her have brown hair and brown eyes and be smart! She made her own way without being one of a huge family or super strange or lost her parents at a very young age or bitten by a monster. She's proof that you can be important and powerful without trauma or a super special backstory. That's so incredibly important to me, despite how it can feel like a disservice to the character herself.
