I completely agree that Hermione's backstory should have been filled in a bit more, even just a POV chapter of her and her parents, perhaps as she's saying her goodbyes and getting picked up by the Order?

I feel this lack of backstory filling exposition could tie into how Rowling kinda...glossed over things as she was writing and instead of thinking through how things made sense from what she's actually written, she went with her 'master plan' on the back of napkins in a shoebox from when she started writing the series in the 90's. Like, Harry and Hermione being insistent that they think of each other as siblings, and somehow unlike every other teenager are incapable of entertaining the idea of any of all their friends as an eligible partner for a second. That makes a lot more sense having heard about how in the early drafts it was the Grangers that found Harry and raised him, because they'd have basically grown up as brother and sister. But that plotline was thrown aside because it makes little sense to just raise whatever baby you find, the likelyhood of the people who find & raise the BWL being muggles but having a witch as a daughter is extremely low(but who knows, maybe Harry'd have infected Hermione with his unnaturalness like the Dursleys theorized all along!), and there'd be no Dursleyesque antagonism at home to inspire the protagonist to jump wholeheartedly into the magical world without looking back if Harry's homelife had been happy, and if it wasn't happy then there wouldn't be any examples at all of muggles raising wizarding children well, which kinda makes the Death Eaters right.

Besides, it's more fulfilling for Hermione to have her own independent journey into the wizarding world before becoming friends with Harry & Ron, as opposed to just being Harry's obnoxious older sister. But I do wish Rowling had done -something- to include the Grangers. Maybe have the trio regroup at their house after the Weasley wedding fiasco, drawn the DEs in with their flippant use of Voldemort's name, thus giving Hermione a much better excuse to force her parent's hand and send them to the opposite side of the globe.
