A good writer or editor, like a good film director, needs to keep asking herself "what does this add to the story", and if it doesn't help tell the story - don't write it, or at least cut it out in a later draft.

Harry's muggle backstory? That adds a lot. Ron's magical back story? That adds a lot too. Partly it serves to explain the magical world to the reader, partly it serves to introduce a large number of characters. Hermione's muggle background, however, wouldn't add anything significant. It wouldn't help the reader understand the world, and none of her family or muggle acquaintances had any real role in the conflict so don't need introducing to the reader.
