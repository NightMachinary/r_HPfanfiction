We don't learn much about Hermione's family because they're not important to the plot. However, I do agree that Hermione was kind of a shallow character in general, she barely even had any flaws and was more or less the self insert of the author. She never really had to pay for her mistakes the way Ron or Harry did, never had to apologize for anything, she was basically always right , even if only by chance and even when she did questionable things , like attacking Ron with birds, the text portrayed her as completely justified.
