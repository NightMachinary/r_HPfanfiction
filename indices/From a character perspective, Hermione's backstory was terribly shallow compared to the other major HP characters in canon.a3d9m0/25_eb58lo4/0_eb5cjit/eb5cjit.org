Hermione's flaws include, but not limited to: stubborn, dramatic, easily angered regarding her classes/homework/examinations, limited sense of humor, narrow-minded, doesn't like to be out-performed in class (with the exception of her being fine with Harry better at Defense Against the Dark Arts), S.P.E.W., rather ruthless, assumes she's always right, makes decisions she knows could hurt/harm a person and shows no remorse for it, insecurity, inability to talk about her emotions, petty, proud, presumptuous...
