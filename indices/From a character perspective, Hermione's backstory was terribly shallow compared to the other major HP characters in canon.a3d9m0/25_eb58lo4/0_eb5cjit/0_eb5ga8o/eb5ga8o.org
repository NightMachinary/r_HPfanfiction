She was portrayed as always right. For example, yes she was ruthless but the text always made her actions look completely justified, nobody criticized her for her ruthlessness. (at least nobody we're supposed to take seriously) Yes she was stubborn with the Half-Blood Prince book but she was STILL right in the end, even if only by chance. These are not real flaws when they're shown to be justified.

As about her being narrow-minded, we all know she's not. Throughout the series, she showed that she's quite open-minded, sometimes even more than Ron and Harry. Just because she didn't take the Deathly Hallows seriously, it doesn't mean she's narrow minded. Besides in the end, she was right about the Deathly Hallows, even Dumbledore didn't want them to rely on the Hallows too much.
