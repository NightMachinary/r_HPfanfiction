Flaws are flaws, whether they're shown to be justified (when they weren't) or not.

She wasn't just stubborn with the Half-Blood Prince's book; she was stubborn throughout the entire series.

And a narrow-minded Hermione (which she is) didn't simply take the Deathly Hallows seriously, she doubted the existence of them. Also, her and Luna's disagreement/argument in Order of the Phoenix if heliopaths exist shouldn't be overlooked either.

  "Yes, he's got an army of helopaths," said Luna solemnly.

  "No, he hasn't," snapped Hermione.

  "Yes, he has," said Luna.

  "What are heliopaths?" asked Neville, looking blank.

  "They're spirits of fire," said Luna, her protuberant eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever. "Great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of -"

  "They don't exist, Neville," said Hermione tartly.

  "Oh yes they do!" said Luna angrily.

  "I'm sorry, but where's the /proof/ of that?" snapped Hermione.

  "There are plenty of eyewitness accounts, just because you're so *narrow-minded* you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you -"

Edit: And she wasn't always portrayed as right. A prime example being she thought the Half-Blood Prince's text was akin to that of Tom Riddle's diary. While some curses in the book were harmful, it turned out to be just a potion's textbook with Snape's adjustments. Also, the book actually helped Harry on several occasions (winning Felix Felicis and thus obtaining Slughorn's memory of horcruxes, and savings Ron's life when he was poisoned) instead of trying to kill Harry like Riddle's diary did.
