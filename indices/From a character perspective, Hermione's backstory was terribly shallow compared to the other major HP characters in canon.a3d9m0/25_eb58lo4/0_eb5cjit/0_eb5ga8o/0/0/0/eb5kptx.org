  There is no reason to believe that Luna's nonsense has a basis.

Except that wasn't the point I was making. It was Hermione's close-mindedness to not believe anything without proof, hence Luna's comment about Hermione needing to have everything showed to her, literally, and sometimes even that isn't enough for her (e.g. Xenophilius Lovegood's explanation of the Deathly Hallows).

And when was Hermione shown to be right? All your doing is cherry-picking small instances her and there to prove your flawed argument.
