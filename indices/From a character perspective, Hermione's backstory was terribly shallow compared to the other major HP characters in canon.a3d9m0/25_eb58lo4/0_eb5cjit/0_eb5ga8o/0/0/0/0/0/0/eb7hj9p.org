No one called her out for permanently disfiguring a fellow student or trapping a person in a jar. Or sicking a flock of birds on Ron.

  stubborn/ assumes she's always right
#+end_quote

These two kind of go together and that's what the other person was arguing about: she's still right (even partially) when she's being stubborn.

#+end_quote

Yes, when the other person is using a cheat sheet... and Harry calls her out on it once and it's never mentioned again. He doesn't point out the other times she was wrong like Malfoy being up to something or how the house elves didn't want to be free.

Sorry, you're gonna need to remind me when she was dramatic because I'm starting a blank past first year.

Kind of goes in conjunction with the earlier "stubborn" bit as she ends up being right or doesn't get called out on it.

What were the ramifications of her "flaws"? Dobby taking the clothing she tried to use to trick the house elves into freeing themselves when they didn't want it? Still ending up with Ron when she tended to belittle him throughout their school years? Or how about not getting detention or a prison sentence for not only causing permanent injury to another student but also causing a government official to be kidnapped by hostile forces? Flaws are supposed to have repercussions like Ron's jealousy causing him to lose his best friend for a while.... twice. Or Harry's need to save people almost getting him, and others, killed on a yearly basis.
