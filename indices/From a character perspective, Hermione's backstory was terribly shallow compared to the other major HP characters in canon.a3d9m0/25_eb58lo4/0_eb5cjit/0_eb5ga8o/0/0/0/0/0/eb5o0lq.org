Of course she doesn't have to believe things without proof but the fact that she vehemently opposes others beliefs (not just with Luna's heliopaths) is a *flaw* of hers. And she wasn't proven right on the Deathly Hallows issue. As I stated above, she didn't believe their existence in the first place when they actually do exist. Also, you say she was more open-minded than Harry in dealing with Kreacher. I agree with that. But another *flaw* of hers was championing S.P.E.W. when she was clearly in the wrong in trying to and wanting to free Hogwarts' house-elves when they didn't want to be. Again, you're cherry-picking a few things here and there and ignoring everything else.

How come you haven't said anything about her being ruthless, stubborn, dramatic, the fact she hates to be out-performed in classes, assumes she's always right, proud, petty, presumptuous, showing little remorse?

I've presented flaws of hers and so has [[/u/pdv190]] but something about it isn't clicking with you. As it is, your argument holds little validity and therefore, I'll be off.
