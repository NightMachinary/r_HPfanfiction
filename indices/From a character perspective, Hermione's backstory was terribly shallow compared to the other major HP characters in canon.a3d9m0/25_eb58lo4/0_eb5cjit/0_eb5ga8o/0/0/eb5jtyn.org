Lol, she was right about Luna too. There is no reason to believe that Luna's nonsense has a basis. Harry didn't believe Luna either.

If someone is shown to be right , then there is no flaw. Having a flaw implies that there are negative consequences and in her case, there aren't. She's just right as simple as that.

The ONLY time she was shown to be wrong (partially) was with the house elves.
