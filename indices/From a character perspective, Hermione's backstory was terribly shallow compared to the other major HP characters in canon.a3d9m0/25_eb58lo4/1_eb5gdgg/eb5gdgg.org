You just made me doubt we read the same book. Hermione is the girl no one wanted to be friends with until fate brought her close to Harry and Ron, so they can perceive her best qualities? Hermione is bossy and knows what's best for everyone, teacher's pet and rigid rule follower, kinda self-righteous (even hypocritically sometimes), generally unwilling to admit she is wrong when she is wrong, rude to people she thinks are wrong and often insensitive to people's emotions (poor Lavender's bunny). I can provide examples, but I am sure people know what I am talking about. She pays for it by being rather unpopular and constantly having conflicts.

The thing is those qualities are kinda balanced by the fact that she is meant to be more intelligent than most people. The way you portray it, aside from giving her random trivia bits and good grades is to have her be able to see and deduct things others can't, i.e. be right. That's why she is rarely actually wrong, otherwise her character would be pretty unbearable, imo.

I wish they'd shown her parents as an example of good muggles, to counter Dursleys. But I see how they might have been out of the scope of the plot. Hermione is pretty fleshed out character as it is.
