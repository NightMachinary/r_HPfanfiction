To reiterate what others said in this thread, backstory isn't everything and you could make a fully fleshed out character through just viewing their interactions with the story.

She has a very clear arc of going from an isolated nerdy and sometimes judgmental kid to being an exceptionally driven person with strong relationships and increased empathy. This arc is so well done in fact that even though she changes throughout the books her core identity is still there which is a search for knowledge and an understanding of justice.

Her struggles, her growth, and her interactions really formed her into a believable person without the aid of a backstory so at least I wouldn't consoder that bad writing

Sorry if this doesn't make sense or its rambly had a real weird day
