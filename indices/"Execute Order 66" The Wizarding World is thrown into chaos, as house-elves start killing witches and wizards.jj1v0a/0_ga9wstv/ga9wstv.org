Like Dobby though, their plans to kill wizards fail because of how ridiculous they are.

Kreacher's plan to kill Harry via a fall down the stairs culminating with an anvil falling on his head ends with Harry deciding to remodel the staircase because of a loose floorboard and wondering why the Blacks had an anvil of all things.

The House Elves at Hogwarts smuggle in the giant squid into the great hall to kill all the wizards, giving it alcohol to make in more excitable. The giant squid just ends up playing with the students while the teachers look on.

Winky is ostracized by the rest of the house elves for just stabbing a wizard.
