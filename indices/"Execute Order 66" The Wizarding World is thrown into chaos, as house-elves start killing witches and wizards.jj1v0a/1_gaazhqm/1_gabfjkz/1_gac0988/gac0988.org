i'm personally rather fond of the idea that Salazar wasn't actually a blood purist. that he had no problem with muggle-born, just muggles themselves. and that the disagreement between the founders was because Salazar saw the muggle-born maintaining ties with their muggle relatives as a threat to wizarding society, and the others disagreed.

most of the ones i've read with this premise usually throws in a son or grandson also named Salazar who WAS a blood purist, and history simply has them confused with one another.
