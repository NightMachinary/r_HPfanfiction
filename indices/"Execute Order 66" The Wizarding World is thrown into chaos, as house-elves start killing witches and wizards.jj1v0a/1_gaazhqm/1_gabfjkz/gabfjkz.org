Good premise but that can easily end up in the same line of thought death eater apologists follow. 'Because of the witch hunts muggles are mistreated and muggles borns a risk to the magical world'

Punishing someone for the misdeeds of their ancestors is a crime against humanity and so is slavery.

Now if this were acknoledged by modern witches and wizards but iriversable it would make ourselves a tragic figure and provide the dangers of the dark arts. However, we don't see any of that in cannon could make an interesting political problem for a AU fic though.

It really depends on the story tone you are going for.
