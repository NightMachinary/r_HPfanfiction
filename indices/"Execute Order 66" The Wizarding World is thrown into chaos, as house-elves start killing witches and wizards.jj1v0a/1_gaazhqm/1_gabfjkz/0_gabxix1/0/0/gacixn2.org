I love this idea

I just read one where house elves are gremlins that get turned into house elves with a spell lmao and they're enslaved to pay back the damage they did. a big old stretch but kind of entertaining in its randomness

I have been trying to think of an origin story for them, but it's a tricky one it have it not be slavery apologetics or cheapen the horrors of what's gone on in the real world
