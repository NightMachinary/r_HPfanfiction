Hard to kill someone who live in your household and slit your throat while you are asleep, like how the first Elderwand owner Antioch Peverell got offed;

Or poison your food/drink, like how Hepzibah Smith got wasted;

House-Elves turning on their masters during their most vulnerable moments can be absolutely devastating.

Interestingly though, only those really rich Purebloods seem to have them, so if this actually happens, most Wizards should be fine and see many new opportunities in the Magical world opening up to them.

Finally, imagine how much inheritance some of their distant relatives are going to get!
