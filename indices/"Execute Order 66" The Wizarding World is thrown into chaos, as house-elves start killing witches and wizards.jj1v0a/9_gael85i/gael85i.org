I always liked idea that Hause Elves are a low level demons like imps or more common fae like brownies that were enslaved to harness their magic. It may be result of a summoning ritual of some powerful mage or group of children disrupting accidentally fae ring one midsummer... with time it was forgotten and 'elves' became simply kept as servants.

What if the high tier demons/ fae king let wizards get away with it because they had a far reaching goal in mind...
