I cannot reccomend how much Fate is breaking everything. So underrated. Updated constantly and already over 1 million.

Trust me the first 5 chapters might feel weird but as soon as it hits Hogwarts is when it gets to the fucking chimichangas. It's so sad that not that many people know about it, or overlook it. No Harry/Ginny so far and no slash. It also has the best pairing that is so unusual I NEEd the next chapter now.
