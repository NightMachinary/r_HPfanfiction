Linkffn(12021325) Im pretty sure you like the billionth person I'm recommending this to. It's my favorite fic and my go to when people ask for recs. Just over 400k words, and it is such a wild ride. The story itself is absolutely incredible. The summary is a bit choppy, but if you can look past that I highly recommend reading it. It's DarkSlytherin!Harry and WBWL. I binged this in like a day and a half without sleeping. Try reading at least to the sorting and by then you'll know if you like the styles and where the plot is going. If you don't like reading on ff.net it's crossposted on AO3. I don't want to link it bc the summary gets all weirdly formatted. Anyways, happy reading!!
