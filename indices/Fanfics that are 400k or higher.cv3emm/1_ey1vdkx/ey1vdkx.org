Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) is half a million words, and is the start of a series that is up to about a million. Has some really nice world building about the Marauders' generation, too.

Nightmares of Futures Past is sadly incomplete, and FFN took it down for spurious reasons (a bogus copyright claim), but is over 400k and has my favourite characterisation of Ginny, Neville, and Luna (seriously, when I think about them, I often have to stop and work out whether I'm remembering canon or NoFP). Links are at [[http://www.viridiandreams.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=5629]]

And opinions on its quality are sharply divided, but Methods of Rationality is over 600k. I generally recommend starting with the alternate beginning, linkffn(Daystar's remix of HPMoR).

Incidentally, are you limiting your request to Harry Potter fics, or do you just want to read anything long?
