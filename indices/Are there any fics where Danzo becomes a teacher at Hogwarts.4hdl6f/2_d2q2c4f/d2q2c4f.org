You do realize that any chakra technique from Naruto is extremely OP and apocalyptic?

That and Dumbles wouldn't take him as a teacher 'cause he's not 'dumbledore-shifty'. He'll prolly try to make him as a pawn and end up in a genjutsu. Even with occlumency, that many copy wheel eyes would overpower any defence.

If you're still hankering for a decent crossover i would suggest linkffn(uchiha fukurou)
