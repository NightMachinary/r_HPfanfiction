There was a dimension travel fic where super!Harry has to fight Lucius Malfoy who was secretly using Voldemort. I can't remember what its called but I'll do some digging. I remember Ron and Ginny were in Slytherin and both shitty people. Harry mom and sister are alive in the new world as well. It's definitely a HHr fic too.
