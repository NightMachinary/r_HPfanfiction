I consider the films different entities. In the films I allow my mind to focus on what happens, and in the books I'm allowed to play around.

... and that's the great thing about books! If I read about a werewolf in Harry Potter - particularly an 'Alpha' - I imagine this great hairy 7ft tall+ bulky man, who could tear a door of a car easily. But he could either slobber like an animal or he could talk intelligently all the time, that's up to the author.
