to be fair, Hermione is physically described when she is 11. Then the assumption is that she happened to be that one girl on the planet who doesn't change much as she undergoes puberty for some reason.

Hermione in first movie basically stepped out of the book as far as I am concerned - and Rowling, being the creator of the character, probably fell into the same trap that many parents do, as in having a hard time to transition mental image of the character with age - after all, unlike most parents she didn't have a physical, visible proof of that transition to help her adjust.
