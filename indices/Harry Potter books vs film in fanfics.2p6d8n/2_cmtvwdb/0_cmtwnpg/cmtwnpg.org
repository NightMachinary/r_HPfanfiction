Yeah, Snape's character was portrayed very well, Alan Rickman did a great job, but I just think the actor was better looking than the Snape in the books. No greasy hair, no yellow uneven teeth... and I think it's with the actor's image in mind that Snape became such a popular character. I mean take all the "Snape is Harry's father" fics. I can imagine Lily falling for someone like Alan Rickman's Snape. Dark, mysterious and good looking in his own way. It's harder for me to imagine the same with book Snape. It's the same with Emma Watson. She's way better looking than JK imagined Hermione. She said so herself in interviews. So all these fanfics where Hermione is this beautiful young woman instead of a nerdy bookworm are more based on the films than on the books. I too imagine someone as good looking as Emma Watson when I read about Hermione. I never think of her as the 'ugly duckling'. Of course it makes sense that they cast more attractive actors, they had movie tickets to sell.

I agree about Ginny. Never thought about it concerning her character before, but it makes sense that the way she's portrayed in fanfics is influenced by Bonnie Wright's acting.
