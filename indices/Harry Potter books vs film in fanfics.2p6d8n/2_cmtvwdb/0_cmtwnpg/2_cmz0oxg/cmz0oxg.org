Fwiw, tho obviously Emma Watson is model-hot, it's clear Hermione gets much better looking; Harry thinks she's very pretty st the Yule Ball, Krum finds her and Ginny both equally attractive, and in her sixth year, Hermione has no problem getting Cormac to agree to go to Slughorn's party with her. She knew Smith would have, too. So it's reasonable that she's pretty good-looking.
