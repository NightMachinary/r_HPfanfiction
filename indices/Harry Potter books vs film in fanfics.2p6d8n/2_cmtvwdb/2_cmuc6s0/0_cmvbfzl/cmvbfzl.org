The problem wasn't so much that Snape wasn't in his thirties, they aged up a lot of adults which makes sense. It was more that none of the characters that were aged up were played by actors that were a roughly similar age. Snape supposed to be the same age as Remus and Sirius starts to stretch the imagination a bit when the actors playing Remus and Sirius are a good 15 years younger.
