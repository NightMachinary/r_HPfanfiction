I was miffed that they broke it in the movies. Sure it makes more of a visual impact, but its doesn't make any sense. Surely if it could literally be broken that way, there was at least /one/ power-hungry wizard in the long list of power-hungry wizards who had a caring and intelligent family who tried?! You can't just break death's hold like that!
