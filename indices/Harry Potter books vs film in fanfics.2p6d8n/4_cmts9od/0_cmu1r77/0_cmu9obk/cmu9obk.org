I've had such a theory for awhile now. Harry's wand "learned" from Voldemort's during Priori Incantatem in the graveyard and then his holly wand "learned" from the Elder wand when he repaired it.

It therefore stands to reason that even though he broke the wand (which I actually prefer over the books) Harry is still in possession of the most powerful wand. BOOM! A plausible way to have superpower!Harry.

Someone needs to write it because I can't finish anything I start.
