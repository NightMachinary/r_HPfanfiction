Blah!

I'd rather have my child (in the future) have seen him stow away the wand, place a fake one in the tomb, and say some soppy thing to Hermione like, /this shit is powerful - but I won't let it corrupt me, just as it didn't corrupt Dumbledore, and it will be a weapon against darkness.../

Thus my child learns that power has its place in society, but only the fools and bastards of the world use it badly - and that the unassuming Harry Potter had hidden the largest power of them all; but didn't use it - not even letting it be known he had it...

Crack!

Credits roll and the Hogwarts quote comes up "Never Tickle a Sleeping Dragon"

Insert flash image of Harry smirking as he pockets the wand...
