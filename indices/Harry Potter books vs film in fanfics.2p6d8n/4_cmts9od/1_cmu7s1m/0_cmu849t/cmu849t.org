I know what you're saying, and it's definitely more artistic the way you're describing it; /however/ Harry Potter, for people who haven't grown up with it and loved the story before the movies, having the Elder Wand snapped is a recognizable and satisfying trope. Kind of like "this silly thing caused so many problems" Mean Girls style. People like that. I can see why they went with it for a summer blockbuster.
