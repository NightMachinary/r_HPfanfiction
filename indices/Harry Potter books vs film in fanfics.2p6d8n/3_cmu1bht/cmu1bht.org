Ron the Death Eater definitely comes more from the films. Its very easy to dismiss Ron's character in fanfic (especially H/Hr or Hr/OC) when the films basically upped Hermione's competency in every area and reduced Ron to 'likes eating, scared of things, is lazy, betrays Harry in 2/8 films'. Where Ron and Harry fell out in the books there was a lot of Ron-Harry friendship moments to balance these out; as well as scenes and moments explaining why Ron might feel overshadowed; the films just portrayed him as a bit of a jealous dick for no reason and also as if he was Harry's 'best friend' by default given Harry's abusive childhood and the fact that their other year-mates weren't fleshed out as much.

I also think Harry/Luna ships surged in popularity after the films' portrayal of the characters (especially OOTP) and Neville/Luna ships as well for that matter - which still seem to me very much like Pair the Spares.
