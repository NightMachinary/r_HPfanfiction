If Arthur was Lily's father then Ginny would be Harry's half-aunt (she'd be Lily's half-sister). If it were Arthur's father then she'd be Harry's half-first cousin. Any other plausible Weasley male would bring more distance between them, so it really wouldn't be all that bad from a genetic standpoint (or societal, considering the wizarding world's pureblood family trees).
