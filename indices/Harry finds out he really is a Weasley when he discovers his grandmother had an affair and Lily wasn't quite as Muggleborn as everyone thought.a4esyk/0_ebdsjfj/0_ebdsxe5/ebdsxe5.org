It'd be horrifying for Harry and Ginny if they'd grown up believing first-cousin marriage was bad. Ginny definitely might have if Molly and Arthur pointed at the Blacks and said "don't be like them".

As for Harry looking like James if Lily shagged Arthur, that's simple---you do what a load of Severitus writers do and say Harry's appearance was charmed. Either by Lily to hide the affair, or by Dumbledore for The Greater Good^{TM}
