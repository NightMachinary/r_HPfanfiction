If we're sticking close to canon we never see Harry get any sort of sexual education and the wizarding world is full of light inbreeding (I say light because it seems to mostly be cousins, not siblings or anything). I don't recall hearing anyone say anything about the inbreeding in canon (even from Muggle borns and "blood traitors"), so it probably wouldn't be too horrifying.
