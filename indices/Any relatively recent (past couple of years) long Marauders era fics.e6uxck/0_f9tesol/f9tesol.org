These are all unfinished, but at least the first two update regularly.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14447502/chapters/33372651]]) This one feels pretty canon compliant, is well-written and does a good job of bringing in other characters than just the Marauders.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19900360/chapters/47135293]]) This one is very explicit/a bit dark when descrbing teenage life, and also very funny. I think the characterisation and different dynamics of MWPP is spot on.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12968535/chapters/29646957]]) This one has a unique plot and is Lily's point of view. Feels a bit American but not necessarily in a bad way.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16281977/chapters/38077013]]) Another unique plot, extremely good characterisation and very funny and with some explicit scenes. I'm a bit heartbroken that it hasn't updated for so long, because it's very closed to finished.
