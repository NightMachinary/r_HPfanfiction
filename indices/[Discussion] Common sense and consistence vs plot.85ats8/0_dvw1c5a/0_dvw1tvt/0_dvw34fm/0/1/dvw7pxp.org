Because they are aimed at children, who interpret the books in different ways. For example, they wouldn't make the connection that the Death Eaters probably raped hundreds, if not thousands, because that's what usually happens in war. They would probably also not know what Centaurs are infamous for and probably think that Umbridge got roughed up a bit, not that the centaurs ran a train on her. They probably also don't realise how utterly incompetent any adult in the series is and the moral implications of certain things like Dumbledore admitting that he knew about the Ten Dark Years.

I love the Harry Potter books for their idea, the outline of the World with a magical school, the different groups and characters. Yes, it is vague in some places, but that makes it a great canvas for fanfics. Compare that to GoT, where the sheer amount of interlinked plots makes any sort of fanfiction fall short compared to the original works.
