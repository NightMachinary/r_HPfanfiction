Tough question.

As a reader I guess common sense is the most expendable, after all irl people won't always act according to common sense. Character being OOC irks me, but can be tolerated. Plot definetely has to be consistent though.

As a writer, if I can't have all three it means I've failed, and the chapter has to be rewritten. Again, though, common sense can be left out if it's in character for someone to act that way in a certain situation.
