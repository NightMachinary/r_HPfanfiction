Depends on the type of inconsistency.

Logistical inconsistency is something that I'm relatively flexible on. How a character gets from A to B, or the Hogwarts timetable, is not something I consider all that important unless it feeds into a plot point.

On the other hand, I find few things more annoying than inconsistency in a character's abilities. If you establish a character as having a certain level of magical skill but then have them lose to someone much weaker than them in order to force a certain plotline, this is not acceptable to me. The prime example of this is how a time travelling Harry with Dumbledore-level skills (or at least, the skills of an experienced Auror) still gets disarmed by Pettigrew in the graveyard.
