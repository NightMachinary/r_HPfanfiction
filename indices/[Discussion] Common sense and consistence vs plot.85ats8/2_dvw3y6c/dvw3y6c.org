In the end, for me, plot trumps all. The end goal is telling a good story. However, that means that there has to be consistency as well in terms of characterization and character abilities. If you use a deus ex machina by making the main character suddenly perform magic way beyond his capabilities in order to beat the bad guys, then that takes away the suspense. However, used well, you can use magical capabilities to tell a story of growth and overcoming impossible odds.

There's a balance to be found here, and as you get more and more experienced as a writer, you get better at finding that sweet spot between plot/consistency priorities.
