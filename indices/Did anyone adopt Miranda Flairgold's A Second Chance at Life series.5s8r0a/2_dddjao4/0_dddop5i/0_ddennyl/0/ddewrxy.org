It's still one of my all time favorites.

I get that a lot of people don't like it because it is a little cliche, though at the time of writing, I don't remember those things being nearly as cliche.

Harry is a little overpowered, but he's not the only one, so it's really that there's a culture of people that are totally OP compared to the average person.

I also LOVE the world building that went on in that fic. Hell, if she dropped the Harry is Rakhesh thing, and wrote out some of the basis of why Harry went to Akren, it could be its own original work, it's that AU. And I'd totally buy the series if she did go that route!
