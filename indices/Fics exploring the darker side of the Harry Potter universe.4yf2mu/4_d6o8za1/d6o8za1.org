Marriage laws represented one of the worst parts of the Wizarding world.

I like five levels of different responses to it:

Level 1: Protagonists ran away as in *Escape*, linkffn(11916243)

Level 2: Protagonists led an exodus of a large amount of people, as in *Harry Potter's Reaction to the Marriage Law*, linkffn(6049450)

Level 3: Protagonists asked a third party to take out certain individuals, as in *There's Always a Way*, linkffn(2612901)

Level 4: Protagonists took out instigators of the Marriage Law by themselves, as in ?

Level 5: Protagonists overthrew the government and systematically executed anyone who voted for the Marriage Law, as in *Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005)
