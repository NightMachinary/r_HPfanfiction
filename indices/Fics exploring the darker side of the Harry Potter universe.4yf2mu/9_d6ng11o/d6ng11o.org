linkffn(10918531; 11070121; 11407944; 11686212) - Matou Shinji series is a crossover with Nasuverse, but ine that is heavily grounded in HP canon. The dark stuff on the wizards side is mostly background early on, but the further we go, the more ugliness is shown. Intolerance, nationalism and populism are major elements of the curent part.
