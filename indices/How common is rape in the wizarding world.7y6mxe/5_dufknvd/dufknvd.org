For all the love potions and charms, we have few in-canon examples of attempted sex coerced by magic. I think it's more to do with the writing than the /likely/ state of the logically-consistent outcome of memory charms and love potions existing.

It's possible that it's so common people don't even see it as rape: cf Molly Prewett giving Arthur Weasley a 'nudge' with potions, how much of a 'nudge' was it? Or Dumbledore's sympathy for Merope Gaunt and lack of use of the term to describe what she did to Tom Riddle Senior.

Or it's possible that it is very rare, and Merope Gaunt's use is a wild aberration. Cf: Hermione's capture. She is tortured horribly and kept for a while, but there's no mention of rape. And there's no mention of unwanted children forced on prisoners.

I think you can argue in any direction at all, from it being a common hobby for a certain set of wizards and witches, to it being incredibly unusual even when murder is happening frequently.
