...? Voldemort's dad was basically raped lol. Voldemort's mother, Merope Gaunt used a love potion on Voldemort's dad, Tom Riddle Sr, then she stopped giving him the potion believing he was truly in love (At this point she's pregnant, not sure how long though) Tom Riddle freaks out and leaves. Years later Voldemort killed him for 'abandoning' his family, despite being essentially raped. Can't recall if Voldemort actually knows this or not.
