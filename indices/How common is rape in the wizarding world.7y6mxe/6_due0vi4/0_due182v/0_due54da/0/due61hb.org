Yeah, but rape can traumatize people for life, make you feel violated in horrible ways. Once you're dead, everything's just gone and there is no pain. We all die in the end anyway.

I mean, you can't really argue that murder is more socially acceptable to have on shows, movies, books, and games. Imagine a game where your character rapes someone. The outrage would be astronomical. But murder? Psh, been there a million times already.
