  After the War, there is a boom of marriage and divorce. Hermione finds herself among the statistics of war heroes who couldn't save their marriages. When she receives the invoice from her solicitor, she has no choice but to answer an ad in The Daily Prophet: Malfoy Heir Seeking Nanny. But, everything is not quite what it seems as Hermione navigates the waters of post-divorce life.
