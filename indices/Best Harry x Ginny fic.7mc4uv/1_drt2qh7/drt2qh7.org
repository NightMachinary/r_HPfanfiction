Anything by Brennus, but I'll recommend a few specific ones.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9631998/1/The-Thorny-Rose][The Thorny Rose]] and its sequels seem to fit what you were asking. Told mostly from Ginny's perspective, she's much more manipulative for a very good reason. linkffn(9631998)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]] features a darker couple. Harry and Ginny against the world sorta thing. linkffn(10645463)

From other authors...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]] She travels back in time alone and defeats Voldemort, but then has a harder time with her love life. linkffn(4740107)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backwards with Purpose]] in which Harry, Ron and Ginny go back in time. It has a lot of angst, but I enjoyed it at the time. linkffn(4101650)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5856625/1/The-Return-of-the-Marauders][The Return of the Maurauders]] is not for everybody. There's a lot of things I didn't like about it, but generally I'd say it's worth a read for a H/G fan. Only James died that night. linkffn(5856625)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2505393/Epeefencer][Epeefencer]] has some decent H/G stories. Mostly just fluff though.

Edit: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2559745/1/Learning-to-Breathe][Learning to Breathe]] features a Harry that has already beaten Voldemort. The downside is, he never developed his social side so he's a pure soldier. Full Metal Panic meets Harry Potter.
