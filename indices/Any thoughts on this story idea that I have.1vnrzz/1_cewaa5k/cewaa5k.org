I don't see where the conflict is. If Harry has free will, just choose not to murder everyone and turn into Happy McSnakeman.

Incidentally, magical power is overdone in HP fanon, considering that there's no analogue to magical power in canon. There's just skill with magic. This makes the setup a bit meh.
