In cannon I think he's just releived that he's not being expelled , which is what madam hooch said would happen if anyone tried flying while she was away. Then later he found he actually enjoyed the sport. Or if thats not how it actually goes in cannon, at least it makes sense and explains why he wouldnt be put out about being given no choice in the matter.
