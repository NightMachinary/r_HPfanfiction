Firstly, [[/u/octoberriddle][u/octoberriddle]] 's post.

Secondly, why? Daphne is pretty much a blank slate. I don't care, I don't subscribe to these inane fandom clich√©s about this super boring princess trope. And neither should you. The only thing we know about canon Daphne is that she hung out, at times, with Pansy. That's it. Make of her character whatever you will. Drug addict, secretly in love with McGonagall, plays Gobstones with Filch, crossdressing Muggle-born, fence for illegally pleasurable sex-magic artefacts. It doesn't matter.

Your prompt shows that you feel the need to highlight Daphne being something that'd defy fandom expectations. You're wrong. If anything, you should strive to always subvert expectations of dusty old tropes.
