Thanks for the reccs I haven't read either of those yet.

I looked at One Step Foward first because it was the shortest of the two. I am very impressed. It's written well and it's different how Fleur's power is veela fire instead of the usual allure... I followed and I hope it is updated soon.

I will start on Perspicacity's story next. I find it interesting how you called their relationship like Romeo and Juliet. I can't wait to read it for myself...
