People tend to like one-liner characters because they can plant their OC into a story without naming it an OC. Hence why Daphne & Co are so popular. We know some things about Fleur, so shes harder to write with a somewhat canon personality.

For recommendations:

This one is a rather new one that is still being written: linkffn(12048876) Its really new, as in, the prologue is just coming to an end. But it shows some promise.

This one I found interesting: linkffn(4152930) Its very AU, but has some great worldbuilding in it, a nice plot and a Romeo & Juliet kind of relationship between Harry and Fleur.
