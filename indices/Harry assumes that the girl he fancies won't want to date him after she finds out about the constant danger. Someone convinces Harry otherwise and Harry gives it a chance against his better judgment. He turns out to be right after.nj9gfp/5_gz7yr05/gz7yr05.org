This actually sort-of happened in canon, though Cho didn't "leave him" because of the fear of /danger/ but because she was just... well, fucked up mentally from what happened to her.

Her boyfriend just died barely a year prior, and she was grieving. She also tried to have a connection to him via another boy she /also/ fancied somewhat while /with/ said boyfriend.

She became /irrationally/ jealous of the closest female friend he had (which he considered pretty much a sister-figure -- the phrase "bros before hoes" is an apt one here), and her own best friend, Marietta, didn't like him -- and Marietta likely had her own hang-ups, too.

Predictably, that "relationship" went down in flames because of how fucked up the whole situation was.

Years later, during the Battle of Hogwarts, there was a scene, IIRC, where Cho tried to lead Harry off somewhere by the hand? Yeah, she got shot down by a territorial Ginny in one fell swoop, so I think that signaled to Cho that she had as much chance of Bellatrix deciding to become a stripper in a muggle strip-club.

Later on in life, I think Cho pretty much called it quits with dating a magical bloke as she settled down with a muggle, but that's just my reading between the lines.

On the plot bunny...

Harry begins dating X: Maybe someone the audience thought could handle it, such as Daphne (if you use the Ice Queen stereotype to subvert it) or Susan Bones (because of her Aunt)...

But while she really was keen on him, a life-or-death situation caused Daphne to break (maybe internal House pressure got to her too) or Susan to panic and run for it because although she picked up a few things from Amelia, said Aunt wanted to keep her away from any of that sort-of thing due to her own experiences during Voldemort's first attempted rise.

Naturally Harry is hurt and it damages his ability to intimately trust future people he didn't already know.

She tries to reconnect with him a bit later, but she is shot down coldly, despite her protestations. His friends, namely Ron and Hermione, also close ranks around him.

As time goes on and she continues to try anything to get him to hear her out and give her another chance, she's stonewalled. Eventually, she gives up or retreats to a distance, feeling as though she'd lost something potentially special.

Harry begins dating another girl, cautiously, and she doesn't chicken-shit run at the first sign of trouble -- it could be Ginny, or it could be someone surprising, like Lavender or Katie Bell.

She feels a lot of resentment and a bit of self-loathing on hearing that.

Years later, she hears through the grapevine that they're getting married.

Maybe it just ends with her sadly staring at the section in the Daily Prophet that announced it, her cereal forgotten. Maybe it ends with her trying to make a last-ditch confession to him, in the vain hope he'd change his mind. Maybe, despite the hurt she inflicted on him, he hadn't actually thought of her for years except for when mentioning her as part of his and his bride-to-be's origin story, and he is genuinely surprised when she shows up, saying that she'd been thinking of him all these years, et cetera.

A cold, brutal twist? If it were Daphne?

The girl he initially moved on to after her didn't work out, though it was amicable and just a "normal" break-up.

Years later, after Hogwarts, she learns that he and Astoria are dating, and she stuck by him during an attack -- something Daphne did not.

Daphne's views on muggles and the like (didn't care about half-bloods who had a muggleborn parent(s) or others like that, but hypocritically didn't like muggleborns themselves or muggles) hadn't changed, while Astoria's did (like in canon, which caused tension between her and her in-laws), leading them to become somewhat estranged.

Astoria and Harry marry and have a child or three, and they're ludicrously happy. It makes her so damn envious! The self-loathing also comes back, especially after she'd been influenced by her petty Housemates all those years ago. That she sees Astoria with the life she could have had --a loving husband, children, excitement-- also burns every time she sees her nieces and nephews running about when they visit.

But then the Family Curse hits and Astoria dies. Harry and their children are devastated, naturally.

It seriously fucks her up. She just lost her sister, something that hurt her deeply, but she also feels a bit of petty satisfaction deep down that their perfect life, the life she could have had, is shattered. And then she feels horror and shame on feeling that.

Part of her wants to try to hit on the widow too, now that her sister is no longer in the picture.

A whole mess of unstable elements ready to explode at any time,

Alternatively, Harry's future wife or girlfriend is a muggle or squib, and despite she crazy shit happening to him, sticks by him and helps as best she can.

This burns the Ex even more, even if she didn't have any beliefs about magical people being superior to those without magic.

After all, someone "inferior" to her did what she could not.

...Yeah, this was a bit disjointed. Oops?
