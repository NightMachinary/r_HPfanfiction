Also, I could see this as being a serious of humorous or dramatic one-shots with Harry and his friends (the Ministry Six) where they try to date other people, but either something happens on these dates (attacks, situations, pressures from fame) or the relationships just quickly become strained and collapse due to irreconcilable differences.

Eventually, they realize the only ones to put up with either the crazy shit or their own fundamental natures are, well, themselves. And they're actually fine with that.

So, Pair The Spare happens, and Harry begins dating Ginny; Ron, Hermione; Luna, Neville.
