I know this is a prompt and not a request, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7471751/1/Feathers-Fangs-and-Flames][Feathers, Fangs and Flames]] has that, kind of. Harry becomes a werewolf and get's together with Cho. They date and he tells her the truth. In the beginning she is okay with it, but after seeing him turn she leaves him if my memory is correct.
