  Another, these children would suffer from PTSD

Well, statistically speaking only one of them would, only about 20% of people who experience a traumatic event suffer from PTSD. Granted this data is from adults, not children, but still, most people do not get PTSD, some people are just better suited to mentally recover from things than other people. And given that all the people who wouldn't be able to handle the pressure/trauma have had 5 years to distance themselves from Harry, plus the various selection biases that caused them to go in the first place, I'm perfectly happy to believe that the 5 people who went to the ministry are all examples of people with about average resistance to trauma.
