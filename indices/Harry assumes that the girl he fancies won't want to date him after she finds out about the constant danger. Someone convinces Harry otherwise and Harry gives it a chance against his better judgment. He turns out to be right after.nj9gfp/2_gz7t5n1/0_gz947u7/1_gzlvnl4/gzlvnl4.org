But that is statistically speaking after ONE traumatic event. In Harry's case we need to accept that even if the chance of PTSD per event might be 20%, he has come across a wide spectrum of trauma inducing events with his friends. Take Ron for example, even if the forbidden forrest, the chess sacrifice and the acromantula didn't give him PTSD, he is not immune to his sister dead in the chamber, dementors, being attacked by someone assumed a mass murderer ect and that is only the first three books. You also can't assume that if you got out of one traumatic situation relatively fine that you will be numb to all the other stuff, especially because not all traumatic events described in the book are the same or simple worst versions of the previous trauma. Also these kids got almost no downtime to recover from their traumatic events, nor any professional help. Maybe not all of them would have gotten PTSD, but I assume that at least the Golden Trio has to be fucked up at the end of the war.
