Keep in mind it wasn't random kids who went to DoM. It was his best friends who've already faced a couple deadly situations, Ginny, who has also faced a deadly situation, has had a long time crush on Harry and definitely has a bone to pick with Voldemort; Neville, who was out for vengeance for his parents (the books even mention that he became way better in the DA after the Lestranges escaped and here they are) and Luna who is quirky and so desperately lonely that she'd probably put up with a lot more to have friends (Not to mention people who deal with and search for exotic and dangerous creatures absolutely have a different level of tolerance for how dangerous a situation has to be before bailing).
