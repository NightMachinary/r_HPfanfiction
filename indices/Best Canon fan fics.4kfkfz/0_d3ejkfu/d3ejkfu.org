Not From Others, written by [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] is a great canon-compliant fanfiction about Hogwarts under Voldemort's regime told from Ginny's point of view. Actually, calling it just canon compliant is an understatement. It ties beautifully into canon, picking up all the small hints we get in DH and bringing it to life in this wonderful story. A great strength of this story is characterization. Ginny was perfect, and everyone is in character. The OCs that appear are well-written too and fit well into the Harry Potter universe. The Battle of Hogwarts was outstanding, reading those three chapters was just devastating.
