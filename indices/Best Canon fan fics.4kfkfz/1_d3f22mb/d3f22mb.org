The Strange Dissapearance of Sally-Anne Perks - simply beautiful elegance in scope of storytelling. All-but perfectly canon-compliant, and one of my favorite fics of all

Hogwarts Houses Divided by Inverarity is probably the best next-generation fic around. His Alexandra Quick series is technically canon-compliant, but set far enough away that I'll not link it here. Great works, though.

The Very Secret Diary by Arabella is a canon-perspective story of what went on in Riddle's Diary, and a truly terrifying thriller.
