I actually just finished reading a series that does a decent job of depicting a full-scale war, but it's not Harry-centric. And not only is it a million words, but it's a spin-off of the linkffn(Pureblood Pretense) series, so you really do need to read that first, and PP is Harry-centric but is not particularly gritty and is also (more than) /another/ million words.

If you're not scared off yet, you can take a look at [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1722145][The Revolutionary Arc]] (but you really do need to read Pureblood Pretense first, at least books 1-3).
