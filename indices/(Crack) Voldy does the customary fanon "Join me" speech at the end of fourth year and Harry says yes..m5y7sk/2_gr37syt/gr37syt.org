/For the inevitable Dumbledore-Harry confrontation-/

"It's over Harry," Dumbledore said calmly. "I have the bigger wand."

Harry stared at him, his emerald orbs filled with hatred. "You underestimate the size of my magical core."

"Don't try it, my boy"

Harry slashed his new seven core wand. A fiery basilisk emerged from his wand, advancing upon Dumbledore with the intent to kill him.

Dumbledore sighed heavily. With a flick of his own wand, he dispelled the Fiendfyre knock-off. A thick set of ropes emerged from his wand almost simultaneously, flying towards Harry with incredible speed.

"Oh shi-," Harry could barely blink before the ropes binded him. A particularly vicious coil tripped him, even as he looked up to face Dumbledore.

"You were the Chosen One, Harry," Dumbledore said, his twinkleâ„¢ suspiciously absent from his manipulative blue eyes. "It was said that you would destroy Lord Voldemort, not join him."

Harry glared at Dumbledore with his AK green eyes. A lesser wizard would have collapsed under his ocular assault; Dumbledore simply sighed.

"You were like a son to me Harry. I loved you."

"I hate you."

Dumbledore's eyes hardened. "Well, tough luck, you lil' shit. I'm not going to let you become an edgelord like that Voldemort fellow. We'll be paying a visit to Madam Pomfrey first. Molly would never forgive me if she saw that terrible contusion on your head."
