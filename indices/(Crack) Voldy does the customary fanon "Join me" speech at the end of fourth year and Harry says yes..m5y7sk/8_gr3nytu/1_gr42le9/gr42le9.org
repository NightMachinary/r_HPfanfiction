hell yes.

A 'Harry joins Voldemort' prompt where Harry gets the full consequences of his actions/choices and gets what he deserves.

Never got that about those fanfics. No amount of 'WAHHH THEY PLANNED MY DESTINY AND TOOK MONEY FROM ME' can justify joining magical hitler. There is no 'Harry joins Voldemort' where Harry is a good guy.
