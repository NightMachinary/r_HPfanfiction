Yup, unless it is an AU extreme enough to not actually have Voldemort, just an OC with the same alias, which is kind of a waste.

Personally I feel that Harry just breaking off with the order/Dumbledore and doing his own thing about the war -not necessarily creating his own faction, just, like, trying to find out Voldemort's plans or just wait for him and duel him (no chance in hell of Voldemort leaving him alone even if Harry was somehow willing to excuse his parent's killer and without Dumbledore Harry has no way of knowing about the Horcrux).

Alternatively, if he absolutely /must/ make nice with a dark wizard then Grindelwald is a much more realistic option. Yeah, he is also a genocidal maniac who committed unspeakable crimes against humanity, but he never really went after Harry or his family so it wouldn't be quite as personal, specially when we consider that Harry neither grew up around people who spoke with him at length about the havoc Grindewald rained on Europe nor studied at length the war. Plus, considering his experience with the Dursley's and his neighbors in relation to how he feels about his mother and his friendship with Hermione, plus simple rationality to debunk the whole Blood Supremacy argument, I can see Harry be more willing to side against muggles rather than muggleborns, comparatively speaking that is.
