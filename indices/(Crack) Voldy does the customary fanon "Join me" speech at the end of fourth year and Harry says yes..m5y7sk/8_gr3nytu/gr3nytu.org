Harry Potter was in pain.

Voldemort's siege on Hogwarts had been a disaster. The Death Eaters had been routed and slaughtered by Dumbledore's forces. Harry and the Dark Lord himself had both been captured and taken to the dungeons to await the inevitable destruction of all their Horcruxes.

He wanted to cry. He still remembered the look of hatred and fury on the faces of his former best friends as they dueled, defeating him with far less effort than Harry would ever admit. In a fit of childish pique, he had aligned himself with monsters and lost everything.

Students would occasionally come by his cell in the Hogwarts dungeons to "give the Golden Boy a welcome back gift." Harry's face often had a new bruise or welt by the time they left. The food they gave him was raw and the students would often throw it at him rather than hand it over.

The latest "meal" had been delivered to him by two girls - one with long, blonde hair wearing Ravenclaw robes and the grimly smirking Ginny Weasley.

"Wake up, Potter." spat Ginny "Can't have you dying just yet, you traitorous bastard." Ginny's brother had not been to see Harry. Neither had Hermione. Seamus Finnegan had come and gone into extreme detail about Weasley and Granger's torid affair, following his abandonment of the light. They were having their "own private victory celebration" in the Gryffindor tower and seemed to have forgotten Harry existed, if Finnegan was telling the truth.

Ginny's companion set down a tray containing what looked like putrid gruel. It would be all Harry ate that day. Injustice burned in him. With Voldemort, he had been given feasts in the Malfoy and Greengrass manors. Now he was reduced to this.

"Filthy Mudblood fucker." spat Harry. In a split-second, Ginny's boot had connected wirh his face. The tears came running down Harry's face as blood gushed from his nose and teeth tumbled out of his mouth.

"Pathetic shit." snarled Ginny "Let's go Luna."

Luna fixed the sobbing Boy Who Lived with a look of pity.

"After all the stories, I'd have thought you'd be somewhat impressive." she said dreamily as the duo departed, leaving the snivelling bastard they had once admired, alone in the dark and cold cell once again.
