Not even Top 100. I mean, Harry/any Death Eater (like Snape, Lucius, Draco or even Bella) would never work unless you go massively AU and make +the magical Waffen SS+ hot actors the good guys. They were murders, traitors, terrorists and war criminals, not some misguided youth group.

At least you can fit Narcissa into the "got stuck here due to my husband" role since we do not have definite proof of her embracing racist ideologies and calling for purges at the tender age of 12 or calling your best friend a racial slur at 16. You can tailor a semi-plausible deniability for her, something that is impossible for anyone else on Voldemort's side.

Therefore I am happy to recommend this:

There is at least one other story out there where Harry and Narcissa get married but it is a weird mixture of harem marriage law fic and non-explicit smut.
