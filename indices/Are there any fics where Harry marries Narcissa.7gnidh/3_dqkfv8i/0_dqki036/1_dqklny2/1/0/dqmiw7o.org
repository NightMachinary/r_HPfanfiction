No, it is "The Law". Marriage law fic and Harry gets Hermione, Narcissa and Kingsley's niece (14-year-old OC). The fic is supposed to be smut but skips over the smutty parts and has some weird moral implications like Minister Kingsley carrying a law that forces people into marriage (= Ministry approved rape) but then dislikes that his relative could get someone who might actually take advantage of the law he passed and pulls some strings so that she get's Harry to prevent her from getting traumatised (unlike the thousands of other girls)
