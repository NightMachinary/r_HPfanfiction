At the end of OotP, when Luna mentions seeing Sirius again by "looking behind the Veil," or "pulling back the Veil," I think that was foreshadowing the Resurrection Stone. Considering the fact that it allows Harry to speak with Sirius again, and her father is a seeker of the Deathly Hallows, it seems likely, or it's another coincidence that lines up perfectly in HP.

It's my headcanon that the Deathly Hallows were made by studying the Veil, and perhaps using pieces of it in the creation of each Hallow. Like, the Stone could be made from a piece of stone from the archway, the Wand might be made from an elder tree that was near the Veil in it's original location (with the hair of a Thestral as it's core, which share many similarities to the Veil themselves- maybe they come from it), and perhaps the Cloak is made of a piece of the Veil itself.
