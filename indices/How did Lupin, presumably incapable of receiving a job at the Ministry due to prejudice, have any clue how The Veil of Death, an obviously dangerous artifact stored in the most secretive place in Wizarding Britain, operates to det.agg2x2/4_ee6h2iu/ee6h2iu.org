I'd like to think that it is established that Remus was an accomplished and capable wizard with a lot of experience. Iâ€˜m sure that someone like Dumbledore would have recogniced the Veil for what it is without knowing it beforehand in seconds. Not to compare Lupin with Dumbledore of cause, but I think that other wizards would be capable of deducing the nature of the Veil through their experience with magic in general as well, although only to a lesser degree, meaning in more time and less precise. They would have made an educated guess where Dumbledore would know what it is and already have multiple theories of its origin and whatnot.\\
One of the clues that mght have lead to Remus seeing the Veil for what it is would have been the whispering voices that people who lost someone can hear near the Veil (Luna, Harry). Now it is of cause just as probable that he knew about the Veil from order members who work in the Ministry or maybe Dumbledore who would have known quiet a lot of the secrets of the DoM and Ministry as a whole since this obscure branch of magic is exactly the kind of magic that he would want to know all about.
