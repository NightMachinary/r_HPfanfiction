I do enjoy slice of life fics, yes. Kid raising fics are one of my favorite tropes, and those tend to be very much slice of life. But this doesn't mean there's /no/ stakes -- conflicts help a story along, even if the stakes overall are low. For example, the main kid character getting harassed, and the reluctance in opening up to the family about it, the kid planning a prank of sort that gets out of hand, or similar. A fic without any conflicts whatsoever gets boring after a while.
