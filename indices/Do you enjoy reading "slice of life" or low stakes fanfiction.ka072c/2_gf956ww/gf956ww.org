I couldn't dig up the exact quote, but I remember reading a great bit of advice from Patrick Rothfuss a while back that boiled down to "make your stakes high for the characters, even if they're objectively low." He was talking about how one of the central challenges that his protagonist faces in The Name of the Wind is that he needs to scrounge up enough money to pay his tuition and rent every semester. This is a character that's performing magic, having adventures, etc, but still has serious anxiety and struggles over his day to day living. I remember the parts of the story where he's scraping up cash or cutting corners to try and meet a deadline moreso than the traditional high fantasy challenges, because Kvothe doesn't really freak out about murders or monsters but he loses his mind at the idea of not being able to play his lute or stay in school.

So your shopkeepers or shoppers don't need to be involved in the larger Harry Potter plot at all, but do give them challenges and make the stakes for those challenges real to them, even if they seem small in the grand scheme of things. Risk of a shop closing down, competing with a rival store, navigating the politics of a small-town business community, etc
