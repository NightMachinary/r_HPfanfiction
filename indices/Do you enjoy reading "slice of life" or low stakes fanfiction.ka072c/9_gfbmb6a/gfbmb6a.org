hm, it really depends. I dont often read slice of life bc im a lover of the dark and gorey and traumatizing. But when I do it has to be written well and have an overarching plot.

If you wrote about the lives of shopkeepers, try to focus heavily of character building and the like. There would be most likely be plenty of OCs and you would probably add some shops, so going into characters and their motivations would be great for some plot or introspection, or maybe a few chapters here and there being character studies.

Hers some plot ideas!!!

Is there a feud between Madame Malkin, the owner of Twilfitt and Tattings, and Gladrags Wizardwear? Does WWW get along with Zonkos and gambol & Japes? Is there some sort of main lounge for the shop owners were they gossip and meet up? Are there other districts besides Hogsmeade, Diagon and Knockturn? How many lawsuits does Borgin and Burkes get? What does Ollivander do outside of the school rush? Do the shop keeps exchange favors (Fix my Owl's wing and you'll get a discount for the rest of the year)? Are there any sordid relationships or affairs? What about hidden mental/physical illness? Does Fortescue bring ice cream for the yearly cookout? What about late deliveries? How do they deal with a flakey worker? How does the new manager of Slug & Jiggers deal with firing someone for the first time? Do Madame Malkin's and Twilfitt and Tattings team up against a modern style punk/goth shop that pops up in Diagon and do they make up with that shop keep? How does Gringotts interact with the shop keeps? How do they deal with a creature escaping The Magical Menagerie? How many other shops are in Knockturn and what do they sell? Does Slug & Jiggers get grumpy when he has to refer someone to Dogweed & Deathcap? What happens when Fortescue has to renew his agreement with Honeydukes, esp when there's a new candy? Did all the shop keeps team up to help Flourish and Blotts during the fiasco with the Monster Book Of Monsters and was The Healer on call all day?

The best part of Slice of Life for me, is people finding out things and reacting. I dont like miscommunication, but secrets or small inconveniences are always fun!
