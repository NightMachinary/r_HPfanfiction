Sort of. It depends, usually I have two requirements for a fanfic; Mystery and History, with a dash of Romance. That is, there should be some over arching mystery in the story, and there should be some, usually historical, artefact that helps resolve the mystery. I typically find slice of life or fluffy stories refreshing as a calm before the storm in long fics. For slice of life fics to stand on their own for me, there has to be something unique about the experience, so for your example, what would make that daily life of a magical shopkeeper unique and different to other people in the magical world?
