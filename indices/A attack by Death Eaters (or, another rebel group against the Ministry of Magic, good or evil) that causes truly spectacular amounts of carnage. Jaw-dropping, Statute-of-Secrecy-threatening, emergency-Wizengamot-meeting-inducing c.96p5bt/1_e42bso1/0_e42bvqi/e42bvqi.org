  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.
