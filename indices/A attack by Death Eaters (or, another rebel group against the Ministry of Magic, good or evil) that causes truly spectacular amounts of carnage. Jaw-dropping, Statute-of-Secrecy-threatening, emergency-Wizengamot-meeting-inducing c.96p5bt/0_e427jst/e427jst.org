linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero) and its sequels. Highlights include (spoilers):

- Assassinating members of the ICW regularly
- Slaughtering over two hundred people in Diagon Alley, including the Minister and many of the Department Heads
- Breaking into Azkaban, killing over forty staff members and removing over a hundred prisoners.
- A mass dementor assault on London that de-souled a huge chunk of the population.
- Leveling the entirety of Beauxbatons and killing 99% of the people there (only like thirty survivors).
- Its sequels include unleashing an army of vampires on the muggles, blowing up Azkaban itself, a full on battle in France, the utter destruction of the Ministry building, a battle with a storm demon in the skies of London that froze the Thames, loosing a half-dozen basilisks in Scotland (not to mention lethifolds and nundus), and Harry literally melting a mountain.

Yeah. That happened.
