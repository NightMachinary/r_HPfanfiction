I tend to think any pairing (with some logistical or creepy exceptions unless that's your jam) can be done convincingly with the right author wanting to put the time into it and flesh it out so it feels convincing. I remember quite a good Remus/Davey one from back in the day that surprised me, but I knew the author was good from their other stuff.
