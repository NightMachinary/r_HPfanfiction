  "For someone like Sirius Black, this endless stretch of darkness had filled up his life for nearly 12 years. He had been abused as a child, he had bullied several students while in school, and he had killed. But what most haunted him was the morning his heart was broken." Sirius/Lily, An exploration of a broken man. AU, rating for language.
