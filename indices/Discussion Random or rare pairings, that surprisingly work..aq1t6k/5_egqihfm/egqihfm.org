Linkffn(Stars Fall by Lady Altair) Stars Fall is an absolutely wonderful fic by Lady Altair which has Remus/Lavender as the pairing. The writing style is absolutely gorgeous and it's just perfect (in my opinion). I adore the characterization and how Lavender's character is treated. If you liked this one I would reccomend like all of Lady Altair's other fics. Some of my favorites with lavender are Linkffn(show me dragons by lady altair) and Linkffn(her first and her last by WhiskeyTangoFoxTrot).
