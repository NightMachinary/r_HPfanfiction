See... when I saw the title of this prompt I was thinking like a completely out of sight not participating apart from odd appearences and not really having much if any of a relationship with the main characters and so I was imagining more along the lines of:

--------------

"Hey Ron, how come the famous Dumbledore is supposed to run this school but we have never even seen him in years?"

"No idea Harry. Strange that is. Oh well, pass the pie." Ron replied

"I heard that hes hidden himself away in order to figure out some sort of lemon mystery or something. No idea what thats about but Parvati and Lavender were gossiping nonstop about it in the common room and I think they heard it from some teacher in the hallway. However, I think hes probably trying to figure out how to free all the elves."

"Not this again Hermione" said Ron. "Can you just pass me the pie already?"

"Great man, that Dumbledore" said Hermione distractedly.

"Barmy she is" said Ron, reaching across her to retrieve his pie.

"Yeah..." Harry said distractedly. There really was something about the lemon mystery that seemed to strike true in his opinion. No idea why, but he just had a feeling. Then again, the three of them hadnt seen Dumbledore but once in the multiple years of schooling at Hogwarts and that was only when Dumbledore randomly showed up to a meal, shouted nitwitt, blubber, oddment, and tweak or some nonsense, turned Filtch into a donkey, stole McGonagall's hat right off her head, and then vanished in a burst of flame.

"Odd man, that Dumbledore" Harry mumbled in thought.

"Whuf wuz at Ary?" said Ron with a mouthful of pie

"Nothing... nothing..." said Harry, going back to picking at his treacle tart.

"Boys..." said Hermione exasperatedly.

But your prompt seems to be more about working from behind the scenes trying to not be manipulate but ending up doing just that in a round about way.

Interesting nontheless.
