Hey [[/u/polliesayswhat]] and [[/u/wordhamer]] - I actually know the creators of the podcast and not only did they receive permission from Ruth/Ms-Figg's son and daughter, but her family was excited about the opportunity to share her work with a different audience saying, "Mom would love that." The hosts are really focused on honoring the authors that put in the enormous effort and creativity to create these stories. In the latest season, they've been regularly communicating with McTwist for clarifications and frequently give McTwist kudos for their story. Whether you like the podcast or not, I just wanted to clarify that they would never use a story they didn't have permission for!
