Ms-Figg aka Ruth Solomon passed away back in 2015. Since their podcast only started this year, I'm going to assume 'permission' in their minds equals 'We sent a couple emails asking if the author minded us using their work for our show, and since we never heard back, we assumed it was alright'.

At least the podcasters were accurate about who she was.
