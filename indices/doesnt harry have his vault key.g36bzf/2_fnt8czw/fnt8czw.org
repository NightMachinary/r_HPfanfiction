I believe that some of the confusion stems from book 6 - where Bill was asked by Mrs. Weasley to retrieve money from Harry's vault because she wanted to spare him from the Dark Magic Detector Stick experience. While Harry was quite happy with that, I was not.

I mean... Increased security measures, and you have a guy that shows up with a key that is not his, who has not ever used a given vault or (at least explictly) given permission, or any form of authorization to access it at all. In the safest place to store valuables. Yeah, the Gringotts heist in B7 was cathartic for me.

Why the salt? The scene explicitly showed that Harry had no idea where his key was, nor that his vault was accessed at all until Molly Weasley told him.

TLDR: The key bounced on and off screen, changing hands in every scene, and spawned many a Thieving Weasel trope.
