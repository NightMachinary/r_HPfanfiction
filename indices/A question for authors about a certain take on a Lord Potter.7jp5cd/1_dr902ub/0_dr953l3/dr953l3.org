Q1: If a line dies with no eligible heirs, the line dies out officially and any real property (incl. house elves) is given in trust to one of the 5 holders of Honor Seats, given to people who are an Order of Merlin, First Class who are currently alive, to find someone to take the seat and join the ranks of the Lords, then all that property is transferred It is literally a bloody mess when this occurs. If there are less than 5, the seats are filled with people with Orders of Merlin, Second Class who fulfilled the requirements for a First Class voting but were not nominated for one. If there are more than 5, than the 5 whose nominations were accepted with the highest percentage of votes get in, while the remainder may sit in on Observer status and may take a seat as soon as one of the 5 dies. An Observer may speak in debates but cannot vote. As to the part about why they have such a system... it's the only way they knew and decided to copy what the Muggle government was doing at the time, with the exception of having a "House of Commons" because the rich families didn't want to cede that power. Due to the lack of a magical member of the Royal Family, they installed the Minister of Magic position as a Cromwell-esque Lord Protector role. Since there was opposition to a lifetime term, they ended up imposing the term limit we know to be canon.

Q2 and Q3 are related. If you lose your heir due to death (or lose the possibility of having one due to infertility, etc.), you may adopt an heir, but that heir cannot already be a Lord, and he must be a Muggleborn. Blood adoption is not a thing, and people know that you are adopted.

Q4: Some families are cocky and only have one child, or some simply Some choose to only have one out of convenience. Others don't really care because of they have a daughter and they marry a Lord, the 2 houses consolidate and a seat opens up.
