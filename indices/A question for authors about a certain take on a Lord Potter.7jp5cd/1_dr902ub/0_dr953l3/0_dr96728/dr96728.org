You need to decide why all the witches tolerate this system. Are they all raised to unquestioningly accept losing everything just because their brother died? Or why do they accept this?

Also, why can you only adopt a mugleborn? That does not seem to make sense in a system that stuck on blood. What if it is revealed after the adoption that the muggleborn was actually a half-blood?

Also, what happens if you are the heir, but too young to have children when your father dies? Do you get a grace period? Can you adopt instead of waiting?

I think the whole "you need an heir to have a position on the Wizengamot" makes not much sense - especially since the muggles never had that requirement. What exactly is the point of this, any way? What kind of plot does it make possible that wouldn't be possible without it? Telling Harry he has to continue his family line is pretty much a standard trope in Lord Potter fics.
