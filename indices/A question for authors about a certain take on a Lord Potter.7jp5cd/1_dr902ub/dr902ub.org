I think you would need to give a reason why sons are favored over daughters in a society where witches are as powerful as wizards. Are wizards so traditional that even 300 years after splitting off from muggles, they still follow the patriarchy, the muggle patriarchy even?

There are other questions as well:

What happens if your heir dies? Do you lose your seat?

Can you adopt an heir?

If having an heir is so important, wouldn't that mean that all families have an heir, and a few spares, instead of single children like Draco?
