What you described is a mechanic, but not a story. I usually don't care much which mechanics are underlying in your world, as long as they are pulled off decently.

So without knowing some actual story I can't really tell you if I'd be that interested - sure, the mechanics sound decent, but it /really/ depends on the actual plot.
