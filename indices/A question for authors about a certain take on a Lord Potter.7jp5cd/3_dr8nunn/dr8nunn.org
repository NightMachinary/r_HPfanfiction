What I wanted to say about your specific post has already been said, so here's some general advice:

If you're having fun writing it, it doesn't matter how many people like it.

If you write it, someone somewhere will enjoy it. The audience might be very narrow or very wide, but worrying about it only causes unneeded anxiety.

If you have an interesting story and believable characters, most readers aren't going to care what they're about as long as you can hook them in the first chapter.

tl;dr - Go write, have fun. Let readers worry about themselves.
