It could be and it must be done in style. In linkffn(4236594) Daphne Greengrass (who is most definitively NOT a Scioness Greengrass, her mind and tongue are constantly close to gutter) tries to avoid Taboo by calling Tom Riddle names, and she is very creative and very disgusting. Other DA members (yes, she is a Slytherin in DA) try to match her names. However, it is in style of her character and pretty funny.
