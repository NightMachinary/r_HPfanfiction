It happens a lot in Dark!Slytherin!Hermione fics, where the authors try to detach Hermione from everything that Canon!Hermione was about.

They get rid of her muggle dentist parents and make it so she was a pureblood or halfblood all along, change her personality by making her beautiful, charming, and seductive without effort, and get rid of Harry and Ron as her BFF's because they're useless and holding her back.

It's the Hermione equivalent of Harry going Dark and changing his name to Hadrian Potter-Black-Peverell and rejecting his parents as dumbasses who were tricked by Dumblefuck and his Order of the Flaming Firechickens.
