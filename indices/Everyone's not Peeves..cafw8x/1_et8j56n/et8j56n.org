I cringe when multiple characters refer to Hermione as "Mione", and she just goes with it.

1. Ron only did that when he was eating, and Hermione told him off for it.

2. Hermione is strict on proper names, calling Ron "Ronald", and teaching Viktor, syllable by syllable, how to pronounce her name.

But none of that is as weird as Hermione being called "Mia" with no explanation.
