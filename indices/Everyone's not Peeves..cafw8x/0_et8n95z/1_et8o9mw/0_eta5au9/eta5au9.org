I have a friend named Alex. She gets the reverse. Her parents explicitly named her "Alex" rather than "Alexa" or "Alexandra" or something like that because they figured everyone would shorten it anyway, but then people, trying to be formal, will guess and extend it to one of those longer names. It drives her mad.
