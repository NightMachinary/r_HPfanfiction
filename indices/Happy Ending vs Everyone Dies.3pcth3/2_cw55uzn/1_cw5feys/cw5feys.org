It's funny, tune travel is one of my favorite and least favorite sub genres to fanfiction. I love reading the different plots and characters and all the problems living in a different time (or alternate reality) can have...At the same time, I absolutely hate the too common time travel stories where all the things that happened in the past led to what happens in the future. It's my least favorite paradox because it's just so expected and so many writers do it as if it's this original idea.

What I want from time travel stories is usually a happy ending in the time they traveled too. Not one where they go back to their original time line having learned from their experiences, ghost of Christmas past style.
