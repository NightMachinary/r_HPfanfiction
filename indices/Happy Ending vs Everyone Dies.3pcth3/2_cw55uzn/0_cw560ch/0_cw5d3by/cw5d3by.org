I read a story like that. It had the happily ever after ending, but for some reason it just felt wrong. And then the story updated again with a real last chapter, and it turns out that the main character was in a coma and would never wake up and just imagined the "happily ever after" in the chapter before. It made me cry, but it was so beautiful. I've re-read the story a couple of times, but there's nothing like reading it for the very first time and having that ending come completely out of the blue and hit you right in the feels.
