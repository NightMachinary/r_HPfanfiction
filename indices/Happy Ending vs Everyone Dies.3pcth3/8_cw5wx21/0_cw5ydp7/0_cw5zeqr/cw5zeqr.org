Aw, thanks. :) I have a terrible tendency to go on for paragraphs, and I'm trying to be more concise lately.

One thing that occurred to me: I hope all those types of fic continue to exist and find an audience. I'd hate for writers to only pitch their stories at whatever is most popular at the moment. I'm fairly omnivorous in my reading habits, and I never want fandom to stop writing everything under the sun, including deathfic and tooth-rotting fluff. The variety is half the fun.
