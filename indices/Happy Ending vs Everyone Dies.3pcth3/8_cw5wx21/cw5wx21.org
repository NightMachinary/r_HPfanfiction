Depends what I'm in the mood for, and as Boomberrybella says, what's appropriate for the fic. Sometimes I want to have my heart broken. Sometimes I want the story to take me right to that painful edge and then pull back, saved by a plausible and hoped-for last-minute twist. Sometimes I want trials and tribulations that end in triumph, or in happiness.

I rarely ever want pure fluff, though. I need the dark streaks and difficulties to tug on my emotions. It makes the payoff even more satisfying.
