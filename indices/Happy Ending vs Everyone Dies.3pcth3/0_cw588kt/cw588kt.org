Personally I always prefer happy endings to everybody dies. The reason is simple, the latter is too much like real life. For me reading (especially in the fantasy genre) is about escapism. I want to be in a different world, far away from the cares of my everyday life.

I like to read stories that have a happy ending because it's nice to believe that everything works out of the best in the end, no matter how dark things get there is always a dawn etc. Stories where everybody dies in the end or key characters die for seemingly no reason is a little too close to real life, and why read about something that is a close approximation to real life instead of just living yours?
