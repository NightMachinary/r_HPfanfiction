I like an everyone dies sometimes, but usually i prefer my bad end fics to end before the bad end is explicit, at a low point, and the happy ending ones to end at a happy ending or high point.

I also like ones that're both. For instance, harry who's working with the voldemort horcrux is partially defeated and limps off into the sunset, frantically fleeing hogwarts, while dumbledore realizes his choosen one is contaminated with voldemort. What happens next?

Or, reincarnated voldemort brings in a new age of prosperity for wizardkind- and meanwhile muggles almost all die in a mysterious accident, for an example of both.
