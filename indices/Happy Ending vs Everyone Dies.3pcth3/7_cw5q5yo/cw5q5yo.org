I'm happiest when there are elements of both. Take canon, for example. In The Goblet of Fire, Voldemort achieves a major victory...but this is undone in part by Harry's survival and escape. In The Deathly Hallows, Voldemort is defeated, but at a price.

Anything too extreme on either side needs to be done with caution. A super-happy "everything is right with the world" can work, in the right context (Seventh Horcrux, romance, and so on), just as a dark ending can work out in other contexts (avoiding spoilers, but certain oneshots come to mind).

But generally I'm happier with somewhere in the middle.
