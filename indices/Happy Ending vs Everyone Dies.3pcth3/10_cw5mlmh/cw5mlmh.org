When I read a story, I usually empathize with the protagonist, at least to some point - I walk in his shoes. To have him lose everything and die means that I experience the same sensation of defeat, and I don't like that. I am willing to suffer with the hero, but only with the expectation of catharsis. Otherwise, I am left empty, frustrated and feeling cheated. Not to say that I can't stand endings were bad things happen to the world or to minor characters, but if the hero wins only to lose everything that he lives for, then the entire quest is meaningless.
