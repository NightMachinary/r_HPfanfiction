It depends. One of my favourite fanfics ever, linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty), has a mostly happy ending that is contained within another (sequel) fic, but the ending as originally written is one of the most breathtakingly tragic endings I've ever read, and both, I think, are equally good.
