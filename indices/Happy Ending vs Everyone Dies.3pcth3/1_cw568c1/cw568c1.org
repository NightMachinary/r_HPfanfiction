I pick C, an ending appropriate for the style and audience the fic was written for. If I'm reading a fluffy, superficial romance fic, then there's little reason one of the main characters should die. If it's a more substantial fic (romance or otherwise) with heavier and more serious issues, then death and dealing with it is not out of left field.
