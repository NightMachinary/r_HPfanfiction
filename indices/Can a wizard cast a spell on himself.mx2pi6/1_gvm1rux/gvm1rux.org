There are a few canon examples.

Dumbledore disillusions himself to surprise Harry in the Mirror of Erised room (it's not explicit but Dumbledore pretty much spells it out, no pun intended).

In the films, Harry casts Ascendio when he's about to drown in the second challenge... although we might want to ignore that one.

The spell to extract a memory for use in a Pensieve is seen cast on oneself a few times.

Then depending on how pedantic we're going to be here, you could say the summoning charm is cast on oneself too - you can't summon to someone else after all. It's obviously cast on the object concerned, but there's an unspoken secondary part.

We don't know what spell Voldemort and Snape use to fly but that seems to be cast on oneself too.
