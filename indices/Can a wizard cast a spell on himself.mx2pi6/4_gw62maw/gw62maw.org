I think it depends on the spell. Some are intended to be used that way, but some maybe not. For example Mobilicorpus is used to levitate someone else, there's a good chance it doesn't work properly when used on yourself. Like you can pick things up by grabbing them, but you can't pull yourself up by grabbing yourself.
