Some spells seem to while others don't. You have plenty of examples of spells that are used to cast on oneself. However in the extended canon (up to you if you consider it as canon or not), Wingardium Leviosa only works on clothes but not on the person so you risk remaining naked if you use it. Also I doubt that the Summoning spell works since you're already there.
