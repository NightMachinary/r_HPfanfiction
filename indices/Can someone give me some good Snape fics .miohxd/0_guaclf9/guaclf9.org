It's a good pairing. They both are intellectual characters. Snamione fics are usuay very high quality, especially the ones written pre dh. Read pet project if you want to get a taste. It doesn't have them getting into any relationship, just a scenario where they care

If you like gen, try linkffn(Birds of a feather by wolfswillow) linkffn(Wrong Champion) is a great oneshot. linkao3(A dealer not a death eater) is a great ongoing fic. linkffn(Cactus and the toad) is Severus Neville friendship. Swung by serafim by flamethrower is. Nice kinda gen story. I don't think there was any pairing in that . Of a linear circle by the same author is great sev/omc

linkffn(The memory of water by whitehound)
