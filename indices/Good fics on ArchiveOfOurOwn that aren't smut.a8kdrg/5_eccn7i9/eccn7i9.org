People must be tired of me recommending these by now, but here goes:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]] (Series) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mad_fairy/pseuds/mad_fairy][mad_fairy]] - I don't remember any smut scenes in this. Harry prays to Loki summer after first year. Bashing is only because people take a while to adapt to a more independent Harry, and slash warning is for minor characters. Complete.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719529][Ninja Wizard: The Adventures of Harry Potter, Dimensional Traveler]] (Series) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mad_fairy/pseuds/mad_fairy][mad_fairy]] - There is a little bit of smut in the last two books, but really short scenes and can be easily skipped over. There is a whole book that can be read as a stand alone where Harry goes to the avatar universe and joins Aang and the gang on their adventures. Slash is for Harry. Complete.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] (Series) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/sunmoonandstars/pseuds/sunmoonandstars][sunmoonandstars]] - So far, this has been very age appropriate for pre-teen and young teen relationships i.e. We're in fifth year and there's been barely any dating let alone smut. It is WBWL, James Potter survives/bashing, lots of other bashing, political and Slytherin Harry, etc. but it's very well done.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13414074][The Problem With Soulmarks Is]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/LadyAramisGrey/pseuds/LadyAramisGrey][LadyAramisGrey]] - 69k and nothing romantic yet. "The fiasco that is Harry's life could be summed up in two words --- Avada Kedavra. Those words have haunted him for as long as he can remember, endangering him with their very existence. He'd resigned himself to a life without a soulmate, to pain and sorrow... but then the Blacks happened. Or, one Black in particular. Whose idea was it to let a Black woman invent time travel, anyway?"

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15966983][Harriet Potter and the Meddling of The Fates]] by[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/ItCouldAllBeForNothingTommorow/pseuds/ItCouldAllBeForNothingTommorow][ItCouldAllBeForNothingTommorow]] - 107k and no romance yet. Fem Harry is Loki's daughter - this is the best version of this trope I've seen yet and does a really good job of making Voldie be on Harry's side but in a realistic way (for a world filled with magic and Asgardians anyway). I honestly love it and can't wait until the author gets a new charger so that they can go back to writing.
