[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8125531][Hogwarts, to welcome you home]] is my favorite Harry as DADA Professor fic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12299451/chapters/27959679][Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow]] focuses around a conversation between Lupin and Hermione. Set early on in DH.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14842689/chapters/34356255?view_adult=true][Employee of the Month]] follows Remus after the death of James and Lily as he attempts to live in the muggle world.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785/chapters/20815621][The Man Who Lived]] is slash, but very plot heavy. Unique story line and original characters that you come to know and care for as much as the familar characters we all know. I'd read the authors note before starting, however, as certain topics may be triggering to some.
