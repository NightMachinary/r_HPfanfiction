  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Eventual Gideon Prewett/Harry Potter. Tags will be updated when it becomes relevant. Updated every Saturday.

  Draco is off for his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. His mother is dead and his father is a traitor and people think he's some kind of hero, but Draco trusts in his aunt Andromeda, who raised him, and his cousin Nymphadora, who's his big sister. Everything will be all right.

  Circumstance makes Harry an offer he can't refuse.“I can get you the Elixir of Life,” Harry says. “But I need your help with something else.”“You,” says Voldemort, cautious now, wary now that this confrontation hasn't gone at all like he expects, a little incredulous, “need Lord Voldemort to help you?”Harry looks right past him for a second, jaw tense. “Yeah. You're the only one who can, apparently.”

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter dies a second time of, of all things, quite surprising and unanticipated old age. Once again arrived at King's Cross, he is offered his rightful seat on the Onward Train, but, in that one split second between Life and After, he discovers that though one can take the horcrux out of the Boy-Who-Lived, the crotchety, intensely private family man and world-renowned Auror who grew to take his place is not quite immune to fear-of-death by association. Not quite time travel, it's yet a trope... But... Not. An epic tale of love, hope, renewal, second chances, revisited priorities, and thoroughly buggered plans and plotlines... None of which are nearly as accidental or incidental as one might imagine. Part One recommended for context.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun.
