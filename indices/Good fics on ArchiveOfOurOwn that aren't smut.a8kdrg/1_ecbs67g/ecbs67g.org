There's plenty good on Ao3, just hard to filter out all of the smut. I mostly find an author I like and take a look at their bookmarks. I also browse through [[https://pinboard.in][pinboard.in]] since it has a huge number of fanfiction bookmarkers and many like Ao3. I included some excellent fics that happen to be slash, but none are explicit and frankly most don't get anywhere near the labeled slash relationship. Hopefully you'll enjoy at least one of these and it can be a springboard to finding more fics:
