Many of the recommendations in this thread can also be found mirrored on FFN. I haven't delved deeply in Ao3 yet, so I can only recommend a few that are exclusive to that site.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] - A WBWL Slytherin!Harry fic. Currently in progress on book 5. Book 1 is "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12608820][Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes]]".

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3459731][The Two Body Problem]] - Ginny gives the diary horcrux to Hermione in year 2. No romance.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/224284][Hogwarts: A (Marvelous) History, or: Thor and Loki's Excellent Adventure]] - A crossover in which Thor and Loki help to found Hogwarts while masquerading as wizards by the name of "Godric Gryffindor" and "Salazar Slytherin".
