I think this entire idea goes against HP. Wizards don't have different levels of power. Neville 'almost a squib' is him just pouting and lacking self confidence and ability.

If people are born better at magic any others it reinforces the pureblood dogma. The strong marry the strong to have strong children. Can't let the mudbloods screw that up.
