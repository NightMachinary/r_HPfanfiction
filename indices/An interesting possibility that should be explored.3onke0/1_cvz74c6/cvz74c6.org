It's deplorable. How many children were murdered by their 'purist' bigoted caregivers just because their magic wasn't 'flashy' enough for a book to accept? I'm thinking the only reason Neville survived as many attempts as his family put him through because there wasn't a chance of Frank fathering another son. They started small and only ended up being extremely drastic, i.e, throwing him out of windows/certain death, in his year before Hogwarts, whereas I can see that if they thought Frank capable of begetting a new heir they had likely have tossed Neville out within his first year.

Edit: possible storylines? All those squibs that were cast out were identified as muggleborns. The prodigal children return home. But then again 'VenGenCe HasT CoME/ HeRe's JohNnY!' storylines tickle my funny bone.
