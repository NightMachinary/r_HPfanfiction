  The Quill's sensitivity, coupled with the Book's implacability, have never yet made a mistake.

If you accept this story as canon then you have to accept it hasn't made a mistake. The book merely rejects early hints of magic that might be from a squib's parents, whereas the quill will write down any sign of magic. So no matter how strong a wizard will eventually become, they have to produce enough magic as a child to prove they aren't a squib. Which all witches and wizards do if it's never been wrong.
