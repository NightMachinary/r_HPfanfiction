  "It has never made a mistake"

  "That doesn't have to mean it never had a false negative, and refused a wizard or witch by *mistake*."

There's probably a reason why it says the two strike a balance to avoid any kind of mistake, otherwise it would only be up to the book if it rejected real wizards.
