That's actually not a valid interpretation because you have no criteria for the book opening, which the text specifically states that it does. You're both simply ignoring that part and focusing only on when it closes because that was more defined.

That's like hearing a remote control will turn a TV off and thinking it can't turn it back on again because no one told you how it works.
