  It's purpose is not to admit wizards but to reject squibs.

Actually the whole point of the quill and book is to admit wizards. One tries to admit anyone related and the other waits until it's a sure thing.

Your analogy makes no sense because sexual fidelity only applies to those in a sexual relationship, otherwise it would only be called fidelity. A better analogy would be a wind-up alarm clock, where the spring inside is always trying to ring the bells, but the clock only allows it to when it's the right time. The point is still to have it ring though, not keep it from ringing.
