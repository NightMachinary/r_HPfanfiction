Whenever I read "muggleborns actually are stealing Magic from wizards", I can't help but think of "(insert race) actually want to harm and ruin aryans".

I would focus more on the fact that the book manages to miss actual wizards. Actual powerful wizards, just because they are not dramatically magic enough.
