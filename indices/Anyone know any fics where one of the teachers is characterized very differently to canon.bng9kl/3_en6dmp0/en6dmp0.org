[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9818387/1/]] The Amplitude, Frequency, and Resistance of the Soul Bond.

An actually good soul bond fic. It's not the typical “Oh we have a soul bond so we are now in love!!!” story. Dumbledore is batshit hilarious here. Ni bashing I believe. It is also dead as a doorknob
