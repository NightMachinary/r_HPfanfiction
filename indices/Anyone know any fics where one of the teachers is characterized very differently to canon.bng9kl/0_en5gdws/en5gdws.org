Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality)

Instead of being the stuttering fool that nobody takes seriously, Quirrelmort is a complete genius and the best DADA teacher hogwarts had in a long time, as well as Harry's effective mentor. He's still evil AF, but much more effective and dangerous.

Linkffn(When in doubt, Obliviate)

Lockhart raised Harry and is a bit more competent as DADA teacher. He's still a fraud, but he's much more competent at hiding his incompetence.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent)

5th year fic written before OOTP was released, so no Umbridge or Luna. Instead, the DADA teacher is the real Moody, who is significantly different from Crouch's act.

Linkffn(The Arithmancer)

Professor Vector, the Arithmancy professor, plays an important role as Hermione's mentor.

Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

Harry is raised by Sirius and knows Remus very well as adoptive uncle by the time he becomes DADA professor.

Linkffn(The Daring Win)

Harry raised by Umbridge.
