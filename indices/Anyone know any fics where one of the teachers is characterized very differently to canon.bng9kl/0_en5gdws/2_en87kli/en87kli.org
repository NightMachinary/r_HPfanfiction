I've blitzed through loads of the Umbridge one since you recced it. Just about exactly what I was looking for, a twist on the characters and world we know facilitated by events happening in a slightly different order. /Of course/ Umbridge's anti-Muggle prejudice and desire for power would lead her to rescue Harry Potter from Petunia if she happened to see her abusing him and realise what that rescue could do for her political ambitions!
