linkffn(Stages of Hope)

A likeable Snape that wears Burgundy, isn't in love with Lily and is best friends with Sirius, who's also on a rotatiing schedule with Remus as the DADA professor.

linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky)

McGonagal is a taskmaster when it comes to training, Snape, while still being a dick, is extremely funny with his acidic sarcasm and remarks. Dumbledore is the pretty much one of the best "true to canon" Dumbledore's there is all fanon. He's powerful as fuck, is old, flawed, trying to win a war by using all the tools and people available to him, and is trying his best, while being fairly humourous. Not a GG/Dumbles, actually useful and good Dumbledore. Moody is vicious as fuck as a trainer too, but that's usually what happens. Also one of the best Remus/Tonks fics, even if they aren't the major focus (i'd say 10% of the fic is dedicated to them).

linkffn(The Art of Self-fashioning)

Best McGonagal-mentor there is, imo.

linkffn(Fraterculus; Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

completely different Lockhart. In one, he's, well, not what it seems. In the other, he's done exactly what he says he's done in the books, so he isn't a fraud.
