Hey, sometimes our favorite fics can have extremely problematic parts. One of my favorite fics has a problematic Snape/Hermione pairing and a randomly petulant/slutty Tonks. On that basis alone, I should hate it, but dammit, the rest of the fic is so engaging and unusual and well-written I can't! I love it, in spite of those major flaws.

I mean, fanfic is free stories, by amateurs, about our favorite characters. Almost none of it is going to be perfect. If the only fics we recommended were the perfect ones, there would hardly be any fic recs at all. ;)
