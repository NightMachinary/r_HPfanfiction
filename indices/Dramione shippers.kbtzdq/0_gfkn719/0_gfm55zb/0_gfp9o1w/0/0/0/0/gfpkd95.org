It's called The Dark Lord's Daughter, and it's a fic where Hermione is actually Bellatrix and Voldemort's daughter. I love the fic in spite of the problematic parts (which I mentioned) because of the relationships between the Black sisters (as well as their relationships with Hermione) run the gamut from poignant to loving, tragic to hilarious, and ring absolutely true to life.

It also has one of the best portrayals of an abusive relationship I've ever seen in a fic (LV/Bellatrix.) Now usually any fic containing a well-realized abusive relationship would be an angst-filled, depressing slog but somehow this is /not/. It's serious in places, sure, but Bella's and Hermione's relationship and it's hopefulness and the way it slowly changes Bella sort of balances out the angst.

The author also includes details/small moments about the characters I absolutely treasure. Like, Bella is portrayed as exceptionally talented and smart as a whip, but it's a running joke through the fic that her recreational reading tends toward low-brow smutty romance/erotica.

I wouldn't say it's the sort of fic everyone would like, but if the idea of a fic exploring loving (yet completely dysfunctional) family relationships sounds like your jam, you'll love it.
