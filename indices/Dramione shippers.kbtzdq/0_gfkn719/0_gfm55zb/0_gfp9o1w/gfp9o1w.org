I re-read what I wrote again, and I hope I didn't come off too harsh, especially as I see you deleted your original comment. I think that's a shame as there may have been some Dramione shippers interested in the fic who hadn't heard about it.

I had just happened to read that fic and figured I'd put in a review for non-Dramione shippers since it is one of the most popular fics in the ship, and sometimes well-written fics can have universal appeal. I know I've read fics about pairings I wasn't a fan of, and I've enjoyed them because the fic was so well-written.

I just didn't think this fic was one of those, although I didn't hate it (as is reflected by my average overall rating.)

Again, I hope my words didn't lead you to delete your post! I'm sure there were some people out there who hadn't heard about it and were interested because of your post.
