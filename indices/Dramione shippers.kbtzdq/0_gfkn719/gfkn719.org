My review as a fan of Harry Potter and not a fan of Dramione specifically:

I read/skimmed it a while ago, and TBH, it's a lot like the Handmaid's Tale AUs that every fandom has.

Here's the basic plot of every fanfic derived from HT (you're welcome): The heroine is forced into sexual servitude/forced impregnation to the “hero”. She initially thinks the hero is an evil monster. However, events transpire and the woman realizes that the hero is not /so/ bad, he was a victim of circumstances, tragically misunderstood, etc. In fact, he actually tries to “protect” the heroine, insofar as his position will allow (which usually isn't very far, thus giving the author plenty of scope for rape scenes that are “ok” because the hero secretly wishes he didn't have to do it.)

Further events transpire, and the hero and heroine (sometimes with a baby, sometimes not) escape to live their lives in “freedom”. Yet it's not truly freedom since the hero will never be accepted by society because of his crimes so the heroine must once again sacrifice her independence to hide out/go on the run with the hero.

Somehow, they live bittersweetly ever after.

The end.

The extent to which you like each individual fic in this genre will depend largely on your affection for the fandom and ship, and how well the author can tell you a story that's been done to death.

I'd rate this story a 5/10 if you have no particular feeling for Dramione either way. It's readable, but definitely drags in places. I'd give it a look if you want a story to while away a long afternoon and you don't have anything else to read.

TLDR: This story is brain candy. It goes down easily, you'll enjoy it while it lasts, but ultimately it isn't very filling or memorable. You might also feel a little queasy and ashamed when you're done.
