I am hugely in love with story and reread it a lot, yet I'm not a dramione shipper and I don't read the Handmaid's Tale parts anymore ( start at chapter 27 instead, the first of the flashbacks). So what's in this story for a person like me, aside from the quality of the writing?

IMHO It has the best and only believable second wizarding war depiction ( but if any of you know a better one, please recommend). Dumbledore, Remus and Sirius are still dead, the Ministry is still fallen, and Kingsley is leading the OOTP in a guerrilla war. Snape is still a spy, and no longer the only one. The characters are believable, grieving and altered by their experiences of fighting a war. They are hardened fighters. They've had to let some of their principles go, and they argue and angst about this. Hermione, Ron and Harry still have a close bond but it's getting fractured. I find it mesmerising. It's like the Battlestar Galactica tv series before it jumped the shark.
