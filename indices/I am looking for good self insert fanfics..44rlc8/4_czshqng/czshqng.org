From my SI is merged with Tom Riddle from the diary story- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11730768/1/Magic-and-Mayhem][Magic and Mayhem]]

  Opening the door I find myself looking down at a young Miss Granger.

  I find myself inexplicably disappointed that she does not appear to resemble a young Emma Watson. Given that I have no idea who that is, I'm not sure why I feel so strongly about it, but I do.

I think that meets some of your criteria (inverted in the movie vs books case), but the story is just getting started and since the SI thinks he's Tom Riddle... YMMV.

Also, [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/]] is a less commonly referenced site with fanfictions that seems to have an unusually high ratio of SI and Quest type stories. You might find something there that appeals to you.
