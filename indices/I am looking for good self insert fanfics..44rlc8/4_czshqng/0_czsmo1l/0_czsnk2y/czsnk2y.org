Cool!

Both of my 'SI' fics are on Spacebattles and I generally post there first to let people comment on any grammar and spell goof ups I make before pasting it over to FFN.

I'd try to give you more recs, but my favorite SIs are for Buffy the Vampire Slayer not HP. I did like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth][A Curse of Turth]] now that I'm thinking about it, but as with anything that's enjoyed primarily for the humor - [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YMMV][YMMV.]]
