I enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11192690/1/Welcome-the-Hellmouth-or-how-I-learned-you-can-t-outrun-a-vampire][Welcome to the Hellmouth]] because the SI's interaction with the main cast is so different than usual. I should warn you that it's incomplete and ends somewhat abruptly. Also, as is typical for me, I enjoyed it mostly for the humor and my tastes there may be different than yours.

I actually enjoyed WttH enough that when it ended, and there was no more, I got angry and grumped about my condo for a while before starting the journey that eventually led to me writing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11608334/1/Blood-and-Chaos][my own BTVS SI - Blood and Chaos.]] in which I die in the prolog. The rest of the story follows the vampire that rises a few nights later and has my memories of the show. Said vampire's favorite sport is trolling Buffy.
