Can I ask how you (And OP as well) would qualify 'good' since I'm sure the answer varies a fair bit among readers.

I assume things like being as typo free as possible are assumed as a baseline, but there's other things that some people seem to care about very deeply about, while others can't be arsed to care. For examples:

Does it need to be canon compliant? Do you care if the SI makes believable butterfly effect ripples or would you prefer the story follow canon's... general progression of events? Do you want the SI to do a possession sue of an existing character or be an add-on to the cast?
