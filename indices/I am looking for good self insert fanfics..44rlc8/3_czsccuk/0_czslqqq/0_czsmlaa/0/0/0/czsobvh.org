Well, for my own stories that I recc'd elsewhere in this thread, I admit to struggling with when to use a semi-colon outside of programming in Java, but I've noticed that I get far less replies pointing out typos now than when I first started writing.

Also, the versions on FFN have been through a few rounds editing and of letting readers call me out on any such things.
