Hm, honestly I like the edit: depiction in "In The Mind Of A Scientist" linkffn(8551180) (Part one of a trilogy/series- part two has him joining Star Gate, and highly recommend both, the third, not so much.)

In it, they are scientists/researchers really, and just regular people more or less. Well, regular aside from being intelligent, wizards/witches and, ya know, messing with things man was not meant to know.

Don't get to see all that much of em, but some as Harry is recruited.

What do I think of them? I think they suck balls at security, and are underutilized in fanfiction. No fan art that I've seen, but I don't go looking for any fan art.
