In the fic I'm writing, the Unspeakables are divided into two groups: The Researchers, and the Field Agents.

Researchers are the ones who study the deepest mysteries of magic, and have a liason to the Department of Experimental Charms.

Field Agents are pretty much Warehouse 13 Agents. Their job is to track down dangerous magical artifacts and contain or destroy them. They basically combine the professions of Curse-Breaker and Auror, and in some cases have them working undercover in said professions.
