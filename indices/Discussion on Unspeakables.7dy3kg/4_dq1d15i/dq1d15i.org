I think Unspeakables work great in many different forms. They are just mysterious enough to give multiple options in fanfiction.

I feel that the most canon appropriate use is as magical researchers delving into things beyond what the average wizard should know. This can be as boring or as interesting as you want in fanfiction.

My other favorite interpretation is as magical special agents with all the fun magic that comes with that such as robes and spells that hide their identities. I think this one is especially fun to see explored.
