  Unspeakables, Harry discovers, do not wear masks.

  He doesn't know why he assumed that they did - he'd known for a while that Unspeakables worked anonymously in the Ministry due to the dangerous and confidential nature of a lot of their work, and his mind had simply conjured up the image of an Unspeakable in their deep, purple robes and wearing a mask not that different to those of the Death Eaters, but they don't. As Harry and Snape follow Dorian Keats down the corridors of the Department of Mysteries, which Keats traverses with ease, Unspeakables pass them by, and although Harry looks at their faces, he finds that as soon as they pass by, he forgets the features of them.

  "Professor," Harry murmurs quietly, and Snape glances at him.

  "It's an enchantment embedded in their robes, Potter," he answers at length, and he says, "Unspeakables have always been anonymous, and have worn similar enchantments since the advent of the Ministry of Magic."

The above is from my fic, The Serpent's Gaze.

I really love the thought of the Unspeakables, honestly: I like the idea that they're effectively researchers pushing the very boundaries of magic and trying to see what their limits are. The Unspeakables, to me, aren't necessarily like hugely exciting, but I definitely see them as being like, scientists in many ways. They try to understand the elements of the universe they don't yet know in detail, whether those elements are to do with magic, the soul, death, time, or even the secret of life itself.

I see them as being completely anonymous, and people pretty much always thinking Unspeakables work in other areas of the Ministry of Magic, just because a lot of what they deal with is dangerous and /extremely/ contentious with the Wizarding World as a whole. A lot of the experiments they perform or the stuff they look into could easily be deemed very offensive or very /dangerous/ by a lot of people across the society, and I can see people having issues with it - Unspeakables trying to figure out immortality, for example, or messing with time streams or the like.

Because I see the Department of Mysteries as so very complex and ineffable, though, I kind of prefer when they're just a mildly ominous concept in the background. As soon as people explore them in detail, I pretty much lose interest, as it takes /away/ from the effect rather than adding to it.
