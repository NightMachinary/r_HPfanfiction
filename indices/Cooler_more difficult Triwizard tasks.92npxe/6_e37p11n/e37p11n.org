For making the tasks, I'd stick to how they supposedly represented some trait of a good wizard, like they did in the book (the first one representing taking on a task without knowing it, the second one being research I think, and the third one being . . . a maze . . . gof is my least favorite book, so I can't remember the exact details lol). But if you pick some traits you like, find some puzzles/challenges based off of those and go from there maybe?
