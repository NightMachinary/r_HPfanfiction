The Triwizard Tournament is supposed to encourage inter-school relationships and goodwill. So the more they can work together, the better. Also bear in mind that the people planning the tasks may have their own agendas, so that may interfere with the whole working together thing.

If you're having small teams competing, consider tasks that all but require small teams. Having one person standing guard in a room in a maze while the other works on solving a puzzle to open the next door, for instance.

Finally, shameless plug for my own fic that features different tasks, linkao3(Neville Longbottom and the Cherry Champion) (starts at part 1, linkao3(Harry Potter and the Girl in Red)).
