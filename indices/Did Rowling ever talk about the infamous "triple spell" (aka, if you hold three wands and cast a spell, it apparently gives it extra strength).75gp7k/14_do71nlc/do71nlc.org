I personally quite liked an idea I once came across that had staffs as more powerful, and duel wands a thing, but because wands were more suited for every day use (more precise, I think staffs were limited in what they could do), most people never used them. I think Hit Wizards and curse breakers may have had them? I think it was likened to wands being handguns, and staffs being an anti tank rifle or something.
