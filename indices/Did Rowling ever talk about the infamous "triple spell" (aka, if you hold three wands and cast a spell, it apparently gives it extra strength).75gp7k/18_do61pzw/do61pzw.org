If using more, bigger, multicore, super rare, ancient, etc... wands made a difference then Voldemort would have done it far sooner than hunting for the Elder Wand during the Deathly Hallows.

He said best, the exceptional wand doesn't allow exceptional magic, the wizard who is exceptional does.

If using multiple wands at the same time drastically increased spell power then many more wizards would be doing it, Olivander would be selling multiwands.

Nope, just more fanon bullcrap.
