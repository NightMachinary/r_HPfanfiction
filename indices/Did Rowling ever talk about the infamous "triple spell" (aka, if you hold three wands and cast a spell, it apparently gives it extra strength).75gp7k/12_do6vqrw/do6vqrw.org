You know, I prefer to think that using three wands at once shoots one's control to hell and as such whatever spell Harry did intend to use at that moment ended up being nothing more than a mass of badly-formed spell-things that simply didn't really work and just threw whatever it hit back as it exploded due to not being well-formed and that, had it not been for the fact that Greyback got thrown into the ceiling and lost consciousness due to that, it would have only annoyed him.

After all, there already is an instance of someone losing consciousness from being thrown into a wall due to being hit with multiple spells: Snape in Shrieking Shack in book 3.
