Yes. That is what happens.

The purpose of this post is to find out if there is any explanation beyond the surface explanation.

Because the SURFACE explanation is, "If you hold more than one wand, you can easily cast more than one spell/the same spell at extra power."

Remember, Harry doesn't get tired or anything after casting this triple spell. That's generally not how magic works in HP- you don't have "mana reservoirs," magic doesn't really make you tired like that.

So, if the surface explanation is true, it makes every single wizard in the world an idiot for not wandering around with a bunch of wands duct-taped together.

So, either every wizard in the world is an idiot (which, to be fair, isn't a huge jump), or there's a better explanation (or JKR screwed up and hasn't retconned it).
