Wands aren't only used for fighting and often need precision to be usefull.

And in fighting situations you want to be able to target things far away. It could be used as a shotgun alternative, but I think very often if you work in a team you will probably lose too much precision. And might acidentally hit an ally. Also it's not clear how easy it is to get an additonal wand. While one wand might be cheap additional wands might only be sold under certain circumstances as they can only be used for fighting.
