Perhaps they already have this.

If you tape 3 wands together and then put them inside a bigger wand it would basically be a multi-core wand right?

Instead of making three separate wands perhaps put three cores in one wand for the same effect. It's essentially 3 wands that are thinner than normal and each shaped like a 1/3rd crosspiece of a whole wand. Use some wood glue to hold them all together and sand it so you can't even tell it's three different pieces.
