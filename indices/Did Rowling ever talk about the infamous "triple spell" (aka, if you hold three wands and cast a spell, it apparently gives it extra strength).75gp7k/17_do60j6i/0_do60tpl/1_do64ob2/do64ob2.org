Ignoring the Doylist nonsense, you could say that Harry cast three Stupefy spells from the three wands at the same target. This might prove an effective technique in limited circumstances, like dragon-handlers having a pepper-box of cheap wands as their backup when a dragon gets feisty. Most other times, having three different wands trying to initiate the same effect wouldn't be complimentary. Imagine trying to cut something and always getting three slices at once. If three different wands tried to fix the same glasses, it might tear the frames apart. Three wands all trying to animate the same puppet could end up with multiple personalities.

I think it's a viable wank in certain circumstances, but most wizards don't need to carry such firepower.
