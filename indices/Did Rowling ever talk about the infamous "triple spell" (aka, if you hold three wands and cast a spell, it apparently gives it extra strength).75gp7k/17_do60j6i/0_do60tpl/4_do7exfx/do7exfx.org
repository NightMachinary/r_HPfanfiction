Wasn't that the moment that Harry got the Elder wand? (Or am I mis remembering?) If it's the part with the Elder wand that could technically explain it. The Elder wand being more older/powerful would then proceed to connect with the other two wands and hit Greyback.

We unfortunately don't know much about wand lore, I always assumed though that the older the wand was the more powerful it was. Which if it was the Elder Wand could have connected with the others as I stated. (Could be possible).
