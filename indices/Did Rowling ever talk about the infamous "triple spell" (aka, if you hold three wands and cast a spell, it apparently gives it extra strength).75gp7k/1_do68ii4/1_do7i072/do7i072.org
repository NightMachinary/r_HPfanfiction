Funny that, I can actually name a couple where he does use multiple wands regularly. In (Altered Destinies by DobbyElfLord) he uses two wands when playing for keeps, I think he'll use the Elder Wand too, but I can't remember. And in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) he does kinda use multiple wands. But it's more like how Luke Skywalker fought with lightsabers in the Yuuzhan Vong War from the old Star Was EU.
