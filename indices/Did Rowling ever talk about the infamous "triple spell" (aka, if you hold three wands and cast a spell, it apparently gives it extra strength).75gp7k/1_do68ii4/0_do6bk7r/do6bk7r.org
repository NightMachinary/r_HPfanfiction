Are there fanfics where Harry is a massive weeb? If you change the time frame ever so slightly, this could work. The potential for humor would be endless, Harry trying to prepare his triple wand style by, taking Kendo lessons and him hilariously failing at using three swords and everyone telling him, that he´s an idiot for trying only for him to somehow managing to pull it off, and after that he tries to use eight swords like Killer B or tries and somehow succeeding with using jutsus, this would be great if it´s played for laughs.
