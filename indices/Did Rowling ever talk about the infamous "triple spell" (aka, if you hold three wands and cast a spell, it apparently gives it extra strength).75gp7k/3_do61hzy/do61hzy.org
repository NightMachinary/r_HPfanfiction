I figure the world makes more sense if we assume spells don't become stronger purely from holding more wands. Maybe it was just a regular powered stupefy divided into 3 beams.

Or alternatively, maybe it's exponentially more difficult to cast, maybe it's required you be attuned to all three wands which is actually very rare and the spells are actually far less stable. The stunning spell might have succeeded in stunning in this case but typically they'd be far harder to control.

I'd agree, It's not an event best taken at face-value though I don't know if Rowling ever mentioned it anywhere else.
