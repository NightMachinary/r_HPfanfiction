I chalked it up to being similar to when harry used the expelliarmus spell on Snape in the Shrieking Shack. More than anything else, it was his emotions that made his magic do something out of the norm. Perhaps he cast three different spells or a triple powered spell, but I don't think it's something anybody could do under normal circumstances, I think it was just him reacting to a highly stressful situation.
