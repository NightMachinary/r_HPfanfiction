I would interpret this as simply casting the same spell from three wands at once; however, I don't see it as a big power-up. A skilled wizard can probably choose to channel more of his strength into a given spell even with one wand, and carrying multiple wands would be cumbersome and inaccurate.

There are reasons that most guns fire only a single barrel at a time.
