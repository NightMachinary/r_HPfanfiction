This is something that's not entirely clear in canon I would say - you could make an argument either way on how it'd work. Personally I get the impression that yes, he would have been his own person and taking over Ginny's body/possessing it as his own.

Past that, it's very murky. Would Tom (the diary) be able to form new horcruxes? How much could he/it develop past what was imbued in the diary? Would the host shift from the diary to the possessed body? Could his magical ability develop further?

It's also not clear exactly what Horcruxes do in some other ways. In canon we know it splits the soul and houses a fragment of it - but is it halved each time? Always the 'same sized' fragment? Etc, etc. This is something that you could easily debate either way on - or make small switches for your fic.

Eg, if it's halving the soul (with a limit), the first horcrux made could make a whole bunch more. If it's a fragment of the initial soul, perhaps horcruxes could keep making horcruxes - each time making it a weaker and weaker 'copy'.

I've also got a headcanon that all horcruxes can eventually possess the one wearing it if they're let in. We know they affect the thoughts, obviously, but I imagine that wearing one for months/years would eventually let the soul fragment/consciousness seep its way into the one wearing it and start to possess them.
