I would have to say it depends. The only real horcrux exposure we have is the diary of Tom Riddle, the locket of Salazar Slytherin, Nagini, and Harry Potter.

The easiest first, Harry Potter. Harry has the distinction of being the first human horcrux, and humans are known for free will. He was also the seventh horcrux of Voldemort, and accidental. Theoretically, he holds the smallest portion of one Tom Riddle's soul. He is subject to possession by Voldemort, visions through a mental link, and has the abilities of bother parseltongue and to always know when the Dark lord was in close proximity. He was known to inflict great pain to Voldemort through love. Obviously, while tethered to Voldemort's life force, he was not Voldemort., and could not become Voldemort.

Nagini, as a snake, (or a blood cursed human, but that was not canon at the time of production for Deathly Hallows, book or movies) has less mental faculty than a human, yet is still known to have at least some level of reasoning and thinking.) Nagini can be possessed by Voldrmort, and is known to have complete, unwavering loyalty to the Dark Lord, even more than is normal for a serpent and parselmouth. Nagini does not seem to have the potential to become it's own variant of the dark lord, nor does it show desire to.

The locket is an inanimate horcrux, and appears to act autonomously from Voldemort during the Hunt. Whether it is due to Voldemort not being aware of the locket's removal from the inferi cave, or a lack of capability to do so, Voldemort Prime does not use the locket as a weapon. The Locket has some form of legilimency, as when worn by the Golden Trio, it has a negative effect on emotions, and compounds their fears. The locket, surprisingly enough, did not have a notable effect on Delores Umbridge, despite her being in contact with the item for months. A notable phrase used by the locked when opened was " I have seen your heart and it is mine. I have seen your dreams Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears." This show sentience as well. The locket, presumably, could become a new Voldemort.

And last the diary. The first Horcrux. The Diary acts completely autonomously, and does not have any memories of Tom Riddle after the creation of itself. The diary grants parseltongue, and possesses the mind of Ginny weasley, eventually capable of draining her life to build himself a corporeal form. The Diary displays sentience, but not the legilimency the locket was made famous for. The diary absolutely could become a new and different Voldemort.

This is mostly conjecture on my part, but I hope it helps. A good idea of the way horcruxes work is presented in the fanfiction Souls Abound by RobSt, and it is that I used as the basis for some of my theories.
