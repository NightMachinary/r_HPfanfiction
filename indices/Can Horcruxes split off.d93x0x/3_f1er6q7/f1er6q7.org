That was Diary Riddle's plan, so at least 16 y.o. Voldemort believed they could.

I really dislike the idea that a soul has a size in a mathematical sense, and that you can measure Horcruxes in percentage in relation to the 'original'. So I believe that after regaining body, any part of a soul has a capability of becoming bigger than even its whole, depending on its choices and experiences.
