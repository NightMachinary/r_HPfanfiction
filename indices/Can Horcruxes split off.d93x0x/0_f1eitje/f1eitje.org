I'd say YES. He and the 'real' Voldemort would both exist as people, but I think their souls would still be connected.

Still, I would also say that this is unique to the Diary because it was his first horcrux (50% soul) and thus euqally or more powerful. In addition to the hurcrux, the Diary is (presumably) enchanted--like a portrait--to retain his personality; So this wouldn't be possible for the other horcruxes and he couldn't create an army of Voldemorts, lol.

Then again, considering the diary (as a hurcrux) could be destroyed by basilisk venom, one could ask if the resurrected 'Diary'-Voldemort could still be destroyed that way. If so, that begs the question whether Voldemort's original Soul could be destroyed that way. I'd say NO, meaning that the 'real' Voldemort always remains superior, and the 'Diary'-Voldemort always remains a hurcrux (except if he somehow manages to absorb the soul of 'real' Voldemort).

I gotte say I'm a fan of the Diary being resurrected, and then becoming his own entity and fighting against the older Voldemort. Sadly, there aren't any (good) fics with that plot. (Preferably without Ginny dying, and with a Tom/Hermione or Tom/Harry pairing, lol)

Edit: Whith Diary-Voldemort resurrecting, I mean that he 'consumes' Ginny's body to form a new one for himself. He wouldn't absorb Ginny's soul or whatever. Just a new vessel inhabiting Voldemort's soul.
