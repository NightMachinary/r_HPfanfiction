I don't know if it's explicit that it's a halving of the soul from each horcrux - it's possible it's the same sized fragment that gets split off I think.

In any case, I am not aware of any fics with the diary fighting against Voldemort like that - but there are at least some where Tom gets set up as his own character/plots. I just don't know any where he explicitly becomes a good guy.
