I'm not saying there is too much focus on the actions. Rather, not enough. The character don't feel very real because you're never given their motivations and emotions. The stories are a lot of dialogue which isn't very engaging. There aren't really scenes where characters have fights or do something stupid on a whim/lose control because of anger/hate/love/fear. I'm not saying that the characters should be more stupid but rather that they feel too logical and calculating.

To be honest, ever since I've started writing myself, my standards have become really high and I probably wouldn't enjoy the stuff I used to like.

'Delenda Est.' It was one of the first stories I've read on FFN, and I'm also a huge Bellatrix fan, so I might be a little biased there. Still, looking back, I thought the climax wasn't very good and the romance a lot too sparse.

'Luna's Hubby.' Again, one of the first I've read but was really sweet.

'What are you doing in my house.' It's a post-war Harry/Narcissa romance. Not much plot but liked it anyway.

'Blindness.' That one started out really good, but I stopped reading after things grew a little boring for a while. Not sure if it got better or not.

'Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches.' This one would be the only one I could call a 'favorite', even though I think that it is a lot too detailed and slow.

As you can gather from that list (or not), I like stories that have good (fast) pacing, an engaging plot, and interesting romance. Not too many of those around, I'd say.

I generally can point out (a lot of) things I dislike in every single fic. Sometimes I wish I could go back to my previous (ignorant) self and just read.

Edit: I also liked 'Paid in Blood' (Haphne) and 'Brilliant Magic' (Hermione/Fred/George) but again, rather boring climax/ending.
