I're read "The Green Girl", "Lady of the Lake", and "A big ball of Wibbly Wobbly". They're certainly interesting stories. It's just that they don't have these 'in the moment' scenes where you're anxious of the outcome, or any battle scenes at all. It's a more passive style, which I personally don't like so much. You're never really 'with' the character--what they're feeling, if they're hurt, distraught, in love, heart beating loudly, breathing becoming labored... You get what I mean.

Also, the climax always feels very lame and predictable.

The stories feel more like documentations of the character's actions and not a story of the characters, if that makes sense.

Well that's my opinion, and I do have (unreasonable) high standards, so yeah.
