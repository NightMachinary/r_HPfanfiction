Ah I've read The Green Girl and Wibbly Wobbly too, not Lady of the Lake though. It's been a while since I've read them and I didn't love them or anything so I don't remember much of the fics beyond the general plot and my issues with the characterization. So you're saying Colubrina focuses too much on the actions of the characters rather than the emotions? I'd say skip Things in Common then because I don't remember it being different from her other fics just that the other fics of hers I read are Hermione-focused ones and this is a Ginny-focused one.

I'm curious then - what are some of your favourite fics?

Edit: also I totally get you on the high standards thing. Don't say they're unreasonably high! We like what we like. I often find myself dissatisfied with very popular fics and wonder why I can't seem to love fics that so many others do and question if my standards are too high but hey, it is what it is.
