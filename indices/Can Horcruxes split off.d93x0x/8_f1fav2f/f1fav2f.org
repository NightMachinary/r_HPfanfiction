We don't really know enough about Horcruxes to say for certain that they all act that way, only that the Diary does. I'n also pretty sure that it's stated or implied in canon that Voldemort planned to have his diary end up in Hogwarts to open the Chamber, only for him to find out later that Horcruxes are limited in number so he decided against it.

So, there are two main theories I have on why this happens with the diary specifically (in-universe, anyway. A third would be JKR being inconsistent). One, Voldemort modified his diary to act this way, or two, all Horcruxes have unique defences, either set by Voldemort while making them or just by what they are. So the diary can be written in and absorb someone's soul, and the locket needs to be opened in order to be destroyed, but can only be opened by a pareselmouth and has a way to mentally see into an attacker's mind and project images of their fears/insecurities to keep them at bay.
