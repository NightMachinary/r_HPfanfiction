  The same material has to be presented so it can be absorbed by Crabbe and Goyle, not just Hermione Granger.

  Think of the Prince's potion textbook as an example. As printed, it's designed to allow the masses to brew a workable potion. With the notes of a master imparting his secrets, Harry can brew perfect potions with ease.

This has always made me wonder... the textbook is clearly flawed and resulted in mediocre potions being brewed by generations of students... Snape figured it out as a student and perfected the potions, but continues to teach from the old text. I know he's an arrogant misanthrope who loves to belittle students, but wouldn't it frustrate him to no end to have students thinking that he endorsed the textbook?
