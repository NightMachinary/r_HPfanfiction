An interesting argument I've seen (and I admit I haven't had the effort to check back through the books) is that Snape actually writes the correct recipes on the board and tells the students to follow these, but when Slughorn comes he just uses the old book. (Why not, he's been out of the field and retired for some 16 years.)
