I can see that. Though I prefer the alternative.

Instead of master/apprentices passing on their skills. Magic gets, for lack of a better term, dumbed down to be taught to an entire classes of students. The same material has to be presented so it can be absorbed by Crabbe and Goyle, not just Hermione Granger.

Think of the Prince's potion textbook as an example. As printed, it's designed to allow the masses to brew a workable potion. With the notes of a master imparting his secrets, Harry can brew perfect potions with ease.

Not to say there's no innovation in magicial theory. But at the same time, there's a certain quality to going back to basics. I often think of magical combat as a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Dueling style A may be good against style B, but shit against style C. In comes Harry using style Q that no one has seen in a thousand years and have no practiced defense against.
