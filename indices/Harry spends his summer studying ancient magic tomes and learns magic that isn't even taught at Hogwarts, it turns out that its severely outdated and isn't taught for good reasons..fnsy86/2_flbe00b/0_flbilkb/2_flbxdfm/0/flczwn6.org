[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages_(historiography)][What]] [[https://www.history.com/news/6-reasons-the-dark-ages-werent-so-dark][Dark]] [[https://www.medievalists.net/2014/06/15-myths-middle-ages/][Age]]? [[https://www.jstor.org/stable/24448338?seq=1][It's older propaganda]] and I find it [[https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/%7Ejim/medmyths.html][astonishing]] that people think, on the basis that one group of people referred to themselves as "enlightened" and everyone before them as living in a dark age, that therefore we should take this at face value.

And this does tie in with the idea of Harry finding ancient magic texts from a more advanced age, because basically you (and the Enlightenment scholars) are buying into the old Hermetic idea that history has been a process of corruption and loss from an earlier state of greater advancement and purer knowledge, and that the older a text the more advanced and accurate it should be. This is a /religious/ belief, not a scientific or historically informed one.
