Just gonna mention here that humanity as a whole was more avanced in 300BC than in 1000AD. Science and technology doesn't follow this trend either, knowledge isn't a static thing, it can be lost and forgotten.

I mean, the Dark Age was called that for a reason. As was The Enlightenment. Humanity as a whole hasn't been doing the whole "science" thing very consistently at all.

For Wizards, this is an even bigger problem. Spells you invent, especially in the bloody past, you'd like to keep secret, because you are very much safer if nobody can counter them or use them against you or the ones you love. Magical research is dangerous, and requires strict isolation and secrecy, because any new discovery could be something more horrible than you could imagine. So the lone tower in the mountains or the underground bunker filled with labs would be commonplace in a society that doesn't want to accidentally spread memetic viruses, or evil creatures, or anything of that sort. All that of course leads to more secrecy. Technology you can sell, knowledge not so much. And if you can't make money off it, there's no incentive to release it to the public for most people.
