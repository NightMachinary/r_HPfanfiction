  Realistically doing this, would be like preparing for science class by studying the works of Aristotle and Newton instead of modern books.

Not quite the same. Magical knowledge makes a wizard personally more powerful. Aristotle and Newton may have been less keen on sharing their insights if their knowledge made them the supermen of their era.

Tbh the wizarding world is doing pretty well in that they have the education system that they do, instead of exclusive smaller groups that jealously hoard their knowledge and fight to steal from others.
