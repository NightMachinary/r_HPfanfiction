I think you forget all the little things the Room of Requirement does. First off, yes it can conjure and vanish objects, but it does that by itself, automatically. Those spells are considered advanced by most people, and here they are automated. It can also call on objects within a pocket dimension (The Room of Hidden Things) and move stuff there. It can selectively allow people to enter it, and hide itself away when it doesn't want to be found. Based on some comments by the Weasley twins, and Dumbledore, it can manifest itself anywhere in the castle, it's just more consistent and easier to access in the seventh floor corridor. Its space expansion is greater than anything else we see in the series (with the possible exception of Newt Scammander's briefcase). It can create exits and entrances /outside/ of Hogwarts. The Hogshead inn is not directly connected to the castle, and the tunnel that was used does not go beneath the ground. That means the Room of Requirement can create passages through space-time. Essentially creating short range wormholes.

We have never seen anything do that before or since. And all of this is done by the Room itself, no practice required for the one using it.
