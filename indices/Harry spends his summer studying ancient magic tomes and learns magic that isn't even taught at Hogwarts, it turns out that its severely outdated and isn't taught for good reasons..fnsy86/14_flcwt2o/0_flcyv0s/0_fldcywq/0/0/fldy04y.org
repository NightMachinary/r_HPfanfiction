Sure, we see enchanted items do some of these things, but none as comprehensive or useful as the Room of Requirement.

We see expanded trunks and handbags, and even an item pouch that can summon the desired object to the user's hand, but that was dependent on the properties of a specific magical creature, and it still couldn't really compete with the Room.

Conjuring creates things from scratch, it doesn't summon them from a nearby pocket dimension. Vanishing... I'm a bit uncertain on, but I think that one has been a bit inconsistently portrayed. I'm pretty sure it was explained, and is usually used as a way to completely unmake something. That isn't what the Room of Requirement does. It pulls things from the Room of Hidden Things. It /can/ conjure things, and thus can presumably vanish stuff too, but if you need something specific, it's better that it's a real object.

I'm pretty sure Dumbledore and the Weasly twins didn't come upon the Room on the seventh floor. The Weaslys /may/ have been, as they were looking for a way to hide, but Dumbledore had no reason to go there when what he was looking for was a lavatory.

Space expansion may get larger than the Room of Requirement, but as I said, the largest we've seen is there. (probably)

And while I can't say exclusively that the tunnel to the Hogshead inn /isn't/ through the ground, I am pretty sure it isn't. I can't remember anything about the tunnel going downwards, which it'd have to do to go beneath the ground. And wasn't the entrance/exit in the second storey of the house?

It may be possible for modern magic users to build something similar to the Room of Requirement, but I don't think there is a single instance of that in the books. The only competition it has is probably the Department of Mysteries, but as we haven't seen much of it, it is hard to say something like that conclusively.

And yes, you can lock a door with magic and only allow certain people to enter. Wards is basically that as an entire discipline, but if you break down the wall before Diagon Alley, or mash down the wards of whatever place you're trying to enter, you're going to get in. The Room simply won't be there. There is no wall to knock down, no ward to break. It's just not there.

Platform 9^{3/4} may be the same, but as there's an exit/entrance where the train tracks goes I wouldn't count on it. Still, this feature is probably the one most likely to be available to modern wizards (besides the basic ones)
