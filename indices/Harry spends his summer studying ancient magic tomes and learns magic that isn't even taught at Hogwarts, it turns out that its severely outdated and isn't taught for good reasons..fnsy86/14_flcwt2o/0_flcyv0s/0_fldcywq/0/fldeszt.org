  First off, yes it can conjure and vanish objects, but it does that by itself, automatically.
#+end_quote

Yeah, because its enchanted, enchanted items use magic by themselves all the time.

#+begin_quote
  Those spells are considered advanced by most people, and here theybare automated.
#+end_quote

Human transfiguration is also advanced and the Weasley Twins managed to put that into a candy.

#+begin_quote
  It can also call on objects within a pocket dimension (The Room of Hidden Things) and move stuff there.
#+end_quote

Yeah, as I said it vanishes and conjures objects.

#+begin_quote
  selectively allow people to enter it, and hide itself away when it doesn't want to be found
#+end_quote

It's cleary protected by an enchantment to only be accessed by a certain method, but even those are plentiful in the books, its like the entrance to diagon alley.

#+begin_quote
  Based on some comments by the Weasley twins, and Dumbledore, it can manifest itself anywhere in the castle, it's just more consistent and easier to access in the seventh floor corridor.
#+end_quote

I dont think there is anything that implies that they weren't on the seventh floor when they needed it.

#+begin_quote
  It's space expansion is greater than anything else we see in the series (with the possible exception of Newt Scammander's briefcase.
#+end_quote

we aren't actually ever told that there is a limit to space expansion or that others who used it were unable to make it bigger, comments by Rowling also suggest that making enormous rooms isn't out of question.

#+begin_quote
  The Hogshead inn is not directly connected to the castle, and the tunnel that was used does not go beneath the ground. That means the Room of Requirement can create passages through space-time. Essentially creating short range wormholes.
#+end_quote

I was under the impression that it simply created a tunnel.

Look the room is clearly impressive spell work, but it really doesn't seem like anything a group of modern skilled wizards couldn't create if they dedicated some of their time to it. Most of the magic that is used clearly common knowledge.
