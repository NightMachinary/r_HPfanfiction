My point wasn't that their works are entirely wrong, but rather that pretty much everything useful about it, is already included in modern textbooks, but stuff like Newton's alchemy or the Metaphysics of Aristotle aren't taught for good reasons.

And like I taught the other guy, and for some reason was extremely down-voted for, the magic that is used in the room of requirement isn't anything not taught at Hogwarts, it certainly seems to mostly be a room enchanted with space expansion, vanishing and conjuration spells, all of which are still by modern wizard.

Likewise most of the magic of Hogwarts doesn't seem to be anything overly complicated, like certainly it would take a lot of effort and time, but none of it is really seems like a form of unique or forgotten magic.
