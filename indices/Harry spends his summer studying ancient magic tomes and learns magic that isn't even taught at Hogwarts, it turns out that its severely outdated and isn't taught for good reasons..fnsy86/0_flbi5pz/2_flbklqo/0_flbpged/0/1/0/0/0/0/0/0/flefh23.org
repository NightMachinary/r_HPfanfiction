My rereads consist of

1.saviour of magic (don't ask, it just stuck with me)

2.dodging prison and stealing witches( it's just too good)

3.courage and cunning( great fic)

4.harry potter and the elemental's power (way too well written not to read)

5.harry potter and the game (I honestly should read this more, it's an AMAZING concept and it's executed masterfully)

Those aren't in any resemblance of order but it still stands that I think they are my top 5, though I think I missed one fic somewhere.

I'll link them if you want to read them
