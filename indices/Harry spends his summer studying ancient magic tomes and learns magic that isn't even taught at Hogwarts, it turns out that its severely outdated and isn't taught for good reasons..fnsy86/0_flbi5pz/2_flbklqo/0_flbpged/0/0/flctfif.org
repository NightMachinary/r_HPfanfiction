Yah nah I've never gotten through more than a couple of chapters, mostly because Harry obviously hates magic and anything magical (seriously, his first response to anything muggle science can't explain is "that's impossible and I hate it"). The constant arrogance and the notion that a little boy who hasn't even read his schoolbooks can lecture a wizard on magic he has studied for over a hundred years basically make it unreadable.
