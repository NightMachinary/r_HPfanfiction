Personally, I always figured that there might have been something forgotten to time that they indeed did better back then, or at least different, but on the whole, things from that time is appropriately vastly out of date. For example, there might have been an arcane form of movement (say, mirrors for example) that completely ignores more modern wards (a la Vanishing Cabinet) that people could abuse to travel past protections, but stopped being used for a reason. Maybe it was more risky, such as people getting stuck inside, people not coming out of the other side whole due to the mirror being broken -- which could also explain the "origins" of the "7 years of bad luck" saying -- or similar.

Another example would be something like a cure to Lycanthropy. Maybe back when the original curse was brand new, it was more rampant and a cure was eventually found, but it was forgotten to time with most werewolves in actual society disappearing (leaving only the "feral" ones that travel in packs). This doesn't imply that the people back then did it better, but that they might have had things we no longer have.
