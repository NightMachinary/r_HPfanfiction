Something could increase in use due to lower risk, ease of use, flexibility, etc.

I like the approach of older magic being more wild, less controlled - capable of being more powerful in some situations, but also just more dangerous to the user. Like your example of Tom almost blowing up his own arm - if that came from a potent spell that could outdo modern ones in its intended use when it works, but 1/4 times it'd backfire horrifically, wouldn't it make sense for society to move away from it - even to a 'weaker' spell?
