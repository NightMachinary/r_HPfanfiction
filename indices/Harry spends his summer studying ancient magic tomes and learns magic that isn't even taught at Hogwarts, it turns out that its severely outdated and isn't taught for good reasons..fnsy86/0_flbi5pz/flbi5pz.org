[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment]] has this, though the main character is Tom Riddle. One of my favorite lines is "Slytherin was skilled but if he was a thousand years ahead of his time we should all have cause for embarrassment." Tom also almost blows up his own arm when using ancient magic. I personally abhor the idea that "ancient magickzals" are more powerful as well. Seriously, if they were so good, who the hell would forget them?
