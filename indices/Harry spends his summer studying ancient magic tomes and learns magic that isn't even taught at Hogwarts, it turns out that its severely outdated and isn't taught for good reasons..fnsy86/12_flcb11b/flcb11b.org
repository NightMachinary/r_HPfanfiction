For a different take on this: linkfp(Mother of Learning) has a world that used to have divine intervention producing one-off artifacts that mortals can't replicate. The gods have now gone silent, and only a few examples of that kind of magic remain.

But, regular magic is much more advanced than it used to be, and outside of divine artifacts, "lost" magic was usually lost because it was obsoleted by better training (eg mages are now skilled enough to have a single colour-changing spell that can make whichever change they want, instead of needing a different spell for each specific change) or changing conditions (eg volcanic spells for which no suitable volcano exists any more).
