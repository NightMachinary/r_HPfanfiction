In his book, The Traveler in Black, John Brunner postulated that the original state of things was chaos, and that magic involved imposing your will upon chaos to produce results. As things are codified (standardized spells), order encroaches upon chaos, and there is less magic available as a result. This is brought up in linkffn(Traveler in Black Meets Harry Potter by meteoricshipyards).
