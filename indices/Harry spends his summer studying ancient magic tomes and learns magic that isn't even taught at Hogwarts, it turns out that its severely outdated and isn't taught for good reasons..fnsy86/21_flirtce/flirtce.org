Late as hell for the party but I love your take on it. Every time I read as how the old magic would be amazing and how hog is useless because it teaches just "useless things" make my eyes roll so much. I come back to my school years and people complaining about how math/ philosophy /geo and basically every other study field are useless and that we shouldn't be learning this.
