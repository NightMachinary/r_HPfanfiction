I actually love basiliskborn. It does switch back and forth between the past and the present and there are some really really good plot threads that tie up nicely the further in you get, I also love how it picks up parts of canon. Ebenbild's writing also drastically improves over the book. If you get into it, imho, it's amazing. But again, it's not for everyone

ETA: omg it drags in the first few chapters, I'm rereading it now. But it does get good around where you meet Myrrdin
