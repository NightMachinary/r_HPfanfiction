Fantasy really likes the trope of ancient and forgotten super-powerful knowledge.

This actually makes sense:

Consider a very powerful hi-tech person (like, even Emperor Palpatine). Much of their power stems from their control and use of technology. Technology requires a very large, well-educated workforce to build and maintain. Thus, the knowledge is hard to lose without a catastrophic collapse of civilization, and even a rather chaotic evil Dark Lord has an incentive to keep such a workforce and knowledge-base going, for their own benefit.

On the other hand, by its nature, standardish fantasy magic, like that of Harry Potter, allows a single moderately skilled practitioner to live entirely by themselves, with little need for others. Canonically, the only things a wizard with sufficient knowledge can't just Transfigure or Charm into existence are various magical substances (like the materials for a wand), certain substances (like gold) and some items (like food).

Even then, a wizard with rudimentary farming knowledge could enchant equipment to maintain some fields. and grow and prepare food that way.

As such, wizards have little to gain from others having knowledge - the most a wizard might want another to know would be skills that they don't want to be bother to use (like hunting down unicorns to take some tail hair).

In fact, the incentive is quite the opposite - the more knowledge other wizards have, the greater potential threats they are, and unlike in a technological society, where the tradeoffs are worthwhile, for the wizards, they really aren't.

Thus, knowledge is hoarded, and only given to those one truly trusts and cares for - one's family and perhaps most trusted friends.

Thus, new discoveries are hoarded and even if the results are publicly sold, the secrets of using them are jealously guarded.

Furthermore, it is entirely possible that sufficiently paranoid wizarding lines might pass on the family secrets only from parent to child, when the child is old enough to not share them... and then all it takes is a tragic early death for something to be lost forever.

Even if some hidden caches of documents are created, if their location is lost, or the location destroyed or rendered inaccessible...

Thus, magical societies hemorrhage knowledge at a rate proportional to their paranoia and incidence of sufficiently early deaths. The apparent low birth rate worsens this (as it takes fewer unexpected deaths to kill everyone who knows).

This applies even if the magic is very sciencey, even more so if there is so little rhyme and reason as to make discovering anything, much less anything useful, in large part sheer luck.
