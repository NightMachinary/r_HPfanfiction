Exactly the idea comes from for exemple the fall of Atlantis , or other antique civilisation far advanced that is a mark of a Golden Age that was lost. It is the same idea of decadence that exist in the Greek Myths of the succession of the different Ages of Man, with each races successive less perfect that those of the Golden Age. (Currently we are in the Iron Age). It comes from the idea that we live in a perpetual decline from the Golden Past of Humankind.
