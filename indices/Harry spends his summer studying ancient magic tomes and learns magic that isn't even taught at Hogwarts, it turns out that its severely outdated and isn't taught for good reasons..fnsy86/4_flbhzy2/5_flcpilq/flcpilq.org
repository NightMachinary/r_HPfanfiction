I mean it's fanfic so you can totally say that there was a magical society of butterflies that made all sorts of crazy artifacts till they were wiped out by the bird-pocolyps.

The trope exists because it's interesting, after all, and can be used in a few different ways. My sarcastic bit above aside, the ancient history of the magical world is hardly touched on in the books (goblin wars and the statue of secrecy being enacted being the two big topics that we ever hear of) so it's entirely possible that certain knowledge and artifacts have been lost.
