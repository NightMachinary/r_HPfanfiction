I think it's caused by the fantasy trope of the ancient empire filled with magic and riches beyond imagining. Seems like every fantasy series has this old wiped out empire or society that was filled with such awesome magic that everyone lives in it's shadow centuries later.

It's as if most fantasy takes places in that world's dark ages. Mix in the hero worship of Merlin and the Hogwarts founders and bam! Old magic MUST be better! Even though that makes no sense in a society that hasn't had some form of complete collapse.
