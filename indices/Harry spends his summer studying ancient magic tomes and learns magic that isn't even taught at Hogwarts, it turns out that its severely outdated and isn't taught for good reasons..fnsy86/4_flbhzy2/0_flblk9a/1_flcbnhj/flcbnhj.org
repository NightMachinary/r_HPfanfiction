The earliest example of that in literature that I can come up with easily is from the Tale of Genji (Genji Monogatari) by Lady Murasaki, which was written in the early 11th century and considered to be the first novel. Near the start, Genji is described and being so well-built and strong and pleasant to look upon that people were surprised that someone like that could be present "in these latter and degenerate days."
