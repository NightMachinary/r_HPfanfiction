Most of human history is full of “things were more impressive then” world views, valid or not. It's really only from the Enlightenment forward that people have felt that we were at the top of the curve and only going up from there. Hell, the Renaissance is all about “look what they had then, and we (Europeans) are just rediscovering it now!”, so it makes sense that people would think about the greatness of what had passed before.
