That's called the Precursor Trope. Basically, an ancient civilisation that existed and was more advanced in every way than anything the people have now, until they were all wiped out.

See the Ancients from Stargate, the Protheans from Mass Effect, the Eldar from 40K (and the Imperium), the Dwemer in TES, etc.
