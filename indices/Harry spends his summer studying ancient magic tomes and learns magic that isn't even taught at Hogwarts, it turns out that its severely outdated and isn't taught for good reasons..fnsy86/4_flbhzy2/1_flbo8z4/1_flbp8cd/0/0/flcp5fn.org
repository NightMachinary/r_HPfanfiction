The Room of Requirement is pretty bonkers in canon. It generates new features /as you think of things you need/ automatically. It follows the established laws of magic (or sat the very least Gamp's Laws) but otherwise seems completely open to exploitation. In book 7 Neville literally makes it so the Room canning be found by the Carrows or their supporters.
