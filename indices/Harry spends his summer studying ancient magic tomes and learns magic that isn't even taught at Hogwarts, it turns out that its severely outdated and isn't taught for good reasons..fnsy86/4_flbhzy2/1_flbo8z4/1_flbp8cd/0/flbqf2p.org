That's the thing---it's not all that impressive if you actually think about it. But to a casual fanfic writer, it seems very mystical.

However, I do think you are oversimplifying their complexity. The only thing which we see are able to do what the Hat does it Tom's Diary Horcrux. The room is even more impressive. The room first needs to read your mind without an obvious detectable form of legilimency. Then it needs to be able to contain Fiendfyre. It also needs to create stuff. (I might be wrong, but I don't recall there being a conjuring charm. It's part of transfiguration, no? And it's a complicated branch of transfiguration too. It certainly needs someone to do the conjuring) It needs to be able to create paths through the castle. It needs to be able to transport stuff into a storage version of itself without stacking everything on top of each other. I'm sure there's much more. Honestly, Hogwarts itself is pretty amazing by its own right, compared with something like the Ministry of Magic.
