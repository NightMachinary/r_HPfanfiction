  However, I do think you are oversimplifying their complexity. The only thing which we see are able to do what the Hat does it Tom's Diary Horcrux

The hat is animated, lots of things are animated, regular Wizards Chess pieces even regularly talk to their players. Or even just Portraits in general.

  The room first needs to read your mind without an obvious detectable form of legilimency.
#+end_quote

Most Legilimency doesen't seem to be detectable, and enchanting objects to use a spell isn't that rare, the weasley twins used it for lots of stuff.

  It also needs to create stuff. (I might be wrong, but I don't recall there being a conjuring charm. It's part of transfiguration, no?
#+end_quote

It's no charm, but conjuration spells, which seem to be part of transfiguration. I assume the Inanimatus Conjurus(we dont know its exact function, but the name seems obvious enough) spell would be enough.

#+begin_quote
  It needs to be able to create paths through the castle. It needs to be able to transport stuff into a storage version of itself without stacking everything on top of each othe
