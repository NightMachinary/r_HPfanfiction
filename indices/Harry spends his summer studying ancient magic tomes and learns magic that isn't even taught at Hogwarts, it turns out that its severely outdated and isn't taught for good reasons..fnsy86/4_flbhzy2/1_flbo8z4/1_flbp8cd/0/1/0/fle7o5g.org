Just wanted to add that the toilets were built on top of the trap door for the Chamber of Secrets, rather than a pathway forming under the toilets. According to Pottermore, anyway.

What I find interesting about this is the fact that, actually, the secret entrances can't have been 'lost' for nearly as long as other people thought. I think that maybe some of the old mystical magic is just a generation or two of people talking up things that way.
