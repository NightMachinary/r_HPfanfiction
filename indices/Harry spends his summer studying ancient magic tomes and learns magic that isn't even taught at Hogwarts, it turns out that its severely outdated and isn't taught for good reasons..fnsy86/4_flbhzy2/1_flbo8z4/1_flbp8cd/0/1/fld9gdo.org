The Room of Requirement doesn't create anything, it just arranges things that are already inside of it in a way that the user desires. There has never been any indication that the room can give a user anything that they want, that being a fanon creation as far as I know. Undetectable expansion charms are fairly easy to make, so that explains the storage aspect of the room, and house elves put misplaced items into the room of hidden things, which explains why Dumbledore received a room full of chamber pots rather then toilets. People don't tend to lose those all that often. The room can create paths through the castle yes, but stair cases shift in Hogwarts, and the Chamber of Secrets, which has been around for a thousand years sprouted a new entrance underneath the girls bathroom on the second floor. As far as I know there has been no indication from Rowling that magical buildings aside from Hogwarts have to behave in the same manner as normal buildings, and at the end of the day a lot of Hogwarts' quirks could easily have been added to the castle by teachers or headmasters/mistresses after the school's creation. As suits of plate armour are inventions off the 15th Century, we already know this to be the case.
