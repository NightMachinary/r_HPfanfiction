What is so special about the Room of Requirement and the Sorting Hat?

The Room seems to be a combination of expansion charms and vanishing/conjuring spells, all of it is still taught at Hogwarts.

And the Sorting Hat seems to be just an animated Hat with a few enchantments.

Stuff like Dumbledores Deluminator seems way more impressive.

Edit: its pretty funny that out of all my comments this is the most controversial one.
