I think this mainly comes from people looking too deeply into the books. Eg. The Room of Requirement, the Veil of Death, and the Sorting Hat are amazing things from the past. Due to Harry's narrow perspective of the world, readers are not exposed to any amazing things from the present. Combine this with how they don't seem to advance (brooms existed way in the past) and readers start thinking that the past must have been better.
