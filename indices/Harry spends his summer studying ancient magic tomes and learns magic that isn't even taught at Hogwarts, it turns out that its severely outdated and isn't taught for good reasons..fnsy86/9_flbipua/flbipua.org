I always liked the idea that it was forgotten deliberately or due to necessity. Maybe that old magic started to break reality due to the sheer power of it (and/or attracted the attention of 'the many-angled ones at the bottom of the mandelbrot set'), or maybe wands and motions were more efficient for day to day (needing less effort and preparation and power to use) and the really powerful stuff that bugger all people needed (because why build a nuclear reactor to run your dishwasher) was disposed of despite being more powerful, or maybe magic is just declining and less people are capable of the stuff and enough teachers died without passing on their knowledge (perils of an apprenticeship system in an overly-traditional and stagnant society - if you don't teach innovation or complexity, it stops very, very quickly). Or just that the spells had some nasty side-effects or some bad dude used them to do bad things and people subsequently banned them and then moved and left their books in that ancient dusty library, etc. But hell, organised teaching only started in 1000AD-ish, so maybe spellcrafters before then were all just ornery hermits and Dark Lords who never shared anything and died with it all sealed in their hidden lair libraries and such.

There's plenty of possible reasons for it, if you look for them - it's just rarely explored because it's most often just an excuse to power-up Harry. :)
