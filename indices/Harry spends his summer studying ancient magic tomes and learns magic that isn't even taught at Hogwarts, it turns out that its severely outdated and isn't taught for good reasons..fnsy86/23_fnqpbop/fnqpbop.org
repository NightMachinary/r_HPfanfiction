Except there ARE things that the ancients used to do that we can't. For example, the Romans built concrete piers in the ocean 2,000 years ago, and they are as good today as they were then. On the other hand, concrete piers built in the last hundred years are falling apart from corrosion. What did the Romans do different? No one knows.

The Romans had subfloor heating in the villas (the rich did, at least), and only since the 1900's have we rediscovered how to do that.

The Romans had a complex system of sewers covered by stones, much like modern sewers. Waste flushed from the latrines flowed through a central channel into the main sewage system and thence into a nearby river or stream. ... It is estimated that the first sewers of ancient Rome were built between 800 and 735 BC. Up until the 1800's people were still dumping chamber pots into the streets in Europe!

The Egyptians use an embalming fluid made from natural materials that works better than the embalming fluid used today. How id they do that? No one knows.

In Peru, the ancient farmers used to grew bigger crops than they can today. Why? It's not climate change through the ages as it is raining as much in the high mountains today as it used to way back then. A scientist finally figured it out. For some reason, no one knew why, the Peruvian farms had extra wide furrows, that is there was a mound two or three feet wide, then a depression two feet or so wide. The depressions between the mounds were not deep enough to be for irrigation purposes. No one knew why they were that way, just that that was the way it had always been. A scientist in either late 1990's or early 2000's had a wild idea and got a grant to pay the farmer for his lost crop. He dug out the depressions so that they flooded with water from the river. Amazingly enough, the water between the mounds acted as a warming bank and prevented the plants from freezing at night at the beginning and end of the growing season when frosts were prominent. It allowed the plants to grow longer! Or, in some cases, to have two crops per summer instead of one.

Apparently in the 1300,s there was a major drought that lowered the river enough to fail to irrigate the plants. When it finally stopped a hundred years later, no one knew to dig up the dust filled channels and let them act as warming banks again.

So, who says that ancient magical civilizations might not have discovered things not rediscovered yet?
