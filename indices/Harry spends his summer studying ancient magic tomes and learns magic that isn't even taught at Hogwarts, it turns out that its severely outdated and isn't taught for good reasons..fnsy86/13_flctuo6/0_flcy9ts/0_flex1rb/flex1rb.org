You make some good points. We do only learn the things they were right about. However, the thing is Newton and Aristotle weren't just right some of time, they were right most of the time. I suppose it might be different with magic but still.

I suppose the really issue is the example that was used in the original prompt. They should have used an example similar to you. An 18th century western doctor would get a lot wrong.

And you're right, it is a lot more complicated than that. Especially in the scenario given in the prompt. Getting some old magic textbooks would not be a good thing if it were similar in n accuracy as a medical textbook written by an 18th century doctor.

As for the magic researcher part, that was just me spitballing. As you have described it seems it was similar to the culture of gentlemen scientists.
