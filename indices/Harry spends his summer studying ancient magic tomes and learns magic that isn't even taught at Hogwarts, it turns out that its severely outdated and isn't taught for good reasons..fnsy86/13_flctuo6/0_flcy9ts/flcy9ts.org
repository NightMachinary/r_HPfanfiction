  I can't say anything about Aristotle as I don't know much about him. However, in Newton's case it would be rather informative. The guy knew his stuff. He was a very good mathematician.

  ...just looked up Aristotle, and he knew his stuff well too. There is a reason we bother to remember these people.

  Just because a book is old doesn't mean it is necessarily wrong.

They definitely knew their stuff, but that doesn't mean a lot of what they said wasn't wrong when looking back, they were simply limited by the available knowledge of their time. And both their teachings are still taught in modern science classes, but you are explicitly taught to only make use of the information which has been proven over the years.

Similarly Wizards like Merlin and the Founders were quite likely some of the best minds of their generations, but they each made point in passing their knowledge on and allowing others to work with it, so modern magics had over a thousand years to improve upon it and discard those which were made redundant or proven wrong.

  If you want to check the accuracy of a book, you should check who wrote it not when it was written.

It's more complicated then that, very intelligent men in history have drawn lots of wrong conclusion simply because of the limitations of their time, for example the best doctor of the 18th century is for example immensely inferior then the average doctor despite being likely much more intelligent.

  Really, the only concern with older books is if newly discovered information is left out.

  If you think about the hp universe, that doesn't seem likely. The reason for this is because the only organization that we know of that is dedicated to the research of magic is the department of mystery. By their job titles, unspeakable, they are not avid sharers of knowledge. Apart from that, all you got is independent magic researchers. Though that isn't much different from the so called gentleman scientists. So maybe I am wrong on that.

While they do research mostly alone, they do seem to work together to some degree, I think this description of Dumbledores Hogwarts years shows it best.

  In a matter of months, however, Albus's own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father. By the end of his first year, he would never again be known as the son of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school. Those of us who were privileged to be his friends benefited from his example, not to mention his help and encouragement, with which he was always generous. He confessed to me in later life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching.

  He not only won every prize of note that the school offered, *he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day, including Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist, Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian, and Adalbert Waffling, the magical theoretician. Several of his papers found their way into learned publications such as Transfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming and The Practical Potioneer.* Dumbledore's future career seemed likely to be meteoric, and the only question that remained was when he would become Minister for Magic.

We know that after school Dumbledore continued to work as partner with Nicholas Flamel and that the Alchemy they worked on ended up being of the things he ended up famous for. This is from his Chocolate Frog Card.

  Albus Dumbledore, currently Headmaster of Hogwarts. Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Professor Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.
