I can't say anything about Aristotle as I don't know much about him. However, in Newton's case it would be rather informative. The guy knew his stuff. He was a very good mathematician.

...just looked up Aristotle, and he knew his stuff well too. There is a reason we bother to remember these people.

Just because a book is old doesn't mean it is necessarily wrong. If you want to check the accuracy of a book, you should check who wrote it not when it was written. The only major concern in that regard is if the language used is understandable from a modern vernacular.

If, say the catholic church printed a science book, you should be sceptical of it's accuracy. Same if the Nazi Germany were to print a history book.

Really, the only concern with older books is if newly discovered information is left out.

If you think about the hp universe, that doesn't seem likely. The reason for this is because the only organization that we know of that is dedicated to the research of magic is the department of mystery. By their job titles, unspeakable, they are not avid sharers of knowledge. Apart from that, all you got is independent magic researchers. Though that isn't much different from the so called gentleman scientists. So maybe I am wrong on that.
