In my stories, ancient magic generally is weaker, less refined, and generally not used for good reasons. Like rituals fell out of use once wands were invented and potions advanced because between the two, rituals were mostly rendered obsolete. Wands, for example, allow much faster and more precise casting, and much more versatility, than staves. Wandless casting is generally so much weaker, even a spell cast by a master of wandless magic would be outdone by an average student with a wand. However, the Dark Arts contain a number of rituals that are still effective compared to modern magic - mostly because they require blood sacrifices.
