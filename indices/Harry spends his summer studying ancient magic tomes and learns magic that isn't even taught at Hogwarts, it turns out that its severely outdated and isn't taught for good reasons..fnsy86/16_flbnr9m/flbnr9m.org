Wait, doesn't this already happen? I mean what they are taught at Hogwarts is essentially useless... turning beetles into buttons, feeding flobberworms, repotting mandrakes, brewing love potions, and charming an egg cup to do cartwheels. And Muggles Studies is a farce. And why don't they learn Latin?

Maybe there is a grand reason why all the actually useful spells are hidden away in the Restricted Section or forbidden to students to learn.

Or maybe it is just because they don't have a way to retrieve information from their libraries... card catalog, anyone? anyone?
