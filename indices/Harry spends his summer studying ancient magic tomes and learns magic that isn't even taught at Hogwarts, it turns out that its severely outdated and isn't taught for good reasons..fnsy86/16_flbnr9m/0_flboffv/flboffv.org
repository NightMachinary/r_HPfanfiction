  Wait, doesn't this already happen? I mean what they are taught at Hogwarts is essentially useless...
#+end_quote

Except you know, for all the stuff that is indeed usefull.

#+begin_quote
  turning beetles into buttons, feeding flobberworms, repotting mandrakes, brewing love potions, and charming an egg cup to do cartwheels.
#+end_quote

Those seem quite clearly to be examples of what they learn, not the whole extend of it, you dont teach children specific things for each indivual situations, but rather teach them things they can use generally and give them specific examples they can apply their knowledge on.

#+begin_quote
  And Muggles Studies is a farce.
#+end_quote

Thats pure fanon.

#+begin_quote
  And why don't they learn Latin?
#+end_quote

Because there wouldn't be much use to it.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe there is a grand reason why all the actually useful spells are hidden away in the Restricted Section or forbidden to students to learn.
#+end_quote

Again fanon.

#+begin_quote
  Or maybe it is just because they don't have a way to retrieve information from their libraries... card catalog, anyone? anyone?
#+end_quote

You can already use a summoning charm for that, like Hermione does, and Flittwick made quite sure that each of his students learns how to do it.
