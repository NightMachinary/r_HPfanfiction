What about Practical life skills?

Harry and Hermione and Ron are on the run for months but don't know how to obtain food using magic.

They don't have classes on how the magical economy works or even basic math.

History is taught by a dead professor who has no interest in engaging the students so that they are destined to repeat the mistakes of the past. Goblin wars, yikes!

Nearly all the spells they use are based in Latin. It would be really useful to know Latin so that you could create your own spells.

Most wizards coming out of Hogwarts are completely unable to interact with the muggle world effectively... Arthur Weasley works for the Ministry in a department that specializes in muggle artifacts, but doesn't know what a plug is or how it is used?

No one seems to know how to summon books - when does Hermione summon books? She collects them and reads them manually to find the information she seeks.

Don't get me wrong... I love all the impractical magic... but goodness, they carry their books in book bags when they could all have little pockets that contain all their belongings.

They could be learning how to do an undetectable extension charm!

They could be flying from class to class on brooms instead of risking falling down staircases that have moved.

Or brewing potions to fortify one against the effects of the dementors.
