Practical life skills are needed at every level of learning and especially for art students (or magic students) so that they can support themselves when they leave school.

Hogwarts starts at age 11 - that's middle school in the US and that is when a lot of schools teach practical life skills such as home economics, wood shop, computer skills, biology, physical education, language skills, etc. I teach middle school - practical life skills are necessary.

Hermione summoning the horcrux books was the first time she tried that in six years of hunting down facts in the library.

  They do, its called going to the store, that wasn't possible here because they are fugitives, Hogwarts has no reason to teach skills exclusivity useful for people on the run from the ministry.

Harry, thankfully, knows how to cook... it is actually one of the skills that the Dursleys inadvertently taught him. Ron and Hermione are pretty much useless at making food for themselves. It's not just a skill you need when you are on the run. It's a skill you need when you're supporting yourself and not being fed by a magical table fueled by house-elves.

  The majority of students do not need this and never will, if some wizard wants to create his own spells he can just use a dictionary, its not like he need to know the entire language.

Using a dictionary to create a spell could have unforeseen consequences... if you know the root of a word, you have a better understanding of what it will do when it is a vehicle for magic.

  Those spells are limited by the ministry, finding somebody able to use the spells and getting a permit seems way more troublesome than just carrying your books.

I don't remember where they are limited by the ministry... Hermione was able to do it, though. She could have put that charm on all their denim pockets instead of just on her beaded bag. That would have been handy.

  Kids arent even allowed to Run in the halls, you cants just let them move on something as fast as brooms, thats pretty dangerous. and the Stairs dont seem to move when the kids are near them, so they dont seem that dangerous.

But they are allowed to search in the forbidden forest at night for Unicorn killers... I don't think student safety is actually a top priority at Hogwarts. The corridors are tall... they could have lanes for brooms just like schools have for bikes.

  What even makes you think such a thing exists?
#+end_quote

A patronus can act as a buffer against the dementors... so it does kind of exist... but nothing was done to protect students against the dementors on the train or at Hogwarts their third year. And a potion might be more effective... hmmm. Might have to brew one of those for my fic...

Anyway, I have a feeling we are going to continue to disagree. I totally love the potterverse, but there isn't very much that actually makes sense in it. Maybe that's why it is so much fun to get lost in it.
