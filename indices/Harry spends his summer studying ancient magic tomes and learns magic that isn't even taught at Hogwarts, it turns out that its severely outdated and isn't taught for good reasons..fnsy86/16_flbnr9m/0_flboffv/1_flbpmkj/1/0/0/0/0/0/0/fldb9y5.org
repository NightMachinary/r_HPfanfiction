Hagrid didn't seem to think there was anything that could hurt them if he or fang was with them.

  He led them to the very edge of the Forest. Holding his lamp up high he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the Forest.

  ‘Look there,' said Hagrid, ‘see that stuff shinin' on the ground? Silvery stuff? That's unicorn blood. There's a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We're gonna try an' find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.'

  ‘And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?' said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice.

  ‘There's nothin' that lives in the Forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,' said Hagrid. ‘An' keep ter the path. Right, now, we're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent directions. There's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin' around since last night at least.'

  ‘I want Fang,' said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang's long teeth.

  ‘All right, but I warn yeh, he's a coward,' said Hagrid. ‘So me, Harry an' Hermione'll go one way an' Draco, Neville an' Fang'll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an' practise now -- that's it -- an' if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find yeh -- so, be careful -- let's go.'
