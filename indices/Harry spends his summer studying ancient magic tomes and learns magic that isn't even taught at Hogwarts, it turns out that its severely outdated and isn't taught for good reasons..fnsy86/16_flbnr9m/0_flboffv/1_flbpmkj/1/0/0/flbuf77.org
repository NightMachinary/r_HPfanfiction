  Hermione summoning the horcrux books was the first time she tried that in six years of hunting down facts in the library.
#+end_quote

It was also the first time had to look for books specifically for a certain toppic because of plot relevant reasons, its quite likely that she and others have done this before.

  Harry, thankfully, knows how to cook... it is actually one of the skills that the Dursleys inadvertently taught him. Ron and Hermione are pretty much useless at making food for themselves. It's not just a skill you need when you are on the run. It's a skill you need when you're supporting yourself and not being fed by a magical table fueled by house-elves.

Again Fanon. Canon Harry doesn't know how to cook, we saw him fry bacon and eggs once because Petunia was busy, but none of the trio being able to cook was a plot point in Deathly Hallows. But again, you dont need cooking if you can just buy food, or like Harry have your Slave cook your meals for you.

  Using a dictionary to create a spell could have unforeseen consequences... if you know the root of a word, you have a better understanding of what it will do when it is a vehicle for magic.
#+end_quote

You either just made this up, or copied it from some random fanfic, either way its not canon.

  I don't remember where they are limited by the ministry... Hermione was able to do it, though.
#+end_quote

It's elaborated on more on Pottermore, but Hermione was specifically preparing for the Horcrux hunt while knowing that hte Ministry was being infiltrated, she clearly prepared regarless of legaitly as her reading the Horcrux books showed.

  But they are allowed to search in the forbidden forest at night for Unicorn killers...
#+end_quote

The only dangerous thing living in the Forrest are Acromantulas which Hagrid explictly knows would never leave their nest to attack a student.

  A patronus can act as a buffer against the dementors... so it does kind of exist...
#+end_quote

That doesn't imply a potion exists.

#+begin_quote
  but nothing was done to protect students against the dementors on the train
#+end_quote

Nothing except having the Defense against the Dark Arts Teacher ride the train with them for the only time we know of, and actually show him protecting the students from Dementors.

#+begin_quote
  at Hogwarts their third year.
#+end_quote

The Dementors were explicitly forbidden to go near students, thats not nothing.

  Anyway, I have a feeling we are going to continue to disagree. I totally love the potterverse, but there isn't very much that actually makes sense in it. Maybe that's why it is so much fun to get lost in it.
#+end_quote

I really advise you to reread the books, you seem to have mixed quite a lot of things from fan fiction into it.
