  I really advise you to reread the books, you seem to have mixed quite a lot of things from fan fiction into it.

Oh, ouch. I can't tell you how many times I've read the books. I've been reading them over and over again since I first started reading them in 1999. I don't have a photographic memory and my opinion about how a school should be run has a lot to do with my job as a teacher.

It's not that you or I are misrepresenting canon, it is that we disagree about what it means. It happens. People interpret things differently.

It's like two people standing side-by-side looking at a Georgia O'Keefe painting... one sees an abstracted flower, the other the intimate parts of a woman. It means something to both of them.

It's okay. The prompt is still captivating.
