  What about Practical life skills?
#+end_quote

Hogwarts is a school for magic, not life skills, thats like complaining that an arts school doesen't teach you how to do your taxes.

#+begin_quote
  Harry and Hermione and Ron are on the run for months but don't know how to obtain food using magic.
#+end_quote

They do, its called going to the store, that wasn't possible here because they are wanted by the Ministry, Hogwarts has no reason to teach skills exclusivity useful for people on the run from the ministry.

#+begin_quote
  They don't have classes on how the magical economy works or even basic math.
#+end_quote

Economy classes aren't taught to the majority of people, and wizards can use magic to perform calculations.

#+begin_quote
  Nearly all the spells they use are based in Latin. It would be really useful to know Latin so that you could create your own spells.
#+end_quote

The majority of students do not need this and never will, if some wizard wants to create his own spells he can just use a dictionary, its not like he need to know the entire language.

#+begin_quote
  No one seems to know how to summon books - when does Hermione summon books? She collects them and reads them manually to find the information she seeks.
#+end_quote

After Dumbledore's funeral she uses Accio to collect all the books about Horcruxes.

#+begin_quote
  Don't get me wrong... I love all the impractical magic... but goodness, they carry their books in book bags when they could all have little pockets that contain all their belongings.
#+end_quote

Those spells are limited by the ministry, finding somebody able to use the spells and getting a permit seems way more troublesome than just carrying your books.

#+begin_quote
  They could be learning how to do an undetectable extension charm!
#+end_quote

Its limited by the ministry and seems to be quite advanced magic at that, for all we know its not learned until seventh year, which we never see Harry attend.

#+begin_quote
  They could be flying from class to class on brooms instead of risking falling down staircases that have moved.
#+end_quote

Kids arent even allowed to Run in the halls, you cants just let them move on something as fast as brooms, thats pretty dangerous. and the Stairs dont seem to move when the kids are near them, so they dont seem that dangerous.

#+begin_quote
  Or brewing potions to fortify one against the effects of the dementors.
#+end_quote

What even makes you think such a thing exists?
