I would enjoy reading a subversion of this trope, but I don't think it's so cut and dry as “new magic would be more advanced than old magic” simply because magic is not a science.

Certainly, some spells and effects could be studied, dissected, disassembled, reassembled, examined, turned inside out, be made to do a little dance, until they are completely understood to the point that you can teach a bunch of 11 year olds how to make things float. Most wand magic and potions that we see in canon are examples of this - things that can be easily taught in a classroom as part of a standard education have to have consistent, predictable results after all.

The flip side of this are all of the things that aren't really explained in full, the bits of mysterious magic that aren't as structured and factor in things like intent, sacrifice, and the giving of ones word. Two huge examples of this are wand allegiance and the blood protections. Don't really need to go into wand lore, but Lily's sacrifice is very important.

The reason Lily refusing to stand aside resulted in Harry being protected from Voldemort is, in my opinion, two fold. One, ol' Tommy promised Snape to spare her, and broke his word. Two, he gave Lily multiple chances to move aside, and she refused every time. This created a unique effect in Harry that enabled him, years later, to survive the Killing Curse a second time. But this is something that couldn't have been planned ahead of time, there were no incantations or wand waving on Lily's part (despite what some very creative people have come up with in fics). It was simply Old Magic, fueled by sacrifice and love, and triggered by a broken oath.

THAT is the sort of magic that would (in my opinion) be the sort of thing that continues to be incredibly powerful magic. It wouldn't be easily taught, since the circumstances surrounding using this type of magic have to be just right, so it would eventually be forgotten in old tomes collecting dust. 99.99% of magicals would never encounter this sort of magic, because it's not something you really ever need to know on a daily basis - and most that do explore it would find it to be just an interesting bit of trivia of Old Magic.

I believe I've stumbled a bit off topic. Anyway my point is just because something isn't taught in standard education, doesn't mean it's useless, doubly so when we're talking about a fictional force that reshapes reality to the whims of its user. Why try to teach ~50 kids a year how to cast a dangerous ritual that may go horribly wrong on the off chance that some of them benefit from it?
