What? How on earth is a fucking pyramid comparable to a house? I think something a little more apt is a mud shack in Ancient Egypt and one of the cheap-ass "efficient" houses we have today (spoiler alert: most houseowners find modern housing better than a mud shack!). No, something comparable would be the hoover dam which will last indefinitely with upkeep and 10,000 years if humans were to disappear (not to mention it kind of does more than a pyramid). Egypt spends millions on the upkeep of said pyramids forever. Also, better? The building methods work cause they're in an arid environment. Also, good luck getting AC and modern comforts through early forms of cement with a bunch of unnecessary walls when columns would have sufficed. Hell, why is the longevity of a fucking pyramid relevant to a house? Who needs a house to last for thousands of years? Not to mention canon and the distinct lack of more powerful ancient magic.
