No it doesn't, magic use only requires incantation and wand movements, you dont even need to know what the spell is for, only very few spells require any metal effort at all.

Magic is a skill, the hard part is learning it, not using it. And how do you even get the Idea that this would result in anyone being able to use fiendfyre?
