> Realistically doing this, would be like preparing for science class by studying the works of Aristotle and Newton instead of modern books.

Not necessarily. Let me make an analogy. For example, some of ancient methods for building (like the Roman concrete, or the way Egyptians built their pyramids) are incredibly durable and if you had enough money/manpower/materials you could make a house that'd last thousands of years. However, it's not economically viable and there are much cheaper options.

In my opinion, it's the same way with ancient magic. This kind of magic takes much more power, energy and effort to do, while being stronger, but it leaves the caster drained. The new magic may be weaker, but it also takes less power and effort to be cast. In other words, it's more /efficient./

Modern scientists are always looking for new, more efficient ways to streamline older technology. Yes, there are new, more powerful devices/techniques being developed, but it just feels like it's all connected. Newton's laws of motion are still studied in primary and high schools all over the world, and Aristotle is studied in every philosophy/logics course in high schools/universities not because they are the best version or more advanced over the new scientific knowledge or philosophic views, but because they provide a basis to future education.

I'm not completely sure why I wrote such a huge wall of text, but I guess I just wanted to say I don't look at ancient magic as more advanced. More powerful, yes, but it requires much more effort, preparation and sacrifice to work than modern swish-and-flick magic.
