Yeah but magic is fundamentally a muggle idea since we all are, and the story is written muggle aswell.

I get what everybody says about the parallel with science, I just don't it's that should be made espacially because magic is essentially the antithesis to science to us humans. It's only natural than that we write our stories in this way.
