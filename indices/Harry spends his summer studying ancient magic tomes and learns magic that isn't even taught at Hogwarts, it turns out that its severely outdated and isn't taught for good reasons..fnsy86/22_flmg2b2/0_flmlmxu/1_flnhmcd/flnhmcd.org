Also, I think our insight on this debate might be clouded by the ideology of progress and makes us see novelty as always better. Yet, sometimes it's clearly the opposite. Take bakery, for instance, bread made with ancient methods, equally in terms flour making than bread making, tend to be much better not only for the taste but for the body as well.

Since magic is clearly to antithesis to science, both as fields of study and as a fundamental and practical way to tackle everyday life, it makes much more sense if the ancient is stronger.

Actually, one might even consider magic as a sort of artisanship, /techn√©/ if you'd like. Aren't there lots of instances where characters speak about magic as a very hard thing to grasp and always surprising, which, to me, sounds a lot like something an artisan would say about is own field.
