I have certainly lost a lot of childish innocence when it comes to evaluating characters. Most notably, Dumbledore, Lupin and Molly. That's not to say that I subscribe to the potion queen bullshit where Molly masterminds a systematic "shipping" campaign or Dumbledore is stealing Harry's gold, but "ten dark years" and not following up on the "bars on his window" are pretty damaging on their own.
