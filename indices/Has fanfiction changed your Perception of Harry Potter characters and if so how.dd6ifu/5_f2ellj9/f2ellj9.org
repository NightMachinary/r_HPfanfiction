The one character that has lost the shine for me is Professor McGonagall.

After bingeing on a bunch of fics that followed the stations of canon, I saw that every other author and their mum had McGonagall in their fic, but reading so many iterations of the same re-hashed plot, I realized that very little of what McGonagall did actually changed the outcome of the story. She's present in important turning points, like when Dumbledore leaves Harry with the Dursleys, she's a member of Dumbledore's inner circle, and the reasonable teacher compared to bitter and biased Snape, crazy Trelawney, and the revolving door of DADA professors. But despite all of that, she's remarkably passive, not just unhelpful, but negligent.

This was the moment where it dawned on me that what we were told didn't match what we were shown. Professor McGonagall, we're told, is meant to be wise and guiding, but she fell far short of those expectations. It was similar to being told that Tom Riddle was the most talented and intelligent student Hogwarts had ever seen, but he wasn't really like that when we finally saw Voldemort in action.

And a big part of my grudge has come about from JKR messing with the timeline and making it so she was a teacher at Hogwarts in around 1908-1913, when Newt Scamander went to school. This makes her a full-grown adult when Tom Riddle was a little boy, and close to 100 years old when Harry is a student. 120+ or so when she's Headmistress to Albus and Scorpius. Ugh.
