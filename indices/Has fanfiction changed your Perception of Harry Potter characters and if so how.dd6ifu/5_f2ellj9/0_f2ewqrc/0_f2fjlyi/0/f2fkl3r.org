  My frustration comes from her personally knowing about Harry's home situation after following the Dursleys around ("they're the worst sort of muggles")
#+end_quote

She had no idea that they would be actually neglectful or the animosity they held towards magic. All she knew is that they spoil their actual child, who is an awful brat but could easily grow out of it.

Indeed, there's not much she could do except report the situation to Dumbledore, who has his own reasons for wanting Harry there. If he were to undercut whatever inquiry she led by saying he thought the placement was valid (and what Ministry official wouldn't use /that/ to their career's advantage?), then she'd lose all support.
