She bought him a professional grade broomstick in first year. So she did favor him, to some extent.

My frustration comes from her personally knowing about Harry's home situation after following the Dursleys around ("they're the worst sort of muggles") and treating Harry as a normal student, which is pretty distantly and uninvolved, when she has a job as teacher, deputy headmaster, and head of house. Instead of as a teacher with a kid who might need extra support or understanding due to his history with adult authority figures.

She does know that trouble always be comes from Harry and friends, so it seems negligent not to be more involved.
