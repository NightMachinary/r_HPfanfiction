I think that also our perception of Dumbledore is twisted by the fact the books are the from the point of view of Harry who worships him. Sure he is very intelligent, sure he is influential, sure he is more talented at magic than the average wizard but it's only in the last book that we truly get to see him for what he is... a deeply flawed human who lacks the confidence to go to a head to head battle (it took him like 20 years or something to finally confront Grindelwald?).
