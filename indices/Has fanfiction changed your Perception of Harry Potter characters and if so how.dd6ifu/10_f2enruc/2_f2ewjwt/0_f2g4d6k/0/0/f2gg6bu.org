Claimed is the important word. Pretty much everyone at the NÃ¼rnberg trials claimed to be innocent, one of the leading Nazis (Goering IIRC) even tried to argue that the judges had no jurisdiction. Let's just say that this didn't work out well for them. Dumbledore could have easily pushed for a thorough investigation simply with the "or I'll make you" argument

But I was generally thinking about straight up slaughtering them in combat (it would be too one sided to call it a fight). We know how massive the skill disparity between Riddle, Dumbledore and everyone else is. Unfair does not even begin to describe it.
