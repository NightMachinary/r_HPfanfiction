You are assuming that there was actually a trial for Lucius Malfoy and the like after the first war, of which there is no canon evidence. For all we know, they claimed imperius and were let off as the head of the DMLE was dealing with his own scandal. We also never see magically forced Death Eaters, just old fashioned coercion, something quite comparable to Draco Malfoy's situation overall, and he got off Scots free in canon.

Also, it is not murder if you use lethal force to repel a terrorist attack in order to protect civilians.
