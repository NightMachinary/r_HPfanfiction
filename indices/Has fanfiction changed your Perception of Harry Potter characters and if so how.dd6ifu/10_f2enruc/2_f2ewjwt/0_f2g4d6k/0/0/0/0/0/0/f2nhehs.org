It is never established that Stan is under the Imperius. Harry, the unreliable narrator, believes so for some reason. And I'm going to preemptively question anything he "saw" during a high speed aerial battle at night. After all, Stan was broken out of Azkaban by Voldemort, something which makes no sense if he was just an imperius pawn.

And, generally speaking, anything Rowling said or wrote after the books were finished is just a retcon. The books, and even the movies have nothing which even hints that Lucius Malfoy got tried in 1981/2.
