  You are assuming that there was actually a trial for Lucius Malfoy and the like after the first war, of which there is no canon evidence. For all we know, they claimed imperius and were let off as the head of the DMLE was dealing with his own scandal.

During the war, they rarely stood and fought. When Harry learns about the Dark Mark, the way they operate is just murdering people before anyone can respond then leaving evidence behind to increase fear. During the war, Dumbledore was already trying his hardest. After the war, they were cleared.
