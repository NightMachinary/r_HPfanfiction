Dumbledore is on Voldemort's level when it comes to combat ability. He could have culled the Death Eaters three times over between 1970ish and 1997. Yet Dumbledore chooses to sit in his castle and others to do the dying. The casualties of the Order were disastrous during the first war. Any military commander would have been relieved of duty if not court martialled for such losses.
