On one hand, I find it very unfortunate that your perception of certain characters has been twisted so badly by trash fanfictions.

On the other hand, Dumbledore is indeed a shitty person. I mean this guy sits on significant personal power and influence, and yet does little to combat sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums, and instead grooms a child to do his dirty work. He's so fucked and I think his soul should rot in purgatory for a very very long time.
