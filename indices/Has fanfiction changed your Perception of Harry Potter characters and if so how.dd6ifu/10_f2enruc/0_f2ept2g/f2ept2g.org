Yeah, you can explain Dumbledore pretty easily with "he is just a plot device", but not convincingly in-universe. Same with Molly and Lupin never checking up on Harry (and both certainly had the clues for abuse in front of them).

But it is entertaining to see what kind of explanations authors who want to depict them positively come up with (or the amount of denial everyone has towards what happened at the Dursleys). Because you either laugh at it or cry (everyone ignores blatant child abuse, accessory to it and conspiracy to commit it, because it would make the author's favs look bad).
