I started disliking the canon Ginny x Harry ship and strted to prefer other whether it be yaoi or the typical Harry x Hermione, Daphne, Susan, or Luna. Then again I always sorta wished Harry ended up with Hermione.

I found Ron to be somewhat selfish and not a good friend for Harry but then again the 4th movie really just brought that feeling out. I couldn't get over how he just up and abandoned Harry when he was forced into the tournament. Like did he not truly know Harry? Harry didn't like attention or came so why would he enter himself into a tournament that could only give him attention and money if he won? He was already famous and rich so he had no reason to enter.

I started disliking Dumbledore and just see him as a person who didn't truly care for Harry and who manipulated his life so he would be a willing martyr. I always found a lot of his actions concerning Harry to be questionable. Like how he left a baby on a doorstep of family members who despised all things magic and who McGonagall swore were bad choices as guardians after just a day of watching them.

As for Voldemort I saw him as more than an insane dark wizard but someone who was once a promising powerful wizard that had people flocking to him but as time passed he fell more and more in love with dark magic and that lead to his decent into madness.
