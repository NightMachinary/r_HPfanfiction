  I found Ron to be somewhat selfish and not a good friend for Harry but then again the 4th movie really just brought that feeling out. I couldn't get over how he just up and abandoned Harry when he was forced into the tournament. Like did he not truly know Harry? Harry didn't like attention or came so why would he enter himself into a tournament that could only give him attention and money if he won? He was already famous and rich so he had no reason to enter.

Here's a snippet:

  But nobody wanted to hear that he wasn't hungry; nobody wanted to hear that he hadn't put his name in the goblet; not one single person seemed to have noticed that he wasn't at all in the mood to celebrate... Lee Jordan had unearthed a Gryffindor banner from somewhere, and he insisted on draping it around Harry like a cloak. Harry couldn't get away; whenever he tried to sidle over to the staircase up to the dormitories, the crowd around him closed ranks, forcing another butterbeer on him, stuffing crisps and peanuts into his hands... Everyone wanted to know how he had done it, how he had tricked Dumbledore's Age Line and managed to get his name into the goblet...

  "I didn't," he said, over and over again, "I don't know how it happened."

  But for all the notice anyone took, he might just as well not have answered at all.

  "I'm tired!" he bellowed finally,*after nearly half an hour.* "No, seriously, George - I'm going to bed -"

There's no way that Ron didn't hear the "blast of noise" when Harry came in. But Harry remains downstairs with his admirers for nearly a half hour before he comes upstairs to find Ron. Which gives Ron a half hour to brood about why if Harry didn't put his name in the goblet, Ron's upstairs alone with zero information while Harry hangs out with his admirers downstairs.

And things don't go well when Harry finally does show up.

  He [Ron] looked up when Harry slammed the door behind him.

  "Where've you been?" Harry said.

Not a great start from Harry. Harry means it as "why weren't you there for moral support?" But to Ron, this registers as "Why weren't you downstairs congratulating me at the party with the others?"

Since we see the books from Harry's POV, we know that Harry wasn't really a voluntary participant in his own party. But Ron doesn't know this. Harry shows up thirty minutes "late" with a Gryffindor banner tied around his neck and looking like he's enjoyed spending the last 30 minutes being praised by the entire house.

  "Oh hello," said Ron.

  He was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort of grin. Harry suddenly became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner that Lee had tied around him. He hastened to take it off, but it was knotted very tightly. Ron lay on the bed without moving, watching Harry struggle to remove it.

  "So," he said, when Harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it into a corner. "Congratulations."

  "What d'you mean, congratulations?" said Harry, staring at Ron. There was definitely something wrong with the way Ron was smiling: It was more like a grimace.

  "Well... no one else got across the Age Line," said Ron. "Not even Fred and George. What did you use - the Invisibility Cloak?"

  "The Invisibility Cloak wouldn't have got me over that line," said Harry slowly.

  "Oh right," said Ron. "I thought you might've told me if it was the cloak... because it would've covered both of us, wouldn't it? But you found another way, did you?"

  "Listen," said Harry, "I didn't put my name in that goblet. Someone else must've done it."

  Ron raised his eyebrows.

  "What would they do that for?"

  "I dunno," said Harry. *He felt it would sound very melodramatic to say, "To kill me."*

  Ron's eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into his hair.

  "It's okay, you know, you can tell /me/ the truth," he said. "If you don't want everyone else to know, fine, but I don't know why you're bothering to lie, you didn't get into trouble for it, did you? That friend of the Fat Lady's, that Violet, she's already told us all Dumbledore's letting you enter. A thousand Galleons prize money, eh? And you don't have to do end-of-year tests either..."

  "I didn't put my name in that goblet!" said Harry, starting to feel angry.

  "Yeah, okay," said Ron, in exactly the same skeptical tone as Cedric. "Only you said this morning you'd have done it last night, and no one would've seen you... I'm not stupid, you know."

  "You're doing a really good impression of it," Harry snapped.

  "Yeah?" said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or otherwise, on his face now. "You want to get to bed, Harry. I expect you'll need to be up early tomorrow for a photo-call or something."
