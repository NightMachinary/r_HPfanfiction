Am I the exception as someone who has found a new appreciation of certain characters? For example, I never paid Ginny much attention in the books, but there are some wonderful authors out there who really flesh out her character and now I love reading about her.

Or Draco, he's a nasty bully in the books, but at the end of Deathly Hallows you can see the beginning of a redemption arc, and I always enjoy a good Draco redemption.

The only one I can't stand as a main character is Snape. I appreciate his complexity and everything but I can only endure his bitterness and self-pity in small doses.
