Exactly and I mean after being able to escape the Dursley's for almost the whole year and learning about magic would have been a good motivator to become more studious. Heck even hearing people praise his parents should have been encouragement enough.

I don't know about you but if I was suddenly taken away from my abusive relatives and thrust into a world where I'm famous for vanquishing a Dark Lord who is the wizarding equivalent of Hitler who also happens to have killed my parents for trying to protect me. I sure as hell wouldn't be lazy about the school work. It's Magic for God's sake for someone who's just been introduced to magic he's not very enthusiastic about actually applying himself as much as he should.

Like you said Voldemort coming after him every year and when Sirius escaped Azkaban supposedly to kill him should have been enough motivation for him to expand his defensive and offensivespells repertoire. Where's all the Slytherin traits the Hat was talking about? Cunning, Ambiton to prove himself and some damn subtlety.

Also I know they covered this in Deathly Hallows but Expelliarmus? Really?!? I love Harry I really do but of all the spells he goes for that. I can understand hesitation for the Death Eaters but Voldemort? Yes he did succeed in killing him but no just no. The more fanfics I read in which Harry offs Voldemort in a different manner the more I find myself cringing at the scene.

That's not to say Harry was useless or anything I don't expect him to be OP in canon. He just could have done a lot better in improving himself. There were some moments like teaching the DA and learning the patronus to defend himself against the dementors which I was quite proud of.
