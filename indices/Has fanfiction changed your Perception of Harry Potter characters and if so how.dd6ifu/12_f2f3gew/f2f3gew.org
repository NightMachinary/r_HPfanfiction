If there's one thing I've realised after reading fanfictions, it that canon!Harry is a pretty average wizard. Think about it, he has the greatest dark wizard of all time after his life - that's enough of a motivator to stay ahead of everyone but he was averaging Acceptable in Transfiguration before his O.W.L.s, and unlike wizards like Dumbledore, Voldemort, or even Hermione, he gets, and is content with, Exceeds Expectations in most subject. You'd think that he will get Outstanding in most subjects, but he barely manages to keep up with his schoolwork.

He's lucky that Voldemort was an idiot to overlook things again and again, and basically handed his death, otherwise Harry is a pretty ordinary wizard that would easily get slaughtered.

Snape's words are not too inaccurate. He's rather lazy and a lot of times, he manages to find his way out simply by pure luck or having more talented friends.
