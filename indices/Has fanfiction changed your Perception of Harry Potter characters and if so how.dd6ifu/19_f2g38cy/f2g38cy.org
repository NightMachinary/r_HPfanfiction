I started disliking - almost - all the canon characters!

Seriously, Harry is a mediocre dumbass, Ron is a (Mo-)Ron (a guy who always complains, but never tries his best and will never amount to much), Hermione is bossy but not a genius (seriously, Snape and the Marauders are much closer, as they have good grades without putting in as much work), Ginny is a fan-girl and a non-personality in canon, Lupin is a coward who always runs when the going gets tough, Dumbledore is manipulative and an asshole (not to mention that he's complicit in child-abuse (...ten dark and difficult years...)), Molly is a stupid and unsupportive mother (we never see her praise her kids, she is always complaining about their jobs, their appearance, their girlfriends (Fleur!) etc.) not to mention that she is the reason her family is poor ("But I want a girl!" - hell, she doesn't even find a job after Ginny leaves for Hogwarts! It's not like household chores take much time with magic! Hell, they don't take a lot of time with modern conveniences like a washing machine, a dishwasher and a vacuum! Seriously, get a job Lazy-Molly!) etc. etc.

Seriously, Sirius (pun not intended!) is the only character I really like!

I did once like canon Harry and the others, but fanfiction showed me that Harry kind of wasted his potential in search of mediocrity (not that he could ever blend into the background, so this was wasted! He should have tried his best!)
