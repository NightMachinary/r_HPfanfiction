I've read all of the books, and I think fandom has only changed my opinion of how I view Harry. That, really, if Harry had more drive and was just a little more ambitious (whoops Slytherin) he'd probably have been quite the formidable wizard. Not to say that wasn't a formidable wizard by the end of Deathly Hallows, but he would have been possibly well past Auror level in dueling or perhaps much more well-rounded in his studies. Harry, to me, didn't realize his potential. Which I guess I shouldn't be too upset about, because Harry grew up in an abusive home; it's hard to see yourself as more when others have systematically called you lesser.

I definitely disliked Dumbledore before I started reading fanfiction. All fanfiction really did was better develop just how manipulative and/or emotionally unattached Dumbledore really was when dealing with Harry. The detailed grooming of Harry by Dumbledore in fanfic just made sense after reading Deathly Hallows.

I still really like the Weasleys and Hermione. If anything, I'm extremely attached to Hermione. Love her to bits, don't really enjoy any bashing or the like.
