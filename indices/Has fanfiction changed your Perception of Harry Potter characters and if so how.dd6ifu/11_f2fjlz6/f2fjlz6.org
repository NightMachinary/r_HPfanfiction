I used to have a similar perspective and I began refusing to read any stories that featured the Weasley family in any positive light. However, I recently reread the series and I realized I spent too much time reading fanfiction -- like I'm talking I began reading FF pre-GoF.

The series is great and yes, there are plot holes and some situations don't always make sense, but ultimately, it's a good children's/YA series.
