I became... dissatisfied with Dumbledore by OOTP, due to the massive shift in tone for the series. Adults being clueless is fine in a children's wish fulfillment fantasy, but when taken as a whole Dumbledore was criminally negligent at best, and a monster grooming a child soldier for sacrifice at worst. The fan fiction I have read has only cemented my negative view.

Ginny, I do not particularly dislike except that I think the books did not establish the relationship with Harry well and the movies actively undermined it. So, I prefer Harmony fics and don't mind if Ginny is bashed, or killed to get her 'out of the way'.
