I kinda admire Harry now. My initial impression of canon is that Harry gets shoved around by the adults and survives by virtue of having Hermione nearby, but rereading after reading a bunch of fic shows he actually does drive a lot of the plot with his desire to solve mysteries, and at least in the first five books is legitimately brave and competent.

Finding out the Draco fandom existed kinda made me pay attention and realize that Draco is not just a bully, but a whiny pathetic coward with no redeeming features. It's weird how JKR kinda hints that she wanted to give him some kind of arc but couldn't square it with him being a total coward and just let the cowardice define him.

Reading shitty writers bash Ron makes canon Ron look cooler in contrast. After reading about death eater/rapist/loser Rons it really stands out when he sacrifices himself in book 1 at the chess match and stands between Harry and Sirius in book 3.
