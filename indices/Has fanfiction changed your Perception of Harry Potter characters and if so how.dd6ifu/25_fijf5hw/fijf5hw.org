Dumbledore bashing has had the opposite effect on me, really- I'm so tired of it that its made me have a knee-jerk reaction against anything which is even slightly critical of Dumbledore, because my gut reaction is basically "Oh great, another Dumbledore-bashing fic". And this is even though I know Dumbledore is a deeply-flawed (but also brilliant and, to my mind, fundamentally good) character, because its just too much.
