I agree that If you haven't reread the books since you were young and get now into fanfiction you'll be exposed to tons of bashing that will make you see everything from a very different point of view, but I'm certain anyone would come to similar theories on their own just by reading the books as an adult.

The trick to prevent such thoughts is to read the books with a simple mindset, understanding that they are filled with plot holes and that JKR never properly planned anything. Take what the books tell you as absolute facts and /don't think/.
