/Fantastic Beasts: Crimes of Grindelwald/ opened my eyes to how much JKR's storytelling suffers from this, when it isn't covered up, as canon was, with lovable characters and evocative writing full of whimsy and unreliable narration. The camera can't be as unreliable as viewing the world through Harry's perspective, and that's why the plot in that movie feels so reliant on ham-fisted idiocy and convenience.
