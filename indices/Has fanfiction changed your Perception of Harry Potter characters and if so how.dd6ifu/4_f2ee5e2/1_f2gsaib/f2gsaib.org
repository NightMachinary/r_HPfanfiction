Really, you've got to read the books as two series. One, from books 1-3/4, is a kid's series. The adults are incompetent, magic is highly ill-defined and fluctuates from book to book, the challenges are tailored for smart kids, and so on. These are wonderfully written - but won't stand up to intricate/consistent worldbuilding examination.

Books 5-7 are a young adult series, and are (IMO) very different in tone. Book 4 is the middle part - bridging the two.

The magic system starts becoming more fleshed out and defined later on - and the plot starts to hit the 'big points' that JKR probably meant to (Voldemort's return, the horcruxes, snape, dumbledore's death, the end). The writing grows more complicated - and IMO less interesting, as JKR's mastery of simple writing falls away.

Both are filled with plot holes - but in the first half it's kind of to be expected.
