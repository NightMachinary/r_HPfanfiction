I hate almost every character now.

Harry for being the edge lord, lord of 10 fucking God know what Noble house.

Hermione for being a (at very least a semi) Mary Sue though a YouTube video or was it a comment expose her not a ff.

Ron for being unreasonable jerk dumbass backstabbing fool because the ff author said so with their half arse writting of their ff. Though I hate the community rather than the character.

Draco for also being a Gary Sue in the ff of course.

Dumbledore for being secretly edge lord I mean evil wizard who takes a single gold coin every day from the Potter vault for his daily butter beer. He's evil I tell ya. Said the author.

But to actually answer your question.

No. FF suck ass. They good but they just ff. Most of them notoriously trash. The top 10 FF people followed or like in FF website, the #1 place is fucking garbage. But hey don't let me stop you from enjoying.

But a fan written article do change my perception of Ron and how the JK Rowling write her books and story telling.

I can't find it but it started with a the quills something dot com.
