I came to HP fanfics to find something which has a good Harry/Ginny romance, and I'm still looking tbh. I've given up on the pairing because IMO there's always some part I don't enjoy. It probably didn't help that the first few fics I've binged back then were almost exclusively soul bonds, amounting to somewhere around 2m words.
