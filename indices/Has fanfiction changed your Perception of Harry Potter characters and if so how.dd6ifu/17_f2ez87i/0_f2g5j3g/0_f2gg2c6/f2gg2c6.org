There are so many fics out there with the strangest AUs, and some pairings definitely are more prolific. Tbh I really just don't think JKR wrote Ginny or Harry to be a good relationship- to have Ginny start as a fan who can't even talk around him, to becoming a pseudo-sister he still never talks to, and suddenly jealousy, just doesn't work. Even when she's fleshed out I think they make great friends not partners.
