It was fanfic that opened my eyes to other pairings in the HP universe. I read the books so young that I took most characters/relationships as facts (Harry + Ginny good, etc) but reading fanfic I saw (in my opinion ik not everyone shares this) the potential chemistry that underlined Harry's relationship with Malfoy, as well as other character pairings, and it introduced me to Drarry which is literally the only fictional relationship I've cared about consistently for years. Although noticing how terribly that JKR wrote Harry + Ginny it's kind of made me dislike Ginny as a character, just because she exists largely attached to Harry, but that's not Ginny's fault it's JKRs.
