I view Fanfiction as fairly mailiable, and don't really have a set position in my view of the characters. Do I believe Ron is a disloyal friend? Probably not. Would I read fanfic with that characterisation in it? Sure. I like the sliding scale Ron can be on in fanon, Him being a huge jerk is just as interesting to me as super supportive Ron. Don't hate him, but also don't mind when he is bashed.

  For example, Ron Weasley, I find it fascinating how if you just shift the focus on him, he can be an antagonist or a protagonist. Antagonist if you focus on his jealousy and self inadequacy, protagonist if you focus on his feats.

Really the only things that I really have a opinion on are, I don't like Hermione bashing, and I LOVE H/Hr. Everything else I see as seasoning to change up whatever Fanfic I am reading from the rest.
