It's also with how small the changes could be to bring that around. Draco having a better first encounter with Harry, and being more friendly with him moving forward. Snape being the one sent one summer to go watch Harry, and seeing how he was treated by the Dursleys/seeing him more as Lily's son than James'.

Little tweaks can believably make a big difference.
