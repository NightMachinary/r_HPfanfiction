I find it curious to see how your experience is pretty much the polar opposite of mine. I'd like to see more of a morally grey Hermione and not her flawless fanon version. Give me more actions like with Rita, make her the one you call for dirty jobs which have to get done. A saner Bellatrix Lestrange so to say.

I've come to despise Remus, found myself firmly in camps Sirius and Tonks (as long as Harry isn't white Knighting his way into her pants) and want to read Snape die a thousand agony-filled deaths.
