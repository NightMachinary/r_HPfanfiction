I'm really annoyed by the power dynamics most authors write for Tonks. You have a woman in her twenties who already went through cop/military training and is outgoing/extroverted, and a teenager who at best had two relationships and a date. So clearly, Tonks will eternally swoon as soon as Harry asks about her "real self" or is kind to her. And clearly, he will be the dominant party in that relationship. /s

As for Sirius, I feel like he never really had a chance to shine. He went from an abusive home into a civil war, into a decade of unlawful incarceration in the worst prison on this planet to living on the run and in hiding. He never got a chance at life and that's something I'd like to see explored. Granted, a lot of fics handle him beyond poorly as an overgrown man child, but that's a different issue.

As for his violent side, good. You can't win a war with non lethal weapons if the other side is shooting to kill. I'd much rather read about Harry, Hermione, Sirius and Tonks fighting a guerilla war against Voldemort and Umbridge than Big Weasley family fluff with enough children so you need a spreadsheet.
