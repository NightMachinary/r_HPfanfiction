I saw your first comment on the top and thought exactly the same thing. Fanon Tonks reminds me too much of Ginny with generally being very well-loved, popular, only even cooler because they go out of their way to prove how good of an auror she is, and that metamorphmagus thing drives me up the wall. So then I go,'oh not another one, I've seen her before'. But I haven't even read Harry Tonks paring, maybe she's better there. And I don't even know why Sirius's lack of, I don't know, emotional maturity maybe annoys me so much. I guess I dislike that in reality. And he also tends to have a violent side, which makes things even worse. I think I am also not that interested in Harry anymore so Sirius's focus on him irritates me. It's fine in canon, but I want something more in fanfics.
