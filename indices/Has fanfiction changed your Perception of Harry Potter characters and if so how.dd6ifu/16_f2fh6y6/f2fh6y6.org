I realized how really really annoying Hermione is and that her ruthlessness is always viewed in a positive light in the books. I remember really enjoying when in some fic she dreaded what would happen if she had to answer for keeping Rita in a jar and blackmailing her. I really love madam Pomfrey now and like Remus even more. I really dislike Sirius after reading several fanfics because there he seems unable to get,say, that Slughorn's favouritism might hurt students or doesn't care about anything that is unrelated to Harry. But that doesn't happen in all the fics, so I'm still hopeful. I cannot stand Tonks now because she irritates me nearly in every fic I've read with the exception of fics by fernwithy. I find Snape even more interesting because fics can give us some missing moments we didn't see in canon and it's fascinating to read something from his point of view or learn of his motives.
