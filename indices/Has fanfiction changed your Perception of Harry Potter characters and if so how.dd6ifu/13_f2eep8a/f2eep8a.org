You read to many stories that bash them, then ;) I try to avoid those and usually (well written) fanfiction makes me understand and appreciate all the characters, even those I initially did not like. I disliked Sirius for example because of the “prank” he played in school. That was attempted murder he got away with and saw nothing wrong with. It could have killed Snape, or turned him into a werewolf. Snape could have told everyone of Lupin's secret. With all three options, Lupin would have ended either expelled or ececuted. That's a pretty terrible thing to do to a friend. But reading good fanfiction which manages to get people's psychology and motivations right, I came to understand that he's just super impulsive and short sighted. He never really considered the consequences. So, he's not as malicious as I had initially thought.
