I never really thought about Molly, but seeing so many of y'all talk her up has made me... double down on dismissing her.

Molly Weasley is fine. She is NOT a badass. She is not uber powerful, or amazingly clever.

She's just a sweet, if a bit exhausted, mother

Saying the word "bitch" does not make you a badass. I don't care that she apparently outdueled Bellatrix, it's just dumb.

And what the hell does she DO all day? Her kids are all moved out or in school.
