I Honestly, a SFW, clean language battle feels way more out of place. There should have been more dialogue along the lines of "let's kill those fuckers", "make those Bastards bleed", or "were going to bait them here and then fuck them right in the arse/bugger them from behind". Also way more cursing and the agony filled screams of the dying (not everyone dies to killing curses after all).

Trying to write a mild T rated battle just feels off and shows a massive disconnect between the genre/target audience and what's happening. McGonagall might care about proper language, but I don't see Seamus or the twins showing the same restrain.
