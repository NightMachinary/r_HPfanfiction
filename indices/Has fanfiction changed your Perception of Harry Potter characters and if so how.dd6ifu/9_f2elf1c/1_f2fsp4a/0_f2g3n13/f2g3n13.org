HBP is an utter train wreck which makes pretty much everyone look stupid. Most notably Harry and Hermione, but it's pretty difficult to find someone who doesn't look worse at the end of it. No matter if characters like Dumbledore or background ones like Bill (Not standing up for his fianc√© or their engagement) or Tonks (what the fuck was Rowling smoking when she wrote that "romance")?
