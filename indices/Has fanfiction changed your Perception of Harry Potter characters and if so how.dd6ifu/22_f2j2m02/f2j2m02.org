I honestly can't really remember my original opinions on most of the characters, however Hermione after many fic I find an overly obnoxious prick who I can only really deal with as a minor side character, Ron... is kinda in the same boat as Hermione in my opinion. And Harry, well I have started to prefer anything other than a overly Gryffindor version. Really I have started to dislike the canon personalitys. And that is just the "Golden Trio"... honestly I hate that name.
