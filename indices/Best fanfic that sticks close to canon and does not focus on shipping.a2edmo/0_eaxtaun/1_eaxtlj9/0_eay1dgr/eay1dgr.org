I really like this linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10268550/3/What-I-Have-Taken-Long-Before][10268550]]) and this linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10066757/1/Cast-Your-Soul-to-the-Sea][10066757)]]

The author has several canon compliant Remus-centric stories but they are mostly Remus/Tonks romance.
