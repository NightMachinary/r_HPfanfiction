Nah, I'm just looking for something that's not too OOC and doesn't change anything in the books. Fanfiction does not only cover things that could have gone differently but also prequels and sequels and the "deleted scenes" that could have fit seamlessly into the story, doesn't it? (Or doesn't it in this fandom?) Another possibility I've tried to find but failed is a back in time story that isn't OOC where the character that travels back just creates an alternate timeline where everything turns out even better and the original timeline is not changed. Btw everybody says time travel is an old trope and there have been too many stories to cound but I have yet to find one that I can read to the end...

Also maybe it's just that I really don't need any of the marriages after the war to be split up for random reasons so that Harry and Draco or Draco and Hermione or Harry and Luna can be together...
