Ooh, ok, I didn't realize you wanted epilogue compliant post canon stories! Ok, hum. So Graeliars has written a bunch of Scorpius Malfoy x Rose Weasley stories and I've really enjoyed those, so if you're ok with a focus on canon ships you might try there.

Nightmares of Future Past really does sound like what you're wanting as far as time travel stories, so I do recommend that one.

Everything else I can think of that I like that keeps all the canon ships gets rather AU in other ways, so probably not what you're looking for, but if you want stories where things get AU after the epilogue without breaking the canon ships let me know and I'll see what I've got.
