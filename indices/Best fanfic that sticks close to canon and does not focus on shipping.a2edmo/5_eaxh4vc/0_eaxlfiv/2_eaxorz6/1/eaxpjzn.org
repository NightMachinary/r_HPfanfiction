Btw I'm interested in next generation stories, would be nice of course if Harry's generation is somewhat involved since I don't really know anything about the next generation and they could just as well be original characters except for the sentiment. +for some reason I really would like to see a Ted Lupin time-travel story. Or maybe just for the reason that I will forever think that Remus got the worst deal of them all or maybe a tie with Nevill's parents...+
