Oh, things like Harry is the Master of Death so when he dies at an old age, he is continually reincarnated into alternative universes because he can't ever truly die, or he gets depressed when his wife dies and he's old and tired and puts himself into stasis sleep and ends up being woken up hundreds of years later out in space because humanity screwed up the earth too much and so migrated to the stars, nonsense like that
