I know the struggle, because those are exactly the type of stories I look for too. I think there are only a handful of them, nothing comes to my mind except one shots that are too short for their own good.

If I may suggest my own story (I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're looking for), I try to keep everyone in character as much as possible. Although there are background relationships (all canon), it's not focused on romance, but rather on family.
