Looking through my favourites found the following. I might make a couple of small slip ups as I've gone through these quickly and might have misremembered them a little.

​

*Post-DH canon-compliant:*

linkffn(An Interview With Justin FinchFletchley)

sort of linkffn(Muggle Saturday by plinker5x5) - this one does talk about relationships but is more just a funny misunderstanding than romance.

linkffn(Cousin Harry by nicnac918) and its sequel (Uncle Harry by nicnac918) explore a future where Dudley's children have magic. In the same vein are linkffn(Perfectly Normal Thank You Very Much by Casscade) and linkffn(Dudley's Memories by paganaidd) - I can't remember which is best.

​

*Mid-series canon-compliant:*

linkffn(The Wandmaker's Escape by White Squirrel) slight deviation from canon in that Luna and Ollivander escape from Malfoy Manor themselves.

Sort of linkffn(The Assassin Wore White by apAidan) why St Mungos was never outright attacked by Voldemort.

linkffn(Goldstein by Laazov) canon told from the point of view of Anthony Goldstein, if he were from a strongly religious family.

​

*Canon-compliant but then sensible time travel:*

linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them) Hermione goes back in time post-canon to stop the war.

(I thought there were more of these but I can't figure out which time travel ones are canon compliant or not from just a glance)

​

Although it doesn't quite fit your criteria, I do wonder if you might enjoy linkffn(The Sea King by Doghead Thirteen)

​

I really really hope some of these are up your street! And I hope I haven't broken the poor bot >_<
