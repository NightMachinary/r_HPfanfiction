Sorry to toot my own horn, but you may like some of my stories. The romance tends to be very mild but I stick to canon as closely as I can. My most popular are Not From Others, which is DH from Ginny's pov, and The Aurors and it's sequel Hollow Ash, which are Harry as an auror thriller/detective stories.
