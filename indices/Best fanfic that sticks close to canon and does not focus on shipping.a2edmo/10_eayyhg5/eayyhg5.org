[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts by holdmybeer]]

A post war fic that diverges some time after the battle of Hogwarts (no epilogue, and no pairings). It explores the idea of what would happen if after the second war everything went back to the way it was before just like the first war, and how the trio would react after all they lost. Also the way Harry reacts is very much something Harry would do. It is a bit extreme, but as usual in Harry's life, extreme measures are necessary.
