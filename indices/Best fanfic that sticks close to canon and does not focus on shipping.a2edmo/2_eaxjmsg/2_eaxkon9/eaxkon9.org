I'm really getting desperate here... Don't think I've found anything at all that I like in a week, neither on ff.net nor on ao3 and I've started thinking maybe it's just not possible to find stories that are not focused on shipping because ppl just don't write them? Or maybe the HP-fandom is just mostly by children for children and I'm too old to try and read HP fanfiction.............
