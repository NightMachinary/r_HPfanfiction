I came back to say that I accidentally stumbled upon a next generation fic that kind of centers on romance and it's actually very nice (I'm halfway through it). It's well written and in character enough for me (for the now grown-ups), and the children do not have enough character in the epilogue to give me a good idea of what they'd be like so... I've always wanted to read something like this where the Potters and Malfoys and Weasleys reach some sort of understanding over their children, it's sweet.
