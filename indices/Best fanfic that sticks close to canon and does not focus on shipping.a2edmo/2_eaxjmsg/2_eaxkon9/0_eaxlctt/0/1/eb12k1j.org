Lol, there are far more older fans than people know. I'm 44 and I have been a Hp fan since 1999 when I first read the 3 books available, and I have been reading (and occasionally writing) Hp fanfiction since 2001. And there are still plenty of these kind of old hats around even now. I don't have any recs for you because I like shippy stuff for the most part. Just stick to the gen tag on ao3 is my advice.
