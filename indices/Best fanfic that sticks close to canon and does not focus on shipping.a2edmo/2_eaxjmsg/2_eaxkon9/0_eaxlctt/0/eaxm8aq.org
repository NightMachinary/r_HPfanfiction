No, that's not what I mean at all (also, thank god, I started suspecting that I was just too old for the fandom, after all, Harry Potter is kind of a series for children and teenagers). What I mean is I personally do not want to see any of the given marriages that were formed after the traumatic war events broken up for no good reason other than to put two ppl together that the writer likes better. (e. g. Ginny loses interest after 3 children and Harry falls in love with Luna Lovegood and also Ron is an idiot and Hermione has been secretly in love with Draco, who, if I remember correctly, actually loves his wife so much he did not want her to go through the dangers of pregnancy and childbirth, that kind of thing)

I have nothing against relationships developing in the background as long as the stories are solid, but many stories focus rather heavily on romance and I'm failing to find anything with a good plot where romance is really just in the background.

A huge problem I have with HP fanfiction is that characters are often out of character to fit the stories, Snape suddenly treating Harry like his own son just because he realized the Dursleys are not treating him well? Dumbledore being malicious and stupid and everybody hates him? When I see things like Harry/Bellatrix I really cannot click on the link...
