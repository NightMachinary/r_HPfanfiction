Maybe you want to be looking at post canon stories? There are some that get recommended on here several times a week and have already been suggested at least once today, so you'll have no difficulty finding them.

I know the filters on ffn aren't that great (they seem to be get rather random results) but putting in the work yourself is probably the best way of finding what you like rather than what somebody else likes.
