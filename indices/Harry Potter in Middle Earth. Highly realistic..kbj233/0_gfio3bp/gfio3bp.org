I disliked this part. I mean... letting a potentially hostile group, after ambushung them, which was carrying a horcrux, free just to rant at them and then barely reapplying the binds when they predictably attempt to give him a steel injection?

Kinda breaks my SoD if this was supposed to be a Harry who had experience dealing with horcruxes (and thus the protections around such).
