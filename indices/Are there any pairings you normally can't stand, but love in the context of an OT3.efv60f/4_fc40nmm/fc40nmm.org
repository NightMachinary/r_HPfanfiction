I've been somewhat intrigued by the idea of a JPLESS fic for a time but unable to find anything besides smut (which I don't care for). I shy away from Jily (I can read it, but not if it's the main focus of the fic).

There's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20196634/chapters/47856466]] but it's brand new and hasn't gotten far enough for me to be able to judge on if it's good or not.
