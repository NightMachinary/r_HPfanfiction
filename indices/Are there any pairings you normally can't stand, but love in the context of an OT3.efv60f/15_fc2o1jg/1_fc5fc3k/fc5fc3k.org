Hermione/random death eater I also don't like, but some of the best fanfics I've read(like some of the best written ones) were SS/HG or DM/HG(whichever you prefer). They were very organic and beautiful, and a lot of people that don't enjoy those ships loved them. I wouldn't give up on those otps hahah But I understand why it wouldn't be someone's cup of tea
