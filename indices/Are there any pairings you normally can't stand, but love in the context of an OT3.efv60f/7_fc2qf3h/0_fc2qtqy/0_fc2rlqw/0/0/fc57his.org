There's plenty of Hermione/Draco/X fics around, with X being anyone from Snape to Draco's father. And quite a few where Hermione gets double teamed by both Weasley twins or Bill and Charlie.

Not my cup of tea, I'd love a good H/Hr/GW, but I have seen many things on Ao3, despite my best efforts to filter them out.
