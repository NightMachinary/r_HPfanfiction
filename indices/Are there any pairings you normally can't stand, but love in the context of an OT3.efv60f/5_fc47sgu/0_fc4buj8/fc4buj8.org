[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is one of the most recommended fics on this sub and has an implicit Harry/Hermione/Ron pairing. (The author confirmed with me in a PM. If he ever decides to publish the sequel, we will see their relationship being fully developed.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771), has the Trio living together against the wishes of their families, but that's not the focus of the story. The main plot is a reprise of Bismarck vs HMS Hood battle 60 years later, with magic. The [[https://youtu.be/4_jDaUSSPhc][first one in 1941]] didn't end well for Hood.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/955771/chapters/1870387][No Boundaries]], linkao3(955771), is pure smut.
