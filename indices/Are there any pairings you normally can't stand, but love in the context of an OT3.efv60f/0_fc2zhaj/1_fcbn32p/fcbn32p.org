  Voldemort making love with the only things that he loves...pieces of himself.

Sorry for jumping into this conversation late, but I want to mention that the plot idea of Voldemort only having feelings for Harry because he is a horcrux is fairly common in HP/LV fics. It works in stories that explore unhealthy relationship dynamics between the two characters. (In those stories Voldemort usually starts out as controlling, narcissistic, etc.) I can recommend a few fics if you'd be interested in reading something of that sort.
