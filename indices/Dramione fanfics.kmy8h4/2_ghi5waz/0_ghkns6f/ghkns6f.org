Hey! I think the premise is great but it was so poorly written. Characters weren't “in character”. For example, Hermione Granger swearing at Professor McGonagall?? In what world?? None of them were even remotely close to the original characters, I didn't even feel like I was reading a Harry Potter fanfic. It was a huge let down after everyone hyped it up so much. Like I said, the story had so much potential and the ideas were great, but I could not for the life of me force myself to like it.
