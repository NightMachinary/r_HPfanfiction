Auxilio Dubitasi sounds like a good spell name. I'd guess it would have a physical weighted down presence. Perhaps it could ground a person? As opposed to uplift them.

What would you call it? If a Patronus is a sort of spiritual guardian then?...

"I summon my Mental Sentinel!"

Not necessarily even a dark spell, just sorta melancholy. Be a great way to fight forced mental effects like the cheering charm, or some such...

I wonder what would happen if it touched a Patronus? Cancellation, nullification, or some sort of explosive reaction?
