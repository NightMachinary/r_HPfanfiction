Exactly, Dementors their effects and their counterparts are (to me) results of a broken soul. Like a shard of a broken mirror cutting things that come in contact with it.

No matter how "evil" or "good" you make a Patroni or the spell reverse. Sapient people can't "cut" into the soul like they do. Even Voldemort!

A Horcrux is like... circular pieces being cut out of the center of a mirror leaving the inside more and more hollow.

I figure Dementors could happen if you messed up the ritual somehow.
