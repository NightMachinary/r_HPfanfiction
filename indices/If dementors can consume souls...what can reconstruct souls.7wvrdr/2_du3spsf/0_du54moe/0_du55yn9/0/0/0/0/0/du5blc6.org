Your idea about Azkaban seems to be correct.

Apparently, a Dark wizard named Ekrizdis(1500s), created the island and lured sailors there in order to torture and kill them. When he died, the concealments he used disappeared, and the ministry came to investigate the island only to find it infested with Dementors. They let it be, like every good government should, and then in 1718~ made Azkaban into a prison.

What Ekrizdis made on the island is not known. But the first Dementors were found on Azkaban. So it is possible they are a man made creature, brought forth through pain and suffering.
