Makes perfect sense, no teleporting for Hedwig if she's not a full Phoenix. But hey at least she's alive again. Place of Power has a nice ring to it as well. Hmm creating magical creatures, that quick and dirty road to becoming a Mad Magus creating odd things... actually scratch that Hagrid totally create magical creatures with a broken wand, makes me afraid for what a fully trained Hagrid is capable of.
