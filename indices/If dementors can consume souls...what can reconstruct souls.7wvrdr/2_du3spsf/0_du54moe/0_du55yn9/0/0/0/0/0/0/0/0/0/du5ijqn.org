Ok, Thanks.

I am warning you, however. I just remembered that it was supposed to be three different kinds of wood, but not what kinds. So I mashed three different versions together. To get a better overview, just check [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(mythology][wikipedia]]

This is probably also not actually 100% correct, as it was written by a 5th grader, to fill a time slot of 3 minutes for a presentation. So a bunch of stuff was skipped or remade.

Edit: This is definitively not 100% correct.
