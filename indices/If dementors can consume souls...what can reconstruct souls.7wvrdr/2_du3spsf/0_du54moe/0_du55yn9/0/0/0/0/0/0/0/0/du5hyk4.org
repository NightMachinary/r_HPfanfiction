That vaguely tickles my memory as well, though I had completely forgotten the bit about the types of wood for the nest. Well most of it.

In exchange here's some spiritual lore I picked up in Australia from an old Aborigine who taught me how to use an atlatl. . . . Of all the spirits of the land, Mei-Mei Spirit (May may) is the most important one. The spirit of Earth and Lightning is everywhere. He has been and always will be, he watches over everything that lives upon his land silent except for when he feels words are needed.

Mei-Mei Spirit knows and came before all other spirits, from water, to sky, to animals. He calls down all Lightning and Thunder, and shakes the Earth to speak to those around him. Or simply to remind them that they live upon his domain.

When you enter a new land or travel to a new place, kneel down and take soil and rub your hands together. Give thanks for the land you walk upon, and let him know you respect it. Think on the paths you've left behind and the ways before you before you stand and continue your journey.
