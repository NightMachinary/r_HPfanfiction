I can agree with your idea about the creation of Dementors. But there should be more ways for Dementors to be created.

I always assumed they were similar to the 'Obscurie' with the repressed emotions and stuff. Only it being a magic 'evil' variant of Depression.

So Depressed magicals doing everything they can to feel happy, start taking it from others. Their magic adapting to sustain itself on the happy memories of others, until that is all they exist for.
