Well, there should not actually be anything stopping Harry from making Hedwig a Phoenix, If we assume you can create one by burning its body in the flames of three sacred trees.

And the colour should not be a problem either, since Phoenixes apparently can be all kinds of Purple too. (White is not a part of Purple though).

But, there is no singing from a dead owl.

So just make up another variant, where you only have to get your bird to the egg in the Sun gods palace and (many strage steps I can't bother making up) voil√°! An Owl Pheonix.

The Sun Gods palace can just be a 'Place of Power' kind of thing, where you have attributes of fire and rebirth.

Like at Vesuvius at the Winter Solstice.

So go to a volcano during the longest day of the year. Find the 'Place of Power' and burn Hedwig, with three sacred woods. In the piles of ash, a tiny owl should appear.

Sure. She would probably not be a complete phoenix though. So not an immortal bird everywhere, just immortal by this pile of ash. But ashes aren't really heavy to carry, so just bring them with.

And since she isn't a complete phoenix, she is still white.
