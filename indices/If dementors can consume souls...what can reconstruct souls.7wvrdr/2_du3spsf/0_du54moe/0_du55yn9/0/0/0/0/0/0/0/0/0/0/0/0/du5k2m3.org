I think HP phoenix are definitely different, for after they burn they are the same creature with the same name even. And they burn way way more often than mythological ones. I always figured the mythos ones lived hundreds of years then burned and were reborn without any of their old memories.

It's an interesting point if they absolutely have to return to their burn site. Makes them sort of like vampires in that respect with soil from the place they turned in their coffin.

I always thought that Fawkes like most things Dumbledore has is simply on loan from Nicholas Flamel. Who else would have the time and patience to tame an immortal creature? Or create the Put-outer?

I'd say HP Phoenix are restricted by not much, since they can immolation teleport. What does peak my intrest is how would you create a new Phoenix in HP land...

Say one took Hedwig's still body, burned it to ash and gave the ashes to a fire magic Obscurus. Maybe potential White Phoenix for Harry?
