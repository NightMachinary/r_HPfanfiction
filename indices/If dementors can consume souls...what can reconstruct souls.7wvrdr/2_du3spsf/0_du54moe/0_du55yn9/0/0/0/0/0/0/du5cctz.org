Thanks, I didn't know that bit of lore. I appreciate you sharing it with me.

That is also soft confirmation that you don't really have to be magical to be turned into one.

I'm so tired of Dementors are just low tier Demons or servants of some greater Daemon Warlords.

I also really love the idea of a natural Obscurus that is made of pure magic not just from repressed magic children. Hot spots of different kinds of magic, all over the world.

Maybe this is also how all magical creatures originally came about too? Phoenix just some red bird touched by a fire Obscurus.
