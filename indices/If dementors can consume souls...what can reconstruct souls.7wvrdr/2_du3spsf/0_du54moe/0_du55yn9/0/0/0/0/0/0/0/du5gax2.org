Harry Potter Lore actually doesn't say anything about how the Phoenix came to be, so I am completely making this up from what I can find/remember.

But the Pheonix was apparently some bird that wanted his legacy to live on forever. So he asked the Sun to give him a child.

The Sun told him that the price for life is death and only through fire, could his legacy be eternal. But not any fire would do, he had to gather sacred plants from all over the world and then call the Sun with a voice of heaven.

The bird flew from east to west gathering the most sacred of woods to build its nest and filled it with Murr, Oak and Cedar creating the childs future home.

He then started singing, through day and through night, to receive the voice of heaven. The sun watched him throughout the day yet never left at night. For seeing the bird, singing for the heavens, filled him with joy.

But the bird had not yet reached his goal, his voice not yet of heaven. So the Sun gave him comfort, energy and time to last him through the ages. For five hundred years, the bird sung in place, its nest now all but sticks. The Sun was now though satisfied and spoke down to the bird.

"Through Night and Day, through Heat and Cold, you have trained your voice, so now its reached the heavens. Your wish is now, your wish is true. You shall have it granted."

The nest now burned, it fire claimed, with the Sun standing over. The bird turned ash, fell to the ground, in flaming balls of cinder. His time was trough, his time was nigh. His death brought life anew.

I think this is how it went. It is not from an official site. In my religion class, like 10 years ago we were supposed to 'Talk' about mythical creatures. This is complete Garbage if you want the actual story, but I could not find it on the internet.

Add on: There is also something about the place of burning always happening at the same place. In the ashes of its first 'Death', or something.
