Aren't Lethifold like solo Dementor cloaks? I forget exactly what sort of magical creature they are. I think they are... Now I'm not so sure, either way I figured those things can make Dementors too like some sort of symbiosis with their victims.

Ohh yeah definitely any sort of hyperdepression in a magical, could create a Dementor for sure I'm with you there. I could see a Proto Dementor popping up from Sqibs too. Trying and trying to become magical while depressed, eventually pulling happiness instead. Perhaps that is why Squibs are looked down upon traditionally?

How about Mundane people? If a nonmagical walks into a magic hotspot, one of your natural 'Obscurie'? I figure that's how Azkaban became an island with so many Dementors if so few people are kissed. It is like some sort of radioactive wasteland, only with negative magic.

Perhaps some awry fishermen, or enthusiastic diver got too close to the island and were infected with negative magic. Later returning home, eventually becoming on of the Dementors found outside of the island.
