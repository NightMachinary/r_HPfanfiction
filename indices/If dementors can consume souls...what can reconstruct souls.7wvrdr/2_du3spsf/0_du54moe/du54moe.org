The spell to summon the anti-Patronus should be the antonym of "I await a Protector" in latin, so "You doubt in Aid"? (using Thesaurus.com)

In Latin: Auxilio dubitasti (Google translate).

Shortened as much as possible: Incertum -> Uncertainty

It sounds like a spell, but everything sounds like a spell in Latin to me.
