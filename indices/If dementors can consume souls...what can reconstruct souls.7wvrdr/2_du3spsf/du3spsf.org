My head cannon on Dementors is this. Souls cannot be destroyed only moved, or broken and repaired.

To cast Avada Kedavra you use something like resonance to shake someone's soul from their body, thus forcing them to pass on once there is nothing holding to the living plane. But to cast it shakes your own soul damaging it.

Dementors, at least the first one could have been created many different ways. But regardless of when or how Dementors came to be. Is that someone with a broken leaking soul, the rest having passed on, lost the ability to feel happiness. And they slowly became a Dementor, as their magic tried to fix it. Drawing happiness and memories to repair the leaking soul. Slowing losing more and more of themselves until only the broken bit of soul and body remained.

What they actually do when they kiss you is break off a piece of your own soul and swallow it to try and fix their own, but since it is not their original soul it doesn't fit and that piece passes on. Leaving gonna husk that will eventually turn into a Dementor as well.

As to reverse the process? You could perhaps cast time magic on them to make then younger and younger eventually they would turn back into a Human with a broken soul again. Perhaps you could then bathe them in Patronus Mist, not a full one because again that is a reflection of one person's soul not bits of one. Perhaps memory mist too of memories containing the original person (that stuff you use for a pensive). I always imagined the two types of magic looking like representations of a soul.

You could make them a person again, but the original person has been dead awhile. But by restoring the soul you would have given then a second chance with no memories. And have "destroyed" a Dementor.

As for a reverse Dementors? That terrifies me. A being with a broken soul that could only cause and remember happiness? Like a Black Hole that draws away Happiness, a White Hole would only allow Happiness and "good memories" but that would mean you were just as unbalanced.

I imagine something like Joker Venom or Tasha's Hideous Laughter would occur. You could watch your SO get brutally torn apart in front of you and only feel like it was the most hilarious and happy thing in the world giggling all the while an Anti-Dementor tore their body apart to ride the world of a soul with darkness of any kind inside it. The worst part would be IF you survived that. Because the memories would forever be funny to you, you could remember your love being torn limb from limb and still think it was funny.

Not to mention that Anti-Dem would necessitate a reverse Patronus spell that could be easily abused as a new unforgivable.
