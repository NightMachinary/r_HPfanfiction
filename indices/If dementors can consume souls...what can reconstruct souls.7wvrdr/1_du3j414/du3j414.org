The idea of the Undementor is amusing, if unlikely. If you are unwilling to believe that the Kiss /can/ permanently destroy a soul, there's an interesting theory that the soul is kept trapped /within/ the Dementor's body; the Dementor thus uses it as a permanent food source. If the Dementor is ever destroyed, the soul is finally freed to move on.
