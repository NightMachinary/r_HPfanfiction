This is giving me ideas. Older and more successful Dementors would be stronger and have a greater aura of despair. Maybe it affects their size, and there are actually various sizes of Dementors, depending on how many souls they've eaten. Maybe Azkaban is a prison not for people, but for the strongest of Dementors, deep down below the surface. Their Aura is so strong it affects the island hundreds of feet above it.
