Ya, the fic description is useless, I think the author tended to update it with each chapter.

It's a AU post GOF, that starts in 6th year: Voldemort has laid low in Harry's 5th year - Sirius is still alive, no DoM, no prophecy, etc.* Dumbledore finds something that may be necessary to defeat Voldemort and Harry has to go find it, along with Moody and an OC, but Voldemort can't know Harry's looking for it, so there's some shenanigans to make it seem like Harry is still at Hogwarts.

The story bounces back and forth between Harry's group and Ron/Hermione/Ginny at Hogwarts, with interludes showing what Voldemort is up to and battles between the Order and Voldemort's forces.

I recommend the story whenever I can because it's wildly AU: no prophecy, no Hallows, but there's still a reason it has to be Harry vs Voldemort and the explanation for why is pretty awesome (it has my favorite "Power He Knows Not" I've come across). Magic is still magic (i.e. author doesn't get hung up on the details) but the combat is snappy and well-written. There aren't a huge number of OCs and the ones used are good additions to the story without derailing it entirely. Writing is top notch.

*Oddly enough, I don't think the author was trying to retcon Sirius being alive or ignoring the prophecy, they just started writing before OotP came out and decided their story would be better if Harry was a year older I guess.
