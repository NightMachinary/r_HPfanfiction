There's no handy way of killing them known to wizards, but it's speculated that some very powerful dark magic (like /Fiendfyre/) might be able to destroy them (it would explain why Voldemort was comfortable with them as allies even though neither he, nor any of the Death Eaters, knew or could cast the Patronus Charm). Failing that, there's always just pushing them through the Veil of Death, that would certainly do the trick.

Also, we know that if they are "starved" of emotions for too long, they start to wither and eventually dissipate.
