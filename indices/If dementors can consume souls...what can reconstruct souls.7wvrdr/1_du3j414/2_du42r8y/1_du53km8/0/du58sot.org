Someone else on here said that the killing curse basically sets the body from "alive" to "dead"--nothing about ripping a soul out.

This is from the HP Wiki entry on Dementors:

#+begin_quote
  No one has ever demonstrated the ability to kill a Dementor, by Avada Kedavra or otherwise, implying that they can not be killed through physical means, but can only be driven away or temporarily kept at bay.
#+end_quote

So, I guess they can't be killed at all? Unless Fiendfyre can consume them as [[/u/Achille-Talon]] suggested. These guys are pretty badass and I have to wonder if maybe JKR erred in making them as powerful as she did. They have one vulnerability, the Patronus, that isn't even available to every witch and wizard.
