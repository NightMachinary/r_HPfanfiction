I actually haven't read any further than you. If you're not enjoying it, then by all means stop reading. I personally find it hard to stop reading a book even if I dislike it, so if you're like me, I can't really offer you much hope. I don't know how it ends or how good the seventh one is. Eventually I'll read through book six, but I'm a bit busy right now.
