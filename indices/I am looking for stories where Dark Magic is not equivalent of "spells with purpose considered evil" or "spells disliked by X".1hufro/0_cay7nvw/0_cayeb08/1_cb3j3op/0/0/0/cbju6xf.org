I don't know if you're still reading, so I'll say this anyway. I wasn't too bothered by most of the "feeeelings" but I did wish they'd get their head out of their asses sometimes haha. On the whole it didn't bother me, but I have never not finished a story I've started unless the editing made it undecipherable.

All in all I thought it was worth finishing and was severely disappointed when I ran into the end.
