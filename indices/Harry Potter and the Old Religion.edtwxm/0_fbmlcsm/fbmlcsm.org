Not particularly, the magic generally laughs at the concept of balance, you can conjure practically anything from nothing, rituals (well the horcrux making and Riddle reviving ones, which are all we get canonically) don't seem to have any balance to them either.

All it takes to bring Voldemort back from just about as close to death as it gets is a few drops of blood, some long forgotten bone and a hand.\\
Horcruxes seem closer, murder for immortality is a classic right, but the murder is just how you split souls, the horcrux stuff is all about binding them to objects.
