Only one of these is a Tournament year story, but you may like them anyway:

linkffn(Playmate by Yunaine). Gabrielle invokes a veela bond at the second task. It's not a good thing.

Harry Potter and the Transfer Student by Enterprise 1701-d is one of my favorites. The author removed it to make it into a standalone novel, but you can still find it on [[https://archive.org][archive.org]] (although I won't directly link it). Made-up country (Kiria) with a stratified society with formalized social interactions.

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] by Jeconais. Gabrielle invokes a veela bond at the second task. It's not a good thing. Post-Hogwarts, she enlists help from Ron and Hermione. Site login may be required.

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Happily_Ever_After/index/][Happily Ever After]] by Jeconais. Gabrielle pairing. Site login may be required.

There's another one I remember, but can't come up with the title. Harry leaves the British Wizarding World after winning, because they turn on him because of his power level. He has a deal that they'll leave him alone. He marries a native American woman, and his bosses eventually send him (against his wishes) back to England. When his daughter turns eleven, Auror Ron and Professor Hermione show up to kidnap her, because Wizarding Britain no longer allows magical children to stay in muggle homes, Harry's magical signature is warded, and his wife isn't a wand-type magic user.
