I am writing one, but it involves time travel(early Marauders era), and it's Fleur's aunt or Bellatrix, still haven't decided that.

But one of the things is exploring other cultures(he kind of travels around a lot), sadly, unlike my other favored authors(Tolkien, Martin, Gaiman, and Riordan) JKR did as little worldbuilding as she needed to do, so I am still worldbuilding it to make the cultures more diverse than regular(British but speaking other language and bluer) quite a bit of work, but enjoyable and working from home helps a lot.

As for a rec linkffn(13140418) has Harry with an east European girl(and Fleur and maybe Daphne) with a quite culture shock.
