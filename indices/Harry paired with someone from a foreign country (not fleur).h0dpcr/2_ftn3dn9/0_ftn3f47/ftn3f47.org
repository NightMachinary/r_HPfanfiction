#+begin_quote
  Fic is crossposted from FFN, it is still being written and future updates will be added here too. A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. Story contains more detailed magic, politics, and more; it is a story of growth and and maturation. Harry is het and it may or may not be a multi fic.
