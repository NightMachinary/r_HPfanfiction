Linkffn(Many Thanks) has Hermione traveling back to the Marauders Era and later has HPHG as told through James's eyes. It is one of my favourites.

 

Are you okay with AU? [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7325][Teacher's Pet]] has a Hermione that didn't grow up with Harry. I haven't finished it, but I really like it so far, and it is complete! Take note that is was written before DH came out. This is the summary: "After what both Harry Potter and Hermione Granger assume is only a one night stand, they are shocked to see each other at Auror Training- him as the instructor and her as the student. They decide to put what happened behind them and move forward, but will they be able to do that? Lavender Brown also struggles to show that she's not just a pretty face- but when Charlie Weasley shows up, will that put a stop to her plans? Ron Weasley deals with his long distance relationship with Luna Lovegood and pursuing a career path he's not sure will make him happy. Can everyone find a way to be happy, both in their personal and professional lives? Hermione went to Beauxbatons."
