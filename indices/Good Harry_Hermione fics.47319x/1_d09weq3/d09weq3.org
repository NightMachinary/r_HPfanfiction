linkffn(Screams Part One by clonserpents) is one of the best H/Hr series.

Stanrick tends to be verbose in a manner not usually found in fanfiction and this has some interesting effects on his characterizations, particularly where Harry is concerned. He's intelligent, but no more academically driven than his canon counterpart. In linkffn(Thresholds by Stanrick) neither Harry nor Hermione are cursed with many of the faults brought on by adolescence, but I think the story is quite strong anyway. The characters make several references to important works in original fiction, which I think is quite satisfying, but others think breaks HP lore.

Lorien829 is frequently recommended on the subreddit, but I think linkffn(Resistance by Lorien829) tends to put the romance a bit further ahead than the plot and the story is weaker than it should be. linkffn(Shadow Walks by Lorien829) does a better job of keeping the mystery and suspense separate from the will-they-or-won't-they cliche. It took me ages to read this one because I find song lyrics at the beginning of a story to be an instant turn off, but it's good despite this.
