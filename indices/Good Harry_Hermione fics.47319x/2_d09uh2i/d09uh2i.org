Depends on what you like! I like the ones that make a conscious effort to stick close to canon---no bashing, no superpowers, no heavy-handed "correction" stuff. (I've always felt a weird, creepy vibe about robst, chemprof, and bobmin-type writers.)

My favorites are Full Pensieve's /The Last Horcrux/ (finished) and /The Years of Rebellion/ (huge and unfinished). They're on [[http://fp.fanficauthors.net/][fanficauthors]].

linkffn(With Malice Aforethought) is a great Book 6.

linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks) is a short, very unusual mystery with a weird metaphysical vibe.

linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Quest for Merlin's Blessing) is another one with a really unusual tone that I liked recently. It goes much farther than most H/Hr pics into all the reservations people have about the pairing---no romance, lots of anxiety and intensity, etc. The writing's a little rough but it has a very tight, interesting mystery at the center of it that's reminiscent of JKR.

/[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7149][Three Seasons to Closure]]/ is a nice, quiet romance fic set immediately post-war that gets overlooked because it's Portkey and FictionAlley only.

A guy named Gabilian wrote two pretty good Book 7s in the months before DH came out. The writing isn't quite as strong as some of my other favorites, but they're solid and under-read, because he was mostly an HPFF writer. linkffn(The Bottom of the Lake by Gabilian) and linkffn(A Serpent's Sacrifice by Gabilian).
