Avid and long time H/Hr fan here, I will update my favorites as I remember them.

Surprised no one has mentioned [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/2119][Dirty Dancing]] yet. Its a good story, and morphs into one among the largest H/Hr sagas, spanning generations.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4237967/1/Coming-To-Salem][Coming To Salem]] is also a good read, set in a totally A.U universe, and based on the movie "Coming to America"

[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/1601][Circle of Friends]] and its sequel [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/1998][Sweet Home London]] are also good reads, again set in an AU universe, and based on movies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3255466][The List]] is a hilarious read, but can also get quite sentimental, and totally H/Hr.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A different halloween]] is an A.U take on how different Harry's life might have been if things had happened different that halloween. Other stories by this author are good as well, but after a while he can get repetitive.
