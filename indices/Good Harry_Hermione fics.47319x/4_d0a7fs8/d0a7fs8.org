I started out a canon shipper, but I have found several enjoyable Harmony stories without those stupid Weasley bashings:

*Harry Potter and the Spygirl*, linkffn(10959290)

*Heart and Soul*, linkffn(5681042), Harry/Hermione/Fleur

*Patron*, linkffn(11080542)

*Returning to the Start*, linkffn(10687059)

*Stages of Hope*, linkffn(6892925), not strictly a Harmony story, but it's worth a read.

*The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382), this one is Harry/Multi, but Hermione was the first and she helped Harry the most

*What Friends Are For*, linkffn(7589233), a short H/Hr smut
