I know about only one such story, linkffn(Strong Blood by CooLibrarian). However, it is a strange story. It has some very strong elements (e.g., it is the only story I know about dealing with Harry's maternal ancestors; very interesting Dudley; elves), but it is also strange and convoluted (NO SPOILERS!). I still don't know what to think about it completely. And yes, it is also unfinished work.
