Best I can find right now:

linkffn(Blue-Eyed-Doe) has a lycantrophy infected Lavender, though she isn't completely turned, much like Bill Weasley.

linkffn(Valeriana Natassa) is a interesting fic at first, but dilutes into some weird clich√©s eventually. I also suspect some self-insert of the author in the form of the female vampire. Try it out, at the very least the premise is fun.

There is also "Forever Knight", but since portkey seems to be down, I can't find a link. Maybe you have better luck or someone on here has an idea where to find it.
