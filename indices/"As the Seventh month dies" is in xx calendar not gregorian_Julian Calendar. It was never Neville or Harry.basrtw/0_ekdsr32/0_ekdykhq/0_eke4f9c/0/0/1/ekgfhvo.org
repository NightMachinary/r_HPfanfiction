  She was never the best under pressure.

I feel like Hermione was pretty solid under pressure. From the very first book, even - knowing to use the right spell when they were all being tangled by that vine, all the way to the last book, where she was a fucking badass impersonating Bellatrix to steal from Gringotts. Actually I would say her cleverness was most obvious under pressure.
