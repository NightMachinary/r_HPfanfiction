But she didn't know the spell, she panicked for a good few seconds until Ron reminded her she's a witch. And when Harry and Hermione went back in time she kept tripping over herself and throughout the year was slowly going insane taking all those classes. In the third book she also panicky during the appearance of Sirius and Lupin and for a good while it's Ron doing the threatening and wand pointing while she is thinking about everything being said.

I agree she's very clever but I think she has a tendency to get flusterd when something goes wrong, and her cleverness in the future is from learning to be prepared. She ruins Marietta's face in time because shd thought ahead, same with having brought all that shit to live in the woods in DH and in duels she wins, it is usually with spells she taught herself in her own time.
