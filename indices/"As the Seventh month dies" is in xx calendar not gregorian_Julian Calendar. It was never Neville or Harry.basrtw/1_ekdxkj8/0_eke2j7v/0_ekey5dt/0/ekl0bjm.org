In the second book of Hufflepuff Harry duology Best Revenge, this sorta happens. Spoilers ahead! Its not Ginny (or Neville, or really anyone you will miss I think) and is just kinda part of the end, tho. I love the series, its not the greats fanfic ever but its decent, and sees the Dark Lord defeated in like 2 years by competent adults! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge]]
