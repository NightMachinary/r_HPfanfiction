You know what would be cool? If there would be a way to make it that the child of prophecy is actually Tom Riddle. He comes back to life in the CoS and somehow brings himself on the warpath against Voldemort. He could still be evil, manipulative and selfish, but you can play it that the bit of Ginny he used to bring himself back to life somehow made him a bit more mentally stable. He could start setting up his own movement, independent of both Dumbledore and Voldemort. He could come back to life in September, the seventh month, or have his date of birth retconned.
