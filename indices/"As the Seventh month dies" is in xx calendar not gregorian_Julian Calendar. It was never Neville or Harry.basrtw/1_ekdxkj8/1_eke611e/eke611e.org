I started writing a snippet about a Ginny who absorbed the Riddle soul fragment and never woke up in the Chamber, instead being transferred to St. Mungos until she finally woke during the summer on July 31. I never got very far but I still think it has potential. Riddle's experiences would provide Ginny an outside perspective on her own life as a poor member of a privileged class, and her own experiences of a flawed yet still loving family would temper Riddle's disdain for human relationships.
