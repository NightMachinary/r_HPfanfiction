Kyle the bat was an ordinary bat. Save from a minor scar on its left ear, it would have been a regular bat leading a regular life in an uninteresting forest.

However, that story would've been very boring.

So this particular bat had a scar. If it had a longer memory, it would've remembered how it had flown away as its parents were eaten by Nagini. In its haste, it had bumped into a tree and gotten that scar.

But because it was after all a simple animal, it remembered none of it and was searching for its prey.

As it flew over a Graveyard, because every bat flew over a Graveyard if it could, it saw so many lights flashing by. It didn't have very good eyesight, Flyte and Styr always made fun of it.

So when he saw those lights, it simply started going towards the source.

Lord Voldemort, the most feared Dark Lord in living history, was casting Killing Curses like it was Christmas and the curses were toys.

Harry Potter, universe's spittoon, was hiding behind a rock, desperately trying to escape.

Kyle, however, didn't see any of it. Kyle wanted that stick that made light. And so Kyle tried to snatch it.

Voldemort's wand turned in the middle of his incantation, pointing the dangerous end towards him. He could've stopped, then, but he was too accustomed to saying Avada Kedavra, and so by the time he stopped, it was too late. A green curse flew from the wand to the owner, and Tom Riddle knew no more.

Do tell me how was it, and provide additional suggestions which could make this better.
