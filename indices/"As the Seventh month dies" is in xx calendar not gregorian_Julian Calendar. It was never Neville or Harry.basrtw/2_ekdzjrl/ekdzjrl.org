It'd be neat if it were to be a total background character. Like, you check the books and find someone who's been mentioned only one time, and make them "real prophecy boy/girl". You write a story about their absurdly normal life as a background HP character, until the fateful day they cast the spell that finally kills the Dark Lord.
