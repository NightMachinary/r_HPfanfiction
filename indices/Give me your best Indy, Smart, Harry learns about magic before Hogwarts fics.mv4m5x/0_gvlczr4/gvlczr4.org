If you're looking for Draco Sympathizing fics I don't know a lot, but there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11360264/1/Like-Brothers][*/Like Brothers/*]] by Colubrina Linkffn(11360264), where McGonagall takes Harry out of the Dursley's care and Sirius raises him along with the Malfoys.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11002763/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Magic-of-Life][*/Harry Potter and the Magic of Life/*]] by Kate Carpenter Linkffn(11002763) has Bill Weasley taking Harry on a curse breaking expedition. It is complete and has a sequel.

For a /good/ 'Good-Voldemort' fanfiction, there [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8873552/1/Twins-A-Different-Life][*/Twins: A Different Life/*]] Linkffn(8873552) which is well known and one of the better read fanfictions on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] it has been abandoned though, so be prepared for disappointment.

Then there's anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/11649002/JustBored21][*JustBored21*]], Especially if you're looking for an over-powered Harry who dabbles in quite a lot of wild magic and has a lot of Dumbledore/Hermione/SelectiveWeasley bashing and helpful Goblins.

I hope that you like these, they're just some fics that I've read and loved.
