  It can just turn me off a whole fic to see muggle subjects like maths or literature there, especially when they're just flavour and don't have any plot bearing. It just feels like it'd be out of character for the pureblood run society to embrace muggle subjects.

Oh really, it feels out of character for a society essentially made up of shopkeepers and bureaucrats to actually train their members in counting and writing beyond elementary school level? Clearly you never had to deal with barely educated adults before.
