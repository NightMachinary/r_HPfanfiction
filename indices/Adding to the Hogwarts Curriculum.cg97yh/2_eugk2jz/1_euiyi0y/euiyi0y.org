  Clearly you never had to deal with barely educated adults before.

- 90% of their homework is "write an essay on this subject" or "read that book". If at the end of 7 years they still can't write, 1 weekly hour of litterature probable won't change anything. Not to mention the few times I read fic with it, they somehow end up studying Shakespear before of course he was either a wizard or wizard don't have "/true authors/".
- They have spell to help with it. In HBP, Ron's quill has its enchantment wearing off, changing everything he writes to something wrong, but before this he had an autocorrect quill.
- "/1 book for 4 Galleons, and these 2 are 3 Galleons each, 10 Galleons in total Mr Potter/", that's the kind of math most shopkeepers do. Just to be safe, you can add multiplication and division for some, but it's mostly simple maths.
- If people "need" math in their fic, can't they use a ready math subject that Harry never took but is somehow linked to it? I don't know like : Arithmancy?

Still, I guess math and litterature is still better than the fics that make they do "Sciences" or "History" as if Wizards would care about that.
