I don't like fics that cover classes at all. Unless the information taught in class is directly relevant to the main plot of the story, or adds important characterization that couldn't have come from anything else, then classes and class schedules shouldn't be put into the story. It just feels like filler content otherwise.

In canon, JKR skipped past weeks of school between major events because the classes weren't important, and the few lessons we actually got to see introduced important plot points - Snape's "bottle flame, brew glory" speech showed his instant bias against Harry, Slughorn's love potion demonstration foreshadowed the Merope backstory.

But I have to admit the most egregious examples of adding classes are the various forms of "Muggleborn Orientation Class" and "Study Hall", without adding any explanation of why or how they're part of the school schedule.
