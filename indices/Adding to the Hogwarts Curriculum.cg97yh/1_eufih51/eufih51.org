I mostly don't have a problem with it. Though it shouldn't beat you over the head with it unless it's plot relevant. In fact I always have to wonder 'Why doesn't Hogwarts teach basic math and writing skills?' Even Deku at UA has to take the boring classes.

As far as embracing muggle subjects, I'd hardly call art, music or literature a muggle subject. Think a pureblood doesn't appreciate literature? In a society where literally, knowledge is power? Pureblood parents should be cramming tomes down their kid's throats, in English and the original Latin.
