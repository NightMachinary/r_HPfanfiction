Meh. You're not exactly impressing me with your purported "contributions" to the sub, which appear to be exclusively to bitch about DLP. The "hobby horse" comment is entirely apropos.

Perhaps you might share whose sock puppet account you are and then we might all be able to compare our relative contributions to the sub or the fandom over the years? Until then, I think I'm done with you.
