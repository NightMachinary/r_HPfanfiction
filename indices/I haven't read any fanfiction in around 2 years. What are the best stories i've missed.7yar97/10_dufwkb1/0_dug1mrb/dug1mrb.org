I'm flattered, but I'm not a "handler" for DLP. No one from DLP is being "handled" or coordinated on Reddit /or/ DLP for that matter. We call stories shit if our members think they deserve it, which most of fanfic does.

Edit: Show me a story which you think DLP undeservedly disliked and we can discuss.
