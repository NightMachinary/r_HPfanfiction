You can't know if every downvote is from a redditor who's also a DLP member. Deleting is exclusive to the poster or mods, isn't it? I actually don't know. I engaged you because I check the sub frequently, but not every DLP member does, or is even on Reddit at all. Pointing out Narf and Taure is just pointing out best known DLPrs who are on Reddit. I would argue that 10 downvotes is huge, and there's nothing wrong with DLPrs downvoting you for attacking DLP collectively, or non-DLP Redditors downvoting you if they simply disagree with what you said.
