[[/u/vir_innominatus]] is kind enough to run a script that ranks the [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169NVDxmtgDuwB7O1rZenT_WfKWTJqs-k-cdxd37xHWw/edit#gid=00][top 100 most recommended fics on this sub from 2011 to November 2017]]

[[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RlWrlHvaHc9jVkI5kkcWuIZ3hEmwY_08fNdcUPHyeY0/edit#gid=2086651006][This file]] also has top 10 by individual years.

--------------

Some on that list that have been published or finished in recent 2 years are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is a great dark!Harry fic, in which he and his friends declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot after Voldemort's fall. The Trio lived and slept together.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is an extreme AU in which a more cunning Lucius Malfoy outmaneuvered Dumbledore after Halloween 1981. Dumbledore, however, would finally have his revenge after almost 20 years. Best Ron/Hermione romance I've read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569][Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw]], linkffn(11574569), contains almost every trope you can think of: WBWL, evil!Manipulative!GreaterGood!Dumbledore, IceQueen!Daphne, Pureblood Culture, Lords and Ladies, and etc..., but it's so well written that many people like it every much.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146][The Accidental Animagus]] and its sequels [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/1/Animagus-at-War][Animagus at War]], linkffn(9863146;12088294), have Harry raised by the Grangers. Both good and bad guys got competence boosts. The first four years more or less followed canon stations, while things become completely different in the sequel. The dark lady La Pantera is a great original character.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is set in a non-magic scifi AU. If you can get past that, you will find it an excellent story.

--------------

There are a few more great fics that failed to make that list:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): A manipulative!Harry expertly used Daphne for advancing his career and agenda.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]], linkffn(12614436): humorous dark!Hermione story with a fresh take on occultism. Its companion piece [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12644815/1/Hermione-Granger-Dermatologist][Hermione Granger, Dermatologist]], linkffn(12644815), is a fun one shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]], linkffn(11961978): If you like Muggle involvements, you will love this one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/Like-a-Red-Headed-Stepchild][Like a Red Headed Stepchild]], linkffn(12382425): What would happen if Harry's hair was red instead of black? Hilarity and chaos ensued.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]], linkffn(11419408): Best canon compliant Year 7 Hogwarts fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467): Dumbledore took the Basilisk a little more seriously, and the entire plot began to unravel. It's refreshing to see adults taking charge for once.
