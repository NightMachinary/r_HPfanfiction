Darklordpotter.net. Several regulars here on this sub (myself included) haunt the site, some (myself again included) for more than a decade. Several others find it a target for vitriol, their experiences being less than positive. The site appears to be at least as polarizing as HPMOR in the fandom. On DLP, there's a general dislike of lazy writing, slash (with a few, well written exceptions), or some of the trendy pairings in the fandom (Hermione/Draco, Hermione/Snape, etc.) and the general trend is for edgier, darker fiction than the norm on ffn.

DLP tends to polarize the fandom, particularly amateur writers who think more of their skills than is perhaps warranted given their skill levels. The site is known for blunt criticism; authors looking for smoke enemas or who haven't a thick skin tend to come by, strut around a bit, have a melt down, then go elsewhere and natter on indefinitely on sites like this sub about their unfair treatment. The site boasts several reasonably well known authors who are regulars: nonjon, jbern, joe6991, shezza, the santi, Taure, R-dude, Scott Press, Serious Scribble, Steelbadger, newcomb, Cheddartrek, Big D on a Diet, enembee, Silens Cursor, nuhuh, and Heather Sinclair, to name a few.

It's a fairly educated crowd: there are at least a half-dozen Ph.D.s in a variety of disciplines, from chemistry to theoretical physics to religion, a dozen or so M.D.s and practicing attorneys, and generally a higher brow level of discussion than the "4chan for HP fanfiction" impression one might get from reading the posts here.

Those who do stick around generally find that people there do try to help out when they can. I can confirm that their Work by Author (WbA) section is an excellent resource for feedback and advice and, while not sugarcoated, gives largely impersonal feedback to writers. (Site rules do not permit ad hominem attacks in the WbA threads.)
