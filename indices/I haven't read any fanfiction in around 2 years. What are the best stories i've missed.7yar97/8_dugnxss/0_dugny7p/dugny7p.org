  You came, you saw, you survived. But at the end of the day, you're still children. It doesn't matter how many battles you've won, how many Dark Lords have been triumphed, or how many personal travesties become medals of honor. You deserve better; the Sun is out now.

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

  One day, Christopher died and woke up as everyone's favorite character-Peter Pettigrew. "Don't suppose there's a return policy on this kind of thing? 'Cause...I think I want a refund."
