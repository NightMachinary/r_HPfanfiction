I enjoyed them and thought they were a decent read. Lots of similarities with the Heir of Magic by Gryffindor but since the author (Darth Marrs) says he was inspired by that story that should be expected.

For other Harem stories try those by RotaryFile (Selector) - Witches Secret Trilogy, Our Lady o'the Bless'd Do Over, Harem of Honeys, etc Plus most stories by Red Jacobson are Harem oriented.

For a fun little crack harem story try Hermione the Harem Girl by Rorschach's Blot

You can also try Harem of the Ancient House of Potter by SSJ04MEWTWO (found at adult fanfiction org)

And of course the classic Radaslab's Harem War. You should also look at his story Life Sucks Then you Die.

Harry Potter: Neko's Mate by FurySerenity (Vance McGill ) inspired/based on Gandalfs_Beard's Hermione's Furry Little Problem. AndcVance has his own version of Harem War.

No links as a couple of the suggested stories will probably run afoul of Rule 8
