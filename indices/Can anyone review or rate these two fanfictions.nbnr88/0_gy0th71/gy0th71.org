Four Founders is the most awesomest story in the history of awesome. Trust me, I'm not biased at all.

More critically, FF started as an exercise in writing lemons when the author foolishly considered trying his hand professionally at romance novels, but then it turned into a real story that then exploded Into a whole series. And you can see it with some hard, sharp tonality turns.

Just remember it was written over a decade ago. I would not write a fic like that today.
