You must be looking at A03. I only post on FFN. My AO3 fics are those with a few more lemons than FFN allows, but I'm not really interested in writing lemons any more. I have over 23 finished, novel length stories in HP, SW, and more recently Worm. Four founders alone has three sequels. Nowadays I'm just interested in writing as good a story as I can, and sharing it with anyone who might want to read along with me.
