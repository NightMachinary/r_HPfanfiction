Harry : "Come on people! When I invited you I never thought the D in DA would stand for dull. This isn't the library Hermione, here, have a drink. Ginny... oh there you are. Let's do something fun. I know! let's go skinny brooming now! It will be legen... Wait for it... Brilliant!"

Hermione - "But I did ask him to go to Slughorn's party as my date, //sobs// Didn't I? //pauses// No, I almost certainly did. And look at him, only stops snogging that bimbo to speak Quidditch nonsense. I just... why doesn't he like me! //sobs//"

Ron - "I'm telling you Seamus, The kenmore... Whatever... Are the fucking worse team in the league. Harry would find a snitch in the dark sooner without glasses, and he's a bloody mole without those. You know Neville here? Her grandma's saggy teat could play better than them! No offense to your grandma teats, Nev"

Neville - //passes out// //twitches dreaming about his grandmother//

Ginny - "Skinny brooming! //laughs, then frowns// Are you out of your mind!? I'll tell you I'm no some scarlet woman. //Frown lessens// But don't think I don't like you, I do, very much. Actually, I know! Let's go skinny brooming! My brothers don't have to know //laughs mischievously, then starts yelling// Potter! Where did you go you prat!"
