Drinking depends on the person. Some people don't get affected, some do.

Drinking is sometimes called liquid courage. Sometimes it'll affect people, sometimes it won't.

But, a lot of people believe how drunk you are, you become "the real you" rather you're a mean drunk, a clingy drunk, a crying drunk, an outgoing drunk. etc.
