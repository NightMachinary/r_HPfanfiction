Okay so as an actual question do people really change that much when getting drunk? I'm autistic so I've never understood the whole "do dumb stuff while drunk" thing because when I drink even, when I've had twice or three times as many drinks as others I just sit there and kinda thinking, like should I go to the gym tomorrow or would this stuff affect my performance? I've gone to parties and drunk a lot but never once did I do something stupid or out of character so I just don't get it.
