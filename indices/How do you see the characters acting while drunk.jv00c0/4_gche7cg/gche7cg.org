Nah, my canon is that Harry, generally so reserved and emotionally constipated, while drunk becomes affectionate and clingy, going around telling people how much he loves them and trying to snog Ginny in public.

Hermione would be sobbing one minute and giggling hysterically the minute later in a never ending cycle.

Ron I see as a fun drunk, making lots of jokes that only he'll laugh to, while answering Harry that "I love you too, mate" and tearing up.
