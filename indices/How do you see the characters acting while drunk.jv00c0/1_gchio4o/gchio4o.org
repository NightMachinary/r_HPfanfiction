Harry: Impulsive, misadventure-prone drunk. See also, Felix Felicis - but with less guaranteed success and more "what did I do last night, and why is there a lipstick-covered traffic cone on my nightstand?"

Hermione: "I'm not drunk, you are" argumentative drunk. Not likely to escalate into violence, just to get huffy if you disagree.

Ron: Clingy, "I love you man" drunk.

Ginny: Flirty drunk.

Luna: Might be drunk 24/7 and you couldn't even tell.

Dumbledore: I'm-a-failure drunk.

Voldemort: Don't drink and cast Unforgivables. It never ends well. Voldemort routinely forgets this lesson.
