Honestly I see Hermione the same way I am drunk. People always assume I'm smart because I have knowledge in almost every topic, but when I'm drunk. I give life advice and just loosen up. I'd like to think she's the same way just drunk out of her mind giving life advice on how to break the Trace, how to avoid taxes, and social issues.

Like the best example I could give is I'm at my friends 21st bday, we're all drunk in a hotel room. And I'm sitting on the floor talking to a dude I barely know about the Social Credit system in China. And how it could be implemented in the US. or talking about video editing because one of the other guys wants to shoot a music video and I do that as a side gig.

I just feel like she would be a great motivated life coach drunk and would be hella supportive of peoples goals. I could see her giving lavender clothing advice and like a good idea to get into the fashion world. I feel like she and Luna might bond because maybe all those creatures Luna talks about have some grain of similarity with Muggle legends. Etc
