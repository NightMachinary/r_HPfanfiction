Lmao Sirius was drunk for like half the book in OOTP, so he's the one that seems the least affected and probably would drink many of the kids under the table. I see Ron as more of a clingy drunk than an angry one. Hermione would probably go up to people and start asking questions she wouldn't normally ask, and Harry would just be down for anything
