I don't know about #1. It was /helpful/ for Lord Voldemort to have two servants that night, but if the scheme is changed just a little bit, there was nothing stopping Barty from slipping away at the end of the Third Task, going to the graveyard, and sacrificing his /own/ hand for his Lord.

Obviously, depending on the way in which Pettigrew is put out of commission and at what point, there is also the added information about the Death Eaters and their operation. Unlike most of the other caught Death Eaters, Pettigre would be very easy to terrify into spilling everything he knows about the Death Eaters. Depending on what view you take of his character, he could even volunteer that information partially out of lingering guilt. It is even feasible for Dumbledore to browbeat Pettigrew into becoming a spy again, Snape-style (it worked for Voldemort, didn't it?), if you want to go that route.
