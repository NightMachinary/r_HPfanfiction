Hmm... I feel like there's a middle-ground between the Stations of Canon in the annoying tropey sense, and chucking large elements of the canon plot out the window altogether. Certainly large-scale "for want of a nail" scenarios can produce interesting results, but I wouldn't want every fic where third year goes differently to then not have Lord Voldemort reappear for a decade.
