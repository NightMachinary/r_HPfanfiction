Ahh, I see. (Though your sentence appears to cut off oddly at the end.) I'd forgotten that particular connective plot thread. Blimey, I always thought so but I'd forgotten the extent to which Rowling's /Goblet of Fire/ plot is needlessly convoluted. Well... is it unimaginable to suppose that after learning (or perhaps witnessing) the casting of the Dark Mark, Lord Voldemort would be able to deduce Barty's survival and find him? Perhaps he is even able to recognise the Mark as having been cast by Barty through the same method which allows Dumbledore to recognise the curses in the cave as being Tom Riddle's work.
