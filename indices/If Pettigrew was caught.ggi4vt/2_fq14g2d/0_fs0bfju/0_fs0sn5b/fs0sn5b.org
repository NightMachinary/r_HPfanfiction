I'm confused what you mean with "about Barty Crouch Jr.". My answer to how he learns about the Tournament would be via Barty, who presumably learnt it from his father when he was still Imperiused and invisible. Am I forgetting some way in which Barty Jr.'s escape from his father's control is dependent on what Voldemort learnt from Jorkins?
