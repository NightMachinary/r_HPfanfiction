There are lots of bigoted purebloods out there who never ended up in Azkaban. You don't necessarily have to use Pettigrew. You can even create an OC if you like. Or use any of the lesser known Death Eaters like the Carrows, Selwyn, etc. Little is known about them, so you're free to do almost whatever you want with them. I read a fanfic once where the author made Barty Crouch Jr. team up with 2 former Death Eaters to start looking for Voldemort prior to year 4.

Remember, Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts doesn't necessarily have to start (or even go) the same way. Heck, you can even use Karkaroff if you want.
