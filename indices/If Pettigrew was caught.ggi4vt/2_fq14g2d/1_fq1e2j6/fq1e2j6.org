I thought the same way, but then I realised I'd need a second servant to look after 'baby' Voldie while Barty is in Hogwarrs. I plan to keep Pettigrew alive as well.

If I were to have Pettigrew as a spy, it would be under an unbreakable vow and he'd still go to Azkaban but I think Dumbledore would know that Azkaban would be the first place Voldemort would go to get his followers. Still not sure if that's a route I'm heading but I'd like to have that option there.
