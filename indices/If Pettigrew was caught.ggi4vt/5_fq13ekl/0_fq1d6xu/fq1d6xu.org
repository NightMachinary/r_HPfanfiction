It was more about the Goblet of Fire, they wouldn't meet him in the secret cave or send letters through code. If I remember it correctly Harry stops usind Hedwig as Umbridge is monitoring the post. Could be wrong though, it's been a while since I've read the books so that's why I'm asking. I think the main effect would be Kreacher, I don't think he'd be in Grimmauld place if he was free. He hated it there, I'd have him donate it to the cause but I don't think he'd live there.
