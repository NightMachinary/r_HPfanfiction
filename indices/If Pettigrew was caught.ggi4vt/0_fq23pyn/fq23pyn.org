Magic works by intent a lot. Pettigrew wasn't truly loyal, more like desperate. Like the other commenter said, there's no need for Barty to stay once the other champions are out of commission, at which time he could simply slip away undetected and apparate out to the graveyard.

Harry arrives, and Barty, still in disguise, pretends to be moody until he stuns him from behind and retrieves a random imperiused muggle who was looking after the homunculus.

Barty is truly loyal, devoted even, so his intention with the hand and the blood would be much purer. The ritual would then of course be much more potent in return, changing Voldemort in untold ways.

Barty, having charmed the cup, will have collected it to prevent escape - so Harry and Voldemort duel, but this time there is no convenient out.

I don't think Harry could truly escape. Voldemort cruciates him for a bit, then shoots the killing curse and ends it. Harry enters Limbo and the Horcrux is destroyed.

Due to Dumbledore not being dead, and his parents having moved on, Harry will likely take a bit longer to get out of Limbo again. Voldemort leaves his "corpse" behind as a sign for the Aurors and Dumbledore searching for Harry, and they find him in the Graveyard when every DE is gone.

He of course tells Dumbledore, who lets out a breath of relief, and finally begins the real assault on Voldemort. He origanizes a Horcrux hunt with people he trusts - snape, moody, etc - and they get all of them except for the cup and the snake. The cup is extracted through Dumbledore's influence, and destroyed, and the Snake is killed in a stealth mission when Snape reports it having gone to hunt.

Then, The Order corners and destroys Voldemort once and for all.
