Book 4 happens the same minus the graveyard. Crouch jr just wants Harry to die in the tournament. He's trying to use the tournament to try and discredit Dumbledore also. With it being just a random death eater year 4 maybe that's the last straw and Dumbledore is fired. Maybe since McGonagall is overworked she loses her position as deputy headmistress. Maybe a puppet headmaster is put in place with Umbridge as deputy. With Dumbledore fired maybe gives him time to get the Horcrouxs. Year 6 is trying to get the Diadem and the cup. Year 6 is also when Harry finds out he's a Horcroux for drama's sake. Year 7 is trying to find out what would happen to a spirt Voldemort if Harry is killed or the horcroux removed.
