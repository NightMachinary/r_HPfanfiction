Crouch Jr only needs to escape the original time he did. Maybe something happened to Crouch Sr at the world cup to allow Crouch Jr to escape. Unlike the original books Crounch Ur only needs to stay at the very least put Harry's name in the Goblet. Anything else like killing Moody and framing Karkaroff is extra. With Crouch Sr proven wrong with Black would be even bring up freeing his son? Should Crouch Jr be found (if something goes wrong) you have a viable excuse to release the death eaters by claiming that the trials weren't fair.

In my mind with both Dumbledore and Crouch Sr fall from grace who is left with enough clout for everyone to rally around? Maybe Amelia Bones would be a fannon answer but could be killable in cannon. Do they need Harry to bring back Voldemort? The whole reason to get him m was to get around the protection. The argument could be the ministry may fall sooner by giving more influence to Malfoy.
