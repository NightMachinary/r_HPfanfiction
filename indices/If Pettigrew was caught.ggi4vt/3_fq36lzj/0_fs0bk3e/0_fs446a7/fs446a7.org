Maybe by framing Karkarof. In the books Crounch as Moody already mentioned it could be a death eater. As Moody he could try to investigate him and by the end of the school year kill the original Moody and slip outside. They could find the original Moody dead and assume Karkarof killed him.(people have been arrested for less in Harry Potter) would any death eater actually try to help him get free? I highly doubt it. With Krum under the imperius during the third task then maybe make Harry the target. If you have Harry hit by the killing curse to destroy the Horocrux then maybe have Harry hit head before he knows he was struck by the curse. Basically Crouch thinks it's failed and Dumbledore thinking it's still there or worried that it took Harry over.
