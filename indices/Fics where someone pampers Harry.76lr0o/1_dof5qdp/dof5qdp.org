So you basically want Harry having a nice childhood:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]], linkffn(6439871): Lily met Mrs Granger on that fateful Halloween night, and everything changed.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): Extreme AU, even in Muggle world. James and Lily got in a lucky shot on Voldemort and ran off with Harry to the Continent. Harry never went to Hogwarts and made his career in the Muggle military. When Spain attacked Gibraltar in 2008, he saw his opportunity arriving...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Iron-Lady][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]], linkffn(12212363): Harry was raised by a loving OC Muggle family, but Muggles had their own design on the Magical World. Things already escalated during Year 1.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146), Harry ran away at age 5 and was picked by the Grangers. Dumbledore found out soon and was actually happy about the situation. He also told them about Harry's real deal and brought Tonkses to help them. Harry and Hermione grew up as siblings and had lots of fun together.

In both [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542;10937871), Harry was raised by 'good' Dursleys.

There are lots of 'Harry raised by Sirius' fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus]] especially likes this theme. However, my favorite here is still [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), where a more cunning and sinister Lucius Malfoy managed to kick out Dumbledore and had ruled magical Britain for almost 20 years. Dumbledore would however make his return after the next generation graduated from Beauxbaton. He and Sirius prepared Harry extensively for the eventual showdown with Malfoy and Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When In Doubt, Obliviate]], linkffn(6635363): Lockhart found and raised Harry. He was sorted into Slytherin, and things heated up already in Year 1. [[/spoiler][Voldemort got neutralized quickly, and Draco somehow got the Diary]].

Finally, the Dursleys had the misfortune of bringing Harrymort into the house in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106):

  I was five years old when Petunia Dursley realized that she would never be rid of me. I know this because she began sobbing while insisting that she would never be rid of me.

  Thick as they were, the Dursleys eventually realized that the only way to live unharmed was to accommodate my desires. It was the childhood I had always dreamed of.

  I stroked the parchment of my Hogwarts letter with fondness.

  The youngest Dursley nearly wet himself at the deranged smile on my face. That was an expression usually reserved for our little "chats" (These usually involved quite a bit more screaming than chatting. Still, I always healed him at the end, so it's not like he has anything to complain about).

  My "loving" relatives were more than happy to ship me off to Hogwarts where I would be far, far away from them. The desire was mutual. Even with training, the three were barely tolerable.
