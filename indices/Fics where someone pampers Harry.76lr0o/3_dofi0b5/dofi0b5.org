Balm of the Soul. Linkffn(12064203)

Too bad it's likely dead, and only 2 chapters. I'd still recommend reading it for sure.

There's not much to spoil, but I'll tag it anyway. Here's a short summary:

[[/spoiler][Harry's exposure to Dementors at the end of his third year isn't something to be brushed off, and it comes out that he was abused by the Dursleys. To start making up for it, Dumbledore offers Harry choices of rehabilitation resorts. Harry semi-spitefully chooses the most expensive one. It's staffed entirely by Veela - but - there's no actual smut in it.]]
