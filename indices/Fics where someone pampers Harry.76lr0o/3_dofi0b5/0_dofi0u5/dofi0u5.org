#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's reaction to a hundred dementor's is severe enough to knock that foreign soul fragment loose. Now his thought processes feel almost alien, foreign memories keep triggering to the forefront of his mind, and he feels cut off from the people closest to him. As such, Harry needs some help recovering from the ordeal, and everything else in his messed up life.
