I haven't seen many of this! Why don't you try to make a full story though?

Also check [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12085137][Seven Normal years of Harry the Hufflepuff]] By TheLemonsWillSeeYou, the story is narrated by Harry reading his own diary on his last day at Hogwarts and I think it does this very well.
