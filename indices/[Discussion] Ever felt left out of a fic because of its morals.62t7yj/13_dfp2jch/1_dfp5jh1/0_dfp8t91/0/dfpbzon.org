A bit mixed, I like the idea of becoming at peace with all the regrets of life, and just being able to let go of painful moments. But as it's being introduced in an HP story, there is something fundamentally sad about this afterlife. Harry, having never 'understood' the love of his parents as a child, will be never be granted a reunion, as by the time he dies, his parents and ancestors will have 'dissolved'.

That being said, there is something fundamentally beautiful about becoming one with the universe as part of the afterlife. All pain, all pleasure, all experiences within life essentially become an expression, a way for the universe to 'know itself'. Andy Weir's story [[http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html]['The Egg']] is a great rendition of this idea.
