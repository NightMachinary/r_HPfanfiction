  Yeah, I have. I can't remember what the name of it was, but Harry got incredibly anti muslim in it, to the point of genocide, so I dropped it. While I usuallly don't care about what happens in fanfiction, if racism and sexism is showing up, then I'm gonna get the fuck out of there fast.

When you die, all the memories and experiences you've accumulated leave you and flow back into the universe. You relive you life backwards and forget each experience after you've relived it. Once you've finished with this process, you are reborn as someone else.
