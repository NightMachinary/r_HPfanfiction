Less the morals, and more how they're dispersed.\\
Dark Harry often kills. That's fine. He's brutal. That's fine too.\\
Don't deliver a 10000 word lecture on why his morality is the supreme morality and why everyone else is wrong. Further minus points if you include a classic staredown where the guy allegedly in the wrong breaks eye contact.

This is why I hate poorly written OP Harry fics, and IMO is a huge line between being jsut OP harry and READABLE OP harry. The latter doesn't worry about preaching and there's a distinct show-not-tell policy where the flashbacks illustrate why he is the way he is but NOT actually putting the author's morality in words.
