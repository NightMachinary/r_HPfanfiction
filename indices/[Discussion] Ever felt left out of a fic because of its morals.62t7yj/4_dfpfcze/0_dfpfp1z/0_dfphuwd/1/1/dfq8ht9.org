What non lethal alternatives do you propose? Stunning is revesible, as are Petrificus Totalus and the like.

And we're told that killin harms the soul, but i cant remember if AK specifically harms the soul. It just requires hatred to cast, which in of itself isnt evil.

If I was Cedric's dad for example, Id probably hate Wormtail enough to want him dead.
