Hatred /is/ evil, in my opinion. It's a forgivable evil, but it's evil.

As for non-lethal alternatives, what about Dobby's line abotu the fact that he tries to "maim and seriously injure"? Smashing a wizard's arm bones will incapacitate him, is totally reversible for wizards, but will require time and care to do so (Skelegro and all that), which simply cannot be deployed in a battlefield.
