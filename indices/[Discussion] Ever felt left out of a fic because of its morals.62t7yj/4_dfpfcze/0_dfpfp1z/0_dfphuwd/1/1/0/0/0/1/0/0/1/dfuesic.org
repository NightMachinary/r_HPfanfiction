Dose the prisoners with Draught of Living Death, put into expanded trunk, put into house with fidelius in the basement (Also make sure they are behind a fake wall inside the trunk), to get into the house you need to drink that potion that voldy had guarding his necklace, and uhh idk maybe throw in a few house elves. Also make fake trunk with duplicate dead bodies put under stasis spells, and also uhhh the real trunk is in the Mirror of Erised, which is confirmed to at least temporarily stump Voldy, and to get to it you need to want to go to the prisoners, but not free them. Sounds good?
