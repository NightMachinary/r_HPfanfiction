Managing to capture someone in a world with instant teleportation AND corruption is a rather high order (hello, "Imperiused" victims). And Voldemort could as likely to mount a prison break as the next Dark Lord.

"Winning with as little casualty as possible". You're not taking account of civilian and ally casualty. If, in a battle, a DE killed one of your side, then killed, that's two deaths. If he was only injured or captured ("Imperiused", ehem), then came back in another battle and keep killing, the number will get bigger and bigger each day.

Not to mention the DE's muggle raid. How many lives were lost each time, or being subjected to something worse than death? And how many of such tragedies could be prevented if their force was so crippled that they couldn't start raiding to begin with?

It's rather weird that you worry more about the lives and well-beings of your enemies than that of your allies and innocent, unaware bystanders.
