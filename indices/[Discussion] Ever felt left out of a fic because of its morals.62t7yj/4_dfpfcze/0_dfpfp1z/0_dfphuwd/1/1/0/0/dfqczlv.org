But how long is that "extensive" time? Overnight, or a couple of days to a week at most? Sure, you may win the battle, but the same enemies will come back and kill your allies in another one, then the one after that, AND the one after that as well.

In the long run, your allies will die off slowly, while the enemies' force is still the same size, maybe even more if they're recruiting. If your force is falling, people will be swayed to the enemy more easily.

Won the battle, lost the war.
