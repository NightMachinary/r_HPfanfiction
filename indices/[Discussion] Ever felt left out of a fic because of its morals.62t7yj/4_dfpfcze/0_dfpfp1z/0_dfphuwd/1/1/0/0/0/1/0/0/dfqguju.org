Maybe true, depends on how you spin it, though in canon, the Light side's capacity to keep their prisoners in check is rather questionable, not to mention the resources and manpower needed to operate such a facility. The more prisoners you rake in, the more it takes to run the place, effectively crippling your force even further.

And like I said, Voldemort could, and would, mount a prison break. Azkaban is hardly a safe place. Or an expanded trunk, like you said. Even the Fidelius could be breached in several ways.

So far only the protection around the Dursleys' house is strong enough, but that kind of spell depends on very specific conditions.

But again, at this point it all depends on the writer's skill. If it's believable enough, I'll buy it.
