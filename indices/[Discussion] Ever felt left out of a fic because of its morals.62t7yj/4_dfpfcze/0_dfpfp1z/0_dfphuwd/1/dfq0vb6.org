Ah. I see. I kinda disagree. In my opinion, if you need to kill people, it's acceptable, but if there's a non-lethal alternative, it's always better; so while it's not practical in real life, it shouldn't be a problem to wizards, as a lethal curse and a non-lethal one have an equal chance of succeeding (except for the unblockable Killing Curse, but the good guys can't use /that/, since it requires deep, soul-tearing hatred to cast and permanently corrupts you). As for prison space, it shouldn't be a problem for wizards (/Space-extension charms are a thing/, dammit. Stick all your prisoners in a trunk. Barty Crouch figured it out!).
