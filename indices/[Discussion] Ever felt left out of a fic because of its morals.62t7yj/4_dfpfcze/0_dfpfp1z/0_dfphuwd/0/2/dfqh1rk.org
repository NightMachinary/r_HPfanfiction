But that case only applied to Stan Shunpike, whom Harry felt was imperiused. He had no problem with others blasting Death Eaters out of their ways.

They didn't kill Dolohov later mainly because they wanted to cover up their trails. But since Dolohov killed Lupin in the Final Battle, that should give Harry a serious lesson.

I don't think JKR was that into non-lethal morals. Harry crucioed Carrows without any remorse, Molly killed Bellatrix, and Voldemort got to rot in hell forever. The 2nd part of the Final Battle was excessively bloody for the bad guys ("trampling over Death Eaters' bodies"), but I guess JKR didn't want to write the scenes too explicit in an YA book.

JKR also indicated in her post series interviews that not many Voldemort minions got away. Malfoys were probably one of the few exceptions since they defected before Voldemort had fallen. Generally speaking, such defectors were often spared by victors throughout history.
