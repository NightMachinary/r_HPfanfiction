This is something that I wish was explored more in the books. Is AK fundamentally evil? It requires hatred, but hatred isnt an evil quality.

If someone killed my friend, id hate them. And does AK actually damage the soul, or simply the act of killing? What does that even mean?

I know a few fics that actually go into this. Off the top of my head Prince of Slytherin has a discussion between Dumbledore and Scridgemore about wheter AK is justified.

We never get that in canon though. Just a blanket statement that AK is bad. Its one if my gripes about the books.
