My understanding is that the violent discharged of concentrated pure hatred required to cast the AK strains the soul, and, if the process is repeated often enough, will eventually damage it. The act of killing itself isn't the cause, but the consequence will be the same if you kill by other means /while/ focusing similar amounts of hatred.
