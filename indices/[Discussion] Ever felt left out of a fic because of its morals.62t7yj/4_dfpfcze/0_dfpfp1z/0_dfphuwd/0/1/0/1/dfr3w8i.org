It's not hatred that fuels it(in my headcanon). What fuels it is absolute killing intent. You have to want to kill them, similar to the Cruciatus where you have to want to hurt them. There is a very big difference between righteous anger, a need for revenge, and legitimate sadism. It isn't the same feeling as shooting someone in a gunfight, because in a sense, that is self-defense. The requirement to cast the Killing Curse is the same if you had to shoot someone in the head, even if they are unarmed and defenseless. Voldemort is a sociopath/psychopath type of character. Of course he can toss out Killing Curses like candy, he has been killing in cold blood since he was 16. Do serial killers hate their victims? The hatred thing makes a lot of sense, because for a normal person, they are going to only really see that sort of killing intent if they deeply hate their enemy and think they don't deserve to live. But anyway, that is why it is illegal. Not because it shatters your soul or anything, regular cold-blooded murder does that perfectly well. But because if you cast it, it somewhat takes all consideration of intent out of the equation. You can't say it was an accident while dueling, because you can't accidentally cast it. You have to know what you are doing. That is why it is Unforgivable.
