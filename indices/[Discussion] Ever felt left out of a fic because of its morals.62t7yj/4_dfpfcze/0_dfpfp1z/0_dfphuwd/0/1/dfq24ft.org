  The time the ministry authorized the use of Avada Kedavra during the first war against Voldemort is seen as some sort of dark time, as opposed to (in my opinion) a sensible wartime policy.

It was really not. You could make a case for /using lethal spells/ (such as a license to /Reducto/ people's necks), but Avada Kedavra itself is a fundamentally evil spell that literally corrupts your soul when you cast it, and can only be cast with true, deep hatred.
