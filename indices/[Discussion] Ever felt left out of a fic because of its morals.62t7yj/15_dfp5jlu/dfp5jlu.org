Hasn't happened in a HP fic that I've read yet, but I've gotten annoyed with author tracts before, even when I agree with them. I feel like good, subtle writing shouldn't make it entire obvious what the author's morals are - we should see the characters' morals and then be able to judge for ourselves.
