I'm not sure if it's the author's morals /per se/, but any time Protagonist-Centered Morality gets too heavy, I click away. Of course, this correlates strongly with Super!Harry, so it tends to have bigger problems than that.

The worst offender I've seen was a story I can't remember the title of where the notion of "One law for the +king+ Noble Houses and another for the commoner" was codified in all but name and advanced proudly as a moral good. It usually takes a lot for me to abandon a story once I get into it, but what finally did it in for me was when Harry called down divine judgment on Jerk!Ron just for being a jerk, and it worked.

Edit: I found the story. It's linkffn(6906107), and it's messed up in a few other ways, too, that I'd forgotten about.
