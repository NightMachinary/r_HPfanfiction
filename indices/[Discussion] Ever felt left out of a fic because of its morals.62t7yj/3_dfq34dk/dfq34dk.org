There was one fic where Ron and Hermione (I think) got married, and their /first kiss/ was in front of the altar.

Apart from purity-obsessed American sects, this is unrealistic in the extreme.

I can just about accept that they're still virgins (I have serious doubts about Ron), but no snogging? No /kissing?/ Please, this is /Europe/. We don't do purity. Virginity is a wrapper, we throw it away as soon as we can.
