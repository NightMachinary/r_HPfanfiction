I agree, it'd be hard to read for me too. On the other hand, I think it's going too far to say it's completely OOC --- I believe J.K. Rowling pretty clearly meant her characters to be Christians or some sort, especially judging from her personal beliefs. It is implausible for Hermione to have been raised in a very religious family (though not impossible), but I'm afraid that it's not that far off from how Rowling would see it.
