This isn't morals per se, as most of that stuff had been covered by others, like not killing death eaters, etc.

I remember this one decently written fic, I was about 80k words in, and Harry visits Hermione. Turns out they're Catholics or some shit, they start praying and then talk to Harry about Jesus and Christianity.

I noped the fuck out. As an atheist, I can sympathize with the agnostic or deist position, even though it's still unlikely to me. But honestly I can't bring myself to read religious dialogue from a Catholic theist. So much cringe, so much bullshit. Especially when it comes out of left feild like that.

And fyi, Hermione's family is the last one I would expect to be religious. A deeply religious family simply would not not could not have raised Logical Hermione. It felt really fucking OC. Suddenly Hermione is talking about Jesus, and I'm here wondering what her problem is with crumple-horned snorcacks.

And there are cool stories where God, angels, all of that is real, like in the Denarian Renegade series. And those stories were really fun to read because it read like a story, not the author using fanfiction to proselytize.
