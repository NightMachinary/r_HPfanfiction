No, there was a justification for that. Ron and Hermione accidentally were exposed to an extremely dark potion that forced Hermione to have sex with Ron, or she'd die, and no contraceptive charms could be used.

Apparently the potion was used centuries ago for sex slavery, that was the in-plot justification, but it makes you wonder why the fuck they wouldn't just use Imperius and get on with it.
