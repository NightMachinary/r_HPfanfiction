"Hermione gets pregnant so Ron/Harry/Draco/etc. must fall in love!" is a weak, overused plot anyways (not that it can't occasionally be done well) but I'll let it slide if everything else is good. It really pulls me out of the story if she agonizes over it though. That just highlights how contrived the plot is. I especially hate when she suddenly has very Christian, muggle views about abortion either as an author mouthpiece or because the story requires it. If you're going to drag the can of worms that is religion into the wizarding world, you've got to commit to unpacking it.
