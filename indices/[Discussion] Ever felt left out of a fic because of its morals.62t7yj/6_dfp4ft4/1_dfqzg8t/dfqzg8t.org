I see a lot of comments against marriage law fics here. To me, the only realistic way to get Hermione with someone like Draco post-war is for an external constraint to force them together. That's more convincing to me than them putting aside their differences and history on their own. Unfortunately, I've never seen an example where they try as hard as they should to get out of it or have a truly compelling reason to submit. I'm considering writing fic again, but I haven't figured out how to deal with that conundrum to my satisfaction yet.
