I recently noped out of a story that I was following for a long time when Harry suddenly became a "guns are great for everyone" advocate. That in combination with the glorification of a real life pagan group that has some nasty racist shit undertones and I closeboxed and deleted the alert.

Usually, thankfully these things show in the first few chapters so I can hit the x before following the story.
