I don't think that's a good comparison (in fact, it would be a false equivalence). Yes, wands /can/ be weapons, but they do not have to be, and an average witch or wizard during time of peace might as well have never actually used spells that are deadly.

Don't get me wrong, I do understand that there will be people in whose hands wands will always be weapons because they are just those kinds of people. But in the hands of someone who somehow does not know any offensive spells, it really can't be; sure, you can use it for combat anyway if you are desperate enough, but there are a lot of things you can do that with if, again, you are desperate enough; craftiness is part of why we, humans, rose so high after all. Heck, I'll give you an example by throwing a name of a video game here: Dead Space; most of the “weapons” you used aren't really weapons but bona fide industrial equipment that is getting used as weapons because there's nothing else and the character is desperate.

I will admit that there is something wrong with the stuff like the Reductor curse (as well as quite a few others), sure, that pretty much is a spell the primary use of which is combat related, meaning that using it does make one's wand into a weapon. However, we do not actually see that curse being taught at any point during the Hogwarts curriculum, for we know Harry taught it to himself before the third task and then taught it to others the next year, and they were specifically learning how to fight rather than anything else so the chose one of the many possible things one can do with a wand, that thing being “harm people”, and it wasn't because the wand /is/ a weapon but rather because it /can be/ a weapon and they wanted stuff that made this happen.

And yes, I do agree fully that a wizard saying that nobody should use guns does make him a hypocrite of the worst order. I do also agree that a wizard saying everyone should have guns is no better, however, and this is why I am going on; there is a spectrum between those two points, and if the authors can't see that spectrum, well ... it's just sad, and let's leave it at that.
