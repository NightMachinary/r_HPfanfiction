A gun can be used for self-defense. Far better than a bulletproof vest. If culture suddenly is an important factor, then guns would be OK for those who consider them a central part of their culture - which is very open for interpretations, unless you like to tell people what's important in their culture and what's not.

And the fact remains that no culture in the world will outweigh the sheer risk a wand provides to a semi-decent (near idiot) wizard once they can cast Fiendfyre. They can wipe out towns with it.
