Well, the Wizarding World is totally reliant on them. To take away wands, would be worse than taking away electricity for us. Keep in mind that the Wizarding World doesn't really have scarcity. Their entire economy is set up differently and it all relies on wands. To take that away would basically mean the end of the Wizarding World and total assimilation into modern countries. A death of a society if you want to be dramatic. Now stick with me, I know these are extreme claims.

First of all, material goods are created by wizards. Everything related to material goods is made by wands, whether it be furniture, or cooking utensils or whatever. Even food is all duplicated. Getting rid of wands would very abruptly put an end to the ability of the Wizarding World to feed itself. Anything that you could possibly get or need at any muggle store would abruptly vanish. At that point, what. After centuries of being advanced, they just get tossed back to the dark ages. The Wizarding population is simply not high enough to constitute a society the way we have it. They don't have any automation without wands, and even if given out on a restricted basis, it would be extremely difficult, and probably require a government controlled economy to even have a chance of working. Capitalism would fail in such a situation.

That is the point I am trying to make. Banning wands from a post-scarcity society of an absurdly small population is tantamount to killing off the society all together, because there is no way that it can work otherwise. Imagine if electricity were restricted in the US. Restricted to businesses and government, in this day and age. People would riot. They might stay alive, but it would severely hurt even the biggest countries.

Take away guns from a society and they don't collapse.
