Explosives are actually a very good example why wands don't get a pass for being tools. Explosives are first and foremost a tool. They are used in construction and mining all over the world, sometimes even to clear old tree trunks from fields. And yet they are regulated, and no one would say that they should be easily available. Would you apply wand laws to explosives?

But even if wands would be treated as tools, that doesn't mean they should be permitted since ultimately, wands are not necessary for anyone. Muggles do fine without wands, after all, so any claim that someone needs a wand as a civilian are already proven false. They make life simpler, but is that enough to compensate for the danger their abuse causes - especially for muggles? Those wizards who need wands to deal with magical threats could still have them, but why should every wizard be allowed to walk around with wands just because they want to be able to use Magic for shit and giggles? Just so some wizards can feel powerful and important? How many people need to be killed or mind-controlled by wands until they are finally outlawed?
