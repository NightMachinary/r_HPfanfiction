And that is a seperate issue. My original argument was against your comparison of wands to guns. As the argument progressed, I found myself arguing different points, and starting from my initial argument. I am relatively neutral to the gun issue. I neither own a gun, nor do I know victims of guns. Frankly, I could really care less. I originally objected to the ways you argued your point, rather than your point itself. I feel like I got carried away, so I am sorry if I started looking like an asshole while playing devil's advocate. It was nice to talk though. You brought up a number of points I hadn't considered, and I appreciate being challenged like that.
