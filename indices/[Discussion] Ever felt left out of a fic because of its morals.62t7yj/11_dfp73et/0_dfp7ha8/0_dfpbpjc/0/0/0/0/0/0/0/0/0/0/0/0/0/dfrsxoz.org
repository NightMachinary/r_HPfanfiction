Why should they get to keep wands outside Hogwarts? Why are wands so much more important for a culture than guns?

What about warrior cultures, who consider guns and other weapons a necessity? Should they be stomped out? What about say, 50'000 people forming a new society with different ideals. Do they get the same protection as the wizards, even though they consider guns a necessity? Or is that not a real society, since it lacks the history (of oppression, torture, slavery and pretty much any human right violation you can think of) of Wizarding Britain?

All societies are equal, but some are more equal?
