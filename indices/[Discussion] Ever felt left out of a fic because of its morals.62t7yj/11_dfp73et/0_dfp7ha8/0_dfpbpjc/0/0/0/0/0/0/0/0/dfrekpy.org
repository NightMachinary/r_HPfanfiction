It is defense through offense. While that has arguable merit of its own, the fact remains that you cannot shoot a bullet out of midair in a fight(in any useful way). Culturally, I admit that it is very open to interpretation. That said, how often do you find yourself actually using your guns. And how often for their purpose. Wizards might find themselves using wands for virtually anything. Summon a sandwich, make dinner etc. It would be used dozens of times a day. Where as with a gun, what are you going to do with it? You can practice at the range, which is like practicing spells. But do you often go hunting? Do you often get assailed by intruders in your house? The point I am making is that a wand is a way to kill someone about as much as a fire is a way to burn witches. Focusing in on that one little part and assuming that the weaponized abilities are all that a wand is about is frankly somewhat ridiculous. I guess the point I am trying to make is that guns and wands are fundamentally not comparable. They are really too different to be held to the same standards. Would you apply gun laws to bombs? Would you apply gun laws to bomb ingredients? I perfectly understand that your personal view is rather pro-gun leaning, and that is fine. But my objection is with you pushing that by claiming that wands are guns and because wands aren't banned, neither should guns. They are not the same, but if you truely believe that they are, I suppose we will have to agree to disagree.

I won't try and argue with fiendfyre. I can only really argue that Wizarding Britain is probably blaise to the idea of WMDs, simply because of all the WMDs sort of pop up in canon.

I do love your work, and I am not trying to rant against your views, though it may come across that way. I simply disagree with a lot of your premises on the subject.
