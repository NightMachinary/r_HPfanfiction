Britain can easily provide for the 3000 wizards (according to JKR) within their borders, to compensate for the Services the Ministry would provide in dealing with dangerous magical creatures and other threats. Why is their culture more worth than lives? Gun control obviously doesn't give a damn about any culture that holds guns in high regard.

How many people should die each year so a tiny minority can feel important? What about rapes? Easily done and hidden with various magic. How many such crimes should be tolerated so wizards can keep wands?

If people think guns are bad because they fear getting hurt or killed with one, then why would they accept wands? Wands offer far, far more ways to hurt, kill and abuse people.
