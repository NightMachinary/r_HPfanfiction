It is a question of scale and consequences. If there were a society reliant on daily hunting for sustenance, then yes, protecting their right for weapons makes sense, because without it, they are destroyed. And there have been hunter gatherer tribes, or warrior clans who have operated like that. But you can only really make that argument for a society that will collapse if they restrict guns. Lets look at Costa Rica. No standing military, and guns are categorically banned. Yet, they are one of the most prosperous regions in their area. America will not collapse if guns are restricted, or taken away outright. Yes, it will have negative consequences for the small percentage which rely on their guns for survival. But it would not be catestrophic for the rest of the civilian populous. If you gathered 50,000 people in one area, and tried to make a society, first of all it would be pretty difficult, as all of the citizens are still under the purview of the government, and it would lack a certain legal standing. But lets roll with it anyway. The only possible way that you could make that equivalence is if that society relies on their guns day in day out to maintain their lifestyles. Maybe if the society had it so that everyone had to hunt and catch their own food, it would make sense. But otherwise not.

And honestly, you could make the same arguments of not having historical value about any society. Point to a first world country which cannot be accused of oppression, torture, slavery etc.

What I am trying to get across is that you cannot compare the Wizarding World to our world, because they have fundamentally different needs. The Wizarding World is simply too different to try to apply our laws to. The only options are allowing their autonomy, or annihilating them. There is no in between. And since they are isolationist and don't attack other countries, I would argue that they deserve to live.
