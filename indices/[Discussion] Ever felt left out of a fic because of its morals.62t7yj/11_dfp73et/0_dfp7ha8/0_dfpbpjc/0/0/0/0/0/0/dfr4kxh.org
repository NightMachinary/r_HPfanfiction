Yeah, but keep in mind the defense section. Hogwarts doesn't have an offensive magic class, they have Defense Against the Dark Arts. Wands can be used as tools, but also as weapons and shields. Almost anything a wand can do, another wand can defend against. And the only spells that we canonically know of which can't be defended against are outlawed with automatic life-sentence. Guns can be used for offense, but not quite as much for defense. You have bulletproof vests for that.

It also counts as a cultural thing. Wands are tools first and foremost. They are absolutely integral to their society, and a wand would be more important to a wizard than a cell phone to a muggle. We can use cell phones to hack people, track them down and invade their privacy, but we don't ban them just because some people use them badly.

TL;DR-I like playing devils advocate
