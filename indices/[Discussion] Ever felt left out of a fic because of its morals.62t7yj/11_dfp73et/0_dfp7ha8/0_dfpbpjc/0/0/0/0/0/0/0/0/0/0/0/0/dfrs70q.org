Why should we be destroying any society? The Wizarding World is an isolationist, hidden first world country with a lot of different requirements. And for that matter, it is probably a better society than the Muggle ones in some respects. They do police themselves, and they do outlaw all the actions you mention. Keep in mind, that using the Unforgivables is a life sentence to one of the worst prisons in the world. Azkaban is no joke, and if you are caught using an Unforgivable, it doesn't matter who you are, you are going to prison. So the deterrant is much higher than in the outside world, and the population much smaller, cutting way down on the crime rate. I would even wager that the crime rate is lower than the Muggle world because of the extreme isolationism and far steeper consequences.

In the end, it isn't about the possible abuses, it is about the consequences to the society and the population. What happens when children who don't know who they are use accidental magic to harm others. Ariana Dumbledore killed her mother, a fully grown witch. Tom Riddle was fully capable of torture and control before he had a wand. Wizards are wizards. Denying wands doesn't change that fact, it only makes the situation that much more dangerous. Would you advocate taking away their abilities? At that point you have a slippery slope argument. With that sort of reasoning, you could argue for gay-conversion therapy, and similar abuses. We already have examples of what happens when you try to control a culture for their own good, and Africa still has problems from the colonial era. And this is a first world country. It would be like colonialism except against a small country like Switzerland. I could easily see wizards going to war for that. To basically destroy and dissolve their way of life, is like a declaration of war. Forgive me, but I am not overly fond of the idea of basically destroying another country, and taking its citizens and leaving them unemployed, or coerced into working for the government.
