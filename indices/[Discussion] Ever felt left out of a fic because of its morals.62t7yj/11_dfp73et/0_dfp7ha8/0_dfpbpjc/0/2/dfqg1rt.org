Wands are tools. Wands are token of status. Wands can be weapons.\\
Not so long ago, basically everyone had a knife at all time; it was an essential tool for everyday life; it was a token that you weren't a child anymore, maybe not really an adult yet but you could work, you could use it without arming yourself.... and it could also be used as a weapon.\\
While it is not the case anymore, wands are that tool: the one that show that you can be a part of the society, the one that allow you to work as a part of said society. And you can even defend yourself with it.
