You say "when it comes to security concerns", which is true enough in our societies.

In the magical world, where the whole culture revolves around magic, wands cannot be considered only as weapons. They are, sure, but it cannot be but secondary to their cultural meaning: it wouldn't, for such a society, be illogical to let everyone have a wand but restrict the rights to own guns, not because of the level of dangerosity, but because of the potential use and meaning.\\
A gun is /only/ a weapon; a wand makes the wizard, a wand chooses a wizards and is a companion to his becoming a member of the society.\\
This, in fact, still is true today in our societies, even if not at such a scale: if someone want to kill another, he can use many tools: the best example is the machette (certainly the most efficient tool to kill someone, and the most used in the last decades). And still today, buying a gun is restricted, while everyone can go and buy a machete, because it is primarily a tool, used for work, and work means that you're a member of the society.
