That's meaningless. When it comes to security concerns, its simple: If you can't be trusted with a sword, then you can't be trusted with an axe either. And if you can be trusted with an axe, you can be trusted with a sword. Anything else is stupid and illogical.

So, if you can trust people with wands, you can trust them with guns. (Given how utterly dangerous wands are, see: Fiendfyre, their use as a tool does not make it ok to hand out kids a pocket-WMD but ban guns just because guns can't be used to summon a glass of water or replace a dishwasher.)
