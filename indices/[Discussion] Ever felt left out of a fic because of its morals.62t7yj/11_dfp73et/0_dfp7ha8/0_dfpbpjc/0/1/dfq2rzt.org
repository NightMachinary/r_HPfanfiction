  Wands are weapons.
#+end_quote

Right, however the primary function of a gun is still to shoot and potentially kill, while killing with a wand isn't its primary function. Look at the subjects they teach the students, especially in the first few years: Nothing that would make it /easy/ to actually kill someone. In the case of magic I'd say "Wands are weapons /with the right instruction/" - which they don't give out until a few years later.

Additionally the true weapon is /magic/, not the wand.

To make a very clear example: In the Fantastic Beasts movie (spoilers ahead, duh) Credence specifically develops and obscurus because he /doesn't/ have a wand and use it, instead suppressing his magic. In the end he actually kills the senator without a wand. Dumbledore's sister kills her own mother because she can't control her magic and tries not to use it out of fear.

Sure, both of these are coupled with disorders, however I think we can assume that the situation could be worse if children wouldn't have a wand and/or were actively discouraged from using magic by saying it's deadly. How would you think Harry would have reacted if this was the first thing Ollivander had said to him? I think Harry (or at least some other child - especially if they had seen some evil wizards) would be outright scared of having it with him all the time, and thus suppressing his magic.

While I am a supporter of anti-gun views I don't think "We give eleven year olds weapons" is the right way to think about a child getting a wand because some stuff is simply not as easily applicable.
