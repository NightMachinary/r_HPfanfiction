Well, subduing someone of similar or younger age is always somewhat possible if you're physically stronger. Could a normal child kill an eight-year-old by holding him down and smothering him? Possibly, I'm no expert on this. A group of two however probably wouldn't have a problem with that.

Again, it's not magic that kill in this case, but it certainly helps. A gun however is a different matter - it can only injure.

I don't see how you can't see the difference here.
