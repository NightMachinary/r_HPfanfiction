I really, strongly dislike the very end of HPMoR because of this. I actually enjoyed the story (or at least the beginning and the end), but the last few chapters I strongly disagreed with the author.

[[/spoiler][When Harry decides to use the Philosopher's Stone to give everyone automatic healing and immortality and turn Hogwarts into a giant hospital really didn't sit well with me. Yeah, I get that the author believes that humans should be immortal and death will be conquered and all that jazz, but I'm pretty sure people not dying would destroy society.]]

[[/spoiler][I'm totally down with curing diseases and cancer. And werewolves and maybe giving people new limbs from people form accidents. But stopping people from dying immediately is such a huge change for Harry to decide automatically]]
