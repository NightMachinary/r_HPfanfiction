You might enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age][The Golden Age by Arsinoe de Blassenville]], it's a very pessimistic look on the postwar HP world, that still manages to be canon-epilogue compliant, but with much darker twists behind that happy platform scene we get at the end of DH.

It's one of my top fics because of how inventive and negative it is, shows real creativity.
