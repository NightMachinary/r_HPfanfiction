I guess I just didn't take it that seriously. I think people just have different opinions. I can totally see how you could read canon a certain way and get different things from different characters, it's a part of basically all the fandoms I follow in a big way.

I guess because I do analysis and differing points of view for a living, it doesn't bother me so much, I'm very used to seeing different points of view. I just view them as self-contained AUs. If it's fiction, it doesn't bother me - real-life issues are different, of course!
