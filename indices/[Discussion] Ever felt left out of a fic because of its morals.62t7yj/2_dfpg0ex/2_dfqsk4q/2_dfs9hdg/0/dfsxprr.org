The problem with this fic is that the author put anti R/Hr rants in almost every chapter's A/N. I respect people not liking certain pairings. But going as far as that author? I have to ask the question whether there was something wrong with that person.

Then the main conflict became wizards getting pissed off at some Muggles killing their magical children. I find this plot line not convincing at all. For thousands of years, Wizards have known that many Muggles freaked out at magic, so why should they suddenly act up now? In fact, the declining religiosity in Europe all but guaranteed declining Muggle hostilities toward supernatural powers.
