  To be clear, I would definitely enjoy a fic where the plot is that our heroes have to fight evil from two sides, especially since overreaching and misused government power is something that happens in canon. Give me Voldemort on one side, a Minister who has used Voldemort as an excuse to make himself dictator on the other, and Harry and Friends in the middle and you might just write one of my favorite fanfics of all time.

Canon Umbridge came close to that, but I see what you mean. That would indeed be a very good idea.
