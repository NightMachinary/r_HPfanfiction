If you can swear magically binding oaths that easily, then any Minister/Wizengamot who'd not have had at least all Death Eaters caught in book 5 swear such oaths to not support Voldemort any more would have been incompetent or a traitor. More likely, those "Imperiused" in the first war would have been "asked" to reaffirm their claims with such an oath.

Adding the Unbreakable Vow was one of the worst mistakes in world building JKR made.
