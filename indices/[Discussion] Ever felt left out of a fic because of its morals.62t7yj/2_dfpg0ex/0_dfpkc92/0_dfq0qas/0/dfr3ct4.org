From a certain point of view, it makes sense, but it is also grossly misused by authors. If we think about traditional magical agreements, in older stories, it seems to center a lot around fairness. You get into an agreement with someone else, and you have an exchange, quid pro quo. The more magically powerful you are, the more you can bend the rules.

Rapunzel for example, had a storyline that had a couple living next to a witch. The wife was pregnant, and had cravings for herbs from the witchs garden, so the couple stole them to make a salad. The second time, the witch caught them, and forced them to agree that they could have all they wanted if the firstborn child would be given to her. Now, admittedly we have to read between the lines a bit. First of all, lets go ahead and assume that this was a magically binding agreement. Now lets examine what the parties got. The witch got a baby, and the couple got unlimited salads. Well, the wiki page indicates that the general superstition was that pregnant women with cravings could get ill or die if they didn't have what they were craving, which in a certain sense isn't all that off, given the bodies needs for vitamins and minerals. And not only was it a craving, but she was described as desperate to the point of death, so going off the beliefs that were held back then, if she didn't get it, she might have died. So now we have the exchange, a life for a life. Similarly, we can see deals with a demon, souls for power, bargaining with Death, Rumplestiltskin, etc.

Where authors fail, is that they don't make the deals fair. So, if instead the only way to force Death-Eaters into Vows like that would be to guarentee them power equal to what they would have had in Voldemort's faction, then it makes a lot more sense why the Ministry would be reluctant to give deals like that to say Lucius Malfoy. I could easily imagine him bargaining to never directly oppose the Ministry and it's workings, if they never directly oppose him and his plans. He is then free to do all the corrupt stuff he wants, as long as he doesn't touch politics.
