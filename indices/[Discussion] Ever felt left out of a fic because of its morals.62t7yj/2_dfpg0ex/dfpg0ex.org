I've stopped reading a fic when the protagonists either take part in creating or at the very least endorse straight up totalitarian solutions to defeating the death eaters.

For example, in one fic, either by Wizengamot vote or MOM edict, everyone who worked in the Ministry of Magic had to swear a magically binding oath of loyalty to the Minsitry. Yep, no way that could every be used for evil, because of course, forget the real world, all of the authority figures in Harry Potter were clearly 100% benevolent, right?

To be clear, I would definitely enjoy a fic where the plot is that our heroes have to fight evil from two sides, especially since overreaching and misused government power is something that happens in canon. Give me Voldemort on one side, a Minister who has used Voldemort as an excuse to make himself dictator on the other, and Harry and Friends in the middle and you might just write one of my favorite fanfics of all time.
