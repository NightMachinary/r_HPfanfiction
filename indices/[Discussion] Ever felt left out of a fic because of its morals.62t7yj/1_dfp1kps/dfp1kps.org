I'm not really picky when it comes to complex concepts, or straight up non-issues (for me) like the afterlife.

I nope out of a fic when it goes into heavy nationalism or racism. The first being way more likely to happen than the second. Especially fics that fall into a heavy 'murica-wank or japan-glorifying fics fall into a nationalistic tone pretty easily. I also can't read fics where I get that feeling that the author genuinely thinks that torture (or similar things) are in any way excusable.

And shit like "The Real Us" I even report. Pedophilic erotica is simply so far down the deep end, I couldn't even begin to tell you how disgusted I am with the author.
