No information can be better than false information. That is a simple fact. It doesn't matter if you quote Sun-Tzu, Machiavelli or the publicly available CIA reports. False information is your worst enemy and torture /predominantly/ produces false information.

There is no question of the amorality of torture in a kantian morality system, such as its mostly the case, for example, in Germany. But also in more utilitarian cultures like the United States, the morality of the act is put into question by the uselessness or even potentially harmful information gathered by torture, if not checked for its accuracy. Torture alone is useless.

It may be a matter of personal opinion. More accurate would be to say that it is a matter of upbringing and cultural imprinting on your morality system, intermixing with personal experience. Depending on where we set the standard, either of us can be wrong.

In the context of the HP world, we are presented with an extremely vindictive and utilitarian society. Its a society where Guantanamo times 1000 is the normal prison even for small-fry criminals. Thinking in that context would get me to the conclusion that your more utilitarian approach is probably the way the Wizarding World would see on the issue.

Still, the author doesn't live in the wizarding world. Therefore I greatly dislike reading a positive attitude towards torture. I find it amoral and despicable, being born and raised in a more kantian society that does not easily condone the suffering of one for the good of the many.
