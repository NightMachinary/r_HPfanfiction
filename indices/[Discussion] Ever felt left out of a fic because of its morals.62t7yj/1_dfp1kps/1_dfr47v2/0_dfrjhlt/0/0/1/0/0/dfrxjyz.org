My point was that many people will disagree with you but it doesnt make your opinion or their opinion wrong as this is an issue that has been cause for debate for years with no traction firmly supporting either side. And about your dystopian statement I said respect others opinions as in understand people see things differently and acknowledge that. Respect allows debate to be civil. It doesnt mean. "Oh well he thinks different from me on this shitty situation I cant disagree with him and try to fix it." I dont believe torture is evil by default. The large majority of the time it is. But there are few situations where I wouldnt lock a person up for it such as when theres desperation in a lack of time or something similar. My intentions in this were not to attack you or force a debate but I probably went about it badly.
