  Thats your opinion and if it bothers you that much then continue not reading those fics.

Yes, as I said in my initial post, I don't read them. However, your response to my initial comment made it about torture in general, not just in the realm of fanfiction.

  Torture can be a morally grey area. If you torture to get information and save lives, is it evil. Can argue either way.

Or did I read that wrong? Should it have said "Torture, *in works of fiction*, can be a morally grey area"?

  No one can say your opinion is wrong or put you down for it. Just give others the same courtesy.

*EVERYBODY* can say my opinions are wrong and tell me so. Everybody has the right to an opinion and also a right to criticize everybody else's opinions. It is even advised, for every responsible citizen of a free nation, to be skeptical and critical of their own and other's opinions. I'm not sure where you're from, but that is the very core of our democracies. I respect that you *have* an opinion and that you have a right to it, but that does not mean that I have to respect the content of that opinion in any way.

If you don't want a discussion about it just say it. That's alright. I respect that you probably aren't on [[/r/HPFanfiction]] to discuss the differences between utilitarian and kantian morals. But as a last comment on this, if you want, I would tell you that our world would be a dystopian shithole if everybody would leave everybody else to brood in their own little world of ideas and ideals.
