Its probably what I call the "Twitter syndrome". Very short bursts of the headline-summary of an opinion. It does force one to just guess as to where the other participant comes from. I may have guessed wrong in this instance. Longer explanation, showing where an argument comes from does prevent that... mostly.

I apologize if you got the feeling I wasn't civil. I try to stay polite in my arguments, though sometimes I miss the tone.
