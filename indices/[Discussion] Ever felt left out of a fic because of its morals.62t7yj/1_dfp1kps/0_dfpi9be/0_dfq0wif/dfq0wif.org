But the books also never described it as something /possibly/ used for good, like some authors when they go on about "reactivating nerve-ends" or some mental gymnastics like that. We as readers are well aware of the evil harry commits by casting it. The heroes in HP aren't perfect. Harry is often driven to a point of severe hate where his curse strikes true. But we also know that the hate necessary for it isn't his nature, but only comes up when he's driven to the very edge.

But I see what you mean.

  Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said,“You shouldn't have done that.”

  As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, “Crucio!”

  The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through theair like a drowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then,with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor.

  “I see what Bellatrix meant,” said Harry, the blood thundering through his brain, “you need to really mean it.”

  “Potter!” whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart. “Potter --- you're here! What --- ? How --- ?” She struggled to pull herself together. “Potter, that was foolish!”

McG's "that was foolish" is more directed to him attacking Amycus, than the actual curse he used. But then again, the reign of Amcyus and Alecto probably left 3/4 of the school hating their guts with a passion. It still damages the image of how we as readers should view this curse, though.
