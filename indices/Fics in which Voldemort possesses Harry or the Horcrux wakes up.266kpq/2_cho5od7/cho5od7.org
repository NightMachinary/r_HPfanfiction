I'm currently rereading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Descent-into-Darkness][Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness.]]

/Through an accident Harry and Voldemort's Horcrux begin to interact and Harry slowly begins to change. He becomes stronger & slowly grows aware of the sinister events that have perpetuated his entire life. Dark!Harry eventual LV/HP SLASH/

Harry becomes truly dark and pretty evil through out the story. It has a sequel that is abandoned though.
