It's really good.

I'm at the stage in my fiction reading timeline where I think I have literally read everything that is anywhere close to good.

I'm always looking for new stories but I feel like it's so difficult to find good fiction anymore.

The only pairing that I don't hate that I haven't read yet is Harry/Voldemort. If you have any recs, send them my way!
