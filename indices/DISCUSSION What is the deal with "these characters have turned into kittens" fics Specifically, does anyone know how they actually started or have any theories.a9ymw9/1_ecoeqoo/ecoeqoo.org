This has been a thing for ages. It has something to do with kittens being cute, the freedom to act playful/mischievous without (serious) repercussions, and the inherent helplessness of being small/weak in a big, scary world (and how a special someone might protect you from it). It's a form of wish fulfilment, where the wish is to be small and cute and loved.

At least, that's what most of them seem to me. I've read a fair few of them, and in the HP fandom they mostly revolve around the transformed character being "allowed" to act a certain way due to their changed form, which they could not do as "themselves" for reasons. Ie; Malfoy being cuddly and playful instead of a pureblood heir; Harry receiving comfort without having to be a selfless archetypal hero; etc.
