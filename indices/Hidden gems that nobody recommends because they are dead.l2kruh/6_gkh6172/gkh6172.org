Well, I still do recommend Nightmares of Futures Past, and technically it isn't dead, but it only updates about every three years, and then FFN deleted it. It's still my most reread fic. Time travel that does a good job of balancing foreknowledge vs the butterfly of doom. It has a powerful Harry, but that doesn't usually matter, because the focus is on building up his friendships again and trying to support people better this time, so him being good at combat doesn't take over the story.

The author has health problems that keep him from writing very much. He maintains that it isn't abandoned, though.
