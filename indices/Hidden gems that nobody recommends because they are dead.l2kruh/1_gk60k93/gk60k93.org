I'm assuming by dead, you mean incomplete and abandoned? Or do you mean that a main character died midway through a story?

If you meant incomplete and abandoned, I absolutely recommend: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7559806/1/][Cry Out, Curlew]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9905105/1/To-Ride-Upon-Svadilfari][To Ride Upon Svadilfari]] by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1693442/][Evil Is A Relative Term]] - linkffn(7559806; 9905105).

They are both great fics with very faithful characterizations and amazing world-buildings. They are also, unfortuantely, very much dead.
