Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus linkffn(9911469)

The writing style blows me away. It's like each word is weighed and carefully considered. Every sentence a piece of a perfect puzzle. It's indescribable how amazing it is.

Or maybe I'm just in love with the story and seeing everything through rose coloured lenses...

The author updates quite frequently, if it's on that particular story however... Though he/she did update it twice in August so here's hoping for more regularity.
