After checking my email:

linkffn(Harry Potter & the Game by Concept101) updates weekly, and I've been finding quite enjoyable.

linkffn(Divided and Entwined) also updates once a week, and is good as well (I think the author lurks her as well)

linkffn(For the Love of Magic by Noodlehammer) has a lot of interesting ideas, but Harry is a bit Gary Stuish. I'm a sucker for weird ideas though...

linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) updates every two weeks.

Lastly: linkffn(Stay Standing by Windschild8178) just updated, but it's very sporadic.

I'm a bit spoiled by the amount of regularly updating fics I'm reading right now. One of the fics I just caught up on is finishing up a 3 month hiatus too...
