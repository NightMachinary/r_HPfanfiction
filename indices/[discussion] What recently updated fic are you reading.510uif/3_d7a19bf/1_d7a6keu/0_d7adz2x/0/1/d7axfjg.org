  Harriet Potter is back for a fourth year of quietly masquerading as her pureblooded cousin in order to pursue her dream. There are those in the Wizarding World who refuse to see her fade into the background, however, and when the forces she's been ignoring conspire to bring her to the fore, it will take everything she has to see her artifice through.
