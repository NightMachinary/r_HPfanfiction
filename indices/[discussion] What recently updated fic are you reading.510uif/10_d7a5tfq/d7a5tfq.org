Grow Young With Me - You know that one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11540175/1/A-Mishap-and-an-Opportunity][A Mishap and an Opportunity]] - A time travely sequel to an independent-metamorph-Harry-and-Tonks fic; I like the Pettigrew in this one (he's not particularly "ratty" or "obviously evil" as in the others...), but it kinda overdoes it with the pranks imo...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12055716/1/Give-Them-Triumph-Now][Give Them Triumph Now]] - Another "Marauders' era" time travel fic, but with only Hermione as the "non-contemporary" character. A really good one too, by the looks of it.
