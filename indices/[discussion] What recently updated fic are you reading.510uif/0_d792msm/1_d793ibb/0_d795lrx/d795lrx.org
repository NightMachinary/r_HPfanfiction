I must say, I do like the idea of two antagonists Peggy Sues. And the story has been able to avoid the usual issues of the harem fics so far (I don't like harem fics, usually. Structure reasons).

I hope, however, that the antagonists will be competent enough. It doesn't feel like a bashfic so far, so i'm not too worried about it, but you never know...

Not a prefect fic by any mean (I don't like it's magic and magical theory that much, for instance), but I've been enjoying it immensely so far. Maybe even more than it deserves.
