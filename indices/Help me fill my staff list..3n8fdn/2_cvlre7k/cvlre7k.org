Ancient Runes- Cho / Bill / Daphne Greengrass (I think all of them were mentioned as having taken Runes. My choice would be Bill though)

History of Magic- Binns would still be there I think

Muggle Studies- Arthur Weasley (It's really the only choice)

Caretaker- Goyle or Crabbe whichever one didn't die they're basically interchangeable.

Librarian- Terry Boot? He was a Ravenclaw seems like a good fit
