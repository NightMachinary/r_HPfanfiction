Just a thing- most everyone you've named came from within a year of Harry's class, suggesting that all the older Professors died or retired soon after the Battle, despite surviving through it. There's no particular reason to replace Sinestra, Hooch, Babbling, Trelawney & Firenze, Vector or Hagrid (though Charlie is more likely to have NEWT students for CoMC, I'm sure). Madam Pince still defends the library from all intruders and Poppy Pomfrey was an able healer. Besides which, most of the main cast have more fitting careers in the wizarding world than just running Hogwarts.

I'd also question having Luna in a Head position, and unless she lost the use of her legs she probably wouldn't want a job that prevents her from roaming the world in search of fantastic creatures.

But hey, if you need names you can use these:

*History of Magic*: Andromeda Tonks

*Muggle Studies*: Arthur Weasley (with monthly guest speaker Hermione Granger to provide corrective instruction)

*Librarian*: Cho Chang

*Ancient Runes*: Padma Patil (probably a better candidate for Head of Ravenclaw, too)

Headmistress was and should be Minerva McGonagall, but if that just doesn't satisfy the need for incredibly contrived insular youth-led shenanigans, you could always use Fleur Delacour Weasley. Everyone would pay attention when she spoke and yet she would often be difficult to understand, following a long tradition of passive Headmastery.
