I guess you could sling Padma Patil in for Runes, but what I want to know is why all of the professors would be from only a couple of graduating classes or why many of these people would even be professors in the first place (what with Malfoy and Harry being so rich and all). Look at any school in the real world and you'll see a vast range of ages amongst teachers (and Hogwarts was the same, with Dumbledore being so old and Snape being Harry's parents' age), so I don't see why the staff would become staffed nearly entirely by a couple of years' worth of students.
