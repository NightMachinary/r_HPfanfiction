I would say Control by Anonymous and also I can't remember the fics name but I read a guilty pleasure fic a few weeks ago about a Harry who had a true boy who lived sibling with his parents still alive and a younger sister. The sister was killed in an accident so Harry becomes a necromancer to revive her and it was very blatant how much he spiraled. He manages to rezz her by like 4th year and then the fic ends.
