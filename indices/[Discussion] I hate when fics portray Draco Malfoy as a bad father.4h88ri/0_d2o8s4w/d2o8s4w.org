While I disagree with you on Astoria, I do agree that the Malfoys are a very close-knit family. A lot of readers just don't like to think that the bad guys are people too.

Lucius and Narcissa loved their kid, perhaps /too/ much (they spoiled the shit out of him). There's zero reason beyond "he's a Death Eater/bigot, herp derp" to make Draco an abusive, especially physically abusive, parent. Dude is positively squeamish around violence, to begin with.
