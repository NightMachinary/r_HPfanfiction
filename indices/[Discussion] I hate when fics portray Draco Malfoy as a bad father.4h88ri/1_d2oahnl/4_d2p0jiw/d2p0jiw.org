While you have a good point in your first paragraph, I don't think that Malfoy being a Death Eater precludes him from regular human emotions or reactions. He never came off as having Voldemort-levels of inhumanity. Malfoy's past evil deeds don't guarantee future ones either.

I mean, Lucius Malfoy was an unrepentant bigot who wanted to wipe out an entire group of people but he didn't go around thrashing his son.

Being evil doesn't mean you have to be every kind of evil at once. That's the sort of over-the-top thing that leads to baby-eating villains who are more boring than scary.
