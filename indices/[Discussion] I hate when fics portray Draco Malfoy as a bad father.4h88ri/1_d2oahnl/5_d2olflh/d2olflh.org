I totally agree. Even if the Malfoys avoided long prison terms due to their defection and later cooperation, they still had to answer to their numerous crimes, especially the multiple attempted murders in year 2. The Malfoys had at least pay huge restitutions to the Weasley family. They had to be crippled financially and politically.
