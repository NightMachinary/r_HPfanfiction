  'Murder' of someone who was already dying and had arranged the circumstances of his death beforehand. I'm sure that part's relevant too.

In the UK, euthanasia is not legal, and you cannot assent to it. Even if it was, Malfoy was not aware of it, so it doesn't affect determining he had the intent to commit murder.
