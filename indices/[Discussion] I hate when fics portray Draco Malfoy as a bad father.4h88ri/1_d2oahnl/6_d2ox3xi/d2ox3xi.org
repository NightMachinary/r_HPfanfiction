'Murder' of someone who was already dying and had arranged the circumstances of his death beforehand. I'm sure that part's relevant too.

And if you're going to judge people for the rest of their lives for something they did at sixteen, Dumbledore's hands are hardly squeaky clean either. Infact, I always thought the reason Dumbledore was so adamant on not punishing Draco was /because/ their situations were similar: they both got swept up in philosophies of charismatic dark lords, they both disliked muggles (albeit for different reasons) and they both desired power and glory. At least Draco always prioritized family above all, something that Dumbledore cannot claim.
