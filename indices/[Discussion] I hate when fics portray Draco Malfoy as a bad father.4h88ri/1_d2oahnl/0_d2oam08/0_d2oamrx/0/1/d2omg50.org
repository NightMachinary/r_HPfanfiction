This is blatantly NOT true. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duress_in_English_law#Criminal_law][Here are the rules for English law regarding duress]]

A couple of highlights:

About murder

- in the case of the most serious crimes such as murder, no threat to the defendant, however extreme, should excuse commission of the crime

About Gang Membership

- "A person may become associated with a sinister group of men with criminal objectives and coercive methods of ensuring that their lawless enterprises are carried out and thereby voluntarily expose himself to illegal compulsion, whether or not the group is or becomes a proscribed organisation... if a person voluntarily exposes and submits himself, as the appellant did, to illegal compulsion, he cannot rely on the duress to which he has voluntarily exposed himself as an excuse either in respect of the crimes he commits against his will or in respect of his continued but unwilling association with those capable of exercising upon him the duress which he calls in aid."

So no, Draco Malfoy would not be able to use duress as a defense under English law.
