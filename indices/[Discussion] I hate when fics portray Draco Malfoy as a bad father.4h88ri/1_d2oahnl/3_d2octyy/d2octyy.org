I wonder how he would explain to Scorpius why he did those things. The boy would find out eventually. Would Draco be able to swallow his pride and tell him that he was wrong? Or would he avoid the subject completely and forbid Scorpius from ever talking about it?

Draco has done too much in his childhood to be a good father, I think. Even if, /if/ he had a change of heart.
