And there it is, the notion that racists and murderers and /bad people/ of every stripe have no facets to their lives beyond being /bad people/. God forbid they have interests, or fall in love, or love their kids, or like pizza, or do any of the normal mundane things that us humans do.

Sorry to pull a Godwin but even Hitler had a mistress he loved and dogs he adored. Even in the universe in question it's abundantly clear that the much, much worse Lucius (and Narcissa, though she seems to have been a noncombatant) loved their kid and were not at all abusive towards him. Even the unhinged Bellatrix cared for her nephew and tried to look out for him.
