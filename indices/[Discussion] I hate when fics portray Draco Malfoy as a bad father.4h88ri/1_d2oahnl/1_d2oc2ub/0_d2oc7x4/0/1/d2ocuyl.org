You're reading more into my statement than I made. I'm sure Draco would love his children. Love isn't enough. Lucius and Narcissa loved Draco too and that didn't stop them from filling him with twisted ideas and exposing him to dangerous people. Not because they wanted to abuse Draco, but because they themselves were bad people and so didn't understand that what they were doing was harmful.
