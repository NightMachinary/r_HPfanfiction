If Draco Malfoy were tried in the Muggle world, he would be likely found guilty of three counts of attempted murder (Katie Bell, Horace Slughorn and Ron Weasley) and one count of murder (Albus Dumbledore). On top of that he would also be guilty of treason and potentially crimes against humanity.

The Muggle analogy is an enthusiastic SS Guard who attempted to murder several of his classmates and teachers and succeeded in killing one of them.

That he had a change of heart when things got dangerous for him does not really do much to indicate that he has the potential to become a good person. If you met someone like this in the Muggle world, even years after their crimes, you would steer clear of them.
