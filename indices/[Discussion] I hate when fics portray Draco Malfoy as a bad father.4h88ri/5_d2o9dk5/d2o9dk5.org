I don't see how you can conclusively say he'd be a good parent. We don't know how what he went through would affect him, and Draco's mindset isn't explored alot in the books. We only see his actions, which aren't encouraging.

There's every chance he would be a good dad, but just a good a chance that he would be a shit one. People with better childhoods than Draco have grown up to be shitty parents.

Draco's parents spoilt him nearly to death, which could affect his parenting in alot of different ways. They taught him he was more important than everyone else, which could very well lead him valuing himself over his kid, or it might have taught him that parents are supposed to treat their child like they're the king of the world. What he would do is up for debate.
