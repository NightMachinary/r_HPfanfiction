A horrible name for a child first and foremost.

Also the eighth Zodiac sign, which probably should mean something.

Theres also the animal, but I can't see any sort of positive aspect from that. A ugly, poisonous bug...

But again, its just a terrible name for a child. But what can you hope for when the father is named freakin Draco?
