Eh, personally I see nothing wrong with either name. Sirius is by far the more cringe-inducing to me (mostly for the inevitable "are you Sirius" puns). Like shit, this is a society that names people Bilius (sp?) and Slughorn. It always takes me out of the story when characters mock their names in-universe.
