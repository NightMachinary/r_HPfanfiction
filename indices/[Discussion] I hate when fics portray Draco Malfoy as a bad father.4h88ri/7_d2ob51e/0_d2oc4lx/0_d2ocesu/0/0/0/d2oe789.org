You are completely unaware of the practice of referring to people by the zodiac sign they were born under? Hence the use of "Scorpios" and not "Scorpius" or "scorpions"

Not to mention you leapt in on a joke and thoroughly ruined it, so good jorb I suppose

Also please don't assume everyone shares the irrational distaste for arachnids or other arthropods
