"Raising Scorpius to be a better man than him" is pretty much how I'd sum up how Draco'd parent Scorpius. I think redemption via decent parenting is much more in character (and interesting!) for Draco than him being portrayed as an awful father. I don't think he'd be perfect- maybe toeing around things his own father says at family dinners, or maybe being distant with regards to explaining his past mistakes- but he would try.

I think [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5760301/1/A-Better-World][this fic]] is probably one of my favorite takes on "Draco as a parent," though it... really only shows him dealing with other people's kids, haha. But it does show character growth and how much he cares for Scorpius, at the very least.
