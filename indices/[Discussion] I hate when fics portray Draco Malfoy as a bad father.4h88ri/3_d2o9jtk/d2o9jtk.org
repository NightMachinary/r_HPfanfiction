While I don't know that Draco would necessarily be a GOOD parent, I do feel he'd be an utterly devoted one, and he'd be more measured in his raising than Lucius - while I think Lucius loved Draco more than anything in the world, he got suiddenly strict if he thought Draco was going to hurt himself (e.g. in Borgin and Burke's) but otherwise indulged his every wish.

I don't think Draco would be as an indulgent a father as Lucius, but I definitely think he'd do his best to raise Scorpius to be a better man than him in every respect, and he'd do his best the whole way through to make sure that Scorpius was happy.

I think that's the thing about Draco - we don't truly see him redeemed in the story, but just as Narcissa&Lucius' redeeming features are in their devotion to family, I feel his redemption would be in raising his son to fit more into the modern world than he was himself.
