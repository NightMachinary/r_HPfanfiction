I've toyed with the idea of writing one of these ever since reading TE7's LdS. I am growing more and more tempted by the day. I love TE7 and all of his/her stories, but I often find they leave me wanting more. It's no fault of TE7, if anything it's a testimony to the writing ability on display, but this one in particular. I felt like there was a lot there that wasn't explored, even if I love the story, and think everything was set up perfectly.

I don't know, is anyone interested in a couple hundred K story on this pairing? Not sure how I'd do it yet, I have two ideas, don't know which one I'd go for, but if there's interest I might write it.

Also, TE7, if you read this, the commentary was no slight on you, I actually loved the story, and thank you for the adventure and potential inspiration.
