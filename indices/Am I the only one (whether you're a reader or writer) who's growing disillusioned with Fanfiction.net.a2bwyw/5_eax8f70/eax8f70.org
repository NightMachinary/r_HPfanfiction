I generally struggle when I want to find a story I might enjoy. Those I did enjoy were on ffn, and I'm not talking about Harry Potter fanfic specifically. And still, I have to keep reminding myself that it's only fanfic, that it's not the end of the world if Dumbledore is described as wearing horn-rimed spectacles, or if Hermione's father says fall instead of autum, or if I can't make sense of someone's actions and think that character is a Mary Sue.
