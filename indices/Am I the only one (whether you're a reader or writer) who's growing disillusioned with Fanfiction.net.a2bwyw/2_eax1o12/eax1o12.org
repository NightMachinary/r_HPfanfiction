After the plagiarist scare earlier this year, I have become really disillusioned with FFN. Seriously, it was frustrating to see the guy make so many sick accounts and to see writers being threatened by him. And it's been really frustrating in the months since to see copycats rise up to continue the asshole's work.

That being said, I still use FFN -- some of the best stories out there are on it, and a lot of people haven't cross-posted to AO3 like others have.
