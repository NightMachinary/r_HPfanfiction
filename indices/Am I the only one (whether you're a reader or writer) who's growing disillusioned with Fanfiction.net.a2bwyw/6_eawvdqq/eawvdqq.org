I'm rather disillusioned with fanfiction generally but that's only because I don't really fit. I recently deleted my Ao3 account altogether (orphaned one fic, deleted the others) because I got so few readers it wasn't worth the trouble of having an account to keep an eye on. I don't think the quality is particularly better on Ao3, it's just that there are more fics on ffn to trawl through.
