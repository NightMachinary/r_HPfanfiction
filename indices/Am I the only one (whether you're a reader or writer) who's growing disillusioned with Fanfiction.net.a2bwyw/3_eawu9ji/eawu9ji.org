Archive isn't really better. Just by filtering out the truly ridiculous shit (Death Eater pairings) already takes away roughly half of the content, there are plenty of fics below 1k/1k per chapter.

If I use a harsh filter, I'm usually left with a 1k base out of 190k, and that's not even talking about quality. Specific searches usually yield between 5 and 20 stories.
