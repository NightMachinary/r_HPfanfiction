Generally Dark Lord Potter has some great reccomendations and a somewhat lively Work By Author forum that has stories pop up weekly. (I wpuld actually check out thier re-read of the Harry Potter series. If only to recognize some of the fanon as just that, fanon. In particular wards. Everything of importance is actually charms work, but the fanon is so pervasive that's wards have been imprinted into memetic existence to the point where it's in every story and I want to pull my hair out.)

I literally almost dropped a story that was one of the few that didn't have Death Eater Pairings (I'm getting real tired of He's Hot, he's just misunderstood that covers 95% of every page on A03 for Harry Potter) just because they used wards when they should have used charms. It was only in its first paragraph.

Other than that SV and SB have reccomendation threads I keep an eye on. They generally have good standards. Not as high as DLP, but generally plenty acceptable.
