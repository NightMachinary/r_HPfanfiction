It's a become a recent pet peeve of mine. My tolerance for general fanon acceptence ( Such as Ron's terrible table manners. It happened ONCE. And in that same scene we got him saying 'Mione. ONCE. And it was because his mouth was full. Not deliberatley as a nickname) tend to wax and wane depending on the quality of the writing. If everything else is good, and it makes sense in context and isn't just thrown in there I can accept it and roll with it and let the author do his or her thing.

As for DLP. Yeah they can be asshats. I never said interact with them, but to go browse thier reccomendation/library thread, because they DO reccomend quality works, regardless of the individual(s) in question. It's why I lurk there and don't post.
