You know, /we/ have frequent "wait is this fanon?" threads just like DLP, and, hopefully, a less bullying attitude.

On the matter of wards in particular, these days, most people know it's not canonical as such, but argue that like how Arithmancy works it's just one of those things where they think the fanon is /better/ than Rowling's original idea, and they'll keep using it because they prefer it that way. We're mostly past the days where a majority are using them out of ignorance, and you'll be missing out on a lot of great fics if you drop them just because they use "wards".
