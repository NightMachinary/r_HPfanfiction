  2010. Harry is head of the Auror Department. With paperwork and endless meetings dragging him down, he longs for the day when he can handle a case on his own instead of being stuck in the office. A chance comes however when Nevile calls him to a case that will see him tested to his limit, when his past comes back to haunt him and the future is not as black and white as he'd want.
