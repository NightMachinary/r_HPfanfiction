Hmm. Throwing a few out here:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6896279/1/We-ll-All-Fall-After-The-Yule-Ball][We'll All Fall After the Yule Ball]] - charming, funny, (drunk!Katie is hilarious), lighthearted, firmly in the series timeline.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3920129/1/Sixth-Year-The-Steps-Toward-The-End][Sixth Year: The Steps Toward the End]] - canon personalities (Ron and Ginny excepted, not completely ooc but it's a stretch), rich character development, firmly in series timeline, drama but not tragedy or horror, Hogwarts-centric.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9444529/1/Vitam-Paramus][Vitam Paramus]] - post canon, Quidditch-focused, mellow, character-focused, Harry's stoicism firmly in character.
