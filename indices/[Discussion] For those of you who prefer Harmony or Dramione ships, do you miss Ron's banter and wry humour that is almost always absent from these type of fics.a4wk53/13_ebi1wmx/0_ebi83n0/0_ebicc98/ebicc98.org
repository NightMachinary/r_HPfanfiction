If the fic never has Ron (died of spattergroit or something before school starts) other people fill in the holes. If its a romance fic it usually starts in Goblet or soon after, and Ron has played his role in the development of the story.

I don't find him integral at all; Hermione would have come into Harry's compartment whether Ron was there or not, and Harry might have eventually bonded with her as they were both outcast or loners. About the only thing missing without Ron is any reason for Hermione to be assaulted by a mountain troll; or otherwise cry from being bullied by him.
