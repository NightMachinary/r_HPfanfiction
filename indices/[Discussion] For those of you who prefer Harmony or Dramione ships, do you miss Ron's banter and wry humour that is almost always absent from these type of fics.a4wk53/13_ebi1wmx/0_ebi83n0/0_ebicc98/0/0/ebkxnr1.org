I like to imagine Harry or Neville being the only "nice" boys in Gryffindor in their year, and the girls being just as horrible as the Muggles were to her; so she shyly gets her courage up and approaches one or the other... practically glomping them at the first opportunity to help.

I imagine at the latest, Harry in the Library trying to figure out who Nicholas Flamel is and Hermione see's her chance.
