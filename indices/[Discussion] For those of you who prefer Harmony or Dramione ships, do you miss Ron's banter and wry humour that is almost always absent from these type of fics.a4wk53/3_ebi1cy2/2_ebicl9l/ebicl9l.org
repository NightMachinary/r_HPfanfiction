I hate when characters have to be bashed to get other characters together. I don't like Ron much, but he doesn't have to be evil for him not to end up with Hermione; I actually think he and Lavender were a lovely couple.

I do believe Potions!Ginny was a storyline that got cut in the final draft, but I don't think she was being evil about it. She doesn't have to be a slag for Harry to end up with Hermione. I love Ginny (authorname) but eventually leaned toward H/Hr as a main ship.

Then again I'm not really a harmonian as much as Harry/Harem or Multi
