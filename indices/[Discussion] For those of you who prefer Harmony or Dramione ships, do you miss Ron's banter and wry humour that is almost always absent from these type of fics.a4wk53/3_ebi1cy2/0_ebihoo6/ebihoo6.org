The absolute worst thing is that so incredibly often some character will eventually just tell Ron something along the lines of "You wouldn't be such a bad bloke if only you could just accept that everyone around you is much better than you and completely out of your league" and the story treats them as justified for saying this, even pretends as if this was some nice way to reach out to Ron and that he is the evil one for lashing out in return.

Just WTF, do you have any idea how Ron as a character works?

That line just makes me want to punch whoever said that in the face. I don't even care what Ron did in before to "deserve" that, it's just such an incredibly cruel thing to say to someone who has already has an inferiority complex in regards to his friends and should not be considered "okay" in any kind of situation.
