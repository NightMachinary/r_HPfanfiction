I just realized that your flair indicated that your are a fanfic writer yourself, and having checked out your FFNet profile, I found you have written a Dramione too! So, before I check it out, let me ask this noob question - how, as a writer, do you tackle the issue of having a nice chap in the character of Ron and then being forced to remove him from the picture in some way in order to have Hermione end up with someone else for the purpose of the story?
