Fair warning in case you missed it: my fic is not yet complete! Wouldn't want you to dive in just to be disappointed when it ends.

My current fic is a post-war back-to-Hogwarts. It's fairly canon-compliant. Harry and Ron are doing Auror training instead of going back to school like Hermione did.

I wrote Ron as being consumed by grief for Fred, causing him to not be there for her when Hermione needed him (going to Australia to revive her parents' memories while in the midst of grieving was probably not easy). He is completely focused on his Auror training to distract himself, and by the time he is himself again, Hermione found comfort elsewhere. I could see that happening. It would be understandable.

I am rather easy-going and I am still friends with my ex-boyfriends since we broke up. Sometimes people grow apart or relationships don't work out, and that sucks but it happens. That would be a plausible reason for them to not be together anymore, too.

I've also seen fics where Ron and Lavender's relationship matures and they stay together, and Hermione then moves on.

There are plenty of reasons to not have a dramatic break-up that creates a villain. It's doable.

Bashing is the easy way out, and in my opinion it's just bad and lazy writing.
