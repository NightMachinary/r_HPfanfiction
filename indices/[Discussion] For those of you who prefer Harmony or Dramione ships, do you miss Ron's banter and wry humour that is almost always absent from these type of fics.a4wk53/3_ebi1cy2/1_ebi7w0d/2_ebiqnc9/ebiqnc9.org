  how, as a writer, do you tackle the issue of having a nice chap in the character of Ron and then being forced to remove him from the picture in some way in order to have Hermione end up with someone else for the purpose of the story?

If you want to go with canon events, give them a short romance which quickly fizzles out because they have very little other than Harry and fighting magical fascism in common. And I mean "we fucked for a weekend and then had absolutely nothing to talk about" short, not several months.

You could kill Ron off (poisoned trident in the second task, DoM Battle, poisoned mead, Hogwarts raid, Battle of Hogwarts) if you can't fit him in, but I would personally advise against that because then you have to deal with the fallout of his death.

My personal favourite is to simply pair him off with a girlfriend who keeps him occupied for most of the time. I mean, most men (myself included) would prefer to spend time with a new girlfriend over friends, at least for the first few months of a relationship (Ron did that in canon as well). So all you really have to do is make Lavender a little more forward and less cringe-worthy and Ron won't notice anything but the way his GF's tits bounce whenever she is on top (of a staircase).
