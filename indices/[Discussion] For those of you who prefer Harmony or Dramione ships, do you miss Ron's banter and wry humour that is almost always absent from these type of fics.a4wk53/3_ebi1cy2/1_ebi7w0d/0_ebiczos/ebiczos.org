  how, as a writer, do you tackle the issue of having a nice chap in the character of Ron and then being forced to remove him from the picture in some way in order to have Hermione end up with someone else for the purpose of the story?

I don't see the need to remove Ron - plenty of nice people don't get together. I usually simply have them not get together in the first place in my H/Hr stories. It's not as if they have to follow the steps of canon.
