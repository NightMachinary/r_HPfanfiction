I dislike when Ron is portrayed as some kind of cartoonish monster, but frankly, I never liked him in the books, so having him disappear and/or be replaced by someone like Neville does not bother me. When his character is well written, he can be compelling, though that has very little to do with canon Ron. I think the fact that I had a friend like Ron in school, and he did the crappy things that canon Ron does, makes it very hard for me to like him.
