I concede your point. It's just that I had the feeling that Tonks or the twins or Ginny would have more of the snarky, sarcastic kind of humour whereas Ron would be more of a genial, dad-joke material guy, somewhat like his dad. This particular trilogy reminded me of it because it has a scene where Ron teases Scorpius in a friendly, light-hearted way for ending up with Rose while the others are mercilessly ragging on him (although, not in an antagonistic way)

Anyway, what I feel can't change what canon says and so, thanks for pointing that out.
