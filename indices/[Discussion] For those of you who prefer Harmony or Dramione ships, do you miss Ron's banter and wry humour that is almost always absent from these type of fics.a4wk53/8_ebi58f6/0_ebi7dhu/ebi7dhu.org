  I dislike the thought that you need to have Ron if you want lighthearted humor or banter in a story

You misunderstand me. I'm not treating him as some sort of a clown. My point is that Ron does have a precedent of making some good jokes in canon. And this trait is generally missing in the ships I mention - either because he is transformed into a negative character or because he basically disappears for the length of the story.

Even in the trilogy I mentioned, he is more or less relegated to be a background character, but in a short scene in the last part, his good-natured humour shined through. He reminded me of why I liked Arthur Weasley so much and IMHO, none of his sons (even in canon) have that goofy, dad-joke creator vibe that he had - except probably Ron.

I have a similar problem with how Ginny's prodigious wit generally tends to disappear in fanfics, but it probably boils down to me not having read the right fics or like you mentioned, authors not being witty themselves. After all not everybody can be JKR.
