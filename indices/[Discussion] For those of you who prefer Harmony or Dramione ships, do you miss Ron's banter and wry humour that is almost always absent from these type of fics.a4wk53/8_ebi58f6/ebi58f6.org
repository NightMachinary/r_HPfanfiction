No, the less Ron the better.

Most authors aren't very witty and thus their incarnation of Ron won't be funny or witty either. They are better off just writing Ron as a best bro kind of character.

Of course talented authors for comedy exist (nonjon, Rorschachs Blot, cloneserpents), but they don't exclusively need Ron for that, as they can make anything and anyone funny. Ron doesn't add anything unique for me, besides his annoying presence... so at best I'd think: "This story could use some humor" instead of "This story needs some Ron".

I dislike the thought that you need to have Ron if you want lighthearted humor or banter in a story.
