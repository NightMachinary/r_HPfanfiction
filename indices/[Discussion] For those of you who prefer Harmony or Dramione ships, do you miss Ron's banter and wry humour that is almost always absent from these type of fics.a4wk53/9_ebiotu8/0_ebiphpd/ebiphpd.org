I'll give you the two that I found most hilarious and more or less tend to remember - one was about Percy not recognizing a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing Dobby's tea cozy and the other I think was Ron fibbing in divination class about how when Jupiter meets Saturn in the sky, it was a sign that a midget with glasses was being born!
