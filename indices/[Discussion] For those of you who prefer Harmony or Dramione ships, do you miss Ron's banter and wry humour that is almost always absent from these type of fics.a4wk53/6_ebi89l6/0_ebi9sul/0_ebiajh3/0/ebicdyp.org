Ron isn't written well enough in fanfiction - but I'm not the guy you're responding to. That's just my opinion. I think that people write their characters into these little boxes where Ron = 1-3 emotions or characteristics, 100% of the time. It's just as bad in some ways with other characters, but Ron especially they tend to write him with "the emotional range of a teaspoon."
