I meant that Ron isn't portrayed as a witty character with a good sense of humor by most authors. Even authors that like Ron mostly don't write him this way--I'm guessing because of the difficulty in writing characters who are wittily funny to other characters, rather than writing interactions like unrealistic banter that are entertaining to readers.
