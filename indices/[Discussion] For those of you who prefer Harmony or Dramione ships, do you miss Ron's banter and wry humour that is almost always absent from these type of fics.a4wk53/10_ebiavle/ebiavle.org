No. I don't really care about Ron one way or another because I find his themes and arc utterly boring. As a single child, the whole "big family" thing with countless brothers is simply unrelatable. And while I am by no means unfamiliar with jealousy and envy, directing it at friends like Ron does is a big no-no in my book. I have friends who are better looking, make way more money, drive fast cars and drown in girls, and yet I am simply happy that at least one of us has his shit sorted out.

And speaking from a writer's perspective, it is not difficult to simply use another character to fill that role. Tonks, Fleur or even a random background char like Katie Bell are well suited for that. Of course, I wouldn't exactly say that any of my stories fit the "average fic for pairing X" mould, but where would be the fun in writing that?
