There are some unwritten ones, most of which are dictated by the pairing. You can go against them, but your primary audience will not be amused. For example:

- As soon as the possibility of a second/third/fourth/... wife is mentioned, people expect Harry to take up that loophole instead of being content with the one he has (or even just one girlfriend).

- Harry/Ginny has to stick to the canon spirit and overall themes (eg Malfoy is forgiven his war crimes due to magical fairy dust, Ron and Hermione end up together, Harry is fully assimilated into the Weasley family)

- Any Tonks/Fleur/Daphne pairing is expected to overly sexualise the character while at the same time depicting them as chaste with people other than Harry. Speaking from personal experience here, if your Tonks has an "adventurous" past, you'll get reviews where she is called "slut" or similar terms.

- As soon as Harry and politics are mentioned in the same sentence, the fanon "political" plot is expected, even if it makes no sense.

- The Bellamione community thrives for the unhealthiness of that relationship and they are not interested in stories which take that away.

- Any story with Susan Bones is expected to go with some DMLE plot and basically reduce her to a plot device to get to her aunt. Her parents aren't even dead in canon (we simply know nothing about them).
