  how he often seems to be let off lightly in fics?

He doesn't just SEEM to be let off lightly, he is let off lightly. For his violations of article 23 of the Geneva convention on land warfare (subsections a,b and f), even the Allies would have summerly executed him with no second thoughts (or a full trial). And that isn't taking into account any regular crimes like treason or attempted murder.

As you might have guessed from this, I am not touching any fic with (any) Malfoy as a protagonist (unless hypothetically, it has him tried for war crimes). And consequently, I have no interest in Next-Gen because it is a severe miscarriage of justice, even canon (other than perhaps some Teddy/Hermione or Victorie/Harry time travel shenanigans).

That being said, there is absolutely no canon on either Rose or Scorpius other than their family backgrounds. The author has a blank canvas and can create anything they want (preferably with an official name change as the first act). Therefore you can't really make such blanket statements since there is no canon structure you usually build a plot on.

Personally, I'd love to read a story where Malfoy's son tries to get him and every other Death Eater thrown away for life while people who +have shit for brains in the epilouge+ chose to path of forgiveness (the trio) try to oppose them. Imagine the irony if Rose founded SPEL (Society for the Promotion of the Enforcement of the Law), trying to counteract her mother who is overseeing things as Minister.
