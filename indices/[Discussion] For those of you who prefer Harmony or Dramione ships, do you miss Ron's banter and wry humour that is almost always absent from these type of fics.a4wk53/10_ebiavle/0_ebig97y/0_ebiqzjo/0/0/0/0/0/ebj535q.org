Okay, I'm pretty confident now that I had this exact same argument because you gave this exact reply, minus probably the exact articles, and I'd probably find the comments as well if I sit down and trawl through my profile.

So, since I haven't bothered to educate myself in the intervening time as to what exactly are the key details of the Geneva conventions, care to take a moment, shine a light and show the ignorant the way? As in what I should read up on; which convention I can specifically find the articles you mention and where I should read up to find out about laws deciding the degree/kind of punishment to be meted out to violators of the conventions.
