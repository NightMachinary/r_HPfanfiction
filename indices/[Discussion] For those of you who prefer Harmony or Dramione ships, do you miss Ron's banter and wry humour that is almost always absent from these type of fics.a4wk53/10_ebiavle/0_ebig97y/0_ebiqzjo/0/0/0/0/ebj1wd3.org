  How does this affect the golden trio's kids though?

Well, one would not be named Albus SEVERUS and there would be no Scorpius since Malfoy would not be able to father children from Azkaban. And you would not have him as the antagonist or that annoying "AS and Scorpius save the world" arc.

Irrelevant, since Murder and attempted murder are treated with the regular law in the UK. The Geneva convention has no minimum age either. It was established after the second world war that carrying out an illegal order (like Malfoys "help us attack a school full of children") was still a war crime. And coercion is not a valid defence for any crimes against life or involving a criminal organisation (such as the Death Eaters).

Twist it how you want, by the law Malfoy deserved at the very least several lifetimes in prison. He might end up with twenty years after a plea-bargain and testifying against other Death Eaters, but even that makes any Malfoy in Next-Gen stories impossible. Or he might just be hanged/kissed.

Also, 23 a/b is about the ban on poisoned weapons and treachery while 23f is about the need to wear a proper uniform/insignia, otherwise one is an illegal combatant and subject to summary execution. The German soldiers caught red-handed violating 23f were quickly shot after their capture and 23f was pretty commonly used to legally deal with any resistance fighter during both World wars.
