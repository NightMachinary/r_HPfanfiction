  For his violations of article 23 of the Geneva convention on land warfare (subsections a,b and f), even the Allies would have summerly executed him with no second thoughts (or a full trial)

I seem to be having Déjà vu because I remember having a discussion with you on this very topic a long time back under a post about something else. Anyhow, the argument that I raised was that members of the Hitlerjugend were involved in some serious war crimes during the war, and yet nobody from the organization was ever convicted at the Nürnberg trials, with the exception of adult leaders like Baldur von Schirach. Although, technically Draco would rather fit the bill of a Wehrmacht soldier, there was a good chance of him being tried as underage, with most of his crimes committed while he was still a student at Hogwarts. And with Harry's benign attitude towards the Malfoys following Narcissa's deed, and legal maneuvers of treating Draco as being coerced, there's a chance that he could escape Azkaban/death. On top of that, you have canon, which indicates that he did escape a life-term.

Keep in mind I'm saying what *could* happen, not what *should* have happened.

  I have no interest in Next-Gen because it is a severe miscarriage of justice

Err..is it because Draco and his friends escaped punishment? How does this affect the golden trio's kids though?

  Therefore you can't really make such blanket statements since there is no canon structure you usually build a plot on.

I'm not saying that. My point is basically that some fanfic writers are probably trying to assuage their guilt of supporting/writing fics with a lightly punished Draco by projecting what they'd have written for Draco and Hermione on to Scorpius and Rose.
