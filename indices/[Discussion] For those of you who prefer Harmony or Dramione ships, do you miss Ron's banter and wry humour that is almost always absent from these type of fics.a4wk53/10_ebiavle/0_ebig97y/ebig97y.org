Ah, yes, Tonks is one character I totally forgot. I thought it would be a bit difficult to introduce Tonks (or for that matter, the twins) as key characters in a fic that focuses on the golden trio. But, like I have been repeatedly reminded in this post, fanfiction doesn't have rules that stories must follow (unless of course if it's canon-compliant).
