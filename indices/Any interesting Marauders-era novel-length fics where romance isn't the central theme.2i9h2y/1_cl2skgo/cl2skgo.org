It's not novel-length (more like a novelette), but BajaB's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4586362/1/Dark-Marauder][Dark Marauder]] has zero romance to it. 13k words, complete.

  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.
