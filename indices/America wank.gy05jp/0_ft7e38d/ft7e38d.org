I think it has something to do with stuff like how Hogwarts has gaps in its syllabus and you can poke quite a few holes in its claim to be a the best school in the world. People like to bash things in their fic to sound smarter- I'm probably guilty too, it's common. Like taking Dumbledore's moral greyness and having the author's favourite character 'see through him' and declare him evil, for example. Add on the fact that a lot of fic authors are American or want to build a better school than Hogwarts, and you get mary sue Ilvermorny.

Same sort of deal goes for making the foreign government more capable than the British Ministry and minimising Britain's terrorists in comparison. It's a big flex basically. It's fine for the people who like to read/write that, but I must agree I do prefer more rounded out schools which have strengths and weaknesses like Hogwarts does, it makes for a more interesting dynamic.
