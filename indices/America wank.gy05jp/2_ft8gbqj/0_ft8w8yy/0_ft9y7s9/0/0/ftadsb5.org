I partly agree.

The 11 prestigious schools tend to be the wand based European model. This is why Europe has more schools than the rest of the world.

However, i also think many Wizarding nations are a lot smaller than their counterparts. Such as South America still having the incas, Mayans and Aztecs. Thus only muggleborns born to immigrants and their descendents really need a special school.

This is especially true in Africa and India where culturally the regions are incredibly diverse. It makes sense that India wouldn't have a school as India as a nation has only existed for a century. Africa it is based on your tribes and a mentoring system.

Hell, even Italy wasn't seen as a nation until the 1900s with people being loyal to their regions rather than the country.

Thus, you have your three big European schools, russian/central Asia, South America, North America, Africa, Japan... And probably one in China, the Middle East and either south east Asia or Oceania.
