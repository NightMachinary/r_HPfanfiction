Smaller due to population. Don't forget that Britain only has between 3k-30k wizards for ~60 million people.

Very few places have over 60 million people under the same culture. France, Germany are the only similar ones in Europe. You have China (which still has hundreds of cultures, even within the general Han). When you split India up to various states, most would have far less than 60 or so million.

Lesser known could be a number of reasons. Age, population, magic focus or even standard racism within the ICW.

That's how I'm going with 11 big prestigious school that are comparable to hogwarts. It's not to say that these lesser known schools can't be older than hogwarts, or some of them bigger, it's just combined for various reasons they aren't on the list.

My headcanon also has that there used to be 2 more schools. One in Greece that was destroyed by the ottomans and one in Baghdad destroyed by the Mongols.
