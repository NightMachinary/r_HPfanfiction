Exactly, but these schools would be quite small and localized rather than a whole British school or French school. This is why I like to say the 11 are the big, centuries upon centuries old, wand wielding schools with a good reputation.

Its not saying the smaller schools are bad moreso that they are smaller, lesser known and more focused.
