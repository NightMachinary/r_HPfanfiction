My head canon is that whatever/whoever recognizes "prestigious" schools only recognizes schools based on the European model. Because I can suspend disbelief for a lot of things but Ilvermorny is a step too far. Same with the idea that there's only one "prestigious" school in Asia, Africa, South America, etc.

Basing it on the European model explains Ilvermorny's houses, too. American schools don't have "houses"; American kids think JKR invented school houses like she did Quidditch and the Sorting Hat.

So in my headcanon, Americans consider a number of American schools to be prestigious, but Europeans only recognize one. Just as Africans, Asians, etc. have their own highly respected schools (or other learning systems - maybe the reason Europe ignores them is that their magic is traditionally taught in other environments.)
