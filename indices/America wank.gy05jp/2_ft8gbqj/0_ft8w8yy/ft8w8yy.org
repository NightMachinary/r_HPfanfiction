This sounds amazing. The USA is a young country, founded nearly a century after the statute of secrecy. There is no reason to think the magical countries of North America line up with the Muggle countries. I despise the way extended canon treats the USA as "Britain, but bigger". Seriously, Pottermore, there's one magic school for all 50 states? Europe has three schools but a Los Angeles student is gonna travel 4000 kilometers to Ilvermorny? Shyeah, right.
