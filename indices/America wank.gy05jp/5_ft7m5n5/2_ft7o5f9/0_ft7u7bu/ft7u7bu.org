It's been a while since I've read the books. But it was my impression that anyone who said "Dumbledore is the greatest ever!" was speaking hyperbolically. That they weren't in a position to go "ah yes, according to the Lindsey-Nguyen hypothesis, Dumbledore's power scores were ahead of the mean by three and a half standard deviations".

The actual facts we're given are that Dumbledore defeated a European dark lord and he's respected internationally. That's not nothing! That's pretty impressive, go Dumbledore. But the world is bigger than Europe.

The author doesn't have to let it reduce the stakes if they don't want to. Just because someone stronger exists doesn't mean they have to get involved. Maybe Africa's got a policy of non-interference in European affairs. Maybe Asia's dealing with their own problems. Maybe the strongest magician in the world is a Herbologist who specializes in irrigation charms and who would be worse than useless in a battle.

Better yet, use that to raise the stakes. Voldemort is recruiting internationally! The Americans are here to assassinate Voldemort, but they're total dicks and just making everything worse! Fudge recruited some powerful ICW task force to solve this but the cure is worse than the disease!
