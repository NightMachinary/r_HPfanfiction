Thats what i like about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12296472/1/Against-My-Nature]]. Its not that any country is super strong but britian throws uber powerful battle wizards stupidly common compared to other but each has a specialty.

The General stared at him for a moment before he smirked, "Do you know... how rare it is to encounter powerful magic users?" he asked rhetorically.

Harry scoffed, "Power isn't everything," he scolded, you could be the most powerful being in the universe, but that meant jackshit if you didn't know how to use it, used it poorly, or just didn't have the ability to use it. Squibs were a fantastic example. Just as powerful as regular witches and wizards, but incapable of using their magic. His smile was thin, "There is a saying, that when you wish to deal with an English Wizard, you had best bring twelve men. Power is hard to come by in these parts of the world. In every part of the world, except England. The Americans are known for their secrecy magic, the Chinese for their healing, Japan for exorcism, India for elemental invocation, Russia for Dark Arts. England? England is known for power. So what is one more powerful wizard amongst others? A powerful young wizard is nothing more than a threat to an older powerful wizard. One to be brought to heel or destroyed. "

But to others?" the General asked, eyebrows raising pointedly as he smirked down at Harry who would have begun to feel uncomfortably hunted, if he weren't increasingly getting annoyed. "Powerful magic users are as rare as pearls in pigswine." He reached out and caught Harry's chin between his fingers, his smirk deepening at the scowl he received, "And just as desired."
