Population isn't everything. Just look at China's GDP. There's more to magical strength then the potential you're born with, we see that intelligence, creativity, and other mental factors matter.

Dumbledore is the only one who can stop Grindelwald who almost succeeded in taking over the wizarding world. He's so respected for his magical skill that he's given supreme mugwump over the ICW. If there are stronger wizards, where are they? Why are they never mentioned in canon? If Voldemort isn't the strongest wizard, where is the international interference. No country is concerned at all about a British coup?

Like it or not, canon hints towards a power imbalance between Europe/MACUSA and the rest of the world. This reflects the state of power in 1692 and to an extent still reflects power today. If there were more skilled wizards, they would be mentioned.
