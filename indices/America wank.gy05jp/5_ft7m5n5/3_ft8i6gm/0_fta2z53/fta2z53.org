Voldemort was able to match Dumbledore when Dumbledore had a supposedly unbeatable wand. For a supposedly unbeatable wand, The Elder Wand changes hands quite a lot. Dumbledore was able to beat Grindelwald because he knew him when they were teenagers and he knew about the Elder Wand. And Voldemort may know many obscure spells that Dumbledore didn't recognize and he was also not shy in using questionable spells .
