I like this metaphor. Maybe British mages are good at the magic equivalent of sprinting and no one can match Voldemort for short term power. But the mages from this other country are the magic equivalent of marathon runners so if they can survive the first hour of battle, they'll outlast all the Brits.

I want fanfics to tell me that, I love fanfics that show me that. The world is bigger than Britain, bigger than Europe, and different doesn't mean inferior.
