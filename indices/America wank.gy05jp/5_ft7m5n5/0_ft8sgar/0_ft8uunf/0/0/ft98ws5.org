Jamaicans are better at sprinting mostly because there is a long history of track and field participation there, and it remains very popular. It is also almost free, which is important for such a poor country, and some people think the training of the athletes on beaches and at high altitudes contributes as well. So basically if you wanna make that comparison, you would never to provide some logical basis for British wizards being better in some specific way. Like, maybe they have an edge on making technology work with magic (ie the magical cameras, radios we see in the books) because they had a head start in the industrial revolution. Just spitballing there.

I also find the wandless magic bit questionable. I believe you're referring to the info about the African wizarding school, since that does mention a preference for wandless magic? I find a lot of the post-book additions through Pottermore to be... reductive at best, and I don't know that it should be used as a basic for canon. Even going by that, there's no indication it makes them weaker duelists. I would like to see more varied cultures and practices in both* canon and fanon, but as it stands a lot of it tends to be a really surface level hodgepodge of real world cultures with very little respect for authenticity, history, etc.
