Idk, this is some problematic thinking. It's very close to real world justifications for Eurocentric thinking/elitism. It would be like saying, naturally England must have the most intelligent person on earth because Oxford is one of the world's oldest universities. Also, why are wands more "modern" than other methods? Because they are used in Europe? We're really not given enough detail on other wizard cultures to make that kind of distinction. The picture we're given in canon of the British wizarding world is of a very backwards, almost Victorian society.
