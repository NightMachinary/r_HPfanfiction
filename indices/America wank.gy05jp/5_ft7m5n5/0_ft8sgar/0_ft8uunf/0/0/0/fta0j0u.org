There can be a clean and logical reason for British to be top-tier wizards - simply Hogwarts. Being 1000 years old it simply is one of the oldest schools and it is far more modern than other places (I.e. African wizards that don't even use wands) and thus accumulated a lot of knowledge. Also, it's not that big a stretch to have 2 statistical outliers simply come from one country just because.
