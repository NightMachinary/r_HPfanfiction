  It's very close to real world justifications for Eurocentric thinking/elitism.

Well i'm European so i have no problem with that.

  It would be like saying, naturally England must have the most intelligent person on earth because Oxford is one of the world's oldest universities.

Magical prowess =/= intelligence. It's a learned skill. And Oxford is one of the best universities in the world.

  Also, why are wands more "modern" than other methods?
#+end_quote

Because we see wizards struggle with spellcasting without one. You don't adopt a hard to make and rather expensive tool for everyone if something else could do the job better. There is literally 0 reason for it.

  The picture we're given in canon of the British wizarding world is of a very backwards, almost Victorian society.
#+end_quote

Yes, but we're not shown other places. Vicotrian europe might be backwards by today's standards, but was definitely the forefront of progress in it's own time. Europe has been the dominant power for the last ~500 years, and then a long time before that during the Roman empire.
