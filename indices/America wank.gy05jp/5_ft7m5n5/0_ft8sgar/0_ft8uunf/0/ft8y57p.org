I was just going for the idea that sometimes smaller nations can do unusually well at things, in spite of statistics.

But you can absolutely think of that metaphor. We know, for example, that many non-Europeans still primarily do wandless magic. That might mean they're weaker at duelling, but are capable of doing very powerful rituals, which have the downside of taking a longer time to set up. Some fics point to a British ritual tradition as well, but there's no reason that one has to exist, or to be accessible any more.
