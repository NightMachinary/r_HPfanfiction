The only stories that really mention Wizarding America seem to have them as either still in the civil war, or just slave owning exiles that don't mean anything in the world stage. I think one had it mentioned decently, and it was like the last two lines of the story, with Harry seemingly transferring to a muggle school or something and finally being just another kid.
