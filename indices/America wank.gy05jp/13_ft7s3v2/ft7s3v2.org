American children are heavily indoctrinated into a slavish devotion to their country and its symbols. That results in them unable to express or even perceive a more graduated picture of it. When they start writing fanfiction the less observant ones tend to express a completely uncritical picture of their country while the more observant ones can feel a mental dissonance but without the ability to express any criticism of their home they tend to overcompensate and put additional emphasis on the symbols they have to be trained to associate with positivity, in an attempt to express a differentiation.
