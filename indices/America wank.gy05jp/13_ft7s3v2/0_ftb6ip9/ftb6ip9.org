Your first sentence used to be somewhat true. Really, though, "heavily indoctrinated into slavish devotion?" I know when I went through school (I graduated high school in 1971), the portrayal of American history in my history and civics classes was largely a positive one. It wasn't all positive, though, and I did have the nightly news showing the antiwar protests, the domestic bombings, and the riots in Watts, Chicago, Detroit, etc.

By the time my daughter was in school, though, the presentation of the US in school wasn't as thorough, nor nearly as positive. Among other reasons, Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States" had become popular to reference in what passed for history classes. I know my daughter didn't have anything like the civics classes that I had, and, to be honest, I don't remember her actually having an American History class, only a series of World History classes.

The rest of your comment, to me, merely sounds like "Americans are brainwashed to be jingoistic patriots, and don't have the capacity to handle nuance or different points of view, which shows up in their substandard writing." While there is a portion of the population that is "rah-rah-patriot" pro-US, and has been at least since they days of "My country, may she always be right, but, right or wrong, my country," we also have what has been termed the "blame America first" segment of the population.

As for the quality of fanfiction by American authors, you should keep Sturgeon's Law ("Ninety percent of everything is crap.") in mind - poor writing is not by itself a signifier of American authorship.
