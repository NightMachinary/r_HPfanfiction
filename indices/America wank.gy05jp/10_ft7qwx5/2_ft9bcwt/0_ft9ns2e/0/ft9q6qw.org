Yeah Seamus wasn't exactly the most...non-stereotypical character. And its worth remembering that there's only 1 Irish character identified, but there's hundreds of students whose nationality we don't know. I always assumed it was just a case of there being other Irish folk through the school and its never mentioned in the description of them.
