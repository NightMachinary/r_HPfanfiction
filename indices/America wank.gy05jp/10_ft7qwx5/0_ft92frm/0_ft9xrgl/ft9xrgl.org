I mean, it's an alright thing to have in the books, but a lot of the background and supplementary material is weird about it.

For example, in the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them book, there are several dragons that love in Europe, but only one native to every other continent.

And don't get me started on the Statute of Secrecy. I mean, really, the Statute was enacted everywhere in the world because of witch burnings? I'm not much of a scholar of history, but even I can tell you that that justification won't hold up outside of a small area of Europe and the United States.

And of course, if one considers Pottermore canon, then once again, Europe has several schools while other continents only get one. Also, how is it that the oldest school in the world is "coincidentally" in the UK? Wouldn't one expect the oldest school in the world to be in either China or mesoamerica? Or, failing that, the middle east?
