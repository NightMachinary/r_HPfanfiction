  I mean, really, the Statute was enacted everywhere in the world because of witch burnings? I'm not much of a scholar of history, but even I can tell you that that justification won't hold up outside of a small area of Europe and the United States.

Yeah, that one doesn't really make sense. As far as i know from my reading on south american indians most tribes, even ones living fairly recently/today but remaining in isolation, have two chief figures - a chieftain, and a shaman/wizard/healer.

Even Europe wasn't that out there in terms of witch burning, it was mostly protestant purist nuts being concerned with those. Magic/occultism was fairly popular topic, to the point where you had court wizards and quite the number of books and treatisies from the period on the topic of it.

Besides, looking at it from logical perspective - an actual HP-style wizard can escape muggles pretty easily, or could've passed himself off as a holy person with god-given abilities. Seriously, noone would be mad at a guy multiplying grain, bread and fish. Furthermore, the negative attitude towards magic of abrahamic religions stems from their definition/ideas of what constitutes magic - namely, dealing with the dead and the evil spirits. HP-style magic isn't that, and any wizard with half a brain could take the Bible and derive an argument that magical people are simply closer to God's image, thus able to create stuff from nothing and trully command the world to do their bidding:

It's in the first chapter of it, pretty easy to figure that one out
