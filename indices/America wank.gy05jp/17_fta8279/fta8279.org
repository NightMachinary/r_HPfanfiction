I think it's primarily because a lot of fanfiction is written by young Americans who have been fed the "America is number one!!" curriculum in school. At least back in my day when I was writing fanfiction as a young teen, we were only /just/ starting to learn that maybe we weren't so great. We didn't start getting into the atrocities until later in high school and by then I had moved on from fanfiction, and it wasn't until college that we were taught how much we actually suck.

I'm a teacher, but my curriculum about America is largely "this is where we live, it's very big, it's birthday is July 4th" because my students are only two, so I can't speak for what they're teaching teenagers nowadays.

Another reason could be because a lot of Americans have some form of national pride, and would want to beef it up. America also currently has a pretty negative image and it could be a subconscious effort to salvage it.
