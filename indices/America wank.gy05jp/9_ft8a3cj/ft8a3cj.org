1. Over time people have noticed many issues with Hogwarts and the surrounding wizarding government/culture that aren't addressed in canon.

2. More people in America > more fanfic authors > more authors glorifying America

3. If you're going to go through the trouble of pulling Harry out of England due the aformentioned issues, it seems kind of silly to have him go to another country with similar issues. By making alternative countries more idyllic, authors can sidestep some problems and focus on the overarching plot.
