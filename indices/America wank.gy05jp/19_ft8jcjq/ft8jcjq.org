Because it's a handy 'other place' you can write as being as you like, more a plot device that gives your characters another option, and one that is also English-speaking so characters could move there with little fuss. I've seen fics where France and Spain are used in this way too and they use translation charms.

Conversely, I've seen series set in the US where the UK is treated as the Magical Place Where Everything Is Better. Marvel and DCU fanstuff, off the top of my head.
