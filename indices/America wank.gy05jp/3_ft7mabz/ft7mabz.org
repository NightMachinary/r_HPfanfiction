This occurs in a specific genre within the fandom; as you said it happens a lot when Harry leaves England for any sort of reason. It seems to me that it's not so common these days (although maybe it is, I haven't read that genre in some times) because American Wizarding World was fleshed out in Fantastic Beasts. I remember before FBAWTFT, a lot of fics had America as a more accepting place of muggles and muggleborns, etc. That was shown to not be the case, so that plot point has died off somewhat I think.

However, I think that a lot of what you're talking about stems from that: for a long time we didn't have anything to go on, and therefore authors, who are almost certainly American in these cases, amplified the romanticized view we as Americans hold of the country. As far as putting down England, it's the same thing as why there are so many bashing fics: TBF, most writers in fanfic don't really know how to write nuance, so they find it easier to just completely villainize the elements that they don't like. It's just in this case instead of bashing a character, they're bashing an entire society.
