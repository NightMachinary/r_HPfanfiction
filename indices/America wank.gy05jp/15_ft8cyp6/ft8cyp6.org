I kind of get Harry not being famous outside Europe or England but I think they would definitely know Voldemory cause even foreign terrorists tend to be well known whereas "oh this is how he died" is less likely to be known.

The whole "american school has more subjects" does make a lot more sense in a way. Just taking a look at population there is bound to be way more students even if there are more than 1 school. Like schools tend to defund programs when they dont have enough students which would be less of a problem with more population. Of course it's likely to only be still somewhat mainstream stuff or like a subset of well established classes. For example in addition to runes class maybe there are classes on specific cultures and their magic.

Like realistically speaking some of the points in bashing do tend to have a basis in reality is all I'm saying. Not saying bashing is good it's just a thing. It's like a lot of Ron bashing being because of the whole triwizard tournament thing. Like it has a basis and jumps off the cliff.
