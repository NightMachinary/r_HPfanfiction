I've read A LOT of fanfiction and it's pretty rare that I notice something like this if I'm honest.

I dislike "randoms" (regardless of their nationality) being outright more powerful than Dumbledore and Voldemort. That's just on principle though, in my headcanon: you're either at their level or not at their level, there's nothing "above" the level of power they reside at.
