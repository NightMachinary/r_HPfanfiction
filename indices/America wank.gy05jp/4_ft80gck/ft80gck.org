I'd agree with almost every one of the replies here, but I'd also like to add that I disagree Harry wouldn't be famous worldwide. He is the *only known person in history* to have survived the Killing Curse. It'd be like someone having a Hellfire missile bounce off of them, when they were a year old.

I've added Harry attending Ilvermorny to my fic, but I certainly don't have America as a progressive or nice place. To wizards and witches, Salem witch trials are probably looked at the way that we see World War II - happened awhile ago, but still visibly imprinted on our national psyche. So the America in my story is paranoid to an extreme about muggles, and a highly militaristic society (including conscription to the aurors after school) as a result of that paranoia.

I think overseas HP fics can be really incredible if the author takes the time to do a little worldbuilding. Consider how incredible jbern's Bungle in the Jungle fics were, where Harry goes to South America/Russia. It's just too many fanfic authors get a patriotism boner and bore their readers to tears explaining how in America everyone shits rainbows and is ultra tolerant...
