I would also think that Voldemort actually did cause internationally concern because the Wizarding World was probably much more internationally connected than the Muggle world because they had access to floo power, portkeys etc. And while it never is really explained, it shouldn't have been impossible for Voldemort to find a way to use these means internationally. So it would have taken very little effort for him to spread out his terror to wherever he wanted to.
