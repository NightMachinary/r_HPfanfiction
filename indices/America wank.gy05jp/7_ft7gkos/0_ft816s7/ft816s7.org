Wizarding Britain and Hogwarts both have a lot problems. I don't see any issue with other magical countries shitting on them.

The Murica! Fuck Yeah! approach is shit too though. Honestly given the nature of America I would expect just as much bigotry in Magical America as in Britain, though maybe less talked about and obvious. Perhaps America had a Muggleborn Rights Act at some point that changed a few things and now they all pretend that bigotry is no more rather than everywhere still.

I don't see any problem with other countries pointing out the shit things about others, even with them thinking that their own country is fantastic and flawless. I don't think the author should think that though, and they shouldn't write their country as flawless either.
