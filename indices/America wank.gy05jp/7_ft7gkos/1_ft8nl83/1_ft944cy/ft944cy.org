  You're comparing teaching standards of 80's and 90's with present time. And all Hogwarts staff were old except Snape who was middle aged, means they most likely adopt new teaching standards.

Snape was NOT middle-aged. Snape was 31 when Harry entered Hogwarts and 38 when he died. He started his teaching career at the age of 21.
