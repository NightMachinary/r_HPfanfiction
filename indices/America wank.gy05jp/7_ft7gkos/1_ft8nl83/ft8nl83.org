You're comparing teaching standards of 80's and 90's with present time. And all Hogwarts staff were old except Snape who was middle aged, means they most likely adopt new teaching standards.

And also, wizarding world in every country was cut off from mundane world 2 centuries ago, so their way of living and ruling would be different from muggle world. It's like another country. You can't compare justice system in Britain with India, even Indian constitution heavily derived from British one.

And sentencing in Magical Britain is a lot quicker than in Mundane world. Barty Couch and Lestranges could've easily drag the proceedings decades if not years with their money and power in mundane world. And Sirius arrest and sentencing was a PR stunt.
