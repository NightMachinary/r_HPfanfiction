Yeah. It's seems to me that /namaskara/ is more common than /namaste/

Tamil's greeting, /vaá¹‡akkam/, is nothing like it(only word I know in Tamil too.). Funny thing, the last Indian film I watched was in Tamil. Not the greatest movie ever, but I enjoyed it. One of the musical numbers had me in stitches.
