One cannot say definitively that Wizarding America is better(there's very little canon there), but Wizarding Britain definitely has problems with corruption.

- Rubeus Hagrid is expelled from Hogwarts, but never actually put on trial for the crime of killing Myrtle(though I admit he probably should have been expelled for the acromantula /anyway/), and when events lead to the Chamber being opened again, he is taken and thrown in prison without a trial.

- Sirius Black was sentenced to life in prison without a trial, or even a proper interrogation, and when he escaped, he was sentenced to summary execution, again without a trial, only to die fighting death eaters and be declared innocent posthumously.

- Similarly, Barty Crouch Jr. was sentenced in a sham trial(for all that he was apparently guilty), with his own father presiding over the trial, when he reasonably should have recused himself. His father later faked his son's death and kept him under an imperius curse for literally over a decade. When Jr. was discovered to be alive, Minister Fudge has Jr. summarily executed, without a trial. No one is concerned about the lack of trial, just the silencing of testimony.

- A ministry employee attempts to silence Harry Potter permanently, and when Potter is forced to defend himself with magic, Fudge uses this as an opportunity to try and hang him in a kangaroo court, even going so far as to change the timing of the trial in order to attempt to try him in absentia.

And that doesn't even go into just how quickly the Ministry falls in line with Voldemort when he takes over.

There are also issues with Hogwarts education.

- None of the teachers are visibly held to account for their biases, bullying is allowed to go unpunished, or even encouraged by certain professors, Snape being one of the most egregious offenders, expressing pure loathing for a student he's literally never met before, and even sabotaging Harry academically in later books(“Oops. Another zero, Potter.” after ‘accidentally' destroying his potion).

- DADA is extremely inconsistent, being unable to keep a teacher for more than a year for decades.

- History of Magic is taught by a ghost bores everyone to death.
