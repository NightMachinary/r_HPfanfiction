Fanfiction made me really sick of and negative of Hermione, and nowadays I tend to skip fics in which she plays any sort of significant role, unless it's antagonist. But tbf, I think she was fully in the right with Marietta and the Firebolt.

So you're telling me that someone from the richest family in Britain is out to kill you, and suddenly after your broom is destroyed, the most high-end and expensive broom just finds its way to you, and no one can tell where it's from? All the while, you have a well known love for flying and someone already tried killing you on a broom just two years ago. The first thing I would do in such a situation is have it scanned for any kind of magic that there is, or ask a professor for help if I don't know how to do that. And don't tell me either canon Harry or Ron would have even considered that.

And Marietta got exactly what she deserved for treason. The DA were a bloody militia, y'all are acting like she snitched on some innocent homework group.

That being said, here are a couple of fics I enjoy about Saint Granger getting a check with reality:
