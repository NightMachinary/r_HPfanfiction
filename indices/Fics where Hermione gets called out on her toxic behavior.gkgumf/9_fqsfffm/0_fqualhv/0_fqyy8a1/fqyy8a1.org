Exactly she could have tried to tell them they should give it to McGonagall and explain why. If they didnt listen then she could do what she thought best to protect her friends. But to make calls on the behalf of your friends without even trying to communicate with them isn't a sign of a good friend. Its the kind of behavior you have the right to be mad about. Her intentions doesn't excuse her execution here. She maintained she did nothing wrong tho causing the conflict. But Hermione having the flaws isn't my problem. Its presented in a way thats dismissive of the initial conflict when its resolved. This could have been good character growth. Set up she has communication issues that can strain friendships and then have her handle a similar set up requiring communication with friends and have her handle it better and appreciate the growth. Especially if you can see its a struggle to communicate for her. It would have been compelling but by being dismissive of her flaws the potential is ruined
