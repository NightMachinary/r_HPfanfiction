The determine factor in whether it's a militia or a homework group is the intent. The DA was founded to learn defense /so that they could fight voldemort/, not so they could pass a test.

  We were all in the DA together. *It was all supposed to be about fighting You-Know-Who, wasn't it?* And this is the first chance we've had to do something real --- or was that all just words to you?"

That is the literal definition of a militia. If a bunch of guys got together to learn to shoot so that they could fight the redcoats, there would be no dispute that it was a militia. The fact that school teaches shooting as well is irrelevant. What matters is that they're doing it in anticipation of fighting the redcoats.
