The DA was about learning DADA. The trio and those who believed them, were motivated by Voldemorts return, yes, but the purpose of DA wasn't fighting Voldemort.

For the trio and those close to them, sure, but for others it was schoolwork and self defence skills. Just because some of the members would gladly act as militia, doesn't mean that the DA is a militia.

Marietta certainly didn't join a militia.
