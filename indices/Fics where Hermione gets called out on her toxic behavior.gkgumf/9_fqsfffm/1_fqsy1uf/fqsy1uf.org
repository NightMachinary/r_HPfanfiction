The DA were a student club, where they learned Fifth year material. The name Dumbledore's Army doesn't make them an actual army. They were in fact an innocent home/schoolwork group. That was the point of DA, Umbridge wasn't teaching them so they had to learn it themselves. Sure the Trio started DA because Voldemort being back meant that everyone needed to learn those things, but those things were with the exception of the Patronus, just fifth year curriculum.

Also, did Marietta even believe that Voldemort was back? Her mother worked in the ministry and it is no stretch to assume that they believed the Ministry official line. So when the Ministers second in command put pressure on her mother, why would she let her mother loose their livelihood, for the sake of the DA?
