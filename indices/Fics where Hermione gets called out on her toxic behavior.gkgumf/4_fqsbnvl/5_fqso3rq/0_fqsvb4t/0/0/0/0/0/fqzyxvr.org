Yeah, in retrospect it was something of a dick move. Fair point.

The SNEAK pimples did disappeared eventually, but left a few scars according to JK in an interview.

Cho brought a friend along whom she knew had family in a precarious position. If there is any truth that Marietta's mother was threatened with a sacking then Cho knew it, but put her needs before her friend's. I feel for Cho, I truly do, but putting a friend in a position where they have to chose between conflicting obligations is a shit thing to do. It's not like she needed Marietta in the DA, they're in the same house, maybe even share the same dorm room and classes. There's no reason she can't spend an hour or two studying defense and then going about her life.

Also to be clear I'm not calling for a witch hunt or bashing of Cho Chang. She was a 15-16 year old who lost her boyfriend via callous murder by the most powerful Dark Lord known. She had a lot of problems and grief to work through and I wholly empathize with that. It's just the actions she took at face value aren't great ones, in my opinion. Which is understandable given the circumstances.
