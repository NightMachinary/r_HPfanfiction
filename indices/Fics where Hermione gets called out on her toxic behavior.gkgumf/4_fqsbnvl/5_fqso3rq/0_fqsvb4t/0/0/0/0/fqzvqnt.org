You may be right in a way, but Hermione should have told everybody about the consequences of breaking the secrecy before (or even after) they had signed. Rather, she kept it all to herself.

You have to admit that Hermione Granger is quite brutal at times (e.g., attacking Ron with birds for snogging a pretty girl in front of her) and she is even described to be “Scary but brilliant” multiple times throughout the series.

Marietta was in the wrong for being a snitch, but /(personal opinion)/ she didn't deserve her punishment. Marietta's scars still hadn't been gone the next year, so I'm assuming them to be permanent. Having a scar that literally declares you as a Snitch on your face can have life-long consequences (after all, who would want to hire a traitor) and her future was most-likely doomed because of that one scar.

Not to even mention that Kingsley had obliviated her later, so the poor girl doesn't even know why she has been branded a Snitch.

Also, I also don't think Cho is a bad friend. Cho did have many faults, but when you look at things from her perspective, she wasn't bad. Her boyfriend had been murdered. That itself is a enormous emotional toll on a person. She joined a group that she thought might help her either defend herself or allow her to do something in Cedric's memory or might distract her from her loss. So what if she decided to bring a friend along with her for emotional support?
