I'm not seeing a page or chapter number for any of that. I've been skimming the book and have yet to see a passage that confirms something to that effect. The wiki's useful but not necessarily word of god. If you can give me something definitive that would be stellar. The closest I've found is Ch 28, page 637, where Cho mentions her mother working for the ministry and that it's hard for her, which is kind of vague (though to be fair Harry did interrupt her). It could be she or her mother was threatened (which to be honest it does kind of feel that way), it could be Marietta is a ministry shill that believes every word they say, and just wanted good girl points from an authority figure (which feels equally likely to me).

Regardless of that I don't feel that sorry for her, and don't think Hermione did anything wrong. Cho is a bad friend for pressuring a friend into a situation she knew she wouldn't be comfortable with, and Marietta's a bad person for endangering the education of everyone in the DA for the crime of wanting to defend themselves, an idiot for going along with someone as unreasonable and untrustworthy as Umbridge, and just as much a bad friend as Cho for selling out her friend.
