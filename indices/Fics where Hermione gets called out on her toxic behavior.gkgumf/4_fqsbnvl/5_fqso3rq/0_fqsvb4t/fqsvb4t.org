I don't quite think that Marietta deserved it... Wasn't it the fact that her mother's job in the ministry threatened by Umbridge or something that actually led to her telling about the DA in the first place?

I mean, it may be wrong that she told on the group, but frankly, if my parents jobs were threatened, I would have done the same...
