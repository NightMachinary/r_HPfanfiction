This! Every time Hermione is discussed someone brings up poor Marietta, like she didn't betray all her friends knowing it would lead to their expulsion or worse! The ministry was clearly immoral by that point and being part of the DA could have put a target on the students from both the ministry and the death eaters.

The whole thing was just a clever way to find anyone who snitched. but honestly they should have made an example of her: snitches get stitches and traitors get hanged drawn and quartered.

Every anti Hermione rant has this and I've even seen stories where she gets into legal trouble after the war or has to deal with guilt over it.. bleh so lame
