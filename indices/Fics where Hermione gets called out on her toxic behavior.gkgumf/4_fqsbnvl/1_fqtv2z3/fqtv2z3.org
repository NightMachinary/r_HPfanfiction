In my opinion, sometimes Hermione wasn't a good friend. She ratted out Harry to McGonagall on the broomstick, she should have talked further to Harry but she gave up after being outspoken by Ron. Harry would have listened to her if she gave an ultimatum. And don't forget fourth year, she is always trying and does manage to let Harry spill his private moments like his kiss with Cho while she didn't tell anyone about her yule ball date even Harry, she shades Fleur, knows how much Sirius means to Harry but still agrees with Molly in shading Sirius and got jealous of Harry because he was performing well in potions. And why was it wrong for Ron to date Lavender in the eyes of Hermione.. He didn't attack her over Viktor. She did over Lavender. This is not bashing but apart from third year she never got any kind of confrontation from Harry like Ron received. Ron wasn't a great friend either but Hermione wasn't one as well. And let's not forget, if she did care for Harry she would've found a way to contact him in fifth year, the smartest witch of her age
