As if Dumbledore's Army was actually part of the war. Dumbledore's Army was a student club to teach the other students. Just because it has Army in the name doesn't mean it's an actual army.

Marietta snitching makes perfect sense in the context of having to choose between a club that you dont care about and your own mothers job.

Do I think that Marietta joined Dumbledore's Army with the intention of selling them out? No, cause she literally could have done it at any time before.

Do I think that Marietta is a snake? Yes, if she was just gonna complain about Harry's teaching, she could have just left.

Do I think the punishment fits the crime? Absolutely not. If you think that permanently scarring and publicly shaming a girl who was worried for her mother's job is an appropriate punishment, then you might need to take a look at your own morals.
