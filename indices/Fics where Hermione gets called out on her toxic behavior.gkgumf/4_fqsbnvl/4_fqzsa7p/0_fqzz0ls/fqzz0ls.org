I'm not saying that DA was part of the war. But Harry, Ron and Hermione were fighting a passive war, and mistakes could have led to deaths. For example, if Umbridge had her way, they would've been carted off to azkaban or more likely, she'd arrange an 'accident' and have them kissed. This already happened to Harry before. So they were playing a high stakes game.

And I think the whole reason they made the club was to give atleast some training to the students when shit really hit the fan. Harry mentioned this when Umbridge asked him why they want practical traini g -because Voldemort's out there. Marietta could have, as a model daughter of a ministry employee, completely kept herself out of DA. But she didn't. She joined in and snitched on them.

She was worried if her mother's job would be threatened by her membership in the DA. So she could have just left. She knew very well Umbridge is a cruel woman. But she chose to betray everyone else by telling on the club.

Sometimes actions have consequences. The consequences for Harry and others would have been far greater than the consequences for her. Harry and others escaped by sheer luck alone.
