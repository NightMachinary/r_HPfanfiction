The kind of thing Hermione did to Marietta isn't considered a big deal in canon. Fred and George do worse in their pranks. And to be fair, she did snitch on them. She could have just cut contacts with the DA, but no, she had to be a tattletale.

For Hermione, Ron and Harry, they were fighting a war with Voldemort as a real threat due to his revival. I am disappointed that the consequence it brought Marietta was so small, which would be fixed by a trip to the Nurse's office. What Hermione was part of was an anti-government rebel group, so they had to take precautions.
