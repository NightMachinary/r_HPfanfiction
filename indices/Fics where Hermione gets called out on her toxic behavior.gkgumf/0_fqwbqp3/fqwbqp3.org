I hadn't really put these to thought. But I do find it interesting that where just about EVERY other character in the series, ESPECIALLY the Weasleys, gets called out or downright villified in fanon by the author going by the most extreme examples of their characters. Hermione is largely left unscathed by such things.

Looking at examples even outside of Ron. Ginny is often called a whore for the simple reason that she dated two people before Harry. Completely ignoring the fact that teenage girls dating different boys in school is so common that it is never a concern in the real world. Or that Ginny is obsessed with the Boy-Who-Lived and doesn't actually care about Harry based on the fact that she hero-worshipped him as a young pre-pubescent girl. Completely ignoring the fact that she pretty clearly grew out of that by maybe the third book.

Molly Weasley is your stereotypical overbearing mum. But fanon would have you believe that she wishes to control her children's every action even into adulthood or even control everything in regards to any of the children around her. This due to her criticisms of Bill's relationship with Fleur, Bill's job, her ready support for Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione, and how she seems to argue with Sirius about what Harry should be doing in the summer of 5th year. The thing is, is that in her heart, she just wants what she thinks is best for her kids. She's not fond of the path that her boys have chosen. She sees them as too dangerous or in the case of the twins, silly and having a high chance of failure. This is the kind of reaction most parents in the real world would have. Also, of COURSE she would be extremely keen on a relationship between Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione. Harry and Hermione are like surrogate children of hers. She knows them and she'd likely find it cute that the childhood friends wound up together, especially since she wouldn't have to guess whether or not they'd be compatible.

There are a few stories that I've read that have called Hermione out for her behavior. But nowhere near the amount of backlash that gets meted out on the Weasleys and/or Dumbledore.
