Both Ginny and Hermione hate on Fleur, for rather shallow reasons, and it's treated as if it's perfectly alright. Sets birds on Ron for kissing some other chic, treats Harry and Ron like they're irrational kids, even in HBP, and never acknowledge her faults, despite her self-proclaimed emotional maturity.

Bashing is stupid, but atleast addressing her deficiencies? That's not a sin.
