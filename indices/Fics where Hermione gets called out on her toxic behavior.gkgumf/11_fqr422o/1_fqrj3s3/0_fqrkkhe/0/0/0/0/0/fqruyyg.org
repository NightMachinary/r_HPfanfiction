I'm shocked -shocked! - that a book written for the tween market did not use the word 'rape.' Imagine that. Since you never learned how to /read/ - rather than running your fingers along a line of type - I can understand you didn't catch the author's meaning, or connect basic mythology to the text. Since you've been denied the education and haven't developed intellectual interest, I'll just step out of the convo.
