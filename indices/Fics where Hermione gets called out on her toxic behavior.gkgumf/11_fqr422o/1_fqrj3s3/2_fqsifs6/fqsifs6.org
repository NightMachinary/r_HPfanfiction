That's a pretty skewed interpretation of events, and just plain speculation at best with regards to the gang rape allegation. For one, Umbridge threatened to torture the main characters with the Cruciatus, and we have no reason to believe she wouldn't. She's shown herself to be fanatical and a sadist.

For another, Umbridge provoked the centaurs into attacking her without a single word or prompt from anyone else. All they did was ask who she was, and she spent every second she could spare insulting and threatening them. Hermione actually tried to stop her from running her mouth.

To suggest Hermione is responsible for whatever the centaurs did to Umbridge is just wrong, and shifts the blame pretty substantially. Hermione didn't knock the woman unconcious and hand her to a bunch of rapists. The worst you could say is she lead a bigot into a situation where said bigot would make an ass of herself, which she did under threat of torture. But Hermione didn't force Umbridge to insult and threaten a group of nervous and numerically superior centaurs, and she didn't force said centaurs to take offense and abduct Umbridge.
