That's just a weird expectation to put on a 11-16 year old. Hermione is a child throughout most of the series. It's not her responsibility make sure every student gets equal attention and stays engaged, it's her adult professors' responsibility to acknowledge that they have other students and get them engaged. It's what they're paid to do. It would not be a difficult thing for McGonagall to say "Let's give someone a go, Miss Granger."

I know I've certainly had teachers who purposefully call out to people who almost never raise their hands, just to see if they're paying attention.

And she's hardly what I would consider a terrible classmate. It's not like she's not a loud obnoxious class clown keeping everyone from learning.
