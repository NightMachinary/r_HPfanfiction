One of the things that really annoys me is that no one, in canon, ever takes her to task for being the first to answer any question posed from a teacher. I can't think of any specific fanfic that addresses that behavior(I've read a LOT and they tend to blend together), but generally with her constantly mugging for the attention of the professors, she is actually denying other students the professor's attention, when it's very likely that they need to engage with the class far more than Hermione ever would. Hermione would probably do well with private tutors, but she's a terrible classmate.
