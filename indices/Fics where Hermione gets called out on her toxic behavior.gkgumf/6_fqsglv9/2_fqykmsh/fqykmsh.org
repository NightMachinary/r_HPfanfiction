I can think of two fanfics that bring it up, one with a nicer Snape who talks to her about it and another where an AU Harry does.

Students like Hermione occur in every class, so it's not unreasonable to include a hand-waver. It is absolutely the teacher's responsibility not only to ensure everyone else is called on/checked in on but also to help Hermione understand and be catered for, to accomodate for social and emotional learning.
