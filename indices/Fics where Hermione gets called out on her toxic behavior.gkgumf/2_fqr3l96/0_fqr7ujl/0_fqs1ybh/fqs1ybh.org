While im tired of that in fics too I think its a problem with the source.

Most of the time when Hermione exhibits problematic behavior its excused by the narrative in some way or handwaved. She doesnt get to be wrong even when other characters do. The fics keep this up which is a shame because she gets less chance to grow as a character in canon and fanon.
