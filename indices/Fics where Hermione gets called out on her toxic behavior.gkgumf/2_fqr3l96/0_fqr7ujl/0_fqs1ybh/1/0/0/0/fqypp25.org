oh to clarify im not saying that Hermione is bad here or the teachers responded poorly.

See conflict here starts for two reasons in the case of scabbers its Hermione is dismissive of Ron's concerns with scabbers and crookshanks she doubles down on being defensive after he's presumed dead.

In the case of the fireboldt she thinks she knows whats best for them so she tells the teacher without even trying to talk to them first. Even if she is right you can't decide things for friends like that. They are young here so its childish but these aren't good behaviors for a friendship and this is what the conflict is about.

She is apologetic later but its when Hagrid is telling them off and she's really miserable. So it comes off as them being very petty and blowing up at her for making a inconsequential mistake.

In contrast when Ron and Harry have a fight in book Ron was just a dick due to his own baggage understandable baggage but still not right be a dick. He owns up and you feel bitter at him cuz you saw how miserable it made Harry but you miss his absence like Harry and you accept the applogy give him the chance to make it up as he realizes hes a dumbass.

So the framing makes you hold Ron accountable and Hermione not so much. If that makes sense

So thats a bit what im talking about not what they do but how the narrative guides you to feel things that make Hermione right and therefore doesnt need to change and so any sorta growth she goes through kinda affects you less.

Consider how different it would be perceived if she applogized to them directly exaplained her pov and they told her well we were mad at you but you applogized said you would talk things through next time and we miss you applogy accepted.
