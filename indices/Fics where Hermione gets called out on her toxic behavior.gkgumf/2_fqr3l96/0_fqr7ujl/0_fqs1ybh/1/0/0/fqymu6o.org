I do see what you're saying.

With regard to the two specific examples:

I think Hagrid's reaction is perfectly normal - he's only really heard Hermione's side and she's on the brink of a breakdown. Bearing in mind that Hagrid thinks that Aragog wouldn't hurt a fly, he then hears that she's lost her friends because her cat chased a rat in a castle that specifically allows cats, rats and owls into the school.

To be honest, I would try to settle down that situation.

With regard to Ron, I don't think it really is shown as a dick move. Harry and Hermione are understandably upset/angry with the situation (no different to Hermione and Scabbers) The reader is told that the deluminator was given to Ron because he would always want to come back.

They're human mistakes in both cases. Certainly there were friendship dispute and disagreements at my secondary school, except in this case the teenagers have magic aggravating heightened emotions (e.g., the bird scene) but an absolute dearth of supervision. Not once do we see the staff actually supervising and fine, they have prefects but the prefects don't report the situation to the heads of houses.

The situation with the firebolt could have been considerably defused if McGonagal had spent a bit more time explained 'stripping' the firebolt in another way and given an approximate time scale for when he could hear next, some mediation between Hermione and Harry, etc.
