IMO there are two actions where Hermione really dropped the ball. Malfoy and the firebolt. And the firebolt was kinda justified since, after all, she was right. Sirius Black did, in fact, send it to Harry. Going behind Harry's back was bad, but I do not think that he would have agreed to her logic there and surrendered his broom. And going to McG after Harry told her not to would have been even worse.

Now Malfoy is the big one, but she is far from the only one who failed there. You cannot give her shit there without also shitting on Ron, Lupin and some more (Ginny?). And I don't see Harry rub that in Hermione's face at Dumbledore's funeral either.

Which is honestly why Hermione is seen as Mary Sue. It is not that her actions have no consequences or everyone likes her, but her mistakes cannot be made visible due to plot demands. Too often, she is the tool for exposition.

If you want to do so at the Malfoy bit, it needs to be after Harry used Snape's spell in self-defence. And it would be hypocritical not to include Ron.

Edit: Right, Fleur. Again, she is not the only one who did wrong there. Basically all of the Weasleys made a mess there. Molly is the worst there IMO because she is supposed to become Fleur's MIL and the Tonks matchmaking bit, with Bill a close second for not doing anything. Then Arthur for not getting his family in order, Ginny since they were to become one family, Hermione (she was just a guest, no need to be rude) and Ron (teenager, pretty understandable if rude). Like with Malfoy, you cannot call Hermione out there without going after the worse offenders first. And if author's call that behaviour out, they usually include Hermione.
