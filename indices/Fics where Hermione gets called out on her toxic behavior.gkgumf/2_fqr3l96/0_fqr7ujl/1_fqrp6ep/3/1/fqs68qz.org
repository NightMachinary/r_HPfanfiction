In more than one fanfic I've seen Hermione pull this "I'm always right" attitude until it backfires on her and then she cries crocodile tears until whoever is mad at her gets over it. Then she does the same shit again. And again. And again. And again...

Maybe this is why she doesn't have many close female friends. This tactic would /not/ fly.
