These examples display one of the main issues I have with Hermione: her arrogance.

She always thinks that she is better than everyone else, always thinks that because she is booksmart she knows better than everyone else. The Firebolt, Draco, Crookshanks with Scabbers, all instances where she dismisses the ideas of her best friends because she thinks she knows better. Regardless of whether she is right or not, she still dismisses the ideas of her best friends, even after years of friendship.
