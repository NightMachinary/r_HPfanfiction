The first transfiguration is wood to steel. Even the simple animals they make in year 3 are a hundred times more complex than an entire car or even a plane (all nerves, various cell types and their internal makeup, blood and so on).

Worst case, turn a few twigs into metal bars and build yourself a crude cage. That is entirely possible with a bit of tape and the first transfiguration they learn.

As for controlling a cat, is Hermione supposed to close the door to Ron's dorm? Because that is a very simple way to keep Crookshanks out.
