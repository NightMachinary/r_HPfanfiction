Yeah cats eat rats, Ron should have protected Scabbers better.

But also Hermione has some responsibility to control her cat.

The first transfiguration they learn is actually specifically matchstick to needle in canon. The idea that you learn to turn anything to anything with more or less the same spell is a fanon thing.

Even though I do think it makes more sense than teaching 10,000,000 highly specific spells to turn each stupid useless thing into each other stupid useless thing. When the hell are you gonna need to turn a beetle into a button or a matchstick into a needle?
