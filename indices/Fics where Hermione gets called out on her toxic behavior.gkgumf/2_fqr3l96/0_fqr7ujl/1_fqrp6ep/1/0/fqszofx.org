But didn't Ron say that his rat was killed only to find it alive again?

Also, given that Ron did not put his unsanctioned pet in a cage (wood to metal is the first they learn in transfiguration if he lacks the funds), he clearly did not overly care. I mean, you put your children in special car seats to protect them because another driver might hit you, even if you are sure about your own abilities.
