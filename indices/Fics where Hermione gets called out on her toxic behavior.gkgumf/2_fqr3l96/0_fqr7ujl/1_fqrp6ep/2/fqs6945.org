What I never really liked of Hermione, is how she dismisses Luna for believing in (imaginary) creatures, I mean, I could understand that from a pure blood, with dragons, unicorns, centaurs, etc. always being real. But for a muggleborn? Who probably considered those creatures to be imaginary before and then being proved to be real?

Well, that and the whole potions book argument in book 6.
