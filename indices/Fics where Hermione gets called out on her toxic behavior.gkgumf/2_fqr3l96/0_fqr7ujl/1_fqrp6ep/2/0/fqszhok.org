Luna is a crazy conspiracy crack. I quite like her caring nature and she was there for Harry after Sirius, but the Quibbler is basically "5G towers cause corona, lizards run the government and secret Nazi moonbase". And Luna buys that wholeheartedly. I think that IRL, such a person would be unbearable.

No objection on the potion book.
