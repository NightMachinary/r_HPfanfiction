Hm, I suppose it has been a while before I read them; mostly I remember that Ron struggled with tact and - when calm - Hermione makes comments indicating that she probably wouldn't have a rabbit repeat.

. I had put the canary incident in the wrong year (though I do think this says a lot about giving teenagers weapons).

Different teenagers react differently and I would argue the threat of Voldemort (or the time turner) puts the them into a different position regarding underlying stress and space for learning than your run of the mill teenager.

I absolutely remember teenagers getting into fights at my school and I remember that some of them were far less mature than others.

It's not that I'm underestimating teenagers, research shows that fundamentally teenagers do not have the same decision making and reasoning skills - however grown up they appear. Especially in the moment.

Nevertheless, yes - many 13 year olds would avoid a lecture when someone's pet had died. I would put a decent bet on Hermione thinking that it was comforting - when she is stressed, that's the sort of information she seeks out. Though I would allow that maybe she simply skipped past that to fact checking.

In either example, it suggests that Hermione struggles to take the perspective of another character, but I don't think she's a fundamentally bad person. The rabbit situation was tactless at best, but disturbing? I do think that - in real world terms - the staff had a responsibility to help her develop these skills and de-escalate situations.

From my perspective, just because someone should have a certain understanding and application of their understanding by fixed ages, doesn't mean they do - nor does it mean they are fundamentally 'disturbing'.

I also disagree with the hate Ron gets, btw.

For clarification, I should probably add that my speciality is challenging behaviour so it would be inappropriate for me to write-off children and young people. I'm used far higher levels of behaviour than shown in HP and have seen many successes. So I have a particular bee in my bonnet about it.
