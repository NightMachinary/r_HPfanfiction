It's not just with Ron that she shows a disturbing level of callousness when it comes to animals, though. In the same books, she acts the very same way about Lavender's pet rabbit just because she doesn't like Trelawney. And I think you are underestimating teenagers too much. Most thirteen year olds definitely have the tact to not start lecturing you about how you are a dumbass for believing in Divination when they find out your rabbit died.

And no, she absolutely hadn't caught up by 6th year. Ron gets so much hate for getting jealous during the Yule Ball, where he was only fourteen, when Hermione got so jealous at seventeen that she physically assaulted Ron.
