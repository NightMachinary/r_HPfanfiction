I think it's important to remember just how young they are in PoA. Even if teenagers seem mature, they fundamentally lack the same risk assessment and decision making skills seen in adults.

Yes, Hermione makes some mistakes and is insensitive, but the whole situation is fraught with stress. Hermione isn't saying these things because she's cruel; in all instances, Ron reacts angrily (because he is upset and stressed) and Hermione is responding in a high state of stress herself.

She consistently does act in ways that suggest she has regret, but the interaction between Ron and Hermione means that things quickly go downhill.

It all suggests to me that Hermione is too stressed out and perhaps a bit spotty in her decisions. It's important to keep in mind that <s>for the sake of plot</s> some adult approved time turners with an impossible workload for anyone, let alone the developing brain of a teenager. Hermione is consistently portrayed as on the verge of a breakdown throughout the book.

I would think in those circumstances she would have struggled more than usual to calming think about other people's view points, and potentially didn't know how to repair the situation afterwards.

It's implied that Hermione struggled to make friends prior to Hogwarts and, as writing in more detail by another poster, was potentially socially immature at that age. I think 'severely lacking empathy' is perhaps more pejorative than need be. In the 6th and 7th books it does seems she's caught up a bit.

It seems to me that she very much cares about her friends, but struggles to see things from other people's perspectives. She's also a very black and white thinker with regards to rules in her first year (beyond the age that children typically would be), so I could well imagine that her thought process was that scabbers had lived in the castle with the many other cats in the school.

Really, a staff member should have been supervising to step in to mediate the situation.

I'm not saying that it's all great, but I think fucked up is a bit far; if there wasn't any teenaged tension and they all got along just fine, I think it would have made for some flat characters.
