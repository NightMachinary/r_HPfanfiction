Let's not forget that originally Hermione wanted to buy an owl, but then she bought Crookshank, AFTER he attacked Scabbers in the pet store.

Then she kept bringing Crookshanks up to the boys Dorm, where he went after Scabbers again, and justified it by 'You shouldn't let Scabbers run around' or something like that. Because apparently a students pet can't be safe in the dorm-room where there are supposed to be no cats.

Hermione's belief that 'cats hunting rats' justifies everything would have made sense if Ron had bought a pet rat AFTER she bought a cat, but she willingly bought someone who had already attempted to attack her friends pet rat in the store. It's her responsibility to keep he pet away from other pets at this point.
