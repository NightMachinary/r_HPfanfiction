How about not even bothering to pretend to care about her cat killing one of her best friends' pet? She admitted herself that it was in Crookshanks' nature to go after Scabbers, and all the proof pointed to just that happening. But instead of taking responsibility, she points out how old the rat was, like throwing Ron's poverty at his face is supposed to justify his rat's death. It's really fucked up, and shows a severe lack of empathy.
