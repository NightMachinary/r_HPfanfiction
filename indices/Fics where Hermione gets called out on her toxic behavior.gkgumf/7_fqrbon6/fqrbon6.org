In Defense of Cho Chang, an essay/vignette style fic from Cho's POV that addresses the Marietta thing without bashing. Not sure she really faces consequences, but it is a great take.

Highly recommend checking out the rest of these In Defense Of essays too, especially the one about Pansy. Probably my favorite things to come out of the fanfic community.
