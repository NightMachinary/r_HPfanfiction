  Any fics where Hermione gets called out for scarring Marietta

Remember, Ron was gleeful at how vicious Hermione acted and Harry was impressed by that jinx and told Cho that it was a "brilliant idea". The fanon perception of it being a horrible attack is not shared by anyone other that Cho.

Now I want to write something where the rest of the DA (other than Cho) can't decide between congratulating Hermione for a job well done or complaining that the boils were not enough.
