One thing about OCs is something I think a lot of authors don't get:

/The audience doesn't give a shit./

There is no attachment to Rane from my side and the side of many other readers I would assume. When Sirius says that he can't and he shouldn't and whatever else he whines, its a really hollow thing to read. Simply because /we don't know why/. And on the other side, when they tell each other their feelings - its the same thing. Its hollow. Why should I care? I don't root for Rane.

OCs have to be built up. The reader has to have some sort of emotional attachment to them. We /want/ to root for them. But we know /nothing/ about Rane and never get to know anything about her, except that for some reason half of her fell out of the Lord of the Rings universe... whats that about, btw?

But anyway. I think the writing is really solid. Some kinks here and there, some unfitting words and sentences, but good overall. Its just the character design is off - or maybe not even the design, maybe you have a fully built character in mind, but, at the very least, the presentation is not working. That would be my critique and feedback to you.
