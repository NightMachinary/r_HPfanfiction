I think truthfully the people who read this will be looking for some smut; and that's what they will get and they'll be quite happy with it. Reading as a writer, It's generally clean and quite polished in the technical sense but there isn't much of a story arc, the OC isn't really explained, and (this is the biggest peeve for me) a quick shag turns into true love far too quickly for my liking.

As a Sirius fan my own headcanon of him as a difficult, complex, tricksy, damaged man often gets in the way of my enjoyment of stories about him and it did here. I admit I found your characterisation of him rather undefined and two-dimensional. But I'm not your target audience so I'm not who you have to please and I'm sure your readers will like it. You've already picked up several favourites in a day, so you must be doing something right.
