*/A Werewolf and a Veela Walk Into a Pub/* linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11279476/1/A-Werewolf-and-a-Veela-Walk-Into-a-Pub]]) Harry is bitten when trying to protect Hermione from a transformed Remus. Harry/Hermione

*/The Beast Within/* linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9527368/1/The-Beast-Within]]) In this one, Harry is bitten by Greyback on Halloween 1981 (Just after Voldemort is defeated). He is raised by Remus. There is some angst (especially once Ginny, his friend and the girl he took a liking to learned about his condition and Hermione figuring it out and trying to get proof of it by giving him pieces of silver.) but it's a good read. Harry/Ginny

There was a third one I would have recommended but I can't find the link. (Nor do I remember the name.) It was basically Harry being bitten by Remus that night in PoA and Ginny overheard him telling that fact to Dumbledore and Ginny decide to become an Animagus for him. It's a very fluffy fic from what I remember but it's a good read. I just wish I could find it...
