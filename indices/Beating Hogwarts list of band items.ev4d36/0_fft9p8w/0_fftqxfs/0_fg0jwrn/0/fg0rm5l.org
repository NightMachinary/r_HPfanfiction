The Harry Potter kids books /used/ to be fanon. Once they were sold commercially, they became evidence.

If it was any other person who was well to-do (and had someone actually looking out for their best interests), they would have that whole enterprise squashed like a bug. This is one of my beefs with Dumbledore. He could have squashed it. Whether it was illegal or not. He scooped up Harry for his protection, he should have looked out for his interests too. Putting aside the whether the Potter "fortune" exists or not, all it would take is one payment for a lawyer and the settlements and payouts would continue paying for the lawyer.

There's a few examples where Fudge had to explain the situation to the Prime Minister. Like it was vitally important to do so. That points towards the muggle government either being in charge of the magical government, or Fudge is scared that the Muggle Government would say "Fuck this!" and send in the soldiers to conquer it.
