I'm confused by your assertion that the “boy who lived” books exist, and your assertion that magical law is equivalent to muggle law. I could also post my viewpoint on the “Dumbledore is eeeviiiil” mindset and why I think it's wrong, but I've done that several times already this week with little results to show for so I won't bother.

On Fudge: he is a politician and bureaucrat. If the rules say he has to notify the Prime Minister of certain developments, he's going to do it. Its less about who's in charge and more about working together to maintain the SOS. Fear of Muggles and their technology is not, nor ever has been, a motivation for any character in HP canon. Whether that is arrogance, ignorance, or a justifiable opinion is a topic of great debate in this fandom, but I digress.

The meetings do not point to Fudge being afraid of a Muggle invasion - they point to the opposite. JKR describes how the PM is frustrated that no one told him about the secret magical world, and Fudge then asks “Are you going to tell anyone?” Which he decides he is not. This heavily implies that the PM is the ONLY PERSON in Muggle government aware of the magical world.
