Because if they didn't, butthurt muggleborns would be flocking out of the magical world in droves and complaining- SOS be damned. That's human nature. Spurned people would rather watch the world burn. And no government would allow a secondary government like that to arbitrarily operate like that. Because that's what the magical "world" is, a secondary government.

I disagree with this heavily on so many fronts. I don't care what canon says. When you have a bunch of muggleborn children between the ages of 11-17/18 randomly "disappearing" off the system for ten months a year and not getting any education? Nor paying taxes? No death notice? That's a pattern like no other. Someone has to know, at the very least to mark down "they are accounted for, see person X in department Y for any followups".

Those fics that have the Queen show up are exactly how I picture things.
