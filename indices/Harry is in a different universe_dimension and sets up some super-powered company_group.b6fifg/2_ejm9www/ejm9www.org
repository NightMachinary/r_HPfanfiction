That reminds me of A Third Path to the Future by Vimesenthusiast linkffn(9443327). The story is ultra long and has been posting for more than half a decade now. I lost interest a long time ago due to the author's verbose nature and long chapters that progress the plot by too little, but if the subject matter is to your liking, you can give this one a shot.

I think The Swallow and the Dragon by Flameraiser linkffn(12343855) should count too. It's a Harry in the Witcher verse tale and those are pretty rare.

I'm drawing a blank after that. There are plenty of crossovers where Harry joins another local faction, such as the Avengers in the MCU, but I can't think of any more that would fit your request.
