When I've thought Cyberpunk I've never really though 'high tech' as such.

Instead I just imagine a world where automated systems are important and dominate society and where the kind of manipulation of technical systems that was possible in the 80s, back when phone systems were hackable by whistling certain notes and computer viruses spread through diskettes. The era of the BBS.

The time period of Harry Potter fits better for such an element than today's era. The characters don't fit this though. I can't imagine Snape, for example, fiddling with phones or being on a BBS. That requires some kind of thirst for companionship or group belonging. Similarly, all the teachers are authority figures and the students themselves are too young.
