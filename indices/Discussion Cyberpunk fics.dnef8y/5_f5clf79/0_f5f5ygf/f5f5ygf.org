One aspect of Cyberpunk that might fit well in the HP universe if one chose to explore it is all the body modification. Implants, guns for arms, hacking things by literally plugging yourself into them, etc, could be spells as tattoos, runic spells on piercings, "absorbing" a horcrux to have some simulacrum of an AI inhabiting you, etc. Wormtail is all like "fuck this hand, I'ma get me a magic one" so people who are really into that sort of Dark Arts shit could have ghost hands and Moody-eye style body modification out the bum.

I've been working on a Witcher crossover where Geralt spent some time in the Cyberpunk universe and he eventually takes on some magical body modification when he gets trapped in the HP world. It makes sense in my head since Witchers are basically a medieval form of super soldier who use mutagenic potions in a similar way, so implants wouldn't really bother him, and magically tattooing something stronger than the Quen sign to his body seems perfectly reasonable.
