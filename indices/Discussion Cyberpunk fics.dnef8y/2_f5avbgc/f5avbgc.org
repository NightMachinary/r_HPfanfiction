It really would be interesting to see the conflict between traditional magic users and those who embrace technology. I think there would be a lot of older wizards who try and cling to the old ways of doing things, and I could see it being an arguement that Molly and Arthur often have; she's a firm traditionalist while he's open to the idea of using technology, and their children would fall somewhere between their opinions.
