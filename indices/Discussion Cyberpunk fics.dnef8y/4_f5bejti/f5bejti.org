What comes to mind (which is less cyberpunk and more tech based) is the kind of magic you see in the Irregular at Magic Highschool.

You've got the old school wizards and witches: wands and potions and runes. Then the new generation with magic on C.A.D.s and every spell centering around specific forms of tech.
