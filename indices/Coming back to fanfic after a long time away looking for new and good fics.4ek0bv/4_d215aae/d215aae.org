These stories are listed in the order of their completion date:

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167), was just finished yesterday. It's a bloody good story, and one of my top 5 already. After Voldemort's fall, the Ministry kept sucking up to pureblood extremists. Harry was angry, very angry, and he was not alone.

*Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650): Harry's horcrux offered him a deal, resulting in a far more powerful and ruthless Harry. But Voldemort was not his only enemy.

*Not From Others*, linkffn(11419408): the best year 7 Hogwarts story by far, written by fellow redditor [[/u/FloreatCastellum]].

*The Arithmancer*, linkffn(10070079): highly popular canon-rehash story with a somewhat different Hermione. Year 1-4. *Lady Archimedes*, linkffn(11463030) covers year 5 and above.

*One Hundred and Sixty Nine*, linkffn(8581093): great Hermione time-travel to Marauder Era fic.

*Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005): the real war began after Voldemort's fall, written by fellow redditor [[/u/Starfox5]].
