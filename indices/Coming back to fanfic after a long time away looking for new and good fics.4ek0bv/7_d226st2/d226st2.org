linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty) - it's sorta like /Delenda Est/, but way better.

linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool) - super clever and often-funny fic.

linkffn(War Paint) - crazy stuff that somehow works.

linkffn(The Changeling) - /brilliant/ Slytherin!Ginny fic.

linkffn(Shadow Walks) - pretty good Harmony, without any bashing.

linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation) - hard to describe fully, but the writing style is superior.
