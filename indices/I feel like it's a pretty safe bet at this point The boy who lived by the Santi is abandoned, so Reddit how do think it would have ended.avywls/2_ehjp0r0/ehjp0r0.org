One bit of speculation I've read is that that fumbled curse Calypso accidentally took for Harry early on had rendered her barren (which is why her father had cancelled some betrothals etc., even before they became a couple); and that Harry would set out to cure that and end up delving too deeply into Dark magic.

Sounds kind of misogynistic, now that I write it out---as if Calypso's value is in her ability to bear children---but who knows?
