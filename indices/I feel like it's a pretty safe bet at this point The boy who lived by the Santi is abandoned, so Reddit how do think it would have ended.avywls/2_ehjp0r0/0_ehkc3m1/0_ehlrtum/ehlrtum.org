Yes, we all know the facts of life.

Author's (hypothetical) choice to write the story around that is still the author's choice and something we can criticise. For that matter, this was a speculation I read years ago in a venue I no longer remember, so it probably says as much about the speculator (and about me, for remembering and repeating it) as about the author. What it says, I don't know.
