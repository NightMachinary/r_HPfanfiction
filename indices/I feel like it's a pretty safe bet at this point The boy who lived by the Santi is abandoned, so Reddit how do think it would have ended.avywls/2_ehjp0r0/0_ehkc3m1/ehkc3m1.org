Yes, evolutionarily speaking, a woman's primary value is in her ability to bear children. Biology is misogynistic, which is why that reality is reflected in societal values and norms. Men are less valuable and are more expendable precisely because of these reasons, so biology is also misandric. There's an evolutionary reason for sexual dimorphism and for the expression of different roles for the sexes within society.

That aside, I see no reason what's wrong with the goal of restoring your wife's fertility.
