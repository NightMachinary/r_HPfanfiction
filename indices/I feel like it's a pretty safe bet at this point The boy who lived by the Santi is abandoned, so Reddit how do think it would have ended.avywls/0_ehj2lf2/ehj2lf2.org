I would guess based on the summary that he winds up going dark, but mostly to impress/fit in with Calypso. Story was showing some signs of that. Seems unlikely that he would've joined Voldie or anything, but there was definitely potential there for him to do some messed up things (especially if Calypso was coerced, harmed, or forced him into it).
