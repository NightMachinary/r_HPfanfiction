Yeah, he was definitely leaning toward dark toward the end so I don't see that being an impossibility. I can't really see him joining Voldie tbh he loves his brother/family far too much to do that but him being a third faction wouldn't have seemed so unlikely considering he might have been shunned away if his parents found about his wealth of dark arts knowledge.
