The story is listed as Adventure, not Drama or Tragedy or something like that, so I think in the end Harry was going to be a dark wizard, not a *Dark* wizard. Also because I prefer it that way - very few fics end with a happy Potter family.

The problem of secrecy with his parents and Nathan's suspicions about him would develop to very serious levels as Harry learns more and more dark magic, gets more involved with Calypso, and becomes more closed mouthed. There would be some pivotal point where he realizes that he has crossed a line, or that he's about to, and he sort of rethinks what he's willing to do. He realizes that his family wasn't entirely wrong to be concerned, even if they are a bit ignorant and biased.

I would expect at least one good scene where Harry (possibly with Calypso, /maybe/ even Krum but maybe not) barges in to save the day, leaving everyone gaping at his sheer magical prowess. Not before he's 17 at the least though. All this hyping up his prodigal skills has to pay off beyond academic achievement.

I don't see him actually straight up dueling Voldemort to win, not sure how that'll really be dealt with. I also have no idea what the details of his future with Calypso would be. I actually kind of hoped that in the end she'd be villain and Harry has to turn on her to save someone or something. I doubt that's truly where that was going though. Maybe it was going to be a bit of the reverse - Calypso joins fully with Harry and they deal with her father.

I think Harry's descent into the Dark Side and his redemption would be the main conflict and climax of the story, with Voldemort mostly being dealt with off screen just like the rest of the canon plot has been so far. I expect Harry would play a pivotal role, but a different role. Maybe he's the one who hunts down the remaining horcruxes and gets his hands awfully dirty dealing with Death Eaters along the way. If he has to deal with evil Calypso that would be something that his parents would probably sympathize with, traitorous close friends and all that, even if they know he shouldn't have gotten involved with her at all.

In the end the Potters are a happy family and Harry has some complicated and mixed feelings about Durmstrang. Nathan goes on to play professional quidditch and Harry gets something of an apprenticeship with Dumbledore.

Edit: I just found out there's 5 more chapters on DLP. Predictions may be subject to change.
