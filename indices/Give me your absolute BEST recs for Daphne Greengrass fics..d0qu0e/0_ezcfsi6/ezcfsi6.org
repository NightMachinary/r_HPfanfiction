Man I cannot find the one I'm looking for, if anyone can help out. It's set 3rd year. I *think* Harry and Daphne meet when they try and brood at the same tree by the lake. It's actually rather sweet with Harry being a nervous dork. They have a picnic that a hungry Padfoot crashes in the hopes of sandwiches, then Sirius realizes it's Harry, on a date, and the big dog trolls the couple.
