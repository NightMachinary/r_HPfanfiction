I write out an outline of what I want done, and then I try to connect point A to point B.

This usually turns into a dozen extra things that I need to account for if this story is going to make any damn sense at all. Rinse and repeat for point B to point C, C to D, D to E, and so on.

I mostly keep it in my head, and it keeps mutating. Fine by me, gives me something to dwell on during my day job.
