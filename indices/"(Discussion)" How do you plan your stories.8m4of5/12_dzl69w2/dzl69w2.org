I think it depends on the story type. Mysteries or Political fics should probably be thoroughly planned out. You want the readers to see the crucial details from the beginning of the story. I'm writing a comedy right now. I have a tone that I'm sticking with, and a few scenes that I really want to work towards making happen, but I don't quite know what I'm doing with Quirrel, even though he's the ostensible 1st year antagonist. That said, my tone really invites readers to accept the improbable so I have a little more leeway with that regard.
