I've come to the conclusion I will abandon my Fanfiction unless I write my whole story before posting it. I end up getting caught up with the beginning and end while completely neglecting the middle. Or, I write myself into a hole.

Instead, I've decided to write my 18 chapter fanfiction first, and once the rough draft is done, get some beta readers to go over it, and rewrite whole sections of it.

Once I am satisfied, I will post it chapter by chapter, using each week to polish up the upcoming chapter as well as start on book two.

Since March I've written 8 out of 18 chapters and starting on the 9th. If I continue this pace, I shall be done by the end of the year. :D
