I'm just busy writing my first multichapter story. I've generated a document and added all the planned chapters. For each chapter, I've created a table containing a brief description of each planned scene for this chapter.

For each plotline, I've inserted the needed scenes to the table in the corresponding chapter, and then I started to write. At this time, at least 80% of the plot was planned out in the tables of the chapters. I do not necessarily write in chronological order. If I'm not satisfied with a specific scene, I skip to another chapter, and come back later when I have a better idea for the scene.

Every time I have a new idea, I add the needed scenes to the tables of the corresponding chapters. I won't post the story, if it's not at least 3/4 completed, completed means ready for beta reading. Until then, I've proofread all the chapters at least 10 times myself.
