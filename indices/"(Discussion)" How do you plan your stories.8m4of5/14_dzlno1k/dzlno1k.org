I only start to write a story (past a prologue/prompt) when I have the ending in mind. I make notes about the plot and background, usually keeping them at the end of my current chapter docs, and add small notes about specific scenes as I think of them or - more often - as the need for them becomes apparent during writing. So, I usually have a rough roadmap, but I'm very flexible while I write the actual story, and the farther in the future, the less detailed my planning is.
