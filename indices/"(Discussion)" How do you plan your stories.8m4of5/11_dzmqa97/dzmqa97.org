Ideas and bunnies run around in my head for awhile, and eventually something will make enough noise that I'll write it down. Actually write it. I can't go from brain to computer. Somethings gotta be on paper first. Some bits are just an outline format, then maybe a generalized paragraph...THEN I'll try and get things together in Bibisco.
