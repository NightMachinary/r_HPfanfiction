First, the story has to come about for a reason. The main idea, whether it's a new take on a divergence point or whatever, that gives you a starting point where you can try to figure out what the changes are further down the line.

Or, if your idea is just a specific interaction between characters, I just write down every idea that comes to mind. Even if I'm starting first year and the idea is for something that happens in the third year, I write it down, because that might slightly influence how I want to get there.
