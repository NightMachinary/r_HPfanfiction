I definitely make sure I have my ending planned. The events, the location, where the characters are personally and in relation to others- the more the better.

I also make sure I have at least three events or important moments plotted out- not necessarily a climax. But certain points that I want in the story, that will effect the characters.

Having these planned out keeps me on track, and also something to work towards. It breaks a large story down into smaller, more manageable parts so I don't feel overwhelmed. Having the ending planned just remind me where I want the story to end at, so I don't write myself into corners and helps with pacing.

Aside from that, it really depends on the story how much further I plan. One fic I have, happens alongside the main one, so I need to have my timelines down- lots of notes on that one. Another story is essentially a continuation from one point that has very little to match up with, so I just have a few main points plotted out and am just filling in the story to get to those points.
