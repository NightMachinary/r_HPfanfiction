  Oh, hold on, he was a squib! Just enough magic to become a ghost.

Er... sorry, but squibs don't have "a little" magic. Rowling has made it extremely clear that they are not magic at all in any way, shape, or form. They're indistinguishable from Muggles at face value; they just carry an inactive copy of the magic gene that they /may/ pass on to their descendance.

I mean, that soynds like a pretty neat story otherwise, I don't mean to come across as mean, but just... "Squibs are /kinda/ magical" is an unnervingly common misconception. So go forth and Magic-Squib no more. As you were!
