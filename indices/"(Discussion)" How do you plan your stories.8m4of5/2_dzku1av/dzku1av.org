Seat of the pants right here. I get an idea for a story, usually with the major beats--beginning, middle and end--in place in my mind and then I have at it. I'm trying to be better at writing a sort of outline and notes, but that's kind of hit and miss.

For example, I have a story where Ginny has to sort of re-home a ghost. I knew there was a ghost and that she was going to be successful, but other than that, I didn't know anything until I started writing. Turns out the ghost was a young British Revolutionary War soldier who fell in love with an American girl and ended up haunting her and her descendants until the last one died. What was a wizard doing in the military? Oh, hold on, he was a squib! Just enough magic to become a ghost. The girl he loved was thoroughly Muggle and was never able to see him as a ghost. Ginny is in Boston at a conference and buys Harry a gift--the item that the solider was tied to and so is stuck with helping him move on. Many hijinks ensue.

I did not know any of that before I started. When I start a new chapter, I'll make a few notes for what I want to achieve in that chapter and sometimes those are met and sometimes things veer off into another direction. It's always a voyage of discovery!
