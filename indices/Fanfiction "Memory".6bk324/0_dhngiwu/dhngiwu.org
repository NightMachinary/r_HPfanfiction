That's ~ 800 words per chapter, which is way too short. 800 words are slightly more than an A4 page. You should aim for at least 2000 per chapter with 4k being the better option. Short chapters make the story feel rushed and lacking details.

Describe the surroundings in more detail (the dig site, the lab). Not only does it increase your word count but it adds so much to the story because the reader can imagine things better if he has directions. A lab can be clinically white and brightly illuminated. Or a dark room on the sixth floor of a run down university building. You should tell the reader how you imagine things.
