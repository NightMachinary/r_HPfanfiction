Resistance of Azkaban definitely fits your description; about 20 years have passed since Voldemort won, he heads a surprisingly competent government that has successfully brainwashed the next generation, and Harry leads a resistance from the nigh impregnable fortress of Azkaban (if that's not a kickass premise then I don't know what is).
