linkffn(Simple and Clean) is probably one of my favorites. Ummm there's another one that's kind of similar where Hermione leaves with Ron during Deathly Hallows and they end up losing the war, Harry spends years and years alone, and then Hermione and Ron's kid ends up finding Harry and they storm Hogwarts with a huge international team to win the war. I can't remember the name right now but I'll try and find it for you when I get home

Edit: also linkffn(Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia) has one of my favorite Voldemort won the war setups. That's not even remotely the simple and clean I meant let's try it again
