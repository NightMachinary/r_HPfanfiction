By “all of Harry's school years”, do you mean when he was in muggle school? There's a Slytherin!Hermione/Slytherin!Harry with that premise, but I can't remember the title. I know it's a pretty popular fic and comes up a lot when people ask for recommendations for Slytherin!Hermione.

Edit: linkffn(8375078) is the fic I mentioned above.
