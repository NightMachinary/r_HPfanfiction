OMG, thank you! Circural reasoning is something that I read long, long time ago when it was still fairly young wip fic but years ago I lost track of it alongside many more works when my old (slider!) phone broke down. Damn going back to it feels amazing, almost don't mind that I have flu now, at least have time to read ;)
