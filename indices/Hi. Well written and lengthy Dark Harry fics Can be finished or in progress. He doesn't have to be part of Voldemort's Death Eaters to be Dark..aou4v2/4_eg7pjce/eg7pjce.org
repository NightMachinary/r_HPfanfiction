If you want a good one, read "The Black Bunny" by Windseeker2305 on ffn. It's not complete and is a Tomarry/Harrymort fic. But boy does Harry go scary quite a bit in this fic. He straight up kills Tonks and Shacklebolt and goes ballistic on Verla slavers. There are also light hearted bits and mpreg in this.
