It's a very intense AU trope from what I gather - Wikipedia has a page on it if you want an explainer (rather than exposing yourself straight to it). [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omegaverse]]

It's very R rated with usually a lot of sex, sometimes of dubious consent or rape. These things are absolutely not my cup of tea, but it is becoming increasingly popular - it started in fandom and seems to be seeping into actual, published fiction now too.
