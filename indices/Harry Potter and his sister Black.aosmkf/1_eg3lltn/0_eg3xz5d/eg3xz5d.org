The question is what would change and if it is worth writing.

If you just want to turn it into a "here comes the most overpowered and noble House of Black, prepare your anus", there is arguably little reason to write it because that has been done to death (unless you can come up with a unique twist).

If you want to have them grow up together, you have to rewrite most of the series because the butterfly effect is a bitch and walls of exposition are horrible.

I think the best thing would be them meeting either during the fourth or fifth year if you want the more traditional "Blacked" way to write her or a sixth/seventh year encounter where you can have her reasonably powerful (Durmstrang Education, private tutoring organised by the mother) and impact the plot directly without having to worry about the Order, Dumbledore and the Ministry sticking their nose into things. After all, an unholy amount of bloody vengence flys better during a civil war than when the good guys are still bound by laws because the government isn't completly evil yet.
