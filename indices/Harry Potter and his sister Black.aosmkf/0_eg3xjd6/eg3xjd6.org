There are a few stories where that happens through adoption (Sirius adopts Harry's friends for some reason, making them Black siblings.

The best example of this is "The silent World of Cassandra Evans", a cracky OP FemHarry story which starts out dark and badly written but ends up being fluffly comedy after chapter 8 (including random Taylor Swift dance scenes and Anime references which don't even disturb the reading flow because it is pure comedy and not Japan wank or author inserts).
