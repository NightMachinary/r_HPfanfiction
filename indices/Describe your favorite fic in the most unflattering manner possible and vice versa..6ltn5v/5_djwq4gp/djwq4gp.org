linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time by joe6991):

A confusing tale about an alcoholic, overpowered, antihero-wannabe, Harry-Dresden-copycat time traveler who uses his knowledge of the future to trick girls into sleeping with him and break into ancient, nonsensical, fairy-tale-knockoff magical realms just to defeat an equally overpowered, stereo-typically-evil dark lord no matter the collateral damage to everyone he comes in contact with and the innocent bystanders within a 100 mile radius.
