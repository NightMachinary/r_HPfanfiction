  Daphne moves in with Harry and spends at least 300,000 words moping in her bedroom while Harry & co. spend another 325,000 words doing mind-numbingly boring bullshit. Seriously I have no idea what happens in this fic and I've read every word of it. It's just so traumatically tedious I've utterly deleted it from my mind.

  edit: there's a whole 100,000 words i can't account for. This fic might be a Euclid class memory device.
