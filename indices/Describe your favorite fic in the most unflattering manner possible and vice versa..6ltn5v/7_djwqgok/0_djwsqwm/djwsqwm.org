  Potentially immortal wizard and all around wise old man can't figure out how depression works so he accidentally time travels to the future where he reminds us that Firefly was cancelled and there's no way for it to return. The magical world is just shoehorned all over the firefly universe where canon randomly shifts between the movie and the tv series while conveniently ignoring certain established facts about both Firefly and HP universes. Also he plays psychologist to a troubled girl over 100 years younger than he is then starts a relationship with her almost immediately after she's cured enough.
