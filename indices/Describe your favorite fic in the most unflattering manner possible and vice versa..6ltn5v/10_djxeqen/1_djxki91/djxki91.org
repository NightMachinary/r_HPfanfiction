I gave up partway through book 2. I can't pinpoint one particular reason, but it was a combination of the older generation being ineffective despite being in power(okay in book one, not so much in two), yet another high level threat having to be stopped by children, people in love hating each other initially(it was done better than most, but this trope still gets on my nerves), and killing off Mordin Solus in book 1.

Really liked some other parts though, especially the house elves. Each character also felt unique and interesting, and age appropriate.
