Wow. Good Job on the Merging. You actually managed to make me completely hate one of my favorite stories just from that short summary.

As For the Price of Being Noble...I think Dumbledore actually used the term "overabundance of love" or something similar in one of the first few chapters; as if love was somehow quantifiable and Harry is just so amazing that he has more of it than anyone else.

I wish there were some Veela Bond stories that just turn the whole trope in its head. Harry and Fleur falling in love but then someone saves Fleur's life and now she's bonded to some random guy while Harry and Fleur want to kill themselves. ( I mean this has to happen sometimes right? What happens if a middle-aged married veela gets her life saved by a 10 year old?)

I know there's that short story with Gabby that kind of did something similar but i'd like a novel length story about it.
