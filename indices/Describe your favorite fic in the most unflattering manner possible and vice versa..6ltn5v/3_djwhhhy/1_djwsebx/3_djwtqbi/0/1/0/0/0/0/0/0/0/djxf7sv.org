I'm not dictating anything as I have no power over anyone. I am just saying, as a species humanity usually likes quality. We like to watch good movies and good TV shows, so why do people enjoy reading bad stories? They really shouldn't. I am more at a loss on why there are people who enjoy this type of story if they are accustomed to the English language. Conversely, if they are a young child, 10 years old or so, then I will be a bit less judgemental.
