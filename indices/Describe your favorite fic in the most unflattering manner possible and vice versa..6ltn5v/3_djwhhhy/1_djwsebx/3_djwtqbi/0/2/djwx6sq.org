As crude as it may sound, I'll reply with “1/10, would get wet again”.

It's not a secret that “50 Shades of Grey” is terribad; nonetheless it is good at the one thing people tend to reach for it for (you know, what with being an /erotic/ novel), and so people continue to do it. I personally don't get it since it repulses me too much to arouse me, but I guess to some people it's less of a problem.
