Well, from what I'd heard, it is good at making the reader ... erm, let' just say “aroused”. That said, I have little doubt that as an erotic /novel/, it is of little worth because it's not very good as a book, just good at making those who can get into it get off.

So “good at achieving the desired effect despite not having much technical merit” is how I will sum it up from my perspective. And really, what more would a casual reader need?
