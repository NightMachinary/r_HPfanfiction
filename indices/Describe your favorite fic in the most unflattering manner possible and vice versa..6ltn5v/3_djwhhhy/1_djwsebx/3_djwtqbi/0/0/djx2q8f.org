So is at least 90% of all fanfiction. Harry Crow is the second HP fanfiction story I ever read, after the then-incomplete HPMoR. I enjoyed it while I read it, but my tastes have changed in the last few years.

Does it have its flaws? Absolutely yes. However, if that story (or some other story that's widely reviled here) is what gets someone hooked on reading HP fanfiction, then I think that's not bad. If it grows the fandom, and starts someone on a path where they might eventually enjoy some of the widely acclaimed stories here, I can't get /too/ upset about that.
