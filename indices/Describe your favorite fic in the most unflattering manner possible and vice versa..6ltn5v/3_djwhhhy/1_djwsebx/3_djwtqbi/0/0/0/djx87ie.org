Ok. Eragon was a book that got me into reading fantasy when I was younger. It's not a well-written book and I am thankful that it introduced me to my favorite genre, but I am not going to say I still like it because it's not up to my standards these days. Saying you like something means that you still, at the present, would enjoy reading it again.

On the other hand, if the person said they used to like it or liked it, then that would make sense as it specifies that they enjoyed it in the past and now recognize that the story is a complete shit show.
