Well, this is describing it as unflattering as possible, and clearly based on reaction everyone aware of it considers it to be at best incest-adjacent. And much as it's played for laughs, Remus literally says "You are raping me right now." At the very least there was no informed consent the first night they encountered each other. Though Remus certainly doesn't get points even with consent for sleeping with a member of the group who made his daughter an orphan. (I love ABC too, but this is fun :). And we both missed on the obvious "robbing people of all their Earthly possessions is wrong, even from assholes")
