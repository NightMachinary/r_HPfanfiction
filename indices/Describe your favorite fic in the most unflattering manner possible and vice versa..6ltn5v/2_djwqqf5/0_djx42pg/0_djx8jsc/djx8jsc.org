I don't know where you stopped in the series, but I read all the way through. Let me tell you, it does not get any better.

There was a lot to enjoy in the series. I especially liked the train and the secret behind how it worked. But the "plucky" protagonist made the story impossible to enjoy. Making the same bad choices time and again. There was a time when she was challenged to a duel in school and she starts to reflect on how she keeps getting into trouble with this sort of thing. I get my hopes up and think she is learning from her mistakes. Nope.
