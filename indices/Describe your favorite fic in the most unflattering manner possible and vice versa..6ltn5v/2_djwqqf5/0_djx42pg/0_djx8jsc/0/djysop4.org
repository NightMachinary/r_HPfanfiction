This was my problem with canon as well. Harry runs in time and time again without thought. Does he learn in OOTP after having his ass handed to him by Voldemort? Nope. Does he learn in HPB when Dumbledore warns him about all of this? Nope, he still runs after Snape and still gets his ass kicked and was almost killed by several Death Eaters because of his recklessness.

Well, does he learn in DH when the Dark Lord is finally stepping up his game? Nope, once again, he doesn't think things through, he fights a battle that gets everyone killed, runs into a forest on the whim that he has to die to save the Wizarding World (despite not killing the last Horcrux to make sure the job is fully done with his death). It's all reliant on many chances and luck, Voldemort lost due to sheer incompetence, how was he ever considered more powerful and more cunning than Grindelwald?

Alright, c'mon, he must have learned by Cursed Child? He got to being Head of The Aurors somehow. *Nope, think again, buddy. He's still the same Hot Head who only shows maturity for a singular second, and that's when he could have actually saved his parents from being murdered.*
