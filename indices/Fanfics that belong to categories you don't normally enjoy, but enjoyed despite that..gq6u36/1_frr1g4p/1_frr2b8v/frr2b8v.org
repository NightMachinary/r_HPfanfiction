Heh. I've actually read /Amalgum: Lockhart's Folly/ and enjoyed that one a number of times. If you want something in a similar vein(though unfortunately abandoned, looks like), there's /Magical Me/ by Publicola.

I've also already read Faery Heroes, and while I generally don't care for ships in general, Harry/Hermione/Luna is one of my favorites.
