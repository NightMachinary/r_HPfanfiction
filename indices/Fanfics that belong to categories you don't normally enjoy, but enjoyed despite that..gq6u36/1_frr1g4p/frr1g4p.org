1. Drarry fic. Not a fan of the couple, but this is so well written and stays true to the animosity between the characters while developing a believable story that I find myself rereading it every few months.

2.Harry/Hermione/Luna fic where they're sent back in time to prevent the war from unfolding as negatively as it did. I don't care for trio fics, but this really surprised me. It's lighthearted and doesn't take itself too seriously (almost crack at times), but is very well plotted and satisfying to read.

1. The FF description says it better than i could. Harry as Lockhart is such an absurd concept but the writing is fantastic and now I can never see the character the same way. Strongly recommend this one.
