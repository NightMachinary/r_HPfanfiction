I'm so glad you mentioned that. When I first started to read fanon!Dobby I was really confused at his lack of English ability, because I had only remembered him using 'sir' excessively. I had to reread his sections of CoS to make sure my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. After rereading CoS, I was like: "okay he's not perfect with English, but canon!Dobby is way better at English than fanfic authors give him credit for."
