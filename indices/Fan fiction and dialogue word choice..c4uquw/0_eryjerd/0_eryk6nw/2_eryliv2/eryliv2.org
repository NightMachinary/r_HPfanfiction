It also seems that the usage of "will be [verb]ing" is slightly different, and slightly more common, in the Elvish dialect compared to Wizard English (which, of course, isn't /quite/ Muggle English either, though the differences are more subtle). But it's not universal in the way some authors apply it; it's just a construction that they use more readily and more naturally than us humans.
