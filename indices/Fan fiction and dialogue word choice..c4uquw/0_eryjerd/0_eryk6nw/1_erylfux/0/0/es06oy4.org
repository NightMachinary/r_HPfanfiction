BTW, could you recommend some of these? I know only about:

- [[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/index/][Makers of Fine Wands since 382 BC]] , and
- linkao3(Bloodstone by Northumbrian) ... lovely but a one-shot, which is obviously just tool for explaining contemporary stories
- one more about some Ollivander's ancestor in Greece?

But that's it. I am still hoping for that Harry Potter x Golden Ass crossover.
