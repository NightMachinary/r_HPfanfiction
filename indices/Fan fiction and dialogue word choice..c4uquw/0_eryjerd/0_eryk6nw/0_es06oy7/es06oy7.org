And even first person isn't totally alien to them, though it varies depending on the elf. The three elves we get to know have different ways of speaking.

Kreacher always speaks in third person, and very seldom uses second person; he'll refer to both himself and the person he is talking to in third person. But his grammar is good.

Dobby MOSTLY speaks in third person but will occasionally say "I," or "me/my, " and he's far more likely than Kreacher to say "you." His grammar is less perfect than Kreacher's, but it's mostly because he always uses third person verbs, like "you is" or "you doesn't." He also sometimes, but not always, says "'tis" instead of "it is."

Winky actually says "I" quite often... She uses third person a lot less than the other two, but like Dobby she always uses third person verbs, like "I is" or more often "I is being." A unique quirk of Winky is that she inserts a lot of "-ing" words in her speech... "Winky is being," "you is saying," and so on. Weirdly enough, lots of fanfic authors give this quirk to ALL the elves, but in canon only Winky says it.

Say what you will about JKR's writing, but she's good at giving her characters their own style of speaking.
