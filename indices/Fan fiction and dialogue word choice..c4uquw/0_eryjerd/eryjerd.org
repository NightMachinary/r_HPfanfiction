In one of my fics, I cowardly sent Hagrid to France just to avoid writing his dialogue.

My pet peeve is house elf-speak. Not every elf speaks like Dobby, and even Dobby himself has better grammar than many authors think. And Kreacher is actually rather outspoken:

  “Kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in Master's house,” said the elf, then muttered very fast, “Mistress would never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries it's been in the family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not let Master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it---”
