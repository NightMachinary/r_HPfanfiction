This could go two ways:

1. “magical research paper” oneshot on this topic: basically what you have written here, slightly embellished and elaborated upon. If you want something longer, than

2. you need real story with a hero [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][going from A to B]]. This is just [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/dudley-has-a-witch-as-a-daughter.html][a tiny funny idea]], not a plot. And even if you try this, write it short, don't plan a novel.

Consider this joke:

#+begin_quote
  A man once asked Mozart how to write a symphony. Mozart told him to study at the conservatory for six or eight years, then apprentice with a composer for four or five more years, then begin writing a few sonatas, pieces for string quartets, piano concertos, etc. and in another four or five years he would be ready to try a full symphony. The man said, “But Mozart, didn't you write a symphony at age eight?” Mozart replied, “Yes, but I didn't have to ask how.”
