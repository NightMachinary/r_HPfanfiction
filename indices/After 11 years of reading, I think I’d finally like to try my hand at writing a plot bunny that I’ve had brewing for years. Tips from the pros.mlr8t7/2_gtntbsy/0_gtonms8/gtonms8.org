I have written it before as one-shots (my first try was just Hermione Granger alone on Christmas Morning at age 9 before knowing she was a witch, figuring out she could do wandless magic to see inside the wrapped presents if she jammed her hair up into a Santa hat) and that is how I ended up deciding I would like to make it a full-length fic, I'm never satisfied with the short versions! Although I had not considered writing it as a magical research paper, that might actually have done the trick lol.

I understand that it's only an idea, not a plot.

Thank you for your response!!!
