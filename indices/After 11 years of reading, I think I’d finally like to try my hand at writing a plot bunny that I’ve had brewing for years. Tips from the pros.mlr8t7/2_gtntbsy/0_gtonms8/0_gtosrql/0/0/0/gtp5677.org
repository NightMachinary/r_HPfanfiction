I actually know a fair amount about black hair care due to following the curly hair subreddit for years :) as well as protective styling. After working on the idea all morning I think I am probably going to set the fic in 1800s England and there probably will not be many or any black characters present. Perhaps I will create an exception though, or have the main characters visit other counties (I'm thinking Egypt, Easstern Russia, and India) so I can show some concepts of how the hair element of magic would work in other cultures. You've given me a lot to think about, thanks again!
