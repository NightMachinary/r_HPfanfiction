Hair is hair, but Black hair acts much differently and needs much different care. If Black hair was washed as often as white hair it would become brittle and strands would start breaking. It needs to be moisturized and washed once a day. Locs and braids especially have a lot of cultural significance (at least here in the States) whereas they don't have that meaning for white people. There's a lot more but that's a lot of education I don't think you're looking for atm. The point is that there's a lot more than it just being hair, and you'd be doing the subject a huge disservice, as well as any potential Black readers, by treating Black hair as just hair. :)

I love that Hermione's hair is where you got the idea! I could absolutely see that happening. :D

Oh the part about Voldemort. I love that. :D
