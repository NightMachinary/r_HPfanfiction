OMG thanks so much, all excellent aspects to consider. The whole idea came from noticing how often Hermione's unruly hair becomes manageable as a sign of her coming of age/becoming mature.

I hadn't thought much about black hair, it's still hair after all, but I had put a good deal of thought into how cultural headcovering would work in this context (hijabs and the like), even going as far as to consider setting the fic in India, where Hindu, Sikhs, and Muslims live side by side with very different hair/head covering practices, but I discarded that because I am American and have not even visited India in person, it would just be too much research to probably still end up with a mediocre result.

Re: Voldemort, inspired by Buddhist monks who shave bald, being totally hairless is actually a sign of his intense power. He is not restrained to any area of magic, he does not have to prepare in any way before performing powerful works.
