I love the idea of Hermioneâ€˜s hair being important. Maybe it's so bushy because she has a ton of magical potential, or because she's so unrestrained with her approach to learning magic. I wonder how her school mates will react to it. And the teachers.

Will Muggleborns have any serious consequences to not knowing about this? I can't wait to see the culture clash! Big hair was The Thing in the 80s and very early 90s, so I wonder how that'll play into it, or if it will at all.

What about Black students with their protective hairstyles? Come to think of it, if you aren't Black you should find a Black collab writer because Black hair works much much differently from white people's. The care of it, the cultural meaning of it and styles. Especially locs and braids have a lot of meaning. It would be interesting to see how this plays out against the very white backdrop of an elitist school in a pureblood-dominated world. It's just really important to do it right. :) If you're going to do anything with Mrs. Zabini you should definitely absolutely have a Black collab. Black students seem rare enough in canon that there's an excellent chance for some plot friction there. Do they have additional classes? A mentor system? Are they mocked? In a hair-based magic system, are their hairstyles more controlled by the authorities in the school? The first question comes up in the real world with regards to cosmetology school, and the latter two already come up in all schools. I can't imagine how much bigger a deal it would be in a world where hair is so integral to magic!

Ohhhhh I wonder how this will tie into Voldemort's resurrection with him being completely bald - not even any eyelashes! Would people be less afraid of him? Or maybe they would be even more terrified because he's so very powerful without a single strand of hair on him? Maybe he did it intentionally as a power move!
