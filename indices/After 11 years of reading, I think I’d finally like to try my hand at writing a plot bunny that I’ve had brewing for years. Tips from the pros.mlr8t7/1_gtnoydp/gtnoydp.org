Your idea seems pretty unique to me!

My initial thoughts: Be careful on “balancing.” How much does the affinity for types of magic affect the overall magic of the person? Does this affect some of the laws in the wizarding world? Does this create new classes of people who are looked down on? Does this elevate some families? How does hair affect the adults (can someone with black hair have an equal affinity/strength in fire as a red head?)? How does aging affect your magic? What happens to metamorphs? Does having curls impact your magic? Haircuts (like mohawks)?

Put a LOT of thought into this. Maybe answer all of these questions, and ask yourself more. This is a super unique idea IMO, and could elevate an otherwise mediocre story.

Wish you future success :)
