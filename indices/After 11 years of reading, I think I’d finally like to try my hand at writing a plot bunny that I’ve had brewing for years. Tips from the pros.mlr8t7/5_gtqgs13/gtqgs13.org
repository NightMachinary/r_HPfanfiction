If you want lots of positive, empty reviews and followers, write the generic tropes and you'll have a temporarily popular, if after quickly forgotten, story. If you want something unique that people will remember, enjoy, and talk about, avoid writing or plain old subvert the tropes.

Character depth is key. If you have money to spare, I highly recommend books written by Nancy Kress about plot, setting, characterization, and the like (Dynamic Characters is a favourite of mine, personally).

Write flawed, very human characters, not caricatures.

If your story organically outgrows the outline, don't try to force it back on track: an infamous example is the HP books themselves, with JKR on the last few books.

Remember, you're not a puppeteer with the characters being marionettes on strings, but someone who's trying to herd a group of cats from A, to B, to C, to D, et cetera. They'll go off wandering on their own and exploring and the like.
