Read a lot by good writers and try to emulate them. Don't get discouraged, you're going to suck right off the bat that's how everyone starts very few people first put pen paper and find that they're f****** amazing. Try to focus on your basics good grammar proper paragraphs and spacing and know that the first thing you write is probably not going to be the first thing that goes on the internet.
