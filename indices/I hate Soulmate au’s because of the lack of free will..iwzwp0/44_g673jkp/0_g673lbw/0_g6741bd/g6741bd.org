Yea, the whole soulmate trope is actually really interesting if written well. I mean, soulmates doesn't always have to mean sexual attraction. In real life we all have someone really close who isn't alway our partner.

For some people their soulmate could be their sibling, again non romantically!!! Or maybe a parent, or a best friend. To me that would make sense in a world where everyone has a soulmate. A soulmate is just someone you just easily connect with, more than anyone else.
