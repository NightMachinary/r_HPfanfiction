I like soulmate AU's where the main character pairing might end up together, but some background characters are soulmates but don't end up together romantically. I actually recently read a story with soulmates and, while the main characters ended up together, the world the writer created was such that the characters weren't forced to be romantically involved. A little detail the writer made was making one of the background characters soulmates who actually became best friends.
