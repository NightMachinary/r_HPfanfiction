I have had an idea for a oneshot somewhat similar to this, but with a twist: while romance is far from guranteed (and in fact has nothing to do with the soulbond itself directly -- in the universe I have in mind, Fred and George has a soulbond that they use for pranks more than anything, being able to sense each other's feelings and sometimes thoughts which is really the only thing a soulbond does), the fact that soulbonds lead to the best romances is a common /myth/, sometimes with unfortunate consequences for the people believing it.

The scenario I had in mind was an incident that happens around 1982ish with a young Professor Snape encounters a group of teenage girls talking about how romantic it would be to have a soulmate. Distressed, he quickly disabuse them of the notion, pointing out the pitfalls of thinking like that, deducts points and give them detention in his usual Snape-ish manner. Because in the past, he had a soulbond with Lily, and the young Severus had done the very same assumption that these girls did about soulbonds meaning an inevitable romance. And this assumption was partly the reason why their friendship shattered (and any chance of there ever being more), because he took her friendship (and future love) for granted rather than trying to talk to her properly and take her concerns in the serious way that he ought to have ("meh, I know things will turn out well in the end, I'll just ignore the problems and they'll eventually go away"), which could have prevented the destruction in first place.
