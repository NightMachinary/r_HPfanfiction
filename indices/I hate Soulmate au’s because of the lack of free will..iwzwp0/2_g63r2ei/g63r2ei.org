Depends on if they're done well tbh. I read a very good Drarry soulmate AU (out of morbid curiosity but it ended up being an excellent AU in general) where while many soulmate pairs did end up getting romantically involved, the characters take the time to discuss the ethics of it and make a point of saying that you aren't required to love or even like your soulmate. Example: Tonks and Cedric have matching soulmate marks and though they're on friendly terms, they're not romantically interested in each other and are perfectly content with leaving it at that It was a very interesting take.
