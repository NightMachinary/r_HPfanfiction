Soulmate fictions remind me of forced arranged marraiges and a very real reality. It's a lays interesting how an author spins stories with a enemy to lover plot but I usually find that the characters either resolve their issues or hate fuck but that also depends on the author's rules of said soul bonds. I've read fiction where they have marks but aren't together - friendly to strangers - while on the other hand I've read angst to some dark suicidal theme's. I love them, I love how it's spun and the enemies to mate's is my trope or the angst/sad of one mate rejecting their soulmate.
