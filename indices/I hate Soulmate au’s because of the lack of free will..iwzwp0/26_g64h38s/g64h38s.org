I hate this trope for the main reason that people do there best to tie people that hate one another to each other most. The whole No Free Will thing is terrible as well. But one does not need to make a a Tom/Harry fic out of it as well.

Although I have seen a interesting twist on this more than once. For instance its where Lily and Severus are soul mates and lily is slowly but surely hating severus because of how he acts toward people (Claiming She's :Different :than other muggleborns when confronted About him hanging with deatheaters, Acting possessive) The real kicker is that this is one of those "where whatever you write on your skin appears on the others skin" sorta fics. when he gets "That" on him she wakes up one morning to find a matching pair on her arm too. She basically goes off on him in the great hall and swears a Binding Oath that cuts the cord between them. Humiliating Snape and letting her choose who she wants.
