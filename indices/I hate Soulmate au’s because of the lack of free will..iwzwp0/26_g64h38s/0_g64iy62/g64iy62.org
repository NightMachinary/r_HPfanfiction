Interesting story! I like the twist. Funny enough I made this whole rant because I read a Tom/Harry story called Train to Nowhere were Harry was basically forced to be with him because.... Fate and reason, and everyone was just ok with it. Like wtf. I actually don't hate all Tom/Harry slash/het stories otherwise specifically when Harry just basically shits all over Tom's plans makes his life a living hell and Tom actually has to work his fucking ass of to even see a sliver of affection. But yeah it's not easy to like the pairing were Harry basically forgets that THIS GUY IS A PSYCHO! And lets his guard down like a buffoon. Can you send me the link to the Lily/Snape story?
