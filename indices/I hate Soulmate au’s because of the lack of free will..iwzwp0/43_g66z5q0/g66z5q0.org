I like soulmates AU when the whole 'soulmate' thing is more diverse. Like, not that you have one soulmate which is the only person you have to love and without them you're as well as dead. Nope, that's creepy. I mean, still can be enjoyable, but creepy.

But a situation, when soulmates are more like guidelines, not a requirement? It points you to a person, with which you have some kind of deep connection. You can be lovers. Best friends. Twins. Mentor and prot√®ge. Enemies but with a strange similarities and link. You have a potential to be the greatest together, but you can be also great with someone else. Especially, if there are markless people or finding out who your soulmate is is difficult.

So you can disagree with Fate's choice and still have a happy life, though you may feel like something is lacking? But you won't die from loneliness
