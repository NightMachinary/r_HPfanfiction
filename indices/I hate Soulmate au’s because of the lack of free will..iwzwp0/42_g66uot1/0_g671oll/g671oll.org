The whole Harry Potter story in it's entirety is a story of wish fulfillment and I think that's a beautiful think. We all need escapism and fantasy, so when I say that “I hate soulmates” I don't mean to sound like I'm condemning anyone from a moral standpoint.

The more accurate thing would be that the external force that dictates who is going to be Soulmates scares me and fills me with existential dread because it reminds me of hard determinism and how you can't run away from your destiny. More often than not in soulmate stories when the characters even accidentally separate something negative happens, or when it's enemies to lovers and they genuinely want to get away this smug external force makes every situation so that they just get closer to each other. Which makes me question whether that relationship developed naturally or not.

What I'm trying to say is I'm not even trying to bash anyone's ideas of true love who am I to do that? I think that's a sweet ideal. But I'm more critical of the covert predestination in those stories. The idea that even though you're enemies and you hate each other whatever action you try to make will only make you closer to each other and you won't even realize this in the end. Because then I feel like what choice did you have in the beginning? I don't know If you've ever watched stranger than fiction the movie, but in there the main protagonist is actually the character of an author and he starts hearing the author narrate his life. He falls in love with a baker because she said so he does certain things because the author has written it. And even when he tries to defy it, it still somehow comes true. The love between this baker and mc is cute but I can't help but feel like how much of it is coercion? Anyways sorry for the long rant again I'm not actually bashing the idea of soulmates it's the idea of having no choice that genuinely scares me but that's just my opinion. Everyone deserves to have their fantasies and I totally understand people who like soulmates and were they are coming from. In a sea of uncertainty the idea of having the certainty of a soulmate seems very appealing. And I think there is nothing wrong with indulging that in stories♥️♥️♥️
