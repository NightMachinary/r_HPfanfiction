I think it depends on your definition. There are certainly cases where people just 'click', when you just get each other's jokes, understand and are able to read each other, etc. Equally, there are 'slow burns' where friends or even enemies can naturally grow to respect and love each other. I think it's interesting to explore a rejection of soul bonds: what if they fight back, what if soul bonds are fake. I think one reason why soul bond fanfics are so popular is because Harry Potter, at least imo, is about wish fulfillment. It's an attempt at escapism, which means that you are expected to suspend disbelief in an attempt to 'feel special'. Many people want to take comfort in the idea that there is a 'perfect one' for them somewhere out there, usually after their existing relationships don't work. It's an unhealthy but surprisingly realistic symptom of modern society, given that digitalisation and personalisation has made us more self-centered. I was, and probably am still among those afflicted by this despite trying hard to change.
