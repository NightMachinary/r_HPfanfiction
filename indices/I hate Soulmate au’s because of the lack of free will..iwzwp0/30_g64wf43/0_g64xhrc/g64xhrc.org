Thats absolutely beautiful! I think that friendship is one of the most powerful things a person can have and to have that kind of connection is a wonderful thing! I hope that the strong bond you have with your bff will continue on for many many more years♥️

With What you are saying I think that the definition of soulmate can differ. I'm talking more about the common soulmate/soul-marking trope in fanfics that inhibit the main characters from having a choice, putting negative consequences, or more insidiously never even show that they actually have a free will or choice in the first place due to external supernatural forces. For sure in general terms soulmate does not need to be sexual it can be platonic. But I'm just generally talking about the trope of soulmate and predestination in fanfics. Thank you for sharing your special bond and experience with your friend 💕💕💕😊😊😊
