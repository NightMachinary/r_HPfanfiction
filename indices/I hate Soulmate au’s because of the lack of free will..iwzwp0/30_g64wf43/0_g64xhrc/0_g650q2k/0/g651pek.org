Damm that was amazing! Thank you for that fantastic piece of writing! Are you a fanfic author? If so can you send me the links of your stories? You're right “beautiful” might be an inadequate word but whatever you want to name it or not name it. It still seems like a very special friendship! It's good to have someone to rely on knowing they have your back.
