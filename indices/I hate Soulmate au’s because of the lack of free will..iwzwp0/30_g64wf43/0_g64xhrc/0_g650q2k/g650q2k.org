Ehhhhhh I'm not sure if beautiful is the right word for our bond. Haha. It's been forged in the fires of hell and a mutual belief of no matter what we're in this together :) Yuppers :) like I said, just an excuse for writers to mash the characters like dolls together. If it was done right though? I feel it could be a beautiful thing. Love is tricky. Writing it out? One of the most difficult feels to bring out. Actually taking a workshop on it. It's easy to say:

As their eyes met in a crowd there seemed to be a moment where the world paused, the hub of surrounding chatter dulled, and without realizing it, they gravitated towards each other like two magnets in an ever developing nexus of magic, courcing through the surroundings.

Then say:

As Ron stormed out of the tent, his face set in a snarl, he hurled the locket into Hermione's face then aperating away in a chaotic swirl of magic. Harry stood there as an unwilling and devastated witness for the death of his friends relationship till he rushed over and wrapped his best friend up in his arms; holding her while she felt her heart sunder in two. He could feel her pain, feel her soul wrenching out in the anguish of sacrificing her parents, friends, status, everything behind in the hope of a future no one was convinced was a posibilty. Looking into her eyes, he whispered "well, at least there's no dragons in the next task." To which she hiccuped a short snort of laughter.
