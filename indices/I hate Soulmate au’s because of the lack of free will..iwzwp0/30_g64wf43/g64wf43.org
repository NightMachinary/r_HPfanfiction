My best friend is without a doubt my soul mate. We have been in each other's lives for almost 20 years. I love her dearly and I would do anything for her.

Barring being in an actual relationship.

No where does it say being each other's soul mates does it say you have to be married, do the cha cha, have kids. Fanfic authors just mash characters like pubescent kiddos with a ken and Barbie and need an excuse.
