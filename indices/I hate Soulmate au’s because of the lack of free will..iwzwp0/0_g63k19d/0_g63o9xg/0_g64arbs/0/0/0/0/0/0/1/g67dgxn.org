  Perhaps, as the hard determinist suggests, we are justified in holding people responsible only in order to influence future behavior.
#+end_quote

In a deterministic system, what is the significance of justification? Things happen because they happen. Justification requires some other alternative possibility.

And how is future behavior influenceable? Things that will happen, will happen; not due to cause and effect, at least as generally envisioned, but because initial conditions demand it.

The problem with the description, at least as it is presented here, is that, if people are not free and, thus, not responsible for their actions, then how is one free to decide to hold people responsible? Or to punish them?

The problem, I believe, is one of language. Regardless of truth, the manner of construction of the English language implies free will. Writing sentences in which there is an 'actor', e.g., a human, but their actions, and others responses to them, are determined is really counter-intuitive.
