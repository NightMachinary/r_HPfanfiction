  Effectively it can be used to say that people aren't accountable for their actions and can't be punished for it (as you can consider it coercion of sorts).

There really isn't a meaning to this sentiment in determinism. People aren't being punished for their actions; outcomes occur. Sometimes those outcomes are 'good', other times they are 'bad', but they are already determined.
