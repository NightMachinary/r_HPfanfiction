I think the "soulmate bond" they're referring to is more of a "I've chosen you and only you" kind of thing. There's actually no predestination involved, just two characters who love each other and know that the other is "the one" decide to tie the knot a bit more deeply than marriage and a ring. It's what it sounds like: a voluntary, irreversible bond between souls.
