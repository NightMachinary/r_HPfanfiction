I don't remember what the name was, but there was one marriage contract-y fic that was played a little more realistically than most (something about preventing squibs by matching magical auras because the post-war generation couldn't afford it) and Draco and Astoria end up together despite their magical auras not actually being compatible because they lie about their results, and choose each other.

I always thought that was really nice. Like the one completely status quo couple was subverting what was "correct."

EDIT: It's called /Safeword is Devil's Snare/ I don't remember how to link D:
