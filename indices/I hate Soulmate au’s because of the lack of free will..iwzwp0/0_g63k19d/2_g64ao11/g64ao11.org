Yeah, I don't like the like “when you meet your soulmate X happens and you know” soulmate stuff but I LOVE the like “across different worlds and different times, no matter what happens these two people will always find each other again” soulmate stuff. ESP when it adds the tragic element of like having to try again and again and always meeting some sad end until they finally get it right.
