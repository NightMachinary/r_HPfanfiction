The lack of free will definitely sucks. it's much better when there are good examples of romantic and platonic relationships between soulmates.

I just read a fic last night where there is a magical force (in this case geese that magically appeared) and they would drag you to your soulmate. kiss and the geese are gone for good. you don't have to stay with your soulmate at all and there's no societal pressure to do so.

Also, seriously, geese in all their geese-ness. was hilarious.
