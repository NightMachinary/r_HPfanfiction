That seems really funny XD For me as long as they have a choice It's fine. Although I don't judge anyone who enjoys it otherwise. It's just that for me personally when there is a magical force in this story whether that be Lady Magic, fate, â€˜insert generic avatar of these concepts' Who says that these characters are bound to each other and they have no choice the to me it becomes no different then playing an Omniscient God.
