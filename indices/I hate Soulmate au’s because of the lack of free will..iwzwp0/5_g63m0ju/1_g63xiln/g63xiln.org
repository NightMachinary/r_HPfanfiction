Right? And conversely, who doesn't at least know of someone who is consistently drawn to someone that makes both of them worse instead of improves either of them? These stories always make it sound like if you're drawn to each other, it's meant to be, when truly a lot of it is just information about you and what you think you deserve. It's not a great message to apply to real life.
