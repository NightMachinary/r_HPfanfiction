It reminds me of an article I read were it talked about people who subconsciously felt more attracted to people who resembled their parents even if that person had abusive characteristics. And even when presented with someone more decent the person would still subconsciously choose the candidate who resembled the parent because they felt like they had more “spark” and “connection”. So I guess there is also a kind of primitiveness that I never caught up on and definitely agree that it wouldn't apply that well to real life.
