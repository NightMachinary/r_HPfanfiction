I agree completely. I don't mind as much if authors explore the issues involved (like the stigma of dating someone who isn't your soulmate), but I overall dislike the idea. Predestination is certainly an issue with it, but to me I also dislike the idea that there is only 1 right person out there. What if they die? What if you never meet them? What if they are abusive? The idea that you should stay with someone simply because they are your soulmate is disturbing. And the idea that if you don't meet (or lose) your soulmate then you'll never be happy is just depressing.

Weirdly enough I hate soulmates, but I can deal with "mates" in some instances with creature fics. Perhaps because it would affect a much smaller percentage of society and because often only one side feels the draw. Some of them are just as bad though (or worse).
