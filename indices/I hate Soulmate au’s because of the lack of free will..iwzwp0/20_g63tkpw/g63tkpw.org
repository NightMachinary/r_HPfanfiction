It all comes back to agency - any premise or plot that denies the characters agency is a problem unless it's /about/ the denial of agency and the struggles that result. This is even an issue in the canon, as Trelawney's second prophecy (and to some degree the first, depends on interpretation) denies any agency by the characters.

Whether it's soulmates, prophecy, or anything else, it should support the characters' agency rather than diminish it (again, unless the plot is a Final Destination-esque "oh f**k we're stuck").

I have seen soulmates done well a time or two and acceptably several more. Non-problematic soulmate stories either have soul-bonding be a choice by the bonded (one of the things I really liked in "Banking on Her" by RobSt), make soul mates just people that are super-compatible (romantically or otherwise) and reinforce any love that does develop, and/or give people multiple potential soul mates to pick any/all/none from.
