I don't like Soulmates Fanfics either. My problem isn't so much the free will but that it is lazy writing.\\
I hardly have any problem with any ship if it's well written. The only ships I don't like are teacher/student fics. That's simply wrong even if said student has reached maturity. I want to believe the journey of the pair that leads to the relationship. Soulmate Fanfics are a lazy way of plotting - like the author has no idea how to make his ship happen so he/she gives her/his characters a soulbond to force them together.
