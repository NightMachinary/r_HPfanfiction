OMGGF YESSSS!!! That's exactly how I feel reading these kinds of fanfics. As though there were an Orwellian 1984 element to it all! Or maybe even a Lovecraftian horror were the cosmic forces that determine things like soulmates are arbitrary, forceful, and ultimately meaningless but people are still trying to put meaning to it assuming that its part of their destiny or grand design. Basically a blind idiot God in the form of a magical avatar telling you that you have no will and will submit to your soulmate role.
