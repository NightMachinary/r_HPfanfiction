I like Soulmate AUs where the two who are “destined” to be together don't end up together. I like the struggle of fighting against the system and showing that love that you create thru hard work and dedication is just as valid or even more valid than the love that supposedly should fit you like a glove. Because real love isn't like that.

I personally don't believe in destiny or fate or soulmates so I guess that's why
