Yeah, this has always bothered me. I do like the representation of bonds through magic, though. A popular trope is that when someone touches you, your skin turns a certain colour depending on your relationship with them. I like this better because the colour can change and it depends on your feelings for them, not some predetermined outcome, but it's still a physical comfirmation. Also, it allows me to write some super painful oneshots about accepting that you have fallen out of love with someone or still being in love after a breakup, but moving on because the relationship couldn't have worked.
