Call me crazy but I only have ever enjoyed those tropes when they're presented by the author critically and as a horror. And I actually enjoy those fics. Give me more critical horror AUs! I don't have any to rec on hand sorry, I'm on my phone atm.

If someone told me that my soulmate was my high school teacher (like a lot of cross-gen fics) I would pretty much have a panic attack and get therapy. And even if the universe gravitated me towards them I think I'd always have a flicker of fear there. I wouldn't settle into fluffy romance life. I would also be extremely uncomfortable with them remaining in close proximity with kids. And also the propensity for abuse is truly extreme. Even if it never happened I wouldn't feel safe. Maybe that's my control issues talking.

Psychoanalysis incoming: Loss of agency is a very common trope in romance. One reason is that it permits a reader to be forced into loving/having sex with someone without any of the ‚Äúblame‚Äù of those circumstances arising, so there's no culpability in enjoying it. This is even present in romance fics of the early 20th century so it's no new trope and I won't shame. Some people just like to helplessly feel seduced to evade the culpability of enjoyment, especially with anything taboo.

I'm just on the other end of that spicy spectrum haha. As soon as there's a ‚Äúsexy‚Äù loss of autonomy I'm like eject!! Wheres that back button! My is that the time I better close this browser! üòÇ
