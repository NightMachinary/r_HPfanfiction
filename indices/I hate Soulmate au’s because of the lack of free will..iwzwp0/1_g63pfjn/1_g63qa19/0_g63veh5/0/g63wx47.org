I loved your psychoanalysis you explained everything that I couldn't articulate! Exactly they just want to evade the responsibility of having to own up to what you want. I like dark stories with problematic characters but at least the characters own up to it it's ver own conscious consensual decisions which can turn out wrong. But I think that makes things more high stakes
