I 100% agree on ever point that you made. Particularly on the ABO trope and how the characters don't have any agency. Look I'm not saying that I haven't read any “problematic” or dark stories that I've liked. But the key thing for me is that there was a choice whether that be good or bad can depend. But with ABO/soulmate/ and teacher student relationships the helplessness of having no choice and not being able to rebel against those constraints is really horrifying to me. Just imagine if somebody told you that the person you hate or even the person you potentially love is your soulmate and no matter what you do the universe will somehow bind you to make decisions that will make you guys be together. How is that not humiliating and petrifying?
