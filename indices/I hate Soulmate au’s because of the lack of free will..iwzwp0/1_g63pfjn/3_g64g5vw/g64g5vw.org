  I still haven't seen a teacher/student fic where the dynamic is explored for what it is - pretty uncomfortable and exploitative and usually associated with grooming.

This really depends on the setting. Hermione/Snape for example, no. Just no. Or Lupin for that matter.

But let's say that Alicia Spinnet is hired straight out of Hogwarts to teacher Runes and Harry ends up in a relationship with her during his 7th year, that's not really problematic tbh since she has very little authority over him (he is not in her class) and the age difference is 2 years (17/19) at that point.
