Thank you!! I fucking hate A/B/O and I can't understand why it's so popular. It seems like its hallmarks are gender-based sexual slavery and "pheromones" as justification for rape?

I hate hate /hate/ the implication that a certain "gender" (the one that can carry a pregnancy) is biologically mandated to be subservient to the other and forced to accept unwanted sexual advances. And the exchange is that the gender raping them will "protect" and provide for them?

Some authors try to wince around the consent issue (not that there's ever been a fic where a "no" is respected in the end), but the gender = role thing is still deeply fucked up.
