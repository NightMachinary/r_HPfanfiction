I don't enjoy it a bit at all so don't take this comment as a defence of ABO because I hate it personally.

But! from my friends who do enjoy that genre, and who critically engage with those themes, they seem to enjoy it because it combines a lot of taboos and (usually) has the main character have no “choice” but to voraciously sexually enjoy those circumstances. For a lot of people, sex is taboo and they're shamed for enjoying it - so it's a kind of sexual liberation. Some writers are more careful about those themes and others really lean in to the more troublesome aspects uncritically and without apparent awareness and those writers also seem really young. I do worry sometimes? That people writing this stuff may not be of age? But that's another monkey for another circus.
