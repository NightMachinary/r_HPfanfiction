I'm actually somewhat in the opposite frame of mind as [[/u/gertrude-robinson]] on this---I'm totally fine with non-consent as a kink ("consensual non-consent" in real life). Sex pollen, dom/sub, mind-altering drugs, random kidnapping, tentacles grabbing you through the shower drain? No problem---we understand it's fiction.

For me the problem with A/B/O isn't the sex (as in, "intercourse"), what makes me uncomfortable is the fantasy of one gender (really, sex assigned at birth, not that it ever seems to differ in A/B/O fics) having basically unrestricted power over the other, as a /fact/ of gender. In these fantasies, consent isn't between individuals, it's a disturbing societal phenomenon where equal rights do not (and maybe can not) exist.

To me, A/B/O serves as a vehicle to both *1)* get rid of female characters---if they /must/ exist, 98% of the time they're betas and irrelevant (finally no more gross vaginas!!)---and *2)* strip any agency from the gender that can get pregnant and reduce them to brainless baby-makers with no other reason to live.

The soulmate stuff is consent issues and a big heap of determinism. A/B/O is less about consent and more about oppressive gender roles. If the writers/readers aren't of age... I'd rather they read porn than stuff with a fucked-up worldview like this.
