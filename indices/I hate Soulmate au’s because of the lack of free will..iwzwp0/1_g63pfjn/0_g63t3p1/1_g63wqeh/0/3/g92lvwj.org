I don't think it's fair to assume A/B/O or soulmates are only about wish fulfillment for men or people who picture themselves as dominant in these scenarios.

Life can be a lot. For everyone. Responsibilities aren't all the same, but we've all got them.

Pay the bills. Go to work. Deal with different managers wanting different people. Deal with different people in your personal life wanting different things from you. Tidy the house. Clean the house. Go to the doctor. Manage your illnesses. Exercise. Cook. Eat. Brush your teeth, every day, forever.

It can be overwhelming. Some people don't cope well. Some people fail at taking care of themselves. And some people's parents failed to care for them or protect them when they were children.

When you're a kid, maybe you fantasize about your parent loving you or taking care of you. And there's nothing wrong with you for wanting that.

When you're an adult, and struggle to take care of yourself, and are miserable, maybe you fantasize about a romantic/sexual relationship with someone who will take care of you. But you know you're an adult and you're supposed to be able to take care of yourself, and you can't, or feel like you can't.

Maybe you feel like you are just incapable of taking care of yourself. But in your fantasy, you don't want it to be your fault. So you write about a group of people, or gender, or whatever, who just magically do need someone to take care of them. You get to fantasize, guilt free, about a total lack of responsibility for yourself or others. And all your needs, sexual and otherwise, are met.

I feel gross about soul bonding and ABO and whatever else because they are non con, whether that's acknowledged in the fic or not.

But I'm overwhelmed with life, and sometimes the escapism of not being responsible for anything is nice. And I'm lonely and worried no one I want will ever love me, and that I'll always make bad choices about who to date, and sometimes the escapism of a soul mate, and not being responsible for finding or choosing or staying with someone or not feels really good.

In real life magic can't find people the best partner. And (of course) I don't want to give up my free will and the freedom I buy with responsibility.

I don't know whether it's okay for people to be writing or reading this shit. But I definitely don't think it's all about catering people who want that dominant role
