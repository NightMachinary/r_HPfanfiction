Yeah I definitely think we're both saying stuff that we already agree on! I think you hit the nail on the head with describing it as sort of "existentially" horrific as opposed to situationally. For me it's deeply disturbing for nonconsent to be a fact to such an extent that consent isn't even really an option. Whether it's biology as in A/B/O or something more abstract like in soulmate fics.

I guess A/B/O tends to have more obvious "it's not rape if they like it" or "no no no yes" kinds of scenes (the trope is almost always explicit) but I see what you mean about Soulmate AUs. In a way the soulmate trope is even more unsettling for its lack of explicitness---nobody is being held down/raped/bitten (although it occurs to me now that the "permanent marking" is actually a hallmark of Soulmate AUs)---the nonconsent is less immediately obvious and more insidious for it.
