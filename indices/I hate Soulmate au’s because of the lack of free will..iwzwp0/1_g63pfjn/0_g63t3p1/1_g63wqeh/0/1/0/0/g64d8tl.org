EXACTLY! When the nonconsent isn't even obvious it's definitely more insidious in my opinion. Because you never even knew that there was an option. Idk the lack of awareness is chilling and can be drawn parallels to real life Orwellian stuff. When you don't even know what you're reading is propaganda or that you are being brainwashed. Kind of like in Plato's cave were the people watching the shadows aren't even aware that something else exists vs the one person who's forcefully kept their with chains having knowledge of the outside world. Anyways sorry for the weird tangent. I enjoyed your comments so much. You put everything that I couldn't articulate so eloquently in to words.

It's not my personal cup of tea but I can understand why as a fantasy you might enjoy those kinks in media/literature because there is a fight going on a power struggle an awareness to it which can be found enjoyable just because of that struggle. But it's overt rather than covert.
