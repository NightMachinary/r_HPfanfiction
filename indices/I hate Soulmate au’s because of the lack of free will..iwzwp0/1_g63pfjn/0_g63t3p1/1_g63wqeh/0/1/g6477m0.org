I actually agree with you and I don't think our opinions differ too much. For me not liking soulmate au isn't about having the moral high-ground. And as a kink I can understand that non-consent/consent can be a type of fantasy/escapism bdsm thing. But as you've mentioned above when it's just a fact of society something bound by unknown external forces and you don't even realize that you don't have agency unlike in kidnappings etc... it becomes more of an existential horror for me. Like imagine if somebody told you that whatever you do in your life you will eventually fulfill this soulmate destiny because its “fate” and no matter what action you do you will simply fulfill that fate like a puppet. That's personally more scary to me then the kinks you say that you enjoy. Because they don't pretend to be anything other than they are it's just a consent/nonconsent kink. But with Soulmate au when the characters don't even understand that they don't actually have any free will or consent because of laws and external powers as you've said then it's personally really scary to me. But yeah I'm not judging anyones tastes of course and totally agree with your insights on abo and gender roles.
