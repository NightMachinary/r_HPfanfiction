There is always this tiny plot bunny in my head that wants to explore ABO system in a political way and how the best you can hope for ids being a beta and alphas and omegas are pushed to the sides of society. Because really would you trust someone who could turn at any moment into a sex-driven half-animal with anything of importance. You can't trust them in any education facility, because the students could turn any moment into an omaga or alpha, and then you need the teacher to be able to take charge with a clear mind. So teachers would be betas and that mean they form the basis for the education and society. Would you put a an alpha or omega into a position of sensitive security? No because they could turn sex-crazy any moment. Would you want them to be your surgent or even your busdriver? No, the people in charge of everything of any relevance would be betas and both omegas and alphas would try to pretend to be betas, but in truth they would at best seen as handicapped and in need to be integrated into normal life, but theirs is not normal life...

But I don't think I ever will
