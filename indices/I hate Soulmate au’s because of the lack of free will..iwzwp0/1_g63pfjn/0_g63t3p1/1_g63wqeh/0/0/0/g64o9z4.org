To be clear---I'm not trying to have a fight with anyone, I've just put a lot of thought into my strong feelings on this subject.

My personal approach to life is generally "live and let live"---I'm not interested in evangelizing or imposing my morals on anyone. If I don't like someone's porn, I won't read it. But this is a bit of a special case. I think A/B/O is actually harmful because it's poorly explored. I know it looks like a double standard, but let me clarify.

A lot of kinky stuff, especially in writing, shades into some morally grey areas. Non-con is the tip of the freaky iceberg---there are huge sub-categories like body modification, torture/brainwashing, breeding/human farming, and so on. On reddit, porn tropes like raping your step-sister are memed to high heaven. Any of those taken "seriously" in real life would clearly be wrong. In fact, a big part of what makes something a kink in the first place is that it's taboo.

I don't believe anyone wants to take A/B/O any more seriously than any other kinks. For me it's that the specific taboos explored by A/B/O fics are poorly defined, even by authors, and as a consequence the parallels with real life are poorly defined.

For example, it's easy to play out (most) non-consent kinks in real life with a consenting partner. But what's the real-life equivalent for A/B/O? Is it an mpreg/breeding kink? Is it dominance/submission? Humiliation? Bestiality/furry kink?

Any of those are fine by me. My problem is that there's another, less obvious "layer" involved with A/B/O---the concept of second-class citizens with no free will. That second layer is both an intrinsic part of the A/B/O trope and rarely a kink itself, because it's rarely articulated. In fact, it's not even really taboo---women being second class citizens is fact in a /lot/ of the world.

A/B/O and the implied horrors of A/B/O society are usually just a vehicle for other kinks. It /may/ be possible that some writers/readers want to explore the horror of gender-based sexual slavery (not that the "alphas" have much choice either), but it's pretty rare. So the trope gets rolled into fics that just want mpreg (etc) and the gender discrimination isn't really a fantasy but just a convenient reason for characters to fuck.

We all understand that rape is bad. But because the parallel to real life isn't obvious, it's almost never acknowledged that "A/B/O /society/ is bad."

It's not that the idea of second-class citizen sexual slavery is being /promoted/---it's pretty much not discussed at all. The problem is that it actually does exist in real life, and these fics implicitly accept it.
