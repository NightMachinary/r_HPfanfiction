I don't like A/B/O fics either, so I'm not trying to defend them or anything, but I'd like you to clear up something.

  I'm totally fine with non-consent as a kink ("consensual non-consent" in real life). Sex pollen, dom/sub, mind-altering drugs, random kidnapping, tentacles grabbing you through the shower drain? No problem---we understand it's fiction.

  For me the problem with A/B/O isn't the sex (as in, "intercourse"), what makes me uncomfortable is the fantasy of one gender (really, sex assigned at birth, not that it ever seems to differ in A/B/O fics) having basically unrestricted power over the other, as a fact of gender. In these fantasies, consent isn't between individuals, it's a disturbing societal phenomenon where equal rights do not (and maybe can not) exist.

So, you seem to be fine with people exploring more taboo kinks (rape, non-con, etc) via fiction, since it's fiction and not real, but A/B/O takes it too far. It crosses a line because rather than it be a non-con relationship/sex between individuals the fiction is about society as a whole and includes submissive second class citizens with little to no rights (or at least no say in the relationship) and essentially the rape is systematic. That seems to be your issue with it, please correct me if I'm wrong.

My confusion is that it's still just a kink being explored in fiction. Like, I understand the deeper implications if someone were to take it seriously and actually try to promote the ideas that are spread within the story, but as you said for other non-con fiction, we know it's fiction and not real. So I don't really see why a line is being crossed here. If someone were to think that the fic is actually promoting the idea of second-class citizen sexual slavery then the same could be said about any other non-con fic promoting rape.

Unless I'm completely misunderstanding your comment and you just meant that you are comfortable reading those other fics but not with A/B/O fics because of those reasons, and not that you are actually against them being written.
