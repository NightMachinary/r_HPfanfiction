A /lot/ of it (like a lot a lot) is slash stuff. I haven't done the research to say for sure, but I'm pretty sure A/B/O started in the slash community. It's a combo of the good old mpreg trope (which preceded it in popular use by at least a decade, I'd guess) with "wolf pack dynamics" (which I suspect evolved from general dom/sub kinks).

It definitely /exists/ for het pairings, but it's much less common. A quick search of the tag [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Alpha*s*Beta*s*Omega%20Dynamics/works][on AO3]] gives me 65k M/M fics and 12k F/M fics. The categories are definitely skewed by people tagging side-pairings (if I filter on F/M, I still see maybe 70% M/M fics), but the difference in number is huge. Part of that is just that slash is popular.

But aside from the rare femslash fic, almost none of them feature female characters as the ones in power. It's always male = alpha, female = omega, unsexy = beta.
