No I totally understand were your friends are coming from. I'm not condemning anyone who likes these things. It's not about even having a moral high ground it's just that I feel triggered when characters don't have choices because it ultimately reminds me of death (it sounds weird I know) in terms of helplessness and not being able to do anything about it.
