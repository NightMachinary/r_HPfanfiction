  When Maria Hill was seven years old, she asked her grandmother---the only person she'd ever known with a soulmate---what it was like to be bonded to someone else. Her grandmother had smiled this sweet, tender smile and talked about safety and warmth and home, and to this day that's what Maria thinks of whenever she sees a soulbonded couple. But when she'd asked her grandmother why she'd quit a promising career, Gran had said it was for her husband. Maria had vowed then and there that she'd never be soulbonded to someone else if it meant giving up her independence.Steve Rogers never knew anyone who'd been soul bonded. He knew that the chances of finding your soulmate were slim, and who'd want a scrawny, asthmatic kid from Brooklyn anyway. And then he'd met Peggy Carter. She was everything Steve had hoped for in a soulmate. Too bad she wasn't his, although it might have been a blessing in disguise. He couldn't image the pain in knowing that you'd found your soulmate only to lose them in the next moment. And when he woke up sixty years in the future, he figured he'd missed his chance. So when it happens to them, it's both everything and nothing like they'd expected.

  RumRogers Soulmark AU: Any and all intelligence on Rogers' soulmark has been heavily redacted in every single file in existence... except for the yellowed manila folder Alexander Pierce places on Rumlow's desk one afternoon shortly after the Chitauri invasion.
