You know, I saw so many fluffy soulmate AUs I didn't like for the same reason and I couldn't say why, and when I finally came across one that was more of a horror story it helped me solidify or articulate the same feeling as you. And those are the stories I enjoy: ones that deconstruct a trope or genre like soulmates and show that, hey - this could possibly be super messed up!

I love that when people take a trope and show it realistically, and it's actually really uncomfortable or intense. I've seen probably only two marriage fics I can remember where it read very similarly to my friends' parents experience who had arranged marriages - awkward, slow, not fluffy and only eventually coming to something like an allegiance and careful affection. Another one is, oh god - any ABO profoundly lacks consent. If it were real life, people would have PTSD. Instead of being an omega getting taken by the sexy Alpha fuccboi Draco Malfoy you're just as likely to have some middle aged, unattractive dude who works at a corner store and isn't gonna be much of a fantasy panting over you and abrogating your free and informed consent.

Oh yeah. I still haven't seen a teacher/student fic where the dynamic is explored for what it is - pretty uncomfortable and exploitative and usually associated with grooming.

So many tropes bend consent, agency, autonomy and I just love when an author uncomfortably shines the light on it for an “emperor's clothes” moment where you're reading it going, ah, yes, this is actually pretty yuck. Thanks for, uh, showing the people.

Props to those authors. I live for those stories that deconstruct the trope.
