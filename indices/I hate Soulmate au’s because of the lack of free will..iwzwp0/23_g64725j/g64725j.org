Agreed!

The idea itself is nice but I genuinely hate how almost every soulmate au I read literally forces two people into a romantic relationship. It has come to a point where a few feels way too non-consensual and... Well, I just really don't like it when a relationship is forced.

Not to mention, I know for a fact that soulmates doesn't automatically mean romantic relationship. Soulmates, depending on which country, can also include platonic soulmates. So, why force two characters who clearly doesn't have romantic attraction when they can be the ultimate best friend? Wouldn't best friends be so much cuter and fluffier?

I dunno... This is just my opinion.
