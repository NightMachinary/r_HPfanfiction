oh ya absolutely

the only versions i can stomach is

1. soulmates means fated to be someone important in youe life not necessarily romantic and you aren't sure what the relation is. Could be friends or like a guide/teacher for example. Doesn't even have to be positive like could be enemies.

2. your pet the only time I actually believe in love at first sight. Your pet is bonded to your life so they live as long as you ( aka like a dog living for like 80 years)
