The whole predetermined aspect is often quite weird, especially if it's used to construct anything involving Draco Malfoy...\\
That said I have read interesting variations on it: for example one in which people have possible soulmates and therefore several marks that might change colour or disappear or maybe a new one appears depending on the choices all the people involved make. But this way it's more of a way to check if the person your dating is "the one" instead of "you have to date this one person or you'll never be happy!".
