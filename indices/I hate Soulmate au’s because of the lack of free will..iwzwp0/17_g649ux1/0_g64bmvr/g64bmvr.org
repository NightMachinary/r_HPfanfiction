I definitely see were you are coming from and can see the appeal of having someone to fall back on no matter what the circumstances are. It can be safe and comforting in a world of uncertainty I just personally don't like it when when avatars of fate or destiny in stories just basically make it so that the characters fall in love no matter what because evidently they wouldn't know what is best for them thus taking that choice away from them or just creating every situation for them to fulfill that role. Like what or who the hell are you to tell me what I will do? As for enemies to lovers I just personally don't like it when the hero archetype just suddenly forgets every wrongdoing that the person of interest does just because they are “meant to be together. ” I'm alright with it though if they just want to call themselves soulmates out of their free volition without the power of external forces. Thank you for your insightful comment! Would love to read the stony fanfic you've mentioned ☺️✨✨
