Ahh yeah I do agree with the part about the hero archetype suddenly forgetting about previous wrongdoings, it definitely has to be properly addressed cos moving on to a future without working out past issues would definitely spell out a very shaky relationship.

Also I found it! It's The Song Without Words by Lelantus, the link is here: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10926021/chapters/24302223]] Hope you like it! :D
