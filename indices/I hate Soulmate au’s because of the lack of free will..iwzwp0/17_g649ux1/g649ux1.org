Actually, I read a Soulmate au from another fandom (Stony) in which one party was not able to view their soul mark (light shining from chest when touching soulmate) due to the fact that they had something grafted over their chest. As the story played out, they both fell in love of their own accord, even in spite of the fact that they were both under the impression that they were not soulmates (and thus, subject to the scrutiny of the public, for pursuing such a relationship). I think in this case it was particularly meaningful because they made the choice to stay together and pursue the relationship together even without the certainty of the soul mark to fall back on.

Nevertheless, I suppose that's one of the rarer cases, though I do see this trope pop up from time to time.

Honestly though, personally, I do like Soulmate aus, even the common ones. Part of the appeal might be the (relative) certainty that both parties have, that no matter the circumstance, they will always ultimately have each other. I guess I don't tend to see it as a lack of free will but more of a case in which the universe gives soulmates more chances/opportunities than it usually would, to make the choices that allow them to eventually be together.

For instance, in the case of the enemies-to-lovers trope, I wouldn't really see it as a case of them being forced to stay together in the end despite hating each others guts (at least not in fics that I've read?), I'll perceive it to be a case of fate or circumstance giving them the time or space needed to get to know each other better and really sift through each others layers and fall in love. (While in the case that they are not soulmates/meant to be, they might've just written each other off for good and never properly gotten to know each other.)

Uhm I don't know if that makes sense? I do see your point about the lack of agency thing though.

But also I really recommend that Stony fic I mentioned! I forgot the name but if I ever find it I'll put it here.
