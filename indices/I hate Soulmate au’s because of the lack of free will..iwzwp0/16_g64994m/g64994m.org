I do agree with you, though I also... don't. Like, I enjoy soulmate AUs because they can just be some sappy, romantic stuff, and I love that from time to time, but the way it interferes with free will... I think that's a very complicated subject and I both love and hate it because of that.

I started working on a soulmate AU fic -- for a different fandom -- where I plan (read: never will because I'm very good at starting things but not at continuing them) to explore that concept more, because one of the main themes of that piece of media is how these kinds of bonds should not be forced through supernatural means and that people should be free to make their own choices. (I got the idea after reading a soulmate AU fic for that fandom and I was like. Well. I mean. That completely clashes with the themes of the original work. And it didn't go addressed. Which, well, is fine, but I'd've loved to see it be addressed.)
