I hope that your plan to write that fic will come in to fruition. I'm sure you'll do a fantastic job! I understand you and can see the appeal of this trope when it doesn't take itself uber seriously and is just fluffy and romantic. But for me when the story is more high stakes and enemies to lovers kind of thing then it just makes me feel frustrated. Because usually the mc works so hard to repel this so called soulmate they fight tooth and nail to be independent but suddenly as though in a kind of trance or spell the mc just abruptly falls in love with this person who is allegedly their soulmate. And it just makes me really angry because I feel like the mc has to give up because they can't fight the external forces destiny. Kind of like imperio or Amortentia. At least when the author doesn't give the characters a choice.
