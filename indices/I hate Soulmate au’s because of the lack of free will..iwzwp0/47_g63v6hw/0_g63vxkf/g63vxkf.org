Hahahahaha “Snape + Greasy hair” love that XD Interestingly enough In twilight Edward basically agrees that there is no free will in their relationship because vampires are naturally designed to be attractive to their prey. So their prey doesn't have much choice in finding them desirable I.e. Bella never even had a choice in liking Edward. And Edward never even had a choice in liking Bella because he basically describes her as the substance heroin because her blood was too addictive. How fucked up is that XD
