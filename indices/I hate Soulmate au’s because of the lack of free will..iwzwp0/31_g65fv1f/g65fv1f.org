Oh yes I hate that! :) I started writing a bit of a soulmate fic where soulmates become physically bound to be near each other, and they can sense each other's thoughts and emotions, but that's IT! What their relationship is or becomes from there is entirely left up to them. They could be friends, or ignore each other and try to work around it to live their own lives, or they could become romantic partners. I had Dumbledore explain that most soulbonds between two people stayed purely platonic, and that it was actually rare for them to become romantic together.

I treated it more like a terrible medical condition than some mystical romance plotforce.

It was something both people didn't like or want, and it came about as an accident, and everyone around them really just pitied them for being stuck in it. :( It was something they had to work together to deal with, but that didn't mean they had to get closer to each other in any other ways. They could even keep hating each other.

I am a huge lover of FREE WILL! So I preserved that with both the soulbonded people's minds even when bonded. Their minds were entirely unaltered and unaffected. No stupid force twisting them to love each other, forcing them to feel attracted to each other. That's as sick as the Imperius, or love potions.
