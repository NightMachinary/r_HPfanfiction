Yes I wanted to write an interesting story about two people just trying to cope with a difficult situation and move on with their lives, rather than them being pulled into some stupid romance unwillingly. Like how would you have a job, or a family, or children in that scenario? What kinds of things would you have to learn to accept or give up for the sake of your new bonded life with this other person, where you can't be apart literally?

At best they became like roommates just living together, but still living separate lives. :)
