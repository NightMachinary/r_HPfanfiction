I agree with you. I guess in all the stories I've read in the HP fandom somehow destiny is involved along with supernatural external forces which makes me question wether the relationship is actually developing naturally or if the characters are just fulfilling their roles. Though I guess some people might argue whether that matters as long as they are happy.
