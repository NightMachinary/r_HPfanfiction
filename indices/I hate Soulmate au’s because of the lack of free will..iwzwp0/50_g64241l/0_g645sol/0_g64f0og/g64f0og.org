Soulmate aus with external forces lowkey feels like gaslighting. Like "Oh? You don't like this person and want nothing to do with them? Too bad! It's destiny so you're in the wrong for resisting it!" And then the characters eventually are forced to be like "Shit bruh u right I /was/ being terrible for resisting fate even though I didn't want this. But whatever in the end it worked out perfectly fine so my feelings must've been stupid and pointless!"
