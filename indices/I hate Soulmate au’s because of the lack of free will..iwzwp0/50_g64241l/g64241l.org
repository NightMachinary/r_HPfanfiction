I agree. Especially when the enemies to lovers troupe is involved (although I also despise that on its own too). I much rather prefer when the soulmate au means that, out of everyone in the universe, those two would have souls that were most compatible.

But also, there's no actual destiny involved. They can just as easily hate eachothers guts and never see eachother again (going off to live their own satisfying lives with other people), as they can get married and live happily ever after with eachother.

It feels more satisfying when they build up the relationship naturally too.
