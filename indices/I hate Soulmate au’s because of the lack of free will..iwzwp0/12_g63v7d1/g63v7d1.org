I had an interesting discussion over in the Harry/Fleur discord about this topic. The general consensus wad that soulbonds, as they are commonly presented, are garbage. But that it could be explored in an interesting manner. The premise we came up with was a situation in which a soulbond is something develops over time between people, and as it develops they begin to be able to sense each others thoughts and emotions, (classic soulbond powers), but that over time the people in the bond will have their consciousness blend together so that it stops being sensing each others thoughts and emotions, and become that they share the same thoughts and emotions. Eventually becoming a single consciousness inhabiting two bodies which is created from the fusion of its constituent consciousnesses.

Story drama could arise from this process as people might be afraid of losing themselves, people with weak personalities might be completely lost in the consciousness of a partner with a more forceful personality.
