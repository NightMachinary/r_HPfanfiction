Yep, although it's not so much an intentional choice to form and develop the bond as it is a natural consequence of being in a close enough relationship with a person, in which case the choice is about being with the person rather than regarding the bond specifically. That way it is impossible to separate the relationship from the bond, and the only way to avoid the bond forming is to intentionally limit the relationship. Full on merging of consciousness would probably take significant intentional effort to develop the connection getting to know each other on an extremely intimate level, but after a while being in a relationship the initial stages of the bond are unavoidable.
