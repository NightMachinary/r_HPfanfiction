Oh! This! I absolutely hate this! This is especially true with those posessive mates who likes to cut the other from society. I always get confused because I keep seeing comments going like 'aww, someones jealous hehe'. But the other character shows signs of being socially inept due to the social isolation, people get angry at them. Like... What??? Did??? You??? Expect???
