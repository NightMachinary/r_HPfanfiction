I love enemies to lovers! The only problem I have is when authors put this cosmic force were they are basically bound to each other and it's their “destiny” to be together. Because then I question if they actually gradually fell in love or is it just the predestination that is dictating their action. If they will inevitably fall in love then there is no suspense for me. But if the trope is enemies to lovers with lots of conflicts and they fall in love despite there being no external force just because they chose to it makes me more excited. But I totally get your point too. I am personally a very stubborn person so when someone tells me that I will “inevitably” make that decision or make any such other claims I purposefully do the opposite so I guess soulmates in a way triggers the helplessness of other people saying “ I told you so” you were meant for each other etc...
