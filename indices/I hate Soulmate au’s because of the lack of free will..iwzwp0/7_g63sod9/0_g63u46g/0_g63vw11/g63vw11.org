Soulmates definitely isn't for everyone haha. I think I like soulmates because when I was younger, before I got into Harry Potter fanfics, I would read books on the supernatural and it's just so common for vampires and werewolves to have soulmates. So I was already okay with the trope. I get how not having a choice could be off putting. Usually with soulmates you /can/ walk away. It's just no one will ever be as perfect for you. There is one book I read where not being with your soulmate can kill you. And it was off putting actually. I didn't like it at all. The author made it clear if you reject your soulmate then you'll die, but then the characters in the book were all like “he can leave me at any moment! Find someone new and forget about me!” Etc. Definitely off putting and confusing.
