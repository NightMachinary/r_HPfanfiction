I absolutely /love/ stories with soulmates - and all I read is basically enemies to lovers. I love the conflict there, I love how the author has to be talented enough to somehow make two people so /wrong/ for each other /right/ for each other. Like Beauty and the Beast. “Just a little change small to say the least”.

I get where having no choice in the matter could be off putting. I've only read one book where they had no choice, though they weren't soulmates, that actually put me off of it. This was just because Harry was so against it. Even in the ending of the series he was still so against it. It was a confusing and just freaking sad read. Harry would start to be like “this is ok. I could love him.” Then bam! “this is so wrong. I'm traumatized. Omg he held my hand ew.” I dunno if it was intentional by the author or if she couldn't think of any other form of conflict but it sucked, which is really sad cuz it's not as popular as a pairing but I don't even wanna reread it. So, I definitely see where your coming from. I like the tropes but I don't want it to be forced or basically non-con the entire way through it. I like for Harry to have a good ending at least, even if this pairing wasn't Harry's first choice.
