I've never liked them either, but a very close friend loved them and I'm currently working on one to try and make the trope work.

My way of fixing it is that the bond only indicates an extremely high level of compatibility. They aren't punished for being apart or trapped. In fact, only one person in the pairing is even aware of the bond and has no clue why the other is around him ALL. THE. TIME.

If the one that felt the bond wasn't a lovesick romantic it would go nowhere.
