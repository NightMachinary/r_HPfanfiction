Try [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/White_Knight_Grey_Queen/index/][White Knight, Grey Queen]] by Jeconais for a Pansy pairing. This is a completed story. Some stories on the site require a login; I don't think this one does, but my browser logs me in automatically.

linkffn(Maybe They Did Know What They Were Doing by ArielSakura) is another Pansy pairing. Unfinished.

linkffn(Unfortunately Unbreakable by Luan Mao). Complete, Pansy pairing (sorta).

In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sun Source by Clell65619), Harry is enamored of Millicent, but doesn't end up with her. That one's complete, but rated M.

I've read another story recently where Harry does marry Millicent, but the title's not coming to me at the moment. Basically, he enters into a betrothal with her for various reasons, and they let it stand. As I recall, it's not a major part of the plot.
