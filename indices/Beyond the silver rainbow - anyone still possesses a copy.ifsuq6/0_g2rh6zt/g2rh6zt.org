I thought I had a link but I was wrong. Sorry. I'm super bummed about this, myself. Been shipping this pair myself about as long as you have :)

"A Letter from Exile One Merciful Morning" was something of a fic of that fic, so if you haven't yet, you can search for it at FFN or Ashwinder. If you don't have an Ashwinder account yet, get thee to [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/]] and take note of the message on the homepage about how to finish a registration while they work out the bugs in their email system. Ashwinder is my go-to SSHG archive.

If you like the early SSHG stuff, I can strongly recommend the entire archive from [[https://web.archive.org/web/20150124064557/http://www.witchfics.org/][witchfics.org on the wayback]] which is all pre-2007 Snapefic with a strong leaning toward SSHG. If you haven't read their stuff yet, I'd say Anna's "Roman Holiday" trilogy has all the best bits of early SSHG: adventures both within Hogwarts and around the world, sex both sweet and kinky, angst out the wazoo, a both literally and figuratively "lemon" of a potions explosion... This archive is also where you'll find Hecate's "Pawn to Queen" which is a classic unfinished work that's heavily influenced by Anne Bishop (yay!) and Abby's "The Other Side of Darkness" which was one of the first SSHG fics where I thought they were both kept very true to their characters.

I hope these recommendations are some small consolation for the apparent loss of our ship's seminal fic.

And here's a shot in the dark -- any chance you know where to find Marrach (I think that was the title)? Can't find this fic /anywhere/ but it was another early one that I'm fairly certain I found on a Tripod webring. Tthe opening line was something like "Hermione was running for her life" and that first scene involved some torture where she was burned with runes, and Dumbledore took one look at the results and passed her off to Snape because he's the only one who might know a thing or two about such a dark rite and be willing to help her. No worries if you got nothing on this one, but as long as I had another person here appreciating the early stuff I have to ask!
