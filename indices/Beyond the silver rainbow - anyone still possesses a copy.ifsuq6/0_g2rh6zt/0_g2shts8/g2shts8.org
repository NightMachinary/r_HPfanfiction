I have read /A letter/ and loved it! That is actually what prompted me to look for /beyond the silver rainbow/. Beautifully written.

Despite being a fairly early SS/HG shipper, I took a long hiatus - only started re-reading HP and SS/HG fanfics a few years back. I've missed some classic stuff but I am catching up. I will definitely checkout witchfics! It's super nice coming across another SSHG fan :)
