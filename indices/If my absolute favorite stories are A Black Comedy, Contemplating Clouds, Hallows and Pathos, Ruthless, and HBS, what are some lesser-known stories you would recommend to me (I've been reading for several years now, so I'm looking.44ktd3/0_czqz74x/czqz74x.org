/Hallows and Pathos/? Coolness--glad you liked it!

I suspect you've read these, but linkffn(By the Divining Light by enembee) and linkffn(Conlaodh's Song by enembee) are outstanding.

A few other, more obscure stories that I think are worth checking out: linkffn(Simple and Clean by Digifruit), linkffn(What lies beneath by Master Slytherin), linkffn(The Human Condition by C. K. Talos), linkffn(Harry and the Hobgoblins by Respitechristopher) (because you like Contemplating Clouds).
