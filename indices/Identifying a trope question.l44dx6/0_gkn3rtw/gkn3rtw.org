If Harry is the main character, the trope you're looking for is [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarringSmurfette][Starring Smurfette]]. If he's not, it's [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneGuy][The One Guy]]. [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple][The Smurfette Principle]] is the same thing with the genders reversed.

And if they are more than just friends, there are plenty of harem tropes that might apply.
