The professors always turn a blind eye to amortentia at Valentine's Day. It's always bothered me; isn't Valentine's supposed to be about love, not coercion? Though, I never expected it to go this far.

Neville royally fucked up his potion today. Don't ask me how: I was watching his every move, trying to prevent the explosion-induced Snape meltdown that left Neville ready to leap off the astronomy tower, but I must have missed something. Somehow, he managed to bollocks-up the wart-removal potion so badly that he produced instead a passable amortentia. How he did it, I don't know. But I knew as soon as I smelled the washing powder my parents use, the distant disinfectant of their dental clinic, the soft scent of mum's washed hair, that he'd made amortentia. I've never loved anyone more than my parents.

Neville looked about to cry, and not just because he fucked up his potion. I only just heard his whisper, "mum? dad?" What I didn't expect, was for the Great Bloody Bat himself, to choke a sob and run out the door.

"What was that all about?" Trust Harry to be clueless. "Neville accidentally brewed amortentia, Harry. What do you smell?"

Harry bent over her and Neville's cauldron, almost close enough for his mop of black hair to touch the bubbling liquid within. "I.... I don't know. It doesn't really smell like anything."

Harry's green eyes met mine, and the confusion in his gaze made my heart ache. "Well, it's not proper amortentia anyway, I'm sure the real deal will work better. Let's vanish this potion before it causes any issues, hey?" Harry waved his wand, and the potion vanished from the cauldron.

Snape never came back to conclude the lesson, so we bottled up and left for our next class. Harry and Ron had divination, I had arithmancy. I almost wish I'd kept divination: if I'd gone, I would've seen that Harry wasn't there, and I would've saved all this from happening.

-Harry-

I thought that smell must be my parents. It wasn't that I didn't smell anything, just that I didn't recognise it, and I figured slipping off somewhere to drink a little would answer my question of who I was smelling quite nicely.

If I'd read my textbook, I'd know that drinking amortentia even once is practically a deathtrap: the potion is addictive, twists up your idea of how to love until you're lusting after your parents and doting on your friends like they're your own children. If I'd read my textbook, the whole castle wouldn't be addicted to amortentia right now. But I didn't, and here we are.

I had indeed vanished the potion: to the place where the vanished things go. And so, I wasn't surprised when I stepped into the room of requirement and found Neville's amortentia bubbling gently in a pewter cauldron, barely ten steps from the door. A silver spoon fell into my hand and I stepped towards the cauldron. Just a little taste, I told myself.

I drank the whole lot, and decided I didn't quite care who I was in love with as long as I felt like this, the room swaying around me while shades of red dance around my eyes, every sensation but love drawn from me: a deep love, sickening in its intensity, but I didn't care about it then, I only cared that I loves everyone in the castle so much that I needed to share with them this wonderful feeling, this bone-deep love.

At least, the potion told me it was love. And I was so blinded by this 'love' that I didn't notice my magical core slowly burning into dust, didn't notice my mind filling with fog and my pants tenting, didn't feel my body moving without my mind to brew another cauldron full, and felt only the incredible pleasure of the 'love.'

I went down to the kitchen, to see Dobby and his fellow house-elves. They've lived in misery so long, the least I can do is bring them this beautiful, burning warmth that filled my body and mind. I offered them the cauldron and spoon, and Dobby told them I was trustworthy.

Maybe the real me was, but this creature in my body now was most certainly not.

The elves drank the amortentia. Have you ever seen a house-elf orgy? It was mesmerising, the dance of a thousand bodies filled with the same warmth, the same passion, the same beautiful love, where you lose where you start and where they begin. Where I lost myself in the myriad shades of pale skin and the glittering jets of white pouring from everyone, pouring from myself, the pleasure driving me even higher into my amortentia-induced bliss.

It didn't take much to convince them it would be fun to sneak amortentia into everyone's food.

-Dumbledore-

I've never had a need to test my food beforehand in peacetime, and this meal was no different. Perhaps I should've known, from the smell of Grindelwald's aftershave that seemed to follow me around, that something was wrong. But I was too lost in the memory of my last visit to my love, the way his glittering grey eyes sparked when he spat at me, the way my heart plummeted as I knew he was truly, truly gone.

None of the other professors raised the alarm. We were all trapped in memories, trapped in visions of the ones we loved. And once we sipped our pumpkin juice, once the succulent morsels of house-elf mastery touched our lips, that love turned to lust.

I do not care to remember what followed. I can scrub my body a million times over and it will still never remove the fingerprints of a thousand underage bodies from my skin. My mind and body were not mine to control, but that does not remove the regret.

My school has become an amortentia den. My sweet boy Harry at the head of it, addicted so firmly that nothing will shake him from his amortentia daze. I knew I would fail that boy when I heard that prophecy, knew I'd fail him by raising him like a pig to slaughter. I never expected to fail him like this.

I can only hope that Voldemort is as susceptible to amortentia as he is, and the two addicts spend their lives in dismal bliss instead of war.

-Hermoine-

Harry never comes to the common room anymore. He spends his time in the Room, brewing amortentia. The same amortentia I see being slipped into people's drinks, the same amortentia that drives my housemates to confess their love only to receive a verbal- and sometimes physical- kick to the head.

The Harry I knew would never have wanted to bring such cruelty. The Harry I knew would never have wanted to cripple his friends with addiction to a mindless drug, to a false love. But Harry is gone, permanently gone in the throes of amortentia and its unyielding grip. Perhaps it would be easier if I drank from the cauldron too, if I slipped away to the burning lust that I will never call love, and never surfaced again.
