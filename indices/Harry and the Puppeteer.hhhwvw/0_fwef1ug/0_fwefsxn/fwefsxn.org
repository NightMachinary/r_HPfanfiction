The puppeteer is a creepypasta. He is usually greyscale I believe, with eyes and mouth that glow gold, and golden strings he can control people with(hence the name puppeteer). I only know what I know because of SteamGeek01 on ffn and Madame Macabre's puppeteer song 'Golden Strings', but I believe he needs to kill to exist, but he sorta feels bad about it(he's an anti-hero), so he primarily targets people who are depressed, usually those who want to commit suicide but are to scared to do it. Someone in the comments of the song mentioned that, especially during the summers after fourth and fifth year, Harry would definitely have been depressed enough to be a target.
