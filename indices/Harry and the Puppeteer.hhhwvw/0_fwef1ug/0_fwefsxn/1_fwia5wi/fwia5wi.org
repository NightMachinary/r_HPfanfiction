Ah, okay. Creepypasta is like the Slenderman thing, right? As you may have guessed, they're not really my area. :D

Could work though, yeah. Then, I'd suggest a taunting from Dudley over Harry being sad, because 'The Puppeteer will come get you'. Maybe have him and his mates chant something tauntingly around Harry, and his accidental magic interacts with the song to summon/bring into being the actual Puppeteer.

Could even take it to another level - since it feels guilt over what it does, there could be an interesting story in the eldritch-creature Puppeteer raising Harry, while constantly fighting it's inbuilt instinct/desire to feed on him.
