  Slendy(as the fandom likes to call him) is sorta the original one/the one that got creepypasta noticed.

Ah, okay. Cool. And yeah, I just meant him as the 'big example'. I know it's sort of like Urban Legends and such. Have you ever looked at the SCP Foundation archives? They're a similar thing, but a bit more 'Organisation formed to deal with them' than 'a scary story someone told me one time'. Also, The Magnus Archives, if you like the 'scary story' vibe and are alright with podcasts. :)

I know that feeling. I'm currently on 15 WIPs and resisting the urge to start more. Back when I still believed I had that ever elusive 'free time'. :D

But I hope you get to it, or someone takes up this prompt for you. It's a fun idea. :)
