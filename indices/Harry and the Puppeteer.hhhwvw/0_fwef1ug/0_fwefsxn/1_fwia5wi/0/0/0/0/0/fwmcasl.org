Yeah, the worst part is that they all have complicated, overlapping universes. I think the weirdest may be Raven's Feathers, but that's because I've been trying to not make any of the characters too op. Considering, Frisk has a hold on monster magic and teaches the rest of her friend group. She's also a hybrid, but she's a wolf monster hybrid, which is why she can use monster magic, because that's actually the origin of wizards in this au, humans who bred with monsters. Frisk and the others just have closer relations. I have entire universes in my head and I need to write them out without forgetting anything simply because it's common knowledge to me.
