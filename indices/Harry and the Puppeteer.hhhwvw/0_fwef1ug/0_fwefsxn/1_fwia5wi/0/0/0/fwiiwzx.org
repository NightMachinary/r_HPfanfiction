  Have you ever looked at the SCP Foundation archives?

Not the official ones but there's a series of short comics I watch on YouTube.

And for the WIPs thing, yeah. I have, let's see,

The Puppet Master(my current title), which is a fnaf crossover(most of it is just notes saved in my memo app).

Pheonix, which is a creepypasta crossover.

The Misadventures Of Hadrian And Hermione Pines, which is a Gravity Falls crossover with lots of gay and eventual Drarry, also stars self-insert OC Maddie Devon.

Draco Black, which has nothing but a vague idea.

Death's Child, a Mod!Harry thing I drew art for.

Raven's Feathers, a Undertale crossover with a lot more of my version of Frisk and a lot less of the Monsters(until sometime after PoA).

The Convergence, which is more going to be a series of One-shots that are all vaguely connected centered around different versions of people from my stories interacting. They don't have much impact in the main stories but all the shots are canon to them.

The Funtime Series, which is a multi-crossover that starts with Hp and Fnaf, Creepypasta comes in slightly after Fourth Year, and Maddie is once again an established character.

Many half-abandoned Return fics

Another creepypasta hp crossover that's missing a name

And I asked one of my favorite authors on ffn if I could adopt an old fnaf hp crossover that was abandoned.

Wow. I need to not only finish these all, but get a ffn account so they aren't just sitting around in my docs.
