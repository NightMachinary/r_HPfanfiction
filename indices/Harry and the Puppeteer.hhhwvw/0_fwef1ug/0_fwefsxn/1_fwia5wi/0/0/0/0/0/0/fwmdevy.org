Heh. Yeah, it does sound like you need to sit down and actually write down your world/setting/plot ideas stuff and get it organised in your head before you write the story. Trust me, it helps, both with writing and with keeping it from stick around too much in your brain - a decade of running Dungeons and Dragons has taught me that. Writing your worlds helps keep them straight where just remembering them doesn't.
