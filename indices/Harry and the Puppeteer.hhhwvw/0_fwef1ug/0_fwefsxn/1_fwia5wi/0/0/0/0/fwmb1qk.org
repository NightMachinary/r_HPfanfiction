Sounds like a fun bunch. Might be worth picking one and getting that FFN account. Add the rest once you're used to working on just one. Though remember, you might not have however much time you have now in the future. I certainly didn't have as much as I thought I would when I started all of mine. :D

None of my current WIPs are Harry Potter - they're all Life is Strange AUs: I've got one with Firewatch, one with Dead Space, one with Arrowverse and Stranger's Wrath, one with Leverage, etc.
