  Creepypasta is like the Slenderman thing, right?

Yeah pretty much. There's much more to it, but Slendy(as the fandom likes to call him) is sorta the original one/the one that got creepypasta noticed.

As for everything else, that's a good idea! If I ever do get around to writing this(bc I have like six stories all simultaneously being written right now) prompt, I'll be sure to use some of it :D
