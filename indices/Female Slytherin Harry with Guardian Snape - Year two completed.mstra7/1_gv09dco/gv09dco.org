Congratulations!

I'm really enjoying your work.

I must admit I was a bit confused with the name of the character, I thought it would be a plot point or something and wasn't very into it but I was on the mood for Snape guardian so I gave it a try. I did not regret it.

I love all the care you put into children psychology, and Rachel's development. The pace is good and most importantly the events of the books happen in a very different manner and still manage to be a very big part of the plot.

I'm so looking forward to the next update! :)
