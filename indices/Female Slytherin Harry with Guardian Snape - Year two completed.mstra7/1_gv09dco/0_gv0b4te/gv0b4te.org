Thanks so much for giving it a try, I'm glad you're enjoying it.

I didn't realize there would be this much confusion about her name, but it's definitely too late now. Oh well.

I'm glad that you found that there wasn't too much canon rehashing. I wanted to stay relatively close to canon, but approach it from another angle and have different end results. I really think that canon Harry wouldn't have gotten into so much danger if he'd had a responsible adult around (probably why he didn't).

Thanks again! I update every Saturday.
