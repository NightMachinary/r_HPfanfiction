#+begin_quote
  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

  Rachel Snow has a lot to look forward to after her first year at Hogwarts. She's living with Professor Snape - her new guardian - and she has a group of friends who she can't wait to see again. She's ready for her second year at Hogwarts to be full of learning new things, making new friends, and having new adventures. However, her second year isn't without its own problems.
