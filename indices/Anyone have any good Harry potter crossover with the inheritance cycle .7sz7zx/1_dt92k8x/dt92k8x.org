there are 3 that i enjoyed, but 2 have fem!Harry/Eragon, and idk if you'd enjoy that. They're also based of one another, with "Slowly" being the "original one". Both authors are friends and allowed this, don't worry. The other one is abandonned, but it was abandonned after the end of an arc, so it isn't that bad.

linkffn(By Courage and Love by najex)

linkffn(Slowly, And Then All At Once)

linkffn(To Train A Dragon Rider) - is the one that's abandoned.
