The only one apart from those listed already I could recommend is linkffn(The last Dragonrider by Zenzao), the update schedule is tortuously slow and there really isn't much there, but I do remember really enjoying what there is. Definitely read the Elder Scrolls crossover thats been linked too, my favourite story from the inheritance cycle by far.
