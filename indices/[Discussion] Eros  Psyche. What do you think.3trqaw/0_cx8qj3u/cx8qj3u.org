I really like Eros & Psyche! The smut is , well , smut -- can't comment on that too much. The plot is really intriguing, and yes there is one! There's a whole lot of character too, and the relationships that form. I originally went into this knowing that it would lead to a Dramione romance (and not hate/love relationship), so I expected the same for the other pairings, but things actually take a turn for the darker side and it's not in the form of drama. There was a particular scene later on that really, really creeped me out.

I wish the author updated more though -- and I also really liked another one of her fics, a Scorpius/Rose and Draco/Hermione fic (can't remember the name) where the Malfoy line is a Veela line XD
