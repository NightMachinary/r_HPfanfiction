I only read the HerimioneDraco, HarryTracy, GinnyBlaise and interlude parts, unless they mentioned something interesting in these parts. Reason is that I cared little to none for all the others. What interested me the most and set this fic appart, other than the above average smut, was the HarryTracy relationship and the canon compliant and quite possible past. I also found it interesting how that Ginnys past with the CoS came into play, most fics just ignore that part of her past, but here it really made her.

Edit: Spelling error
