If it's any consolation they are my two least favourite as well -- hate the accent the author writes Seamus with, and I'm not a fan of femdom but at least this femdom isn't --- ball-busting kinda thing (I know, it's a rather broad generalization but that's generally what comes to mind). I think there isn't much in the LavSeamus part, think the only thing you need to know is Seamus's secret and also Lav cut herself with the card at some point? (I think all the girls do. I really wish they'd update so I can find out the significanceeeeee)
