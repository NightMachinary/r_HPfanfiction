Its honestly one of the best smuts I've ever read. I'm impressed about the character development and how they're applied. Not with all characters, mind you. I find Nott and Seamus are unnecessary and I skipped their chapters.

The most amazing thing is that this is (maybe the only) fic where I find Hermione and Draco to be somewhat believable.

Its definitely worth recommending if someone asks for smut with plot.
