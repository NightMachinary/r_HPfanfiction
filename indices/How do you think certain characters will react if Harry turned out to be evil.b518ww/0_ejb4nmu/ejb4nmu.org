It depends on when Harry turned evil. Given the crap all of them went through in canon, a Harry turning evil and radical after the War would find plenty of loyal followers, such as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167).

Of course, there is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Hocrux]], linkffn(10677106), in which he's evil right from the start. But he hides well and thrives in the chaos he created.
