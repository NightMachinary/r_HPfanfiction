I think Hermione has a much higher potential for turning evil. While she is against breaking rules just for the sake of breaking rules, she has no problem doing so for a good reason, like setting Snape on fire to save Harry. She's a genius with a lot of potential, she can be really scary when she gets angry, she's ruthless against traitors (cursed DA contract) and she is rejected from society because of bigotry.

Harry grew up in a bad situation and the magical world is a massive improvement over the Dursleys. He's unlikely to want to destroy it. Hermione in the other hand grew up in a good situation in the muggle world and is met by massive bigotry in the magical world. I can see her recruiting other muggleborns to overthrow the ruling pureblood elite.

Attempting to overthrow the government and killing important pillars of society like Malfoy would make her just as evil as Voldemort in the eyes of many, but if she succeeds and installs a democracy instead of the antiquated hereditary system she'd be the greatest hero ever. History is written by the victors after all...
