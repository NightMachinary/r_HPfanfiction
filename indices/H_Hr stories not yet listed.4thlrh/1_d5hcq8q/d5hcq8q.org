  3rd through 7th year story, generally canon but with plenty of AU-goodness. Harry struggles to survive his ever-violent relatives during the summer before his third year at Hogwarts. He dreams of Hogsmeade visits and stumbles through the murky waters of steadily growing and complex relationships. Darkness looms in the distance but will they see the darkness lurking from within?
