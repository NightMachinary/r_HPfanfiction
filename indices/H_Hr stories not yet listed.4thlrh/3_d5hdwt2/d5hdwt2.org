linkffn(darkness ascendant by Cole Pascal) is likely going to be Harry/Hermione but it may end up being H/Hr/OFC or H/OFC or maybe H/Hr/OFC/Tonks if I feel like I'm up to writing a polyamourous quadrangle. (NOT a harem fic as all women will also be involved with each other if I do do it(so if Harry and Tonks are on date night, then Hermione and OFC are on their own date night)).

Or I may write harry as asexual and only involved with anyone sexually to procreate. I dunno yet. I still have a long time to figure it out.
