Lol well yeah Searching For The Power is probably the best Harem fic I've read, it's the only one where the girls actually seem like different people. So kudos to you for that. My only complaint with it really is that the end seems really sudden, it takes 30 chapters to get to the end of the summer then the final term takes like 5 chaps... but that might just be me wanting the delightful smut to continue for as long as possible.
