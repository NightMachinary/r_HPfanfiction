I've read all of these and I will recommend To Fight the Coming Darkness and Junior Inquisitor, I will say Junior Inquisitor has probably one of the most outlandishly evil/manipulative Dumbledore I've ever read.

I also want to say Not the Only Redhead gets...weird to say the least near the end. It is also very heavy on the bashing from what I remember and not in the way you'd expect.
