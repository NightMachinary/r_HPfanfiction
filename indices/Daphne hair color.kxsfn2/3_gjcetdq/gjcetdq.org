Some people assumed a background character from the Order of the Phoenix movie is Daphne, who just so happens to be blonde. This has never been confirmed (and doesn't matter regardless) but people originated the idea from there and ran with it, and it then intersected with the Ice Queen trope.

That's why she is normally seen as blonde. But since she has no canon hair colour (and her sister, Astoria, was depicted with darker hair in DH part 2) some also like to give her a different hair colour.
