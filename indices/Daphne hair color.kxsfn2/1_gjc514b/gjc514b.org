Her hair colour isn't stated in canon. It's popular to give her blonde hair as part of the Ice Queen trope, but it's not at all necessary. In two fanfictions I've written involving Daphne, I gave her dark hair, mostly just to be contrarian.

It's worth noting that in an old essay on Harry and his 39 classmates, called /Secrets of the Classlist/, it's explained that the Greengrass surname implies a particular location (East Anglia) and ancestry (Anglo-Saxon), which fits the blonde-hair stereotype.
