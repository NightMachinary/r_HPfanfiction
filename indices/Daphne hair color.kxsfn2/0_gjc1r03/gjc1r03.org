Daphne appears just once in the entire series and is just a name:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione's name was called. Trembling, she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle and Daphne Greengrass.
#+end_quote

-/Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix/, ch 31.

There's no mention of how Daphne looks (or even which house she's in). So she's basically a blank slate.
