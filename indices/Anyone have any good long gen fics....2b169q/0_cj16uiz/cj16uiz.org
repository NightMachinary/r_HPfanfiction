To start off with, I'd recommend checking the stories from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/940359/jbern][jbern]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1077111/DobbyElfLord][DobbyElfLord]].

Then there is nonjon's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]].

Or perhaps [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][The Unforgiving Minute]]. Or if you like Dark!Harry, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]]. Or perhaps [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6763981/1/The-Dark-Lord-s-Equal][The Dark Lord's Equal]], or even [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6849022/1/An-Old-and-New-World][An Old and New World]], both from Lens of Sanity. Or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5714450/1/The-Crow-Phoenix-Rising][The Crow: Phoenix Rising]]. If JBern's Bungle in the Jungle writing style isn't your thing, you can try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5915140/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Cursed-Summer][Harry Potter and the Cursed Summer]], another curse-breaker summer vacation adventure.

For comedy, in addition to several of nonjon's stories, there is of course [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]]. Then there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4532363/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sun-Source][Harry Potter and the Sun Source]]. Or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][A Mother In Law's Love]] from Perspicacity (who has several other good stories).
