I'm not quite certain. I already have plans for the stories after my current ones end, and it's a bit close to the crack fic idea I had, where Harry inherits some shady obligations from Sirius (who claims to be too sick after Azkaban to deal with it) and has to handle weird demands and contracts for he "family business".
