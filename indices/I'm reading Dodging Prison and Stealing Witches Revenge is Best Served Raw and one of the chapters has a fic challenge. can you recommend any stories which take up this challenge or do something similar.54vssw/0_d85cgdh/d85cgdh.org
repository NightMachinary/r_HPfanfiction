Hm. Sounds a bit too corny. I'm not certain why the wizards would call actions they think are fine and dandy "crimes".

I'd prefer a story where Harry is the heir of a criminal syndicate, in Wizarding Britain. James and Lily fought Voldemort, but were not part of the Order, but allies of Dumbledore out of neccessity. After their deaths, Remus kept it running, but couldn't approach Harry because that would have exposed him to the authorites. Sirius is in Azkaban because the DMLE finally could pin something on him. Dumbledore knew the charges were false, but since Sirius dodged murder charges before, he thought it was karma catching up with the man. Snape hates James for dragging Lily into a world of crime and vice, and thinks Harry will do the same. He also hates Sirius and Remus for almost killing him and making it look like a tragic accident with a werewolf, James only saved him beause Lily told him to. Petunia and Vernon hated Lily and James not because of magic, but because they ran drugs, protection rackets and an escort service - they are not lying when they tell him Lily and James were criminals.
