  Of all of the possible endings to "Voldemort is after you and your family," James hasn't expected this one. It should be Lily who survived, not himself. Nevertheless, he's alive. And he has a toddler to raise. Oh, and Sirius is in Azkaban, Remus hates him, and he has no idea what to do. But when you've hit rock bottom, the only way out is up.
