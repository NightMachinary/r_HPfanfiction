Thanks! My goal is to publish weekly, with brief hiatuses while I write ahead. I'm nearly done with the next four chapters, so hopefully there'll be a chapter every week in July. As for final length...I'm anticipating maybe 12 more chapters? I don't want to commit to a number though; it's already gotten so much longer than anticipated, so who knows?
