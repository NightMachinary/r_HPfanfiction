Fair critiques, thank you. It's a combination of incompetence, a world still recovering from years of terror, misinformation being spread (the Prophet is, was, and always will be trash), a legal system that is completely useless but still has to process actual criminals, a backlog of said actual criminals - including within the ranks of Ministry employees - and above all, the need for a scapegoat. And Sirius is it. Also, James's priorities are a bit...skewed, I suppose, at twenty-one years. He's trying to adjust to life as the primary caretaker of a toddler. It's been about three weeks, max, in-story. Lily was buried a week after James wakes up, and he went back two weeks after that. My guy James Potter's got a trial coming up with Wizarding Family Services, after which he'll work on the utter joke that is the Wizarding legal system.

Thanks again for your comments, though. You've given me a fair bit of work to do, and may have broken my writer's block!
