I have some problems regarding chapters 5-7. Since James is alive and knows that Sirius Black is innocent, why isn't anything done about it? Sure, we can say that James was in shock and need some time to process what happened. After a few days, James still keeps telling everyone in the Order that Peter was the secret keeper, so then why is he being ignored and brushed off?

In canon, Sirius Black was imprisoned without a trial because of general incompetence and the lack of witnesses, but here James is alive, so why is there not a trial, and why are people still ignoring James?
