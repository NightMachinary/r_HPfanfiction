  I grew up imagining myself as Harry, going on adventures with him and Ron and Hermione.

  Also, it didn't matter that you failed at your ultimate goals of making something of yourself, because these magical objects will show up and give you a loophole with which to defeat your nemesis with love.

These are, simply, misplaced expectations born from a fundamental misunderstanding of what makes Harry tick. He doesn't care about adventures, he doesn't care about making something of himself, and he certainly doesn't care that his victory was handed to him. The only time he ever applied himself throughout the course of the books was when a crisis was imminent.

All he ever cared about was being perfectly normal and living an average family life. He is the magical equivalent of the Dursleys.
