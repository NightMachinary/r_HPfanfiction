Think you've been confusing fanfiction and canon, mate. I see that normal thing a lot in fanfiction.

Harry definitely wants to make something out of himself. Normal unambitious people aren't crazy good Quidditch players who enjoy winning and making a name for themselves. I'm pretty sure Harry thinks about wanting to make a name for himself through Quidditch, something that he's actually done himself (unlike his scar business). Nor do completely normal people want to become Dark wizard hunters.
