Indeed, that and the message it sends ("It's ok to be a lazy fuck, as long as you are willing to die for the people you love" - despite the fact that a more trained Harry might not have killed Sirius (lack of applying himself at learning occlumency is what caused the death of Sirius Black!) and might have been able to save many others/end Voldemort at the graveyard (before his resurrection because he might have been able to duel Pettigrew (who was described as not very good at magic)...yes, he would have come back, but way later, thus giving Harry more time!) etc.) makes me hate canon HP :(

Give me a hero's journey where Harry gets stronger (strong enough to take Voldemort on with help - I never thought Harry would fight him one on one! I always thought that people like Madeye Moody, Shacklebolt, Lupin, Sirius etc. would be there and that some of them might die, but Harry would be able to keep up with them and strike the killing blow (and the power he knows not would be friendship and trust!)) over canon any day...especially if you do without the crapilogue :D
