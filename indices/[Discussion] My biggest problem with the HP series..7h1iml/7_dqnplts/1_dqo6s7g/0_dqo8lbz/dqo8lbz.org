He literally picked up a broom and fell into the seeker position. Him becoming a seeker had absolutely nothing to do with his own initiative, and everything to do with random circumstance and natural talent. Him wanting to be a quidditch star or an auror isn't some grand aspiration, it's him blurting out any old random thing at a career interview he didn't care about or prepare for.

Pretty much all of his great triumphs throughout the series are the exact same thing: he is carried by circumstance (mother's protection, random time travel/deathly hallow shenanigans), or by vastly more competent allies in Hermione and Dumbledore. The most proactive thing he does is learning/teaching defense in book 5, and /even that was mostly as a favor to Hermione/.

Harry has no ambition, really. He spends all of Hogwarts coasting by on the minimum amount of effort possible. This isn't a condemnation of his character, having humble aspirations is perfectly admirable, and it makes sense he would just enjoy basking in normal school life after his experience at the Dursleys. It just makes it really, really questionable that the hat ever seriously considered him for Slytherin.
