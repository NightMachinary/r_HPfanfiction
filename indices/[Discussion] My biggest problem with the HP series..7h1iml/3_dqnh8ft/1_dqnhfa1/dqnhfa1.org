I mean you make a good point. Harry never was particularly bright, but for a while there it looked like he might have real potential.

I definitely read way to many Indy Harry fics during that time period that did nothing to dampen my expectations.

I think it's safe to say that there wasn't much hope of the series living up to my expectations. Doesn't change that it was a pretty disappointing ending (to me).
