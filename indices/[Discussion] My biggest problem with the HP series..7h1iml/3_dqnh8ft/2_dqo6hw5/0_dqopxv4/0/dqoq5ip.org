You could argue he trained himself. He and Hermione, at least. They spent time learning spells they could teach. I think.

  Anyway, my point was that Harry, while lucky and battle-savvy is not a particularly talented wizard. And whatever training he receives he will never be able to defeat Voldemort in a magical combat.

I think he has the potential to be. Not many adults can produce a Patronus. He's just lazy and only puts in real effort in... Quidditch, pretty much.

I agree that he would never defeat Voldemort though. Voldy has 50+ years of experience on him.
