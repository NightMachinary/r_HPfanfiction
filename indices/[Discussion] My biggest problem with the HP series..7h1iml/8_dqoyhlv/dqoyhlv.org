Looking back after reading some great Fanfictions I realized that Rowling wanted to do that whole 7 books of pressure turns Harry into a diamond. But at the end of Book 5 we actually get to see what made her switch course to full Deus ex mode.

The Voldemort/Dumbledore Duel. You can tell it was hard for her to write it which is why she stopped with dueling the way it was shown and dueling becomes rushed running battles where everyone is running around trying to get to Base so they can't be 'It'. Book 6 has no fights until Harry chases the DEs out and the Draco bathroom Duel was at most 4-5 spells? JK found that writing action was too hard said fuck it and found a way out through McGuffins
