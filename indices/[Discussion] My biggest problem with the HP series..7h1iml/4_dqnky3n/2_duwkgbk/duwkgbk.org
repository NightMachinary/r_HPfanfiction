Indeed, great posting! R/Hr makes NO SENSE WHAT SO EVER (Hermione would probably be more attracted to a freaking stone then to freaking Ron "I love shoveling food in my face hole, I don't have manners, I dislike academics and I love being lazy" Weasley :( )

Then there's Harry and Ginny? Sure they fit, but that lovestory lacked development (not to mention that there's more interesting options...how about pairing Harry with a Slytherin who pushes him to be the best he can be and who tells him off every time he's needlessly brave and accomplishes NOTHING! That would be more interesting than H/G and you don't have to go full independent Harry and all adults are idiots (despite the fact that this fits canon to a T! Damned adults were unable to fight their damned war and thus children got dragged into it!))

As for Dumbledore? Yeah, I fully agree...he had the power but lacked the stones to actually use it (snuff the DEs by the dozen and Voldemort will soon run out of them and nobody will want to join him with that high a death-risk!)

Add some cosmetics and contact-lenses (just to make sure!) and you really are saver in a big city with a flat under the fidelius...hell, if not a flat: Use a damned cave, a hunting-cabin etc. etc. but not a damned tent that you constantly move around in!)

They aren't, Dumbledore just still believes some mixture of magicals are better than muggles and he wants to preserve the culture IMHO (and thus he needs the purebloods and most DEs fit the bill!)
