To be honest books six and seven are an utter mess. We had characters doing stupid things before (like flying a car to Hogwarts instead of waiting for the Weasleys to come back out) but the whole "He has horcruxes so let's not even try to kill him" and the "Harry has to take another killing curse for the team" plots are simply bullshit. The relationships are entirely out of the blue with little reason why they are attracted. What does Hermione see in Ron? This is until today one of the biggest mysteries I've ever read. The guy spent five and a half years destroying her sense of self worth but now she thinks he is hot because he actually got himself a girlfriend? And Harry/Ginny is not much better but sends a frankly disturbing message that you just have to be obsessed with somebody and they will fall in love with you. Things do not work that way in real life and if you reverse the gender it gets even more creepy.

The hunt was a retarded idea (just get a flat in Dublin, put it under the fidelius, dye your hair and Voldemort will not find you), Snape's regret does not wash the blood from his hands and Dumbledore' mixture of appeasement and redemption did cost many lives. If anyone with a dark mark gets executed then they could not kill again (and they did). So why are they suddenly the good guys?
