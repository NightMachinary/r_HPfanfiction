Did Harry know that he could actually you know disqualify himself without losing his magic? I think he didn't and thought he needed to do his best (otherwise he'd end up banished back to the Dursleys!), he didn't want to be a champion and in an act of teenage rebellion I guess he would have left the tournament (even if he had to make sure he was disqualified at every task!) if he thought that would work!
