Year 1 was the introduction and did set the tone with incompetent adults driving the plot, which CoS took one step further. PoA had a great plot, lots of Quidditch and a good twist.

GoF was interesting because Harry had little choice but bend over and hope for the best, especially considering the second task. He should have bailed out at the maze after Krum was imperiused but Harry remains a teenager who was about to shut up his "enemies" by winning against all odds. I can see why he did the stupid thing there.

OotP has Harry getting fucked again and trying his best to fight back. Considering what he had to go through it is a small miracle that he did not snap and went on a murder rampage.
