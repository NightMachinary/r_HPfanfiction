I have no idea why she spent so much time on relationship drama in book six. I get that fans loved shipping and the whole "they're teenagers now" thing but it wasn't really done in a way that added anything significant to anyone's character development imo. I wasn't a fan of the main pairings either. Ron and Hermione makes a lot of sense to me within the context of the story as kids; however it's absolutely nuts that they ended up married.
