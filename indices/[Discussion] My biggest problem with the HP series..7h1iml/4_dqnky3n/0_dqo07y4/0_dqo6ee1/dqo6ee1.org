Yeah, I agree. I hate the excuse "They fight like a married couple" that people use. In my experience, married couples who fight that much tend to get divorced. Plus, they have literally /nothing/ in common. I mean, I don't think Harry & Hermione would work all that well either, but at least I'd get it --- if JK Rowling went down that route, that is.
