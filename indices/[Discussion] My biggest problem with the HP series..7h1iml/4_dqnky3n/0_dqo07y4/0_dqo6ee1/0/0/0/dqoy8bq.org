I always thought it should have been just Harry sending Teddy Lupin off at the beginning of his first year and teased what everyone's relationship/parent status was while leaving it up in the air. It would have felt more rounded imo; Teddy is an orphan who lost both parents to Voldemort, but he has a parental figure in Harry to send him off to Hogwarts, that Harry himself didn't have. It wouldn't have shoehorned questionable marriages and children's names while still achieving the same emotional resolution.
