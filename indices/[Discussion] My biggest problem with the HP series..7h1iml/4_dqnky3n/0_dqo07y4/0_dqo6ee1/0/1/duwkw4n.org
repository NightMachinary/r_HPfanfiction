It's never outright stated, but Harry never made fun of her for being an ambitious girl/woman (he might not have shared that ambition with his sad "I want to be just Harry, nothing special! Nothing to see here, move on!" crap...he mentally held himself back IMHO (I think the Patronus showed he has potential because even in the DA only very few could actually cast and maintain the corporeal version in the face of a true dementor and Harry did it way earlier than they did...sadly Harry snuffs that potential out and never really uses it!)), while Ron constantly makes fun of her academics and tries to derail them from learning/spending time in the library etc. :(
