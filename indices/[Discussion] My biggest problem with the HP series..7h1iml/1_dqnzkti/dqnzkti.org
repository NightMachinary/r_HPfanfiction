I hated Deathly Hallows too. The whole Hallows arc was such contrived bullshit totally out of left field. The last half of the book became a "quest" story in pursuit of two more chekovs guns in addition to the first seven. I thought the whole idea of Harry needing to obtain this OP artifact in order to totally defeat Voldemort was stupid as hell.

I was personally dissapointed with Snape. I was just expecting more from his character rather than just being a love-lorn puppy pining after Lily forever. But it appeased the fangirls so what the fuck ever. I'd be more okay with it if JKR hadn't tried to make that fact redeem him completely so much that Harry names his god damn child after him.

I truly think JKR was pushed for time in order to have it finished in line with filming. Or maybe there should have been eight books instead of 7. Who knows what could have made it better.

I love the HP books it was a huge part of my childhood. But I'm still bitter about book seven after all these years. It's also frustrating that there's such blind reverence for the series among fans that it's sometimes seen as sacrilegious to criticize anything about it.
