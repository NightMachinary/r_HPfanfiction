I totally agree, especially with the message this sends ("don't bother, if you need to you'll pull a victory out of a hat - just be ready to die for your friends and everything is ok!" - yeah right! What about the people who wouldn't have died if Harry "I am a lazy shit" Potter had bothered with occlumency (yes, Snape was a shitty teacher and I hate the man, but that doesn't mean that Harry gets a pass...hell, why not ask Sirius, Tonks, Lupin etc. for occlumency advice or even a pureblood like Neville who might know something or at least who to ask?), more magic (he attacks Voldemort with a disarming charm! Damned, I'd rather blow my brains out than attempt that, at least this would lead to a relatively painless death while failing to kill the dark lord leads to torture and a painful death!) and silent-casting!)

Yeah, maybe the hero's journey has been done before, but it still works well (better than this contrived ending and the damned crapilogue!)

I also despise Snape and that he's suddenly important...I think Harry should have ended the man (He's the one who killed Lilly after all, even if she didn't die by his wand! Same for James and he's also the guy who made Harry suffer the Dursleys etc. (every misfortune Harry ever suffered can be attributed to Snape telling Voldemort the prophecy!!!))
