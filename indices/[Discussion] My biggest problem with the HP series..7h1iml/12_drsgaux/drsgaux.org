I love Snape /(mostly thanks to Alan Rickman and fanfiction haha)/, but I agree with most of your points why Book 6 and Book 7 sucked. However, I don't think the books focused too much on Snape, since I absolutely lived for scenes including him. But I hated what JKR decided to do with his character in the end.\\
Before it was revealed, I vehemently DID NOT like the fan-theory that /"Snape loved Lily"/. I wanted Snape to have left the Deatheaters because he was intelligent and finally realized on his own that it was wrong, or self-destructive, or all of the other great reasons fanfic comes up with. AKA it wasn't /"truuu lurve"/ for Lily that saved Snape, but Snape coming to a realization on his own during his time as a Deatheater. AKA Snape actually chooses "good" for the sake of good itself and NOT because of sappy romance.\\
I also hated /how/ she killed Snape. I figured he would die in the end since he's a double-agent, but I wanted him to go out in a "blaze of glory" fighting a super-awesome duel with Voldemort himself. Not get bitten by a snake and die pathetically. ( because we KNOW Snape is a powerful wizard even if we never really get to see him duel a worthy opponent. )\\
I too hated how "lazy" Harry became after book 5. Hermione was the only one doing any studying or preparation for the final battles.\\
I read a lot of fanfics where Snape trains Harry to defeat Voldemort /(usually with a strong emphasis on Occlumency/Legilimency because that is my favorite branch of magic)/. Snape is a sarcastic bastard in those fics (because I hate it if he's too nice), but he does care enough and he's *practical* enough to train Harry to win.\\
I see Snape as a self-sufficient badass, and I wanted him to train Harry into a self-sufficient badass too. :) Even if they always will kinda love-hate each other with a ton of sarcastic banter. Being "nice" to each other is just too boring and unrealistic. But they can make a very badass, pragmatic team to defeat Voldy, because it is totally unrealistic to expect Harry to defeat Voldy alone unless its some kind of special Legilimency trick only he can do because of the horcrux in his brain.

I loved the horcruxes idea. I hated the Hallows, since it was definitely shoehorned into the story badly. I hated the camping quest crap. I wanted to go back to Hogwarts for a least part of the seventh year.
