I personally like Snape so this never troubled me whenever I was reading the books, but admittedly thinking about how much better the books could have been if Harry's arc was given more focus, and if he was realistically characterized as an abused child rather than a Roald Dahl character, does make me a little disappointed that she didn't go that route.
