Late in the series, just before the trio return to the hogwarts, doesn't Harry have this internal debate and he chooses to let go of the hallows and go after the horcruxes?so I believe the hallows didn't help Harry survive but it helped him defeat voldemort,because there is no way in hell Harry is going to defeat voldemort in magical combat in a hundred years..
