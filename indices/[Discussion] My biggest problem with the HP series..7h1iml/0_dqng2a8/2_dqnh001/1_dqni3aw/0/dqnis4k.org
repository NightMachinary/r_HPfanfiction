In the end Harry still survived because of his mother's love/sacrifice* and Voldemort's own mistakes (his huge ego). I agree that the hallows did not help Harry survive, but paved the way for his acceptance of the inevitability of death, and that death is not a terrible thing, or something that can be 'mastered'.**

*Harry's blood carried his mother's sacrifice which only purpose was to protect him from Death By Voldemort. Voldemort took on the blood protection and as long as he lived Harry would be tied to life. poetic justice that love and sacrifice worked just as well as Voldemort's gross and destructive horcruxes (which Harry was also Ha. HAah.)

**I just realised that 'master' of death is almost an oxymoron. And surely to master something you must face and experience it. So to be the master of death is to accept it, as Harry did. The interpretation is there to be taken at face value! But I guess we all must have epiphanies in our own time oops lmao.
