Yeah, I don't think the Hallows were very well done either. They were kind of out of the blue.

I don't know exactly how Harry survived, but the explanation offered by Rowling in DH revolves around this central fact--that Harry understood and accepted that he would die. Now, if the Hallows were in fact why Harry survived, I would think that the very fact that he owned them would be enough. He would not need to believe he would die.

I also don't think using the Hallows as a cheap way to get Harry to survive is Rowling's style. She's very much interested in the abstract throughout the Harry Potter series--she's interested in the power of love, the fear of death, regret and so on. When Harry triumphs over Voldemort or faces his trials, it's never really about how powerful he is or some OP magical item (save his wand). It's always about /emotions/: the loyalty of his friends, the love of his mother, the love Snape had for his mother, etc. Voldemort, on the other hand, relied on material items like Horcruxes and the Elder Wand. If Rowling had Harry survive because of material items like the Hallows, it would basically destroy the entire theme/story she has been building to throughout these seven books, because she has always, /always/ emphasised the defeat of evil through love and loyalty.
