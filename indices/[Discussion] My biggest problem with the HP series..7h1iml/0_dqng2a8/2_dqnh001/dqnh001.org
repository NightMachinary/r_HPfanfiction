Thank you for the thoughtful response.

I don't see how you can say that the Hallows had no impact on his survival. What was even the point of them then, just the symbolism?

I have trouble believing that Rowling added the Deathly Hallows just for that reason

I think your initial statement which you disregarded seems more likely

  Rowlings explanation of it in DH had a somewhat unreliable feel to it

Rowling just did a poor job incorporation the Hallows into the story, which unlike the horcuxes, appear to have been shoehorned into the plot late in the series. Maybe as late as book 6.
