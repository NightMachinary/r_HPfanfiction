I'd actually forgotten about that. I was thinking more along the lines of him refusing the Minister of Magic position several times.

Nevertheless, we don't actually know what the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot and the Supreme Mugwump of the ICW do. I always thought they were rather ceremonial positions, but there's no evidence from any source to indicate whether they were one way or the other. But as for the Headmaster position... well, it's not really supposed to be a powerful position, is it? You're just the leader of an institute of education. Granted, the position holds more weight given that there seems to be a very limited number of schools, but the Headmaster really shouldn't have much say in anything outside the sphere of education. I think we fans give more weight to the Headmaster position because of /who/ holds it in the Harry Potter series. I mean, when you think about Armando Dippet, do you think of him as a highly influential wizard? Because I don't.
