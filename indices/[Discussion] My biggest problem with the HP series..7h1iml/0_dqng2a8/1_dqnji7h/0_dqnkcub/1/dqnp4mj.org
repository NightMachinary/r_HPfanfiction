Actually I would have to disagree and say that Dumbledore put himself into as many positions of power as possible that were worth while.

- Head of International Confederstion of Wizards. This gives direct global influence, regardless of it being a figurehead or not.
- Head of the Wizengamot of Britain. This gives him direct influence on laws AND the enforcement of said laws, once again regardless of it being a figurehead or not.
- Headmaster of the most prominent and influential school in all of Britain. Not only does being Headmaster give you influence to the students that he once instructed as transfiguration professor but also influences the future leaders of Britain which are the children (and their families). Commanding the respect of those in political positions simply by being seen as a guardian during their formative years could have a very real influence on a persons actions later in life, specifically in this individuals are part of the wizengamot. See where I'm going here? Playing the long game here in this position even if it is mostly just because he loves Hogwarts and teaching. I would also like to mention that a british youth representative who is under 17 yo sometimes is in the Wizengamot so maybe that could have some sort of influence being the headmaster of said youth.
- Held the Elder Wand. Weildable power to influence others into either being awestruck by his power or fearful of crossing him, an exclusion being Voldemort as seen during their battle in the Ministry.

I would say that Dumbledore wanted himself in as many adventageous positions as possible while giving himself some wiggle room by not being quoted in the papers constantly and being asked every single little meaningless decision. I would disagree that Dumbledore didn't trust himself with power. He knew how to use it and knew what positions were the best net-positive for him.
