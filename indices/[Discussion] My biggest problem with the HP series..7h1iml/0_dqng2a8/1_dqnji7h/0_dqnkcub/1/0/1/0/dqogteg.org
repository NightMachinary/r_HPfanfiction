Well, he's still very manipulative. He just isn't as influential/powerful as his positions would suggest. And none of his manipulations in Harry's life really had anything to do with the legitimate authority he could wield. His schemes were effective mainly because of his personal position in Harry's life--Harry saw him as a wise and powerful wizard who cared for him and wanted the best for him. That's why Dumbledore could influence Harry so much, not because he was Supreme Mugwump/Chief Warlock. Maybe a little because he was Headmaster.
