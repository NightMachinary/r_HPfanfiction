Very well written response thanks ðŸ˜‹. I can see what you're saying and I guess I am being presumptuous to assume those positions, while possibly holding no real administrative power, would still allow more influence then just defeating Grindlewald.

You're response makes me question myself and how I only saw Dumbledore as the manipulative wizard behind the curtain, following the Snape pensieve scene.
