I think you've misunderstood what I meant by 'power'. Power, as I am referring to it, is the real, legitimate power that is given by a formal position of authority that an individual can wield, not their influence. It is undeniable that Dumbledore is influential. On top of these three positions, he is also known for his defeat of Grindelwald. Dumbledore is respected, if not revered, and he is magically powerful. But I disagree completely with the idea that this influence guarantees him any /legitimate/ power.

For your ICW point: If we assume that his position is ceremonial, then the only influence he has is through voice. His position, at best, gives him a platform for him to propose items on his own agenda, but he cannot (strictly within the confinements of the ICW, if he chooses to influence ICW members by talking them around to his point in private, etc., that doesn't count because anyone can do that--one does not need to be Supreme Mugwump of the ICW to persuade people to their point of view) enforce whatever decisions the ICW may make.

As Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot: Again, assuming that his position is completely ceremonial, which it very well might be. We have seen in OotP how the Wizengamot conducts trials, and they did not seem to require a Chief Warlock to proceed. If it did require a Chief Warlock, they would have gotten a replacement, as while the trial was ongoing, Dumbledore was on the outs with the Ministry. Either way, this position, again, lets his voice be heard, but if he has no power, then he cannot directly influence nor enforce those laws on the basis of his position.

Headmaster of Hogwarts: This entire argument relies on the idea that every child who goes through Hogwarts will respect their teacher/Headmaster. Here's a question. Do you respect the Headmaster/Headmistress of your school? I don't know about you, but Headmasters/Headmistresses of my schools tended to maintain a very distant relationship with the student body. Personally, I had no particular feeling towards them. They turned up at assemblies, and sometimes they made speeches. Sometimes they gave the student body a dressing down for doing something wrong. But at the end of the day, we rarely see the Headmaster/Headmistress. All I feel for them is a very distant kind of respect, and if I went into politics, I would not spare one thought about their opinions/views. This distant relationship between student body and Headmaster does seem to be what is happening in canon. The only student we really see Dumbledore interact with is Harry. Most students probably have other things to worry about than the opinions of a distant authority figure--like the opinions of their parents and peers. In canon, Dumbledore gives the impression that he is shaping many students' opinions because he is shaping Harry's. We only ever see the story from Harry's perspective, and thus, we're offered a biased perception of what is going on. In reality, the frequency of Dumbledore's meetings with Harry is what allows for this shaping of the mind to occur, whereas other students do not receive the same opportunity. The point is, Dumbledore's influence over the students is not as significant as you seem to think it is.

Elder Wand: Nobody knew he held the Elder Wand until the end of DH. His strength as a wizard is not being called into question here. Aside from the fact that I'd argue this is not a position at all, Dumbledore actually doesn't show off his magical power a lot. Everyone knows he is powerful, because he defeated Grindelwald, but throughout canon, we are only offered rare instances where his strength is displayed. He was always reluctant to use the full measure of his power and he rarely tried to intimidate people into doing what he wanted. Mostly, he preferred to remain genial and try to persuade others through discussion and logic--when he used strength, it was usually out of necessity. I think this is more in line with the idea that he was afraid of using his power.
