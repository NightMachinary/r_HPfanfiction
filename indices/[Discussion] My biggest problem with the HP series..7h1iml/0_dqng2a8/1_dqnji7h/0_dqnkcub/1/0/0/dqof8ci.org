When you look at the etymology, Supreme Mugwump basically means he's an impartial negotiator.

And don't forget how little respect Draco and his posse had for Dumbledore.

In OotP, Griselda Marchbanks mentions Dumbledore's magical prowess during the OWL Exams, stating: /"Examined [Dumbledore] personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he did N.E.W.T.s... Did things with a wand I'd never seen before."/

One more thing to consider about Dumbledore, relating to the last point: What happened when he allowed his own power to go to his head? He plotted world domination with Grindelwald which led to his sister dying.
