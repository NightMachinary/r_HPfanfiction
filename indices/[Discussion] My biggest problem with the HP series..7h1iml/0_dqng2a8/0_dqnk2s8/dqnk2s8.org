hmm. i love snape so i don't mind, but i can definitely understand how someone can be resentful of him if they don't. he's present in every book, one of which is named after him, and directly antagonises the protagonist in all of them. he's pretty much the most important adult that isn't dumbledore and voldemort, and i'd say he's more of a main character than the entire silver trio + draco. he's also one of two people, the other being the main villain, that protagonist personally identifies with. waaay more than a background character. i mean, even in CoS, where he arguably does the least, he's still the one who inadvertently teaches harry his signature spell, which harry acknowledges, more than once
