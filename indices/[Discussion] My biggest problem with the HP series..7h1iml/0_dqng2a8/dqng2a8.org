Imo, Snape's character arc was only really significant in the chapter of Snape's memories. Yes, Book 6 and 7 develop Snape more and make him a more important character, but he still remains very much in the background save for that one chapter in DH. To some extent, I understand your irritation with this, but I certainly don't think Snape was as significant a character in Book 6 and 7 as you seem to be making him out to be. In fact, I think the way JK Rowling wrapped up Snape's arc was a little rushed--I mean, a chapter of Pensieve memories to showcase his past? Anyway, to sum up, for me, Snape was a background character at best, whose character development happened mostly in the space of one chapter, and therefore, did not feel like he was 'shoved down my throat' for two books. He was just kind of there.

I don't have much to say about your problem with Snape, but as for your complaint about 'a contrived MacGuffin (The Hallows) arc to save Harry's ass', this is debatable at best. At least if your intent was to say that the Hallows were what enabled Harry's survival. If not, just disregard the rest of this post.

There's been a few theories floating around about how Harry actually survived, because JK Rowling's explanation of it in DH had a somewhat unreliable feel to it (was it a dream? Was it all just in Harry's head? Was Dumbledore actually there?) But I don't believe that the Hallows had anything to do with Harry's survival at all, nor do I believe that JK Rowling intended for this to be the case. The Hallows had no real power over death. They seemed to me more a symbol of understanding and accept death. They were not there for the purpose of allowing Harry to survive, but rather, they paved the way for Harry to accept his inevitable death.

Now, I'm coming up with this analysis as I go, so this is probably not going to make much sense. But first, look at who held the Hallows. Voldemort held the Elder Wand, even if he never owned it, but he did not understand death. He feared it and he disdained it. Dumbledore held the Elder Wand and the Resurrection Stone, but he feared the Hallows' power. When he had the Elder Wand, he refused all seats of power, afraid that he would commit the same mistakes of the past that led to his sister's death. When he had the Resurrection Stone, he was so drawn to it, to the possibility of seeing his sister again and atoning, that he became blinded and nearly killed himself. They both held onto the Hallows, unable to give it up. Voldemort feared death, but Dumbledore couldn't let go of it. They both let their, for lack of a better word, relationship with death control their lives.

Harry, on the other hand, knowing both the mistakes of Voldemort and Dumbledore, understood that death was inescapable, and also that he couldn't cling onto the spirits of the dead. The Hallows were just symbolism for that understanding.
