Snape was not the main focus of the last two books, sure his characters got more developed and more in-depth so it's not a Snape is just evil--she added more dimensions to his Character. But he still was just a side character like every other one.

From what I see you dislike him and don't wish to read about him at all, which is fine, but there are those of us who do. We got a few chapters over 7 books, so I hardly think one could make an argument for Snape was the main focus.

I hate Ron and everything about him and he has far more mentions and scenes with him in it, forced to read his character, I am resisting going into a long rant about everything wrong with Ron, I have yet to find any redemptive features about him. Can't even say he was a good friend can I?
