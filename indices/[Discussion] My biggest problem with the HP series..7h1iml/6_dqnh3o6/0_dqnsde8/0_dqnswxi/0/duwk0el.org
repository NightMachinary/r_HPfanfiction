Indeed, 'cause I do love to hate Snape (I like complex characters, but I still hate them if they are douchebags without need, case in point: Snape and Draco and also Dumbledore - the former are petty, small minded bullies who hold grudges for years (Draco only goes after Harry constantly because he didn't accept his offer of friendship in favour of Ron, a "blood-traitor" and Snape hates Harry because a) he survived when Lilly didn't and b) he's the son of his school nemesis James Potter!) and Dumbledore is a manipulative old man playing a chess game with Voldemort who lacks empathy for the people he sacrifices (their lives and happiness don't matter, the greater good does!) and who also lacks the stones to really decisively fight (and snuff deatheaters out by the dozens!)) and I think that bully got too much of the limelight...hell, I think Draco got off too lightly as well :( (society can't heal if the guilty slip justice - again and despite the fact that the good guys pulled a decisive victory out of a hat!)
