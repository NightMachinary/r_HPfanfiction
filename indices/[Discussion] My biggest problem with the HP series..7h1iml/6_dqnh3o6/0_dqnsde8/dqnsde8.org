That's besides the point of the original post, true as it may be, though. Regardless of how good a character Snape was, what OP is complaining about is that /his/ story stole the spotlight from Harry's even though the series isn't exactly called /The Life, Adventures and Struggles of Severus Snape/, but rather /Harry Potter/.
