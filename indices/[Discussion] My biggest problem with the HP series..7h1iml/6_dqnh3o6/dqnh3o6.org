I count it as a sign of good writing that she created such a polarising, complex character. Most of the other characters were 'good' or 'bad', which isn't really very representative of real life, doesn't prepare kids for differences of opinion, and teaches the lesson 'if someone does a few bad things, they are evil'. Most (all?) good people in real life have done some bad things. Most notable people will be hated by some and loved by others, and tolerance is being able to say 'I think the good outweighed the bad (or vice versa) /but I understand that people think differently to me'/
