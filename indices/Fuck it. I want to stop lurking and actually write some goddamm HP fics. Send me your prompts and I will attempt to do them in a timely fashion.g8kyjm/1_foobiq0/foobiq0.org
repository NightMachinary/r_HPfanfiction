Gilderoy Lockhart's personal memoirs (not his novels), written in the style of the Flashman books. Gilderoy finds himself with practically no resources and no skills (save obliviate, money and a ready smile) a) trying to find and locate the people with the stories he steals in situations where he doesn't realise how dangerous it is, or b) the Ministry forces him to work secret cases for them despite his incompetence.
