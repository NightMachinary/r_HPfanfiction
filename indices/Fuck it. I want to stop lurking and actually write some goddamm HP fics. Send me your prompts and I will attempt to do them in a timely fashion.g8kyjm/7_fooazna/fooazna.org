The weather was damp and uncomfortable with freezing wind blowing across empty streets of an abandoned city block. A lone man was walking slowly with a huge limp on is left side and, if you focused your hearing, you could make out small metallic clinks as his left leg moved. The wrist on his left hand was unnaturally still with total absence of small twitches and jerks you could usually see even in the most fit of people and the left side of his once handsome face was completely covered in horrendous scar tissue. Where a left eye should've been, there was a metal contraption one could often see in a modern science-fiction movies and video games. Suddenly, there was a scream disturbing a perfectly silent and, some might even say, serene environment. The man's head jerked in the direction of the building the scream was most probably coming from, lenses in his left eye refocusing and adjusting to the distance. His limp sped up in the direction of the sound and suddenly in his right arm there was a wooden stick permeated with cracks and small grooves and in his left appeared a pistol one might recognize as a Glock 17.

Can you make something out of that?
