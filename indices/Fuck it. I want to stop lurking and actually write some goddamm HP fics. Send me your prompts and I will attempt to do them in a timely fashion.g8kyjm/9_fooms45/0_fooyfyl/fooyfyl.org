Depends what you mean by "fastest". Given a finish line of King's Cross (the one London location they all know) and the general theorized locations of Hogwarts (ie in the highlands in centralish Scotland, south of Inverness) the least amount of time spent traveling would probably be to get to Inverness, take the 80 minute flight to Heathrow, and then (unless you are /really/ blowing money on this) ride the Piccadilly for just under an hour directly to King's Cross. So a little under 2 and a half hours (plus the time to get to Inverness).

 

As to whom would get there /first/? Presuming rules of they can start anywhere that is not further south than the starting town (because having them all start in a group just means people copying each other and because nthey don't /truly/ understand how Muggle travel works), the most clever one would simply say they are renting a room for the night in Inverness as their starting point. The other competitors don't need to know that that room, while tiny, is on a Caledonian sleeper.

 

They enter their room at 8:30 p.m., have a goods night's rest, and wake up on the first day of the race to see that by 7:47 a.m. their room has travelled to King's Cross for them!
