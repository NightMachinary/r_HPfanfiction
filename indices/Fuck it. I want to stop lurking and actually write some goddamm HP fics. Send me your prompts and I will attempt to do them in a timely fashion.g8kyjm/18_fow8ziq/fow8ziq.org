Idk I've always had this idea of a gryffindor harry that is a powerful student and as seen as intimidating by other(younger and older) students and still manages to be playful with his friends?

I've seen the same trope but the authors make harry stuck up and too serious for a teen. (And they also make him more powerful than dumbledore and Voldemort together)
