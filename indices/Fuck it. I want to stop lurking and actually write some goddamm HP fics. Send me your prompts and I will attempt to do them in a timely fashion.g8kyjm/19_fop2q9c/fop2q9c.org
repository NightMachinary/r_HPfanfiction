What I really wanted to find is something that involves Hermione, Time Travel and the Marauders! I've read tons of these fanfics but I've never really liked them! My idea is that Hermione travels in time, she gets stuff done, becomes friends with the marauders and marries a Slytherin? Maybe, I don't know. Something that I think has to be included is that Hermione needs time to mourn, she has trauma from the war and most times that isn't represented.
