Harry balancing being a career man, dad, friend, spouse, etc when the world keeps wanting him to solve their problems. Harry learns to say no, I can't save your community today, Junior's got a game and I'm supposed to go out to dinner, I still have to write my self evaluation, and I haven't seen my mates in over a month. I'm sorry but I just can't deal with whatever uprising it is right now, have you tried someone else?
