Snape and Sirius meet each other when they're really, really young (like five or six) and decide that since they're both in unhappy family situations, they're going to run away together. A few days/a week later they're tracked down and seperated, until they meet again at Hogwarts.

Basically, I wanna see a Sirius who sticks up for Snape without question, and a Snape who becomes fast friends with the Mauraders.
