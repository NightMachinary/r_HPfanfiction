Why would it matter they look the same (Harry and James) if they are different people? It could just be coincidence as it happens quite frequently in our own world. The name thing though. He could change it or he could not. Perhaps he is a badass and is the reason Lily names her son Harry because he was her friend and nice to Snape. She wanted to remember old Snivellus but James was anti his name so they went with his badass best friend. Then young Harry can meet old Harry at Hogwarts and Old Harry can help guide the youngling through all the books behind the scenes. He could be the one who suggests to Fred and George to give Harry Jr the map and he can be the guy who suggests Hagrid be the one to pick Jr up for his letter delivery and such. I suppose in this canon Dumbledore will have known it was the original Harry Potter who is Sr and is ok with allowing him to make suggestions and such to keep young Harry on his paradox free path. He also can be there to remind Sr that he can't alter young Harry's life or else he'll never grow to accidentally go back in time essentially making Sr disappear. You can have the story end when young Harry hits the time loop and goes back and suddenly realises he was Sr all along and that's why they got along so well and why he felt such a strong connection to him. Final ending could be Jr becoming Sr and realizing his fate is to be stuck in this time loop but by sacrafice of himself he defeats Voldemort and saves all those who he loves. Sure Ginny would be sad and such but Sr could explain it to her on round two so she can continue linearly down her path knowing Harry is stuck in his time loop saving the world one and over again.
