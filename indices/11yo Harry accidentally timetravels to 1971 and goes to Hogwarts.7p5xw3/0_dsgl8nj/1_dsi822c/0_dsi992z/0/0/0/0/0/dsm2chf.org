That's not what I meant. In your version both senior Harry and junior Harry are at Hogwarts at the same time. Junior and Senior are even interracting. But the point of this fic is that Harry must time travel before he got the letter. He attends Hogwarts in the past, not present (meaning he never got to the 1st September 1991 and was claimed as vanished/kidnapped/something else).

If the plot follows that route that I suggested (he never time travels again and has to live from 1971) then in 1991 he, being already grown-up 31yo man and possibly a professor at Hogwarts, hears that the famous Harry Potter vanished as Hogwarts owl hadn't managed to find him and give him his letter.

If he follows another route of events and manages to travel back to present (either to 1991 (after his younger copy vanished) or to (197x + 20) year), then he continues his studying there.

The point is older and younger Harry don't have a chance to even meet each other.

Though linkffn(Sine Qua Non by AzarDarkstar) might have what you wanted but it's unfortunately abandoned.
