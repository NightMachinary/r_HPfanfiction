Well, I don't know. Maybe several years? Then he somehow returns to original time, either 1991 or just 20 years later.

Maybe he should stay for 3 years and return to 1994 for the tournament. And everyone suddenly realize that he was that boy from 1971's first years.

Or he is there for the whole 7 years and returns when the war has already started.

Or he never came back and just continues living in the past. That is a really interesting idea! He then comes to Hogwarts and becomes a professor of, say, Muggle Studies. Or Arithmacy (that intrigues me), or Runes. Let's leave DADA to canon. And then he is the one who saves the Stone, kills a basilisk and so on. Canon events but this time he is not a child but a man.

I guess Harry must understand that he is somehow in the past. He has no choice but to go to an orphanage (or some people found him lost on the streets and sent him there). And somehow he has to come to an idea of changing his surname. And something must be done about his appearances as he's a copy of James. Maybe a haircut will help?..

I imagine that he makes friends with Snape as it will open many opportunities for the plot later. And it's reasonable I guess. Harry saw a boy in hand-me-downs and decided that they're similar enough.

I'm just throwing ideas at you.
