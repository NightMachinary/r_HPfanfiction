There's always the old-fashioned way (copy-and-paste each chapter). It's blocked on the main site but not the mobile version. Using a computer, replace the "www" with "m" to get the mobile version, and you're free to select and copy the text there. More time consuming but you can paste it into the word processor of your choice.
