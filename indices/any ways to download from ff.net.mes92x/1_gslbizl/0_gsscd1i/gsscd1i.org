Indeed. FicHub currently uses Calibre to generate pdfs which is unfortunately incredibly slow and resource intensive, so only a single pdf export across all users is allowed at any one time. FicHub has already moved to a better server once, but it's simply not viable to keep throwing money at the problem and will take some time to properly address.

In general EPUB is a much better format and I'd suggest you and [[/u/bukgu]] only resort to pdf as a last resort. As a bonus, EPUB export is generally extremely quick :)
