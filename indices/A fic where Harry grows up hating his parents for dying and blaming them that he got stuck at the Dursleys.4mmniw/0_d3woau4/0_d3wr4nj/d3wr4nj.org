I was hoping for some dark!harry stories like that, that could go in any direction. For example that his hatred for his parents would turn into hatred of Dumbledore for leaving him at the Dursleys but I don't actually know. It could be whatever the author would make it. I just thought that it would be interesting character development for Harry and I wanted to see where other people thought this might take him.
