I don't recognize the scene, but I am compelled to poke a logic-shaped hole in it. Neither the Torture Curse (crucio) nor the Killing Curse CAN be blocked (I believe the same goes the the Imperius Curse too), so no shield would work. Unless that's the point.

Okay, rant done, I wish you luck* on your fic search.

Edit: I knew this comment was going to stir up debate, so I did do some research before posting. I did some more digging and as it turns out, the original sources I used were flimsy. Even originally I did not mean anything truly negative, and I was just pointing out what I thought was a deviation from canon. A fanfiction author can do whatever they want and I wholeheartedly support that.
