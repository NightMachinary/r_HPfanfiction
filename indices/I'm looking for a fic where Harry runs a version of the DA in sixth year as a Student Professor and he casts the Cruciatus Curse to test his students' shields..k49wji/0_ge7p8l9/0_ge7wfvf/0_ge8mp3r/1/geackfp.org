I'd say that falls under the "dubiously canon" category. Rowling may have intended it to be true, but since it's not in the books, it's not official, and she could choose to change her mind about it in the future. Especially since the test is no longer available. So as far as I'm concerned, any author can choose to use or ignore any information there as they please.

Also, according to the only answer guide that seems to exist, one of the correct answers is blatantly contradicted by the books. (The test says animate to inanimate transfiguration is impossible, but we see it several times in the books, including mice to snuffboxes in PS and hedgehogs to pincushions in GoF.)
