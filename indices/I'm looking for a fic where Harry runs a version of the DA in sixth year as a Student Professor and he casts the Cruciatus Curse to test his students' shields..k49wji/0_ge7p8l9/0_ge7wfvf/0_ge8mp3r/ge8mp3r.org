I had to do a LOT of digging to get to reliable sources (of which I found ONE), but here is a question from W.O.M.B.A.T.S (the standard exams) as stated by the Harry Potter Lexicon:

1. Which of the following is FALSE? a. Patronuses vary in strength according to which animal's form they take. b. There is only one documented case of a person surviving the Killing Curse. c. Hags have only rudimentary magic, similar to that observed in trolls. d. No defensive spell exists against the Cruciatus Curse. e. Giants have traditionally allied themselves with the Dark Arts.

That doesn't give an exact answer, but it confirms the POSSIBILITY that the Cruciatus Curse can't be defended against.

The Fandom Harry Potter Wiki also mentions that Wonderbook: Book of Spells has more evidence to support this, but it doesn't list said evidence anywhere. So no, I admit that I cannot say for certain that crucio is unblockable, but I personally believe that it is at least implied.
