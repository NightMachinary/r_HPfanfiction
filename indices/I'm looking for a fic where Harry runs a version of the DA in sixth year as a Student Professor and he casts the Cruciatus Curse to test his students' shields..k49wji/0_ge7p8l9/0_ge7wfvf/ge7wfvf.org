If we're going to be pedantic here, I'll point out that that's not actually true. Crouch/Moody specifically said that the Killing Curse can't be blocked, but not anything about blocking the other two Unforgivables. Fanon has mostly decided that they can't be blocked either, but canon is silent on the matter.
