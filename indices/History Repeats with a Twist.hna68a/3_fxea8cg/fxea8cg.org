Harry stomped through the corridors, his temper flaring, and students scattered out of his way, the scene was familiar to some, the aftermath of another Potter-Greengrass event, sometimes dangerous, very noisy, but always entertaining.

The also noticed the way he was going, and if the pattern kept, tomorrow there would be the oft-repeated sequel, a Davis-Greengrass event, this one was always dangerous, and sometimes not that enternaining, and for some reason it rankled Professor Snape something fierce.

Harry opened the door with roughly, and then threw back, closing it with a bang.

The other occupant of the room wasn't impressed.

"Wow, Harry, so much testorone, so much masculinity, are you going to roar now or after?"

Instead of snapping, Harry smiled, and turned sheepishly at his friend.

"Sorry, Trace, it's just..."

"Greengrass" Tracey Davies rolled her eyes, but couldn't stop a little venon from coming out in her voice.

"Yeah," Harry breathed, before looking at one of his best friends and smiling, not noticing her forming blush, those damnable eyes.

He sat down and didn't notice as she scooted closer in the bench, rather, he did notice, but didn't think anything of it, ever since the first year Tracey had been a very physical person, it was the first time Harry was exposed to an abudance of hugs, or close contact, and she was one of the few people he was entirely comfortable with.

"So, Transfiguration or Potions?"

-----

The other day, the event was already expected, for it was spread fast that Daphne Greengrass was told that Harry had spent yet another full afternoon in company of Tracey Davies, the "evil Slytherin".

Which was the opinion of very few(namely Daphne), the only 'evil' Slytherin by commom accord would be one Draco Malfoy, but after a disastrous fourway duel (Crabbe and Goyle were there, but they were taken out in three seconds so they don't count) in Second Year he had decided to stay the hell away from Potter and the crazy women he associated with, thank you very much.

So, it was with a mixture of aprehension, expectation and concern that students saw Daphne Greengrass stalk towards Tracey Davies, while flanked by Susan Bones, Luna Lovegood and Padma Patil.

"Davis, what part of "Stay away from Harry" you didn't understand?"

Tracey subtly palmed her wand, but faked nonchanlance.

"The part where you have any say in what I do or don't do, Greengrass."

The blonde girl huffed, while Luna shook her head and pulled Padma back a little, Susan rolled her eyes but palmed her wand to.

"You listen here you slimy-"

"Oh, sod off Greengrass!" the abruptness was enough to stop the girl so Tracey continued,"I don't know what you are thinkin, but if you think Harry is going to like you while being the biggest bitch in this school you clearly don't know him."

"What? How dare-"

"I dare! He's my best friend and I know him! Harry is gentle and kind, and he would never be with a.../bully/ the likes of you" the brunette took a step closer, making Daphne tense, and two sets of blue eyes, one bright and the darke met, and Tracey said in a low tone.

"I think /I/ have a much better chance."

Luna sighed, and Daphne saw red, snarling in frustration and pointed her wand at the girl.

"You'll never-/Furun"/

"Expelliarmus!"

Daphne wand went sailing to the side, right in the hand of a fuming Harry Potter, flanked by a paling Ron Weasley and indignant Hermione Granger, the first of which was shaking his head and murmuring "Blimey, not again".

Harry's face was red and his eyes glaring, now the student body got a little warier and lot more excited, a Potter-Greengrass-Davies event was a rare treat, but always a messy one, the students were so excited few noticed a first year slip out to call a Teacher, a prefect would only become collateral now.

"What the fuck do you think you are doing, Greengrass?"

"Protecting you from her, Harry!" Daphne pointed at Tracey, who smirked.

Harry sighed and passed his hand through his hair, Daphne noted he was still holding her wand with that hand though.

"Again with this crap? Tracey is my friend, it's you who comes after her, if anything I should protect /her/ from /you."/

Daphne recoiled, Susan shrugged, Luna nodded and Padma sighed, normally Daphne was fun to hang around with, but coming from a traditional family didn't help her social skills at school, if only she would be her normal self around Harry and not do all this posture she would have a genuine chance.

"Me?"

Tracey snorted, and Harry shook his head in disbelief.

Ron was slowly walking backwards while Hermione had opened her book again, wand in hand, this row was shaping up to be another 'air your dirty laundry' one rather than an ' extreme spell shootout' one and Harry was a big boy now, and she had just gotten into Moria, so she would just wait out the teenage drama.

"I don't understand you, Daphne." the anger was out of Harry's voice, and the frustration in it, along with the use of her first name, surprised the crowd.

Daphne looked at Harry oddly "What you don't understand?"

"How you can be so different when it comes to me," he sighed and gestured at Daphne's group "the Daphne I see from afar is like another person, this Daphne that laughs with her friends over silly things, that plays harmless tricks with the Twins, that is kind with the younger students, that trains at night to be one of our best Chasers," Harry looked at her mournfully, and now even Hermione was looking over her book, "this Daphne I would like to know," Harry was blushing now, and Daphne too, "but /this/ one" he pointed at her, his blush disappearing and being replaced by a hard expression "the /bully/ Greengrass, who goes after my friend over nothing, who sneers at people because of their House, that prances around the school like a damn peacock?" he shook his head, Daphne flinching at every sentence.

"This one I will stay well away from, I have no interest in knowing her, never would."

Some students were grimacing now, but Luna had a small, unseen smile.

Harry fixed Daphne with an intense stare "Which one will you be?"

He threw her wand to her as he turned to leave, and she was so shocked that Susan had to catch it, the redhead whistled lowly, before squeezing her best friend's shoulder and turning her around.

"Fucking finally, Daph, let's see if you can take your head out of your ass now."

Ron and Hermione followed their friend, both realizing something had changed.

The crowd was dispersing just as Flitwick turned the corner, he looked at the hallway and sighed mournfully, "Ah, no spells today, good, but I missed it, those always get a good story for the staff room." he remembered a few years ago, when similar rows took place, he just hoped these had a happier conclusion for all parts.

As Harry took Tracey by the arm, he didn't notice the look of dawning realization on her face.
