Cont 3(mods is there anyway you can blend all this, I am really sorry about the size, but I can't help myself)

The news that Harry Potter would take Daphne Greengrass on a date spread like fiendfyre through the school by the other day everyone knew, and many bets were won and lost, among the staff, the winner was neither Minerva nor Albus, but Pomona, who explained in the staff meeting.

"Girls mature faster than boys, and boys are much more tolerant to some things, not to mention, James was much worse."

Not all was hapiness and fun, for one Tracey Davis, her heart was shattered, she should've known it was a matter of time, Daphne was taller, prettier, richer, when she wanted she was even charming, and Harry was a /boy,/ of course when the girl finally tried she would get him.

It didn't stop her tears though, Harry had always been oblivious to her feeling at least she hoped so, it was too painful to think she was in Hermione territory, of being thought off as a sister.

So she was crying at the Astronomy Tower, she guessed they would start dating now, and Harry would fall in love with her and...is this what she got for being his friend? Perhaps Malfoy was right and she was just a loser half-blood who was good at Transfiguration and would never amount to nothing, certainly not good enough to be 'Mrs. Potter'.

"Miss Davis"

Tracey jumped at the voice of her Head of House, she turned expecting to see his disgust at her weakness, but stopped at the look on his eyes, she had never see them so expressive before, pain, regret, anger even loneliness was there.

Tracey hiccuped and tried to dry her tears uselessly, but she didn't care now, what was he going to do, 'detention for crying'? McGonagall would jump his throat.

"Miss Davis, I am only going to say this once, so listen well."

There was a weight to his words, a reality and regret that were palpable, so she did her best to listen.

"I know, what you are feeling, this betrayal, this pain," he shuderred and Tracey didn't know how to reconcile her stoic and sarcastic Head of House with this one full of regret "I know you must be feeling anger, at Mr...Potter now, and at Miss Greengrass, perhaps event at yourself."

Tracey nodded without thinking, she certainly wanted to go and scream at them, what, she did not know.

"I am going to tell you, to try and control this anger, ir hurts, but if you lash out now, you may do and...say things you'll regret."

She was about to lash out, to scream at him, his post be damned, what he knew of what she was feeling. He apparently could read her because he said in harder tone, his eyes darker than normal.

"Tell me, Miss Davis, how would your life be without Mr. Potter? Imagine it."

She did, and she almost curled into a ball, she loved Harry, there, now she admited it, he was her best friend, even if she wasn't his, and she was always afraid of telling him because she feared he would reject her, that it would hurt their friendship. And now where had that left her? But without him, she would be, less, the world would lose a bit of it's color without his laugh there, his encouraging words, his good jokes, his bad potion jokes, the little funny spells he always showed her first when he managed to do it. Her world without Harry would be, horrible.

"I see you've gotten my point." Snape said, "If you lash out now, against either of them, there's a good chance you will irreparably damage your friendship and I can /guarantee/ you, that you will regret that eternally."

Tracey nodded, the weight with which he said that was clear, he was speaking from experience. But she didn't want to give up.

"So I should just accept it!?Let her win"

A deep frown came upon Snape's face and now he was looking past her,"It will be hard, you may suffer in the beginning, they will become close, and if you keep antagonising her and she doesn't return it, you will be seen as the agressor, she will come to ask for your forgiveness, and you may or may not give it to her, do not howeve,r attack her, it will hurt for a time, but,"and now he almost smiled, "no one knows the future, /teenagers/," he sneered, "can be fickle, and you are /Slytherin/, bid your time."

Had Professor /Snape/ just given her /relationship advice/ what was the world coming to? But she couldn't stop the spark of hope from surging in her heart, it was dim, but she would feed it.

"Do not hang entirely on this though, for all you know they may even /marry/," he looked beyond her again, "but if you lash out now, you may lose him entirely, if you do not, you may keep him as a friend, or maybe more, the choice is yours, Miss Davies, all I can say you is that if you surrender into your anger, you /will/ regret this."

He looked at her for a moment, his eyes coming back to the present, before he nodded, and with whisp of cloth, was gone, as suddenly as he had arrived.

And Tracey Davis was left with a lot to think about.

---So with a more stable political enviroment, less emotional and angstry teenagers, will history repeat itself, or will the Slytherin half-blood play their cards right?

I don't rightly know, this practically wrote itself, sorry for the grammar, my Grammarly is not working on Chrome.
