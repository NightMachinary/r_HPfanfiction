Cont.

Over the next few days, the words Harry said to Daphne spread throughout the school, some embellished, other dismissed them, but many noticed how quiet things got regarding Daphne's ground and the Golden Trio(and Tracey) remained the same, though Tracey seemed to be around Harry more, Daphne was seen talking seriously with the Twins, and writing home more too.

It was a week later, when Daphne approached Harry in the common room, Ron tensed, but Harry only narrowed his eyes, her gait was different, less like a peacock strutting around and more like a...lioness stalking in the savanah, there was a even a subtle /sway/ he hadn't noticed it before. He kinda of liked it.

Daphne apparently noticed, because she smiled, and this wasn't the arrogant grin, but a more natural one, pretty, even.

Hermione's eyebrows raised, she glanced between the two before grabbing Ron and leaving, shushing his protests about helping his friend, he wouldn't need their help.

Daphne sat down in the chair in front of him and spoke before Harry could.

"I am sorry."

Almost all conversation stopped, and all the heads turned in their direction, before Hermione glared at them an waved her wand, blurring their images and muffling the sound, completely returning the glares she received from the rest of the common room.

Harry was flabbergasted, Daphne Greengrass apologizing, he almost started using those techiniques Uncle Remus taught him to escape Sirius' when she continued.

"I know, I have been a...bitch these last three years Harry, it's just," she looked around, noticing the privacy spell and nodding at Hermione, who looked on impassively.

"I don't, I don't know what to do sometimes, it's no excuse but," she blushed and Harry recognized her expression from when he was still recently "rescued" by Sirius and had no idea what to do in normal situations as a kid.

Daphne powered on "I don't know how to act like a, a /normal/ girl, ok? I was raised to act like the 'heiress' of House Greengrass" Harry snorted at her airquotes, and Daphne smiled a little "and that doesn't include making friends or" she looked at Harry and blushed hard, but closed her eyes and whispered "/courting/ boys."

Harry's eyes widened, and he blushed just as hard, every lesson Sirius had given him on girls was forgotten at this moment and he gaped.

"Cour-courting?" He said faintly.

"Dating! I mean dating!" Daphne took a deep breath, her anxiety was getting the best of her but she wouldn't lose the glimmer of hope she saw a week ago, "And so, I didn't know what to do, and then I started acting like that, to prove myself, or to call attention, I don't know."

Harry had a good suspicion of /whose/ attention.

"And then I began, and I guess I didn't know how to stop, how to be different in certain," she looked at him again, far shyer than normal "situations."

Harry nodded "So the real you is..."

Daphne jumped at the chance "It's Daphne, the one you spoke about last week! I do like to laugh with my friends, and they are my real friends, Susan and me go way back, Padma I met in the train and Luna..." she smiled.

"Luna is Luna," Harry smiled back in that fond way people who were friends with Luna did, " she's Ron's neighbor and the only reason I paid attention to try and see the 'real' you."

Daphne made a note to buy Luna the biggest box of chocolates she could find, or radishes, whatever she wanted.

"So, you were saying..." he gestured for her to continue.

"Ok, so, my friends, they stand by me, even when I am an arrogant asshole peacock, and I love them, and I..."

Harry raised an eyebrow and Daphne continued, "I don't want to be that person anymore, the.../bully,/ I don't want to become her and I want." she looked at Harry again and gathering all her Gryffindor courage grabbed his hand, making them both blush fiercely, "I want you to know me Harry, the real me, and I want to know you too, the real Harry Potter, not the one I brought out by being an asshole."

Harry grinned at her, feeling her soft hands and unknowingly turning on the 'Potter Charm' that Sirius said would bring many an irate father to their doorstep, he squeezed her hand softly, massaging the back of it with his thumb, making Daphne blush redder than she had before.

"Well, Daphne, I like this idea," he said, looking her in the eyes "but," her face began to fall when he continued "you will have to show to me, I think you are very beautiful," he hesitated a little before kissing the back of her hand, unknowingly setting off a round of gasps around the room and even the exchange of currency, "smart and even kind," he frowned at her, "but you have tormented Tracey, and she's my friend, so you'll have to apologize to her."

Daphne's eyes widened and she had to resist the urge to pull her hand back "Apologize, to /her?/ But she'll never-"

Harry stopped her protest with a raised hand, before returning it to holding her hand, much to her appreciation, "I know there's some bad blood between you two, and I don't expect you to reconcile and become best friends overnight." he squeezed her hand and fixed her with a stare that reminded her he had been raised by the Head of House Black, "but you must be the one to extend the olive branch, Daphne, you began this, and you must be the one to try to end it," he sighed "if Tracey accepts it or not it's her decision, but you will have done your part."

Daphne gulped "And if she tries to curse me?"

"She won't, believe me."

And Daphne did.

"And I will stop playing tricks on the Slytherins too."

Harry nodded with a smile, that Daphne returned.

"But we may do it to Malfoy if he doesn't leave my sister alone."

Harry chuckled "I never heard you saying that, Daphne."

Daphne laughed(and how Harry liked her real laugh) and held his hand, they both knew it wouldn't be so easy, that many wouldn't believe, but Harry chose to take a page out of Professor Dumbledore's books and believe people could change, not knowing he had given the same counsel to his mother decades ago.

When he signaled Hermione and she ended the privacy spell with a suspicious look, Harry smiled at her and turned to Daphne, speaking in a low tone.

"I would like to know more about this Daphne, and this weekend is a Hogsmeade one..."

Hermione groaned as they finalized their plans, this would spread and the drama, and when Tracey found out.

Lee Jordan however smiled, and strutted towards a group of older years with a large smile, "Oi, mates, would look at the date, oh, just /before/, the first Hogsmead weekend, which means...everyone here owes me money!"
