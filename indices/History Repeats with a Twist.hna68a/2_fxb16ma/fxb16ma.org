"Look Potter, I'm sick of dealing with you Lions and your ridiculous prejudices." She slapped away Harry's helping hand, Tracey Davies staggering to her feet with as much of her dignity as she could muster. Her eyes puffy and red and her hands angrily yanking down her robes and skirt, mortified still as the slowly dispersing students still snickered at the view they'd received of her underthings.

Curtesy of the foul Daphne Greengrass, who's housemates Brown and Patil were dragging her away from the the verbal dressing down a furious Harry had given her,

"Look I don't condone what Daphne or any of the others do to you or any of the Snakes who aren't hateful gits. It is wrong and I always call them out, you know that!" Harry's impassioned declaration tinged with desperation. Tracey's eyes were burning with fresh tears, "We're going to get you to Snape or McGonagall and have Greengrass out of here in no time. That was way too far."

"Oh sod off, Potter. I don't need you and your pity parade." She snarled up at him, not at all perturbed by his full body flinch, "I heard you and Weasley earlier, talking about Slimy snakes after cursing Malfoy. Suppose I'm 'one of the good ones' right?!"

"I mean, you are? I- what am I supposed to say?" His voice shook in his throat, suddenly hyper conscious of both the still present crowd and the loathing that flooded into her tear-filled eyes,

"Of course. Cause the great and NOBLE Harry Potter wouldn't deign to sully himself by loitering around a Slytherin unless he had some sort of excuse to make her worthy."

"What's gotten into you?" Harry snapped back at her, her imperious sneer making his skin crawl, "I'm your friend because I like you, Trace. What the hell is your problem?!"

"My problem is my so called best friend is just another Gryffindor pretending he likes me, but mouths off about my house just like everyone else."

"Look, I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean Slytherin's in general are 'slimy Snakes', just Malfoy and his goons." Harry implored, cheeks a bit red and breath coming shorts, "Besides Tracey, he was calling my mum-"

"This isn't about him, Potter! This is about you and your House picking on me for wearing green and 'daring' to speak with you!" She screamed, fists balled at her sides as she took a half step forward. Shoulders squared as angry tears fell, "Besides, why should I care what he said about your mudblood mother?!"

She screamed and everything stopped. The words having barely passed her lips before colour drained from her face. Harry taking a hairbreadth longer to register them.

His glare was murderous.

On the sidelines, Snape's world came crashing down around him. As, once again, he beheld those wide green eyes. They were hers, not just in colour and shape, but in how they looked upon Tracey in that moment. The same glare that had pierced him all those years ago.

"I... I didn't..."

"You know what Tracey-"

"Detention, Miss Davies!" Snatching their attention from one another to the approaching Potions Master, dark eyes alight with a fury neither of them had seen before.

But the thunderous expression did not last. Snape's heart broke a little in the face of her utter defeat. For Harry differed from his mother.

Instead of screaming and shouting at her for saying that word, for spitting in the face of their friendship, for lashing out with her frustrations and insecurities on the one person who wished to help...

He just stormed away without a backwards glance.
