I can see Snape taking a very active role in regards to Tracey when he realised their similarities. If I were to write this he'd rip her to shreds during the detention and let it slip why he's so invested in their relationship.

Also, Daphne and Harry's relationship wouldn't last, as Daphne only really sees Harry as a prize and not an equal. Harry would then reconcile with Tracey but not date her.
