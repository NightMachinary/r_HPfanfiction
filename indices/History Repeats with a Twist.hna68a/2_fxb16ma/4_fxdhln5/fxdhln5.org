That was awesome, I could see the ending coming, but like Snape wanted it to be avoided.

Very poetic, would you think Snape would try to intervene and reconcile them? So he could try to redeem himself a little?

Ha, I know want to see a Harry/Tracey with this premise, since this seems to be Tracey being under pressure/stress rather than being like Snape and trying to balance his friendship with Lily and his association with the Death Eaters.
