It does! :)

We know he fallout from the Lily/Snape situation: He falls in with the Death Eaters, and ultimately it leads to Lily being killed because of the partial information he passed on.

At roughly the same time (maybe a year or so later), James stops being a dick and finally catches her interest.

How do you think a reflection would work here?

Tracey pushed further into Pansy's 'camp', and by extension Malfoy's (with the excuse "see, told you Potter was the 'wrong sort')?

Tracey reluctantly becoming a Death Eater or an Unmarked supporter between Sixth/Seventh?

Her giving away information that helped lead to Harry's canon capture at Malfoy Manor (maybe Daphne had "Blood Traitor branded into her skin like Hermione had Mudblood carved into her, or something)? Or where he died (before returning to off Voldemort), shattering her heart into pieces? Or where she became part of the DA, despite people's protests, but the divide is furthered after she unwittingly betrays them like Cho did in the movie or purposefully did like Marietta did (thinking it was for his own good?).

Would talking to an imprisoned Luna help drive things home, and cause her to turn traitor to the Death Eaters to keep Harry safe, like Snape did for Dumbledore (that ultimately failed)?

Would Daphne become more grounded/mature after seeing the sobering effects of the student population dividing? Maybe Astoria, who could still be in Slytherin or be in Ravenclaw after being pressured by her sister, is attacked/seriously harmed? All the while Tracey sees Harry starting to slowly reciprocate Daphne's attentions, which angers/causes more despair?

How about the ending? Bittersweet compared to Snape/Lily? Still being ostracized? Would Tracey let things go/forgive or refuse, becoming bitter like Snape? Would she be involved in the Potters' lives as a godmother or aunt to their children, or something?

Ooh, so many possibilities!
