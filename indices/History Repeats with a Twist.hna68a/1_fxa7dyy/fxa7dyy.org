I think the dynamic could work, but putting Daphne in Gryffindor automatically removes the attractiveness of the pairing... the fact that she's in Slytherin.

Let's be honest people, the only reason Haphne is a thing is because Rowling dropped the ball in making the series so Gryffindor oriented and people like the Romeo-Juliet dynamic of Harry dating a Slytherin. And since we don't know a thing about Daphne, that makes it by default better than Pansy or the rest of the Slytherins.

Also, Daphne in Gryffindor just makes the series even more Gryffindor oriented.
