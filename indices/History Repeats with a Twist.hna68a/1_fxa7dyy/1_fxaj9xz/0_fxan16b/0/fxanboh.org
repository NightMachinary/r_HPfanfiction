She's pure blooded, has big brothers who could've taught her to be a jokester, into Quidditch, popular and she already had a crush on Harry. Wouldn't take much to make her more arrogant (hammer home the only daughter bit, maybe she doesn't get possessed by Riddles diary her first year and instead tries to show off for Harry) and Harry is forced into contact with her through his friendship with Ron, so we can write their interactions a lot. Canon Ginny stands up for herself and takes no shit, so would be easy to write into a Jame Potter role I think.
