I wouldn't mind reading this. Sounds much more interesting and character-driven than the types of fics that Daphne usually gets shoved into.

Bonus points if there's a young Snape equivalent who is jealous of Harry and Daphne's relationship. Just...not Ginny. Leave that poor girl alone for once, fic authors.
