And you know what would be really cute? If Remus referred to Harry as his pup! xD x3 UwU

You know, the guy whose main character arc is that he super duper fucking hates being a werewolf? He'd really get a kick out of referring to Harry as his pup, I think.

Also, it's not weird at all to call a thirteen year old boy that you haven't seen since he was a toddler your â€˜pup' and let him sit on your lap.

What? No, why are you putting me on a watch list?
