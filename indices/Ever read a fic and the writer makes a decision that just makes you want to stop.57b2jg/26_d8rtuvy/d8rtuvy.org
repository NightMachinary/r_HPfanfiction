Yeah, got some pet-peeves that make me leave ASAP - one of them is teen-pregnancy (especially if it supposedly is ok or even a great thing - NO WAY!)...so yes, I do have a list of things that make me stop reading a fanfiction story (the same things make me want to throw out real books, but I normally don't because I paid good money for those!).

I really hate it when authors do this and didn't have the decency to foreshadow it or put it in the summary (I get that there are people who love stories with babies/new parents etc. but I don't and I'd like to avoid them! Same for all the other things I haven't mentioned (example: There's a relationship and one partner is totally whipped...hate this! I think both partners in a relationship are equal and both have a voice - there's nobody "in charge", because if there is the other is the lesser and constantly plays second fiddle! I especially hate it if the woman is in charge and is allowed to badmouth her boyfriend and boss him around etc. etc.))

ps: I also hate what I would say is "feminist propaganda" (meaning works of fiction where the men get nothing done if there isn't a woman helping them or telling them how to do it...this often happens in Harry/Hermione IMHO (I get that she's a strong independent woman, but she's not this bad and Harry isn't a submissive character either...sure he could be more active and involved etc. but he's not just taking shit lying down either!)
