I just finished Stages last night, and while I understand your point, at least the fic had the courtesy of admitting it was a n alternate universe where Sirius befriended Snape on the train instead of James - so James never had the tempering influences of Remus and Lily, and Snape got dragged out of his shell by his friends.

I was much more annoyed at the Edgyworld characters' personalities, but at least they were mostly consistent with their characterization.
