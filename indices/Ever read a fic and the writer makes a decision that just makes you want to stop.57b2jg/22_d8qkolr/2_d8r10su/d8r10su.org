Taste is individual, but I really like Stages of Hope. The AU James is just that, a very alternate take. Note that in the story, in one universe Lucius is a good guy and in the other he's the worst sort of sadist. If the reader can accept that the two universes have versions of the same person that are that different, then jerk James isn't such a big deal, and doesn't imply that canon James would be a jerk. That said, again, taste is individual, and I won't tell you you're wrong for not liking it.
