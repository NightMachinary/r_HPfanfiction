A lots of stories actually. For example, Innocent series. Good stories, plot similar to canon. But in trying to make Dumbledore character somewhat balanced than the manipulative version we see in many stories, the writer make the character so insufferable, I stop reading.

Another story I often say, I regret, is Stages of Hopes. In that story, in the other Universe, there's a well-behaved, good Snape && James & James Jr. exactly how Snape described in canon. I extremely despise when a story have this: a jerk James/Sirius to look Snape/Malfoy's great.
