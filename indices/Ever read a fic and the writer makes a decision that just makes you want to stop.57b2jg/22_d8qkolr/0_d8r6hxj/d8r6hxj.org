Snape's actually my favorite character and I like reading AUs set in the Marauder era, especially with SS/LE romance, but... God. James is not a monster, and Snape is not a saint. James's parents spoiled him and he was a shit at Hogwarts, but he never tried to kill Snape, and we're never given enough info about his parents to know what they were like. He ended up dying for his beliefs (despite some weird fanfics that portrays him as a pureblood supremacist, we know James's beliefs are those of equality) and family without a second thought for himself. Snape had a bad childhood and was obviously a damaged person, but that doesn't excuse his own behavior and attitude. I like that JK balanced the two of them.

After writing that, I guess I've realized that I like the idea of Marauder-AUs more than the reality. Alas.
