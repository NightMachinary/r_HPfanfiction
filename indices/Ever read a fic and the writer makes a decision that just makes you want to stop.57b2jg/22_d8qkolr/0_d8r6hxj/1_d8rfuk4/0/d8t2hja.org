I agree with you for sure. Sorry if that wasn't clear. I don't know enough about James to say he's a favorite character, but I think despite his faults, he's a better person than Snape in many ways. He (and the others) accepted Remus when most other students would have shunned him and he didn't buy into pureblood ideology, even though he'd have been fine ignoring it. Those things indicate to me that there's plenty of genuine nobility and goodness in him. James's faults seem to come down to his adolescence and immaturity much of the time, and it drives me nuts that so many fics choose to exaggerate those to the point of absurdity.

I don't think making Snape "good" means that James needs to be demonized. I just wish there were more fics where he ends up accepting Lily/Snape, even if reluctantly. Unfortunately, fanfic writers often aren't good at balancing characters and their relationships.
