Like I said in 2nd comment, I don't mind good Snape/Malfoy or SS/LE romance. Snape is/was my one of favorite character. Infact, I started to read fanfictions after DH & solely due to 'The Prince's Tale' chapter.

Again, over the years, my preferences have changed. I just dislike when stories which portrait James exactly how Snape described throughout the book. I mean I am well aware of James's faults. But when a writer identifies his faults based on his childhood emeny completely ignoring his good characteristics, I can't stand to it.
