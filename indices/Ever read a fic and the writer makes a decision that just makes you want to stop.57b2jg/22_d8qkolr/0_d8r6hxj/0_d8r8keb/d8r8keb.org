I like to think they equally attacked each other but snape didn't have bad memories when he attacked them only when he got humiliated so we never saw the other side of the coin.. The tripping jinx in the hallways the prank spells to embarras himself infront of lily etc... After all they fought alot because of lily (sirius/remus mentions thats what the rivalry was huge on) I also never understood how they said snape knew loads of dark arts before 1st year... Half blood? abused mom? drunk dad? whered he get these magicke moste evile and potions moste vile?
