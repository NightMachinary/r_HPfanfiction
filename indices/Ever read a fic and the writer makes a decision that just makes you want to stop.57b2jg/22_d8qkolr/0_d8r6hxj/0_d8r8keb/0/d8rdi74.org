It always a little bit irked me that Harry let his image of his Dad get tarnished by one side of a complex story from the memory of a hateful man. He talked to Sirius and Remus about it but Sirius had spent 12 years in Azkaban and probably wasn't the best adjusted, and Remus is basically one big guilt machine. So of course it's not gonna be the best explanation.

I'm glad he got over it later and realised that yeah, the Marauders did some dickish shit. But Snape was no better, he wasn't always alone, as mentioned Avery, Mulciber and other future Death Eaters. He held Blood Purist views, either to save himself or simply because he believed it. All of this at a time when the War between Voldemort and the rest of the Wizards was at hitting it's peak. Is it any wonder that things where strained between children?
