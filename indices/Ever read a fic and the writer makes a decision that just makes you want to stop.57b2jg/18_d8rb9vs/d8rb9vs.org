In general, I dislike it when an author starts off with a single, cohesive, strong story thread, only to add other pointless things for no reason other than they like that character or that pairing. If they liked that idea so much, they should have written the story about /that/ instead of muddling the whole thing.

It's an issue that's present in other fiction too, not just fanfiction. Rather than fully explore and stretch out the premise they started with, some people will just go completely off the rails and make the story all about some other thing.

Narrative cohesion, people, that's all I'm asking for.
