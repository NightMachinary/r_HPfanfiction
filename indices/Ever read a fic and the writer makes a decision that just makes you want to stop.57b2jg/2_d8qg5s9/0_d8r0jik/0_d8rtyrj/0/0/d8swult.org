Sorry, but he sounds like my father (who married at 28, put my mother through college (she was studying to become a teacher) by helping her study etc.)...just that my dad got used (so it kind of sounds to me like your brother in law's wife is using him) and later she slept with one of her professors (in order to get grades good enough to pass - my mother isn't the most studious person, she prefers going to parties and intellectual events like the opening of an art collection or to the opera etc.) so they had a divorce (I was only an accident, the copper IUD my mother had implanted wasn't working - but both of them were too chicken to consider abortion (or too indoctrinated - strange, because neither is overly religious! My dad might be a believer, but he's not a zealot by any stretch of the word - hell, he brought me up to be more of a skeptic and I turned into a full blown Atheist!))

I agree that your brother is the exception :) and I hope she knows that she probably won't find another one like him (so that she will not cheat on him and treasure him!)

Those people that want it in real life (I've heard some stories, like girls making a pregnancy pact and sleeping with boyfriends, teachers etc. without protection to get pregnant) are crazy IMHO :(

Yeah, write it if you think you can do it, but announce it in the summary (!) so I can avoid it :)
