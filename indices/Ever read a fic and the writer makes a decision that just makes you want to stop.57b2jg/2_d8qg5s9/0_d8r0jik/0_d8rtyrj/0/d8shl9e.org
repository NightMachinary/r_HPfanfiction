It depends on the situation my Brother-in-Law was 21 at the time i think the guy is the most responsible man I've ever meet, helped her finish HS while he was finishing UNI and working as a Prison Guard (now he is an accountant).

Of course she is probably the exception to the rule. in the sense of fanfiction, one can write about a good story about teenage pregnancy specially considering that some people do make it work in real life. mostly you need to be smart about it and don't drop that kind of plot on a unrelated story
