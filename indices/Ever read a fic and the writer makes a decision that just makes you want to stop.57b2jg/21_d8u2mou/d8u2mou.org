I once started reading the first chapter of a fic on Ao3 and the summery made it out to a fic where Voldemort turns Harry dark but half way though the chapter Voldemort's meeting got swarmed by Stormtroopers... yep, it became a surprise crossover with Star Wars, and there was nothing in the tags to say it was a crossover of any kind.

I also hate if an author makes a character too rich and the heir of too many families, like oh Harry just found out that he's heir of all the Hogwarts founders, Merlin and Morgana La Fey and he's now the richest person in the world, oh and also now he's really attractive because it turns out his mum was a Veela that got adopted. if I read that then I just nope my way right out of that story.
