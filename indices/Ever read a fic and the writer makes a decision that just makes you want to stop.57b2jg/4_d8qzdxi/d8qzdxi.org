I don't remember the fics, but :

- Pureblood Hermione is just stupid
- baby that fixes everything in a relationship (surprisingly, it worked in a few fics that I loved, but it involved an older Hermione, not a teen)
- Hermione learns how to take care of herself over the summer and suddenly is super hot (and "edgy", most of the time, with tattoos and stuff), the worst one I read (started to read, actually), was Hermione discovering that she is actually adopted, a pureblood, and her appearance was glamoured at birth so that as was not recognized (by whom ?). She removes the glamour and boom, taller, skinnier, black straight hair, blue eyes, knows and uses makeup, gets a tattoo to celebrate... I mean, it was something that I could have written at 13 when I dreamt about being goth/emo. Now it just a screams immaturity and teenage fantasies.
