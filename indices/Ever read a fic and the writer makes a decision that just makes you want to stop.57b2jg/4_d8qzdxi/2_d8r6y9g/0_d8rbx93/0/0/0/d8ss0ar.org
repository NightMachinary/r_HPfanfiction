can I get a link to the bimbo fic? But yes I completely get the point you're making about Pureblood!Hermione fics, which is actually true for a lot of pureblood fics which somehow illustrates how everyone pureblood is better looking refined features, while muggleborns and blood traitors (note the weasley family) is stupid and unattractive.

To me I enjoy Hermione as a character and the pureblood fics are like AU which explores different possibility. But of course only if it is a well written fic
