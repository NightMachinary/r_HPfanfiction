To an extent perhaps, in the first book it's already established that Hermione read all her texts, indicating a general thirst for knowledge. I think her ambition and drive would have existed regardless of the wizarding world. Perhaps discrimination gave her knew depths but I think Hermione would still have been the same smart, motivated person even if she wasn't a witch!
