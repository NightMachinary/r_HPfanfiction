Not to mention the weird pureblood supremacy shit. Like, I always wonder if people who push that are racist in real life. How monumentally ignorant do you have to be to take a character for whom one of their defining characteristics is their struggle against prejudice and be like "oh well everything's better now that they're not a filthy mudblood." It would be like taking Magneto and making him not a mutant anymore.
