TBH depends, like there is that one story where it turns out Hermione was adopted but never preaches pureblood supremacy, or even completely alternate universes. The problem is any fic that explores pureblood culture necessarily goes on the tangent that being pureblood is superior without even addressing canon issues of inbreeding, political stagnation etc.
