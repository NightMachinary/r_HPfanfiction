When they just drop in a villain out of nowhere, for no discernable reason.

I was reading this Harry Potter/Inheritance Cycle (Eragon/Eldest/Brisingr/Inheritance), and it was pretty good at first, the only long one to not have slash in it, and it played by canon really well.

It was almost perfect until the chapter after Yazuac, where Harry was shown that killing was something he would have to do, when...

Tom Riddle out of nowhere.

Now, I might not have minded it if Voldemort had taken the place of Durza, but the thing was, the story took place after the Battle of Hogwarts.

It spun some bullshit story about how the horcrux in Harry's head made the entire Kings Cross scene up so he could build himself back up using Harry as a host.

I hit the close tab button really quick on that one.

There was another one like this that annoyed me as well, a Time Travel story that had Harry and Hermione defeat Voldemort in he their first year, in the Stone's chamber.

It was going pretty well for a time travel fic up to then, but apparently Voldemort dying set up a Dark Lord worse than Voldemort.

Then they tried to call it the butterfly effect.

I quit out pretty fucking fast on that one.
