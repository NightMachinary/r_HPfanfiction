I have developed a severe dislike of stories that feature Harry as a little kid. Because the authors always want to make him some twee version of a Dickinson urchin who must resort to eating coffee grounds from the dumpster for nourishment and has bones broken every couple months. But he is still adorable and good-hearted and doesn't end up a raging sociopath (a legit concern for children who are abused)

Plus there's the weird thing where authors want write kid characters with inexplicable lisps and toddler talk because supposedly that's cute.

Edit: Just remembered something else that annoys me.

Another thing that'll have me hitting the back button at the speed of light is the "Harry is summoned to a parallel universe where James and Lily survived" stories. Because the characters ALWAYS develop this instant familial bond that's just weird. Very rarely does anyone point out that these AREN'T Harry's parents. They're different versions of Harry's parents. Any interactions at first should be awkward and confused. Not "they all hugged and burst into a pile of tears."
