Something which always instantly turns me off is extreme dark!Harry. Writing Harry as a complex character who embraces his dark emotions is entertaining to me up until a point. A lot of the Dark!Harry fics out there portray him as a freaken sociopath who completely turns on all his friends and supporters.

It's just not my cup of tea, personally.
