Nearly every fic I try to read has something hard to swallow; getting an entire story to 'ring true' seems to be one of the rarest things in this community. I understand though, we're reading the unpolished work of amateur authors.

Most of the time we're just looking for something clever, fun, or interesting; a different take on a story we're all very familiar with. I read them because I love seeing people's creativity, and a lot of times it's just sifting through garbage hoping for something worthwhile. Every once in a while though you're rewarded by something really great, even if it's just one really good sentence that gives you a new insight.

I think every writer would benefit from reading "Elements of Style" and a Syd Field book or two. Really ambitious amateur authors should also read "The Hero With A Thousand Faces" by Joseph Campbell.
