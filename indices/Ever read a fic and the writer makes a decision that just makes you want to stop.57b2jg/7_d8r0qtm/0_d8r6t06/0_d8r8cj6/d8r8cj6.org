same I'm still waiting to stumble on a well written one all of them are either vernon/-insert evil pureblood- or ones where malfoy gets ginny/mione than they get away with it because who would believe or a poor pureblood/mudblood? Like come on thats so stupid why even include it at that point... You could acomplish much more by hospitalizing said characters and making harry want vengeance...
