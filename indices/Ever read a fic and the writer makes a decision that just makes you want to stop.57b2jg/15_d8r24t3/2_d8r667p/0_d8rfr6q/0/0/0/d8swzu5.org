You are listening to audio books I take it? (How else would you "put it in the background" while doing other stuff?)

Hm...maybe I should give that another go ;) (I normally don't do audio-books because I am faster reading a book on my own, which I enjoy very very much)

Still, yeah, that's exactly it: Why dump the most important piece of content (the supernatural (vampirism, shapeshifting etc.) for Twilight or magic for Harry Potter) if you are supposedly writing a fanfiction? You could really go for original content if you are comfortable doing this (note: It's ok to make changes to say the magic system or to shift roles around - say make the Cullens the "dogs" (shifters) and the werewolf-pack into vamps or something...changing the whole genre however isn't IMHO, that's not why I read fanfiction for a certain work of original fiction - be it Twilight, Harry Potter or any of the things I read fanfiction about!)
