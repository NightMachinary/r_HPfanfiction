Honestly? I'm super bad with names and never fav. It's kinda good because a few years later I can go back and re read something like its new because I've forgotten I've read it. I almost exclusively stick to Bella/Jasper, with the occasional Bella/Carlisle or Bella/Emmett, but these are much rarer. I dislike all human fics and prefer novel length.
