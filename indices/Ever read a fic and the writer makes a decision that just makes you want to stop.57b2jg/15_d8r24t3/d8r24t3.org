Disclaimer - not a Harry Potter story. Also - potential trigger warning - rape mentioned.\\
I have a guilty pleasure at the moment - Twilight fics where Bella ends up with a different Cullen. At the moment I am reading a Jasper/Bella fic. In it they have this pretty well written romance where Jasper runs into Bella several years after Edward left and they fall in love. Eventually they end up meeting back up with the rest of the Cullen's and Edward is all pissed off and emo and pining over Bella still. I know, I know, twilight! But it was actually pretty good. It's novel length and it's a trilogy.\\
In the first few chapters of the second book, Bella and jasper are married, and we find out that before she was turned, Bella conceived a child so she is now pregnant.\\
Then it comes out that EDWARD RAPED HER IN HER SLEEP ON HER WEDDING NIGHT SO THE BABY MIGHT BE HIS. Every one is super pissed, he gets a few things thrown at him, but because he could potentially be the father he is allowed to live in the house, bond with the fetus, Bella forgives him, and then makes everyone else not tear him limb from limb. The only person that reacted vaguely appropriately was Rosalie(which you know why if you know the books), but a few weeks later, he wins her over WITH A PAIR OF DESIGNER SHOES! I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. I did not read 100k+ words for people to be so blaze about rape. Like their reactions are as if he totaled a car or something. Go sit in the naughty corner for a few weeks, we know deep down you're a good boy.
