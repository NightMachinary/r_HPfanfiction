The term I have invented to describe what triggers me to abandon a story is _____-wanking. I define this term as something the author includes in a story because he likes the concept, but it doesn't serve any purpose with the plot.

Power-wanking, for example, is Harry learning all sorts of combat spells, only to never use them in the rest of the story. Melodrama-wanking is everyone having heartfelt moments and tearful discussions and then the relationship dynamics not changing at all. Preening-wanking is involving secondary characters in a scene, just because the main character does something cool - you know you've read it, when a scene starts in Dumbledore's office and the list of those present include: McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick, Sirius, Remus, the Weasleys, random Aurors, other students and so on, and so on.

Things like this are subjective of course. The author might include things for reasons that are not readily apparent. But after reading so much fanfiction, I've developed a rudimentary radar for detecting bullshit that has no reason to be in a story.
