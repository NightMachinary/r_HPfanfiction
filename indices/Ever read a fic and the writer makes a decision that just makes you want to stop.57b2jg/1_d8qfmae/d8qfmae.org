Any fic where a characters looks get changed permanently for seemingly no reason other than to make them 'hotter'. I read a fic once where Fawkes cried into Harrys eyes and he didn't have to wear glasses anymore then he had a haircut or something. It's weird and seems to me only to be there to fit their idealised versiom of the character.
