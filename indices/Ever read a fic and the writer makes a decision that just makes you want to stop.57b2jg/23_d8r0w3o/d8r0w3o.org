Just read linkffn(harry potter and the rune stone path) and while there were many annoying bits, like Harry having to apologise to his girlfriends when he isn't wrong, or having to train extra with a wand in case his runes are taken away (but forgetting that the same could happen to his wand) or having [[/spoiler][Barty Crouch's corpse fall on winky at the cup and those clothes freeing her (for no reason)]].

No what got me was that [[/spoiler][despite having goodish treachers and having Sirius as 5th year teacher and having a population that is more willing to fight Voldy they still need the fucking DA!]] Makes no sense other than clinging to canon like glue.
