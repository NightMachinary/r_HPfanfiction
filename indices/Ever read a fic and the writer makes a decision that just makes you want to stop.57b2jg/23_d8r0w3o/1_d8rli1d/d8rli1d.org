I stopped reading that fic when [[/spoiler][Lily got revived/wasn't dead in the first place]]. It was already pretty ridiculous before that but i still kept it as a guilty pleasure read but that was just the last straw. It just seemed weird and unnecessary. Harry already had all that support from his truly ridiculous amount of hot girlfriends and several teachers. There was really no reason to add /that/ to the mix too.
