I just hit a stumbling block with a one shot I started to expand. The original tone was of a crack fic, but the pair I'm trying to ship has so much angst (at least the way I'm going about it) since I don't feel the romance would be believable or real enough. I'm afraid to post it because the style is so different from the original chapter - it's like a cold bucket of water on what was a light and fun fic.
