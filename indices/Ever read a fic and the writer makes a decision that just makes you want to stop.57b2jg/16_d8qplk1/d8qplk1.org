For me it was A Marauders Plan, it was soo good, until the author started with Harry/Hermione romance, which happened suddenly out of the blue, had these long descriptions of their pretty little dates, and you just couldn't see where did that come from, I mean there was no believable romance development. So I got annoyed and stopped reading.
