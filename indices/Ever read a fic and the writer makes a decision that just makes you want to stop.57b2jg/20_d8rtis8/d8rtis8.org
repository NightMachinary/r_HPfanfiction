A friend of mine writes stories that are often just too goddamned fluffy and often bash some characters while making huge excuses for others. I mean, I get it. It's her stories so it's her choice how to write them, but there's a point where I just can't deal with fluffy!Lucius and Rapist!Sirius and Perfect OP!Hermione.

So yeah. Or writers that just make drama for no reason every chapter. It's boring.
