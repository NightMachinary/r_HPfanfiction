Honestly? Anything that isn't canon-compliant or a parody/trollfic is a no go for me. It just doesn't feel right, ya know?

Along those lines, time travel fics are so frustrating because it's usually "GRITTY MAIN CHARACTER! DESTROY HORCRUXES! HARRY IS DESTINED TO BE WITH HIS OTP (THAT ISN'T ACTUALLY GINNY BECAUSE WEASLEY BASHING)! DUMBLEDORE IS ACTUALLY HITLER INCARNATE! THE END!"
