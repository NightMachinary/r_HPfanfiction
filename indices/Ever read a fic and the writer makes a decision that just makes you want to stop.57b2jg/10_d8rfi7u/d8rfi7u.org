Snaps apologists scenes. Like I was reading something and Harry found out that Sirius was kind of a dick(hadn't been told about the whole attempted murder thing yet) and Harry just went off saying Sirius was evil and the marauders were all awful people and poor Snape just needs a hug. I'm just like 'uhhhh no.' For one it's pretty clear Snape gave as good as he got from the Marauders. And like all that shit was happening either just before a fucking war broke out a war was currently taking place so yeah tensions would be high and factions are gonna start forming in school. I'm not saying the marauders are angels, but villainizing them so Snape can be the hero/Lily's true love is just bad.

Also whenever Tonks is killer or something similar. I love me my Tonks. There was one fic where she was brutally murdered by a 10 year old Harry that was really taken over by Riddle and I just noped the hell outta that.
