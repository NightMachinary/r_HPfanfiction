I honestly don't remember which fic it was but... it was a Harry centric fic of some nature, and the author made Snape evil. Like torture people happily evil. Since Snape is one of my favourite characters, I almost quite reading, just because it was so out of character. In the author's defence, I think it was written between HBP and DH, so they probably didn't think it was OOC. Anyways, they thing that saved the fic, surprisingly, was that the author killed Snape after only 3-4 chapters. Once I didn't have to read about an OOC Snape, I could just ignore that annoyance and enjoy the rest of the fic.

I also read a fic where in one of the early chapters, Bellatrix killed a pregnant woman. Graphically. I don't mind graphic violence, hell I even write some pretty graphic violence. But the way that scene was written, I just couldn't handle it. I didn't even finish the scene (in fact, I'm only assuming that the woman died) and I didn't finish the fic.
