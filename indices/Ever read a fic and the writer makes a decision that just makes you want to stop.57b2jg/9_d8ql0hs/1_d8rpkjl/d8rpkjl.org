The only fics I've seen this happen in is the LOTR crossovers, the ones where he somehow get turned into an Elfling? And with the mind of someone 17+ starts blubbering and hiding his face in capes and shit. The only "good" Elfling HP/LOTR fic I've ever seen is Steelbadgers, which is basically a crackfic.

(Sorry for bad grammar etc.)
