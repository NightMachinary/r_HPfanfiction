Fics where Harry turns into a blubbering wreck, panics, pisses himself or something equally as pathetic when confronted with danger.

I understand people want to make sure Harry isn't god-like (or any other super powerful fics) but even in canon, when confronted with something scary (Troll, Quirrel, Basilisk, Voldemort etc) he's scared sure but not a coward.
