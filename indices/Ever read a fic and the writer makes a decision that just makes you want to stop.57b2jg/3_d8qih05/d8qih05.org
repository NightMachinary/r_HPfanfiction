Sure I did.

I remember once reading a fic that maybe wasn't great but was somewhat readable, and then a certain character made a very stupid mistake that almost killed Harry and they got estranged, then Harry went (in the middle of an effing Hogwarts year) to a Christian mass, “learned forgiveness”, and apologised to said person for ... I'm not sure what exactly because he shouldn't have been the one apologising.

It made me drop the story and anything of that author's I had on my to-read list.

Another time an author decided that dedicating a whole chapter of a story with clearly wizards and witches of no clearly visible faith to a rant (from the mouth of one of those characters) that is pretty much about why Christianity is superior to atheism, and the result ... well, the same as above.

I have nothing against Christianity per se, but just as any other possible plot element of a story, it should be used when and where it fits, and in a way that does not make the readers make horrified faces and/or flinch in either disgust or confusion. Those two authors failed to do it. And there are other writers and other stories I remember, but those two I remember the most ... possibly because I remember them both trying to defend those decisions and not doing a very good job of that.
