Yes, actually. It's not a great reason, but by not naming those stories outright I'd tried not to put people off them by pointing and saying “look, those stories are crappy” because they really aren't if you can stomach the religion thing, and if people were told that the story is crappy before they could decide for themselves it could ruin whatever enjoyment they might have actually had.

But, as I already wrote, it's really not a great reason; rather minor in the grand scheme of things, to be honest.
