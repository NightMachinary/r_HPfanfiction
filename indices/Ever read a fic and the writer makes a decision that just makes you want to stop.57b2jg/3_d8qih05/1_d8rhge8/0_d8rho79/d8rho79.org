The sequel to another story that actually was quite good and had Voldemort lose the graveyard duel due to his Death Eaters' stupidity and where a certain character came back back then? Yup, that's the one.

And honestly, I'd tried to power through it, but for me a lot of enjoyment comes from ability to imagine all that takes place as I read it, and I can't do that when it all goes too crappy and my imagination gives me a “fuck you”; with that, I just couldn't continue because it felt more dry than drinking sand.
