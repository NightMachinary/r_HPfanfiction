Hmm, well, if properly justified and properly implemented I could see almost any plot element combined with HP. But religion, as any of the currently visible faiths rather than just elements of mythology with some deities of the old times being present in some way, is quite hard to both justify and implement properly; and, obviously, most people don't manage. So as far as most stories are concerned, I share your sentiment that they should not be mixed.

That said, the question of whether things like D&D deities---as proposed by [[/u/Evilsbane][u/Evilsbane]] in another reply to your comment---would count as “religion” is pretty much a semantical one, so I presume you did not include things of that ilk when you spoke of religion.
