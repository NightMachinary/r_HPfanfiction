Well, if it's fantasy deities (like say Elune from Warcraft - in a Warcraft-Crossover) I don't have a problem (especially if those deities really show up in their respective fantasy settings, so that proof of their existence is there...I have a problem if someone who can do magic believes anything about gods, I mean every wizard is kind of like a demigod - they can after all force the universe to obey their will, even if only on a small (compared to the size of the universe) scale! So my first go to theory as a wizard would be that any deity is just a very powerful wizard!)
