When a relationship is going great and building trust in a natural manner and the guy in the pairing rapes the woman in the pairing, like it's no big deal, and it's instantly forgotten or forgiven.

It's in so many stories I've read.

There's a trio of stories called whole again, which I in general like. Each focused on one character, either Sirius, Severus or Remus.
