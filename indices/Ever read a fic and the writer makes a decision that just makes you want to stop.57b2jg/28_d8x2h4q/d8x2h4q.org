Wow, this thread has a lot of comments!

In general terms, I quit reading fics if they have extreme 'bashing'. To clarify, I have a very precise definition of bashing that's different from other people's; my definition of 'bashing' is when a character is portrayed as wrong, stupid, evil, et-cetera, AND this is used by the narrative to justify obnoxious, immoral, or outright illegal actions towards that someone by the main characters.

So, 'Ron is a jerk' isn't really bashing for me, but 'Hermione castrates Ron and leaves him bleeding in the Great Hall and gets away with it, because Ron is a jerk' is bashing. 'Lucius Malfoy gets fined for possession of dark artifacts' isn't bashing, 'the Malfoys have everything seized and are sold into slavery for not attending Muggle Studies classes' is bashing. ...Perhaps I need a new word to describe my personal definition of 'bashing'...also, by the way, that last Malfoys example did happen.

Also, individual case: Tonks was Imperius'd to attack an ICW meeting in France, and was apprehended; during her imprisonment, the French Aurors deny her any human contact (or a lawyer), use heavy torture curses whenever she does something even slightly wrong (like trying to open a door at the end of a hallway she's been ordered to go down, before being told to open the door), and force her to swear two Unbreakable Vows (1. Never commit a crime against a French citizen, ever, and 2. Always obey the commands of Sirius Black, and yes, it's noted that Sirius ordering her to commit a crime against a French civilian would kill her.) as a condition of her release, without convicting her of anything.

And nobody in the fic even batted an eye at this treatment. So yeah, screw that fic.
