Post second year: Albus and the staff are in a meeting with the Heads of House. They decide that Each must take a year off (time Turning) (Year 3 with Minerva, Repeat with Flitwick, Repeat with Snape, Repeat with Pamona [A little OOCness, make her a badass with Martial Arts or something, Last year with Albus]) to train Harry and prepare for LVs ultimate return. Culminating with Harry's 4th year and the end of LV.
