"You came early this year. Why?"

Albus stilled, "Is it so obvious?"

"There's a reason for everything you do. What was your reason in this?"

Albus responded hesitantly, "A question..."

The prisoner stiffened, and moved back from the bars slightly.

After a moment, Albus asked, "How does one beat an unbeatable foe?"

The prisoner grimaced, "Do you mock me? /YOU/ of all people?"

"No, Gellert. I-"

"Has it finally come to this? You've come to flaunt your victory at last?"

Albus' eyes widened, "Never. You know-"

The prisoner cut him off with a bark of bitter laughter, "What do /I/ know of beating unbeatable foes, Albus? The world has made /you/ the authority on such matters. Here is the proof!" He spread his arms wide. "Do you not see it? Maybe the world has forgotten. Only you and the gaolers travel this high anymore!"

There was silence, and neither man responded. The prisoner glared in fury at his old foe, and his older friend. But perhaps that was gone to him as well, and then he would have nothing.

"I never asked you," Albus said, "about how it happened."

The prisoner spat back, "Because I /told/ you never to ask!"

"You had the wand," Albus whispered, "and yet..."

"Oh? Is that it then? Have you finally met your match with Old Tom? You fear that wand shall fail you, as you believe it failed me? Well, rest assured /old friend/, you have nothing to fear on that count. You are far too /ambitious./ You never move without a purpose."

Albus recoiled, as if struck.

"Well?" the prisoner prompted. "Is that it then? Would you cash in your final coin for an answer? I shall give it if you ask, and then you must /never/ return here again."

Albus stood silent, as if lost in thought.

The prisoner let out a mirthless chuckle. "You deliberate." His voice was cold. "You play your games, move your pawns, and wonder if this pathetic piece is finally worth the sacrifice. Well, take me off the board then. I grow weary..."

Albus' looked up at his friend, "No. Never. Not you..." He stepped forward and lifted his hands, still bound in fur gloves, towards the silver bars. He began to reach through them.

The prisoner's eyes widened, "No, Albus! Don't!"

Albus' hands passed through the bars and reached into the cell.

The prisoner gaped. That should not have been possible; /nothing/ passed the plane of the bars and survived. He should know; they were of his design, after all.

Albus stood there, arms outstretched, and waited.

Slowly, like a startled animal, the prisoner made his approach. "H-how..."

Albus smiled sadly, "It wouldn't be magic if I revealed all my tricks." The prisoner stared. "Though, I was saving this one, for when the time was right..."

The prisoner, so long without human contact, reached out his own unbelieving hands. Slowly, he entwined them into that of his old friend.

And then he recoiled.

"Albus! Your hand..."

Albus did not move, his sad smile did not waver. The prisoner reached out tentatively, and removed the glove from the old wizard's left hand.

For all the horrors the prisoner had seen, and those he committed, he still shivered at the sight of the blackened, withered thing before him.

His eyes darted between the hand and his friend's eyes, calculating and figuring in a way he'd not done in half a century. His gaze finally settled on the blue eyes. "This is it, then?"

Albus nodded, and reached his unmarred hand out to take his friend's, and squeezed it gently. "Alas, I saved by best trick for last."

*Part 3 on the way. This is turning out to be a bit longer than expected.*
