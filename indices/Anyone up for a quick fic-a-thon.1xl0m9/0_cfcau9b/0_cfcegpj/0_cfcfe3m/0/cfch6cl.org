"Then, the unbeatable foe..." the prisoner whispered.

"Must Not be Named."

"You still posses it? The wand?"

Albus nodded, "Thus, should I perish to /his/ curse..."

Nothing more need be said on that matter. Both knew who the wand would choose as its next master should such a thing come to pass.

"Is there time then?" The prisoner asked. "Can he be beaten before the end?"

"Come now, Gellert," Albus smiled wryly, "Were that the case, I would not have asked such an impertinent question."

The prisoner squeezed his hand and then, after a moment, took the maimed one as well. His expression grew serious. "You wish to know then, how one who possessed the wand could be beaten?"

"It was never my intent to ask, nor to ask why I mustn't ask. But yes."

The prisoner nodded and paused, looking into Albus' eyes. "I was selfish."

"Gellert, your reasons for not discussing this were your own. It wasn't selfish to refuse to dredge up-"

"No," the prisoner cut in. "Not selfish to withhold my knowledge." He swallowed dryly. "Selfishness is what lead to my defeat. My selfishness was my downfall..."

Albus did not speak, prompting the prisoner to continue.

"You were there, Albus, from the beginning. You shared my ambition..." The prisoner scowled, "/For the greater good./ Bah! So much evil done for four cursed words. And yet I persisted, waded through a sea of blood in search of green pastures.."

"That is passed us now..." Albus soothed.

"Ambition... it reared its head in those four words, and it surely would have consumed me."

Albus did not argue this fact, "And yet it did not consume you in the end. Why, old friend?"

"Because I was selfish, Albus! I stood across from you at the end, in a field of fire and destruction that we had wrought! You had the phoenix, but /I/? I had the /wand/! Unbeatable! Invincible! All it asks for is the ambition- the will to power."

There were tears in the prisoner's eyes, foreign things to him like the warmth of the sun, like anything but cold stone beneath his feet.

"But then I looked at you Albus, /truly/ looked. I saw the ferocity in you, the passion. You would stand before me, ready to die, like in all those childish vows we made in our quest for the Hallows. We swore we'd give our lives... for the greater good..."

The prisoner sagged. "But there, in that field, I saw you. And I remembered... I'd thought myself the deliverer of the wizarding world, a Magical Moses. But I saw you, and knew that you would perish before you laid aside your wand. I would lose you at the last..."

"Gellert..." Albus whispered, eyes glistening.

"And I asked myself, 'What is the use of the 'greater good' if, at the end, there was nothing /good/ left for me?" He smiled sadly. "You see? I was selfish. I was spent. In that moment, my ambition left me, and so too did the power of the wand."

"Oh, Gellert..." Albus said softly, and he raised his hand to the prisoner's cheek. "Gellert... why didn't you tell me?"

"I... I was ashamed. All the things done in the name of my ambition, tossed aside because I could not get what /I/ wanted. Hypocritical. /Weak./"

"It wasn't weakness, Gellert. Nor hypocrisy, nor selfishness."

Gellert looked at him, a mixture of hope and doubt carved into his face. "What was it, then?"

Albus smiled, "A force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than the forces of nature. The same force that brings me here, to you."

The two old friends stood there for a long time, neither speaking. Albus knew this admission had taken much from his old friend, and he lamented now that they would not have the time to heal this, the final wound. Even after all this time, it seemed that there was so much left unsaid.

And so Albus, never one for half measures, decided to say nothing more on the matter. Instead, he spoke with a surprising levity. "Oh! I almost forgot. I found something that you simply /must/ see."

The prisoner eyed his friend quizzically. Albus lifted his maimed hand, and turned it so that the back faced his friend.

The prisoner had not noticed the ring worn there, the metal had been scored by curse until its tarnished surface all but blended into the darkened flesh. The reverse side however, had been set with a black gem. A series of small scratches had been worked into the stone and, as the prisoner leaned closer to examine it, his eyes expanded.

"Mein Gott... Albus, is that...?"

"Finding it once meant the world to us, Gellert. Well, one third of the world really, if one goes by the arithmancy of it. I thought you should see it, to know that we didn't quest after fairy tales."

The prisoners eyes were filled with a childlike wonderment, and his face seemed to shed years. He clapped his hands and nearly jumped for joy, his previous laments all but forgotten.

"Baba Yaga's tits! You found it. And you snuck it in here? How?"

Albus gave him a withering look, "Really now, Gellert. I am the Supreme Mugwump and a wizard of advanced years. What guard would dare deny such a man his /gloves/ on such an abysmally cold day?"

The prisoner laughed. "And tell me, what great power has the stone granted you?"

Albus chuckled, "Why, it's going to kill me, of course!"

"Of course!"

Both men continued laughing, and in that moment they felt young again.

They conversed for another hour about the old days, and the bloody damned Hallows that, in the end, would be the end of them both. There was no bitterness, nor remorse, at least not for the time they had shared, as short as it had been.

In the end, the conversation wound down slowly, as such conversations were want to do. Albus made a gift of his fur-lined gloves to the prisoner, along with a heartfelt apology that such a small thing was unworthy of their friendship. The prisoner did not hear this, as he was raptly focused on sliding the gloves over his long-chilled, arthritic hands. He smiled at himself as he flexed his fingers, like a child at Christmas. Albus had offered to let him hold the ring, but this was waved off casually. Such things were inconsequential now.

They said their goodbyes, choosing to run with their long-practiced script, neither mentioning that this would be their last meeting.

Albus turned to leave and had is hand on the door when Gellert called out from behind.

"That ring, it was Riddle's wasn't it? He had the stone all along."

"Assuredly. Turned it into a /Horcrux/ of all things. Can you imagine?"

Gellert let out a disgusted huff, "Impudent little whelp. You think he even knew what he had?"

"I am unsure, though I hope he did. Let him try his hand at the quest; see if he fares any better than /us./"

Gellert laughed. "Oh, I suspect he knows. For all his madness, he /is/ clever. No doubt he is following the trail of the wand as we speak. Imagine his surprise when it leads back to you!"

Albus did not smile at this, as the revelation struck him, "Gellert... If he is following the trail of the wand..."

"He will find Gregorovitch, if he has not already. That old man could never keep his mouth shut. And that will lead him to me!"

Albus saw that Gellert was smiling. "Voldemort will find a way in here. His power of incursion and ward-breaking exceeds even my own. You won't be safe here. I could have you transferred-"

Gellert waved this off. "Please, and miss an opportunity to tell Tom, 'Du kannst mich mal?' Nein. Whichever of us first sets off on the next great journey, let the other not be far behind."

"That is your wish?"

"I look forward to it," Gellert grinned, revealing stained and broken teeth. "And may our /next/ adventure be more fortuitous than the last."

XXXXXXXXXXXX

Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was smiling as he collected his possessions from the security station at the base of Nurmengaard, being sure to conceal his ungloved hands in his pockets as much as possible, like a child feigning innocence in a sweets shop.

He was handed his deluminator.

"A pleasure to have you here, Sir!"

Phoenix kibble.

"We hope you visit again soon, Sir!"

Lemon Drops and baubles.

"It's been an honor, Sir. Truly an honor!"

Finally, the old guard stood at silent attention and held out, unbeknownst to him, a wooden stick of incalculable power. Albus pocket the wand and, after the briefest pause, took the old guard's hand and shook it firmly.

If the guard took note of this unusual gesture, or that the old wizard was missing his gloves, he said nothing. He met Albus' eyes and nodded once. Albus smiled, and nodded back, and then walked out the doors.

The rain and wind were still blowing, but the cold did not bite as deep as it had before, even without his gloves. His question had been answered, far truer than even Gellert realized, and a long-held suspicion had been confirmed.

Fawks appeared on cue and squawked at his master. This meeting had taken longer than expected, and Albus had another appointment to keep, with yet another adventurer. That young man's quest would be terrible indeed, but now there was hope that he could succeed, that he would meet a more fortuitous end than two, broken old men.

How does one beat an unbeatable foe?

"With love." He whispered.

Man and bird vanished in a flash of orange light.
