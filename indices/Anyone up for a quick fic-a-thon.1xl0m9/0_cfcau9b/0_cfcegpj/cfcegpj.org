  "But what's it mean when suddenly we're spent? Tell me true - ambition came and reared its head and went far from you."

Albus shivered and immediately regretted sending away the Phoenix. The blowing wind and rain cut through his fur-lined cloak and gloves, penetrating to his very core. Before him stood the grim fortress, the terrible message carved above it's doors:

"For the Greater Good."

Albus shivered; a different chill entirely. He hated this place, and so did Fawkes. That was why he'd sent her away. She'd return shortly, however, once this final task was complete.

He stepped up to the doors which opened to admit him, and he stepped out of the rain, though the cold remained.

The Aurors were deferential, of course, all but genuflecting to the Supreme Mugwump.

"A pleasure, Sir!"

"An honor to have you here, Sir."

"Allow me to take your coat, Sir."

Albus took this in stride. The youngest ones were the worst, the ones who rotated in and out of this dismal station on an annual basis. This visit was, in actuality, one of the few things of note to happen in this place. Somehow, this made their groveling even worse.

There was one guard, however, who did not rotate. He had been stationed here for over fifty years, refusing other postings outright. He never spoke of it to the young ones, the ones who changed with the seasons. He'd fought in the war. He knew who was held here, and the cost to make it so.

This old guard simply nodded to Albus. It was the 51st nod he'd given the aged wizard. Albus returned it in kind.

Their deference, of course, did not translate to a lack of security precautions. He'd be searched, his wand would be held, his trinkets deposited.

"Terribly sorry for this, Sir."

"Protocol is protocol, Sir."

"I hope you understand, Sir."

The old guard merely nodded, and Albus handed him his wand. A small smile crept up on Albus. After all these years, the irony never escaped him.

How much had gone into acquiring that wand? The lives lost? Things destroyed? So much done to get it into Albus' hands, only to hand it over in /here/, so close to /him/.

This was /his/ place, Albus knew. Built by him, to hold his worst enemies.

In a way, it had fulfilled its mission.

"Your ambition nearly destroyed us all, Gellert," Albus whispered, not unkindly. "Even yourself..."

Dispossessed of his wand, deluminator, small bag of Phoenix kibble, tin of lemon drops, and a small assortment of baubles, he stepped past the guard station.

Albus waved off the proffered escort. Such was his /grande and moste honoured/ privilege as Supreme Mugwump. And besides, he knew the way.

Another benefit of his station: freedom to visit this place with neither inquiry nor suspicion whenever the urge took him, which was once a year. In truth, this perk was one of the reason why he bothered to retain the office, though he'd never admit as much to his 'most esteemed colleagues of the ICW.'

"Hundreds of the world's most powerful and accomplished witches and wizards," He thought sardonically as he made his way up the winding stair to its zenith, "Put them together, and they struggle to agree on what color wallpaper should adorn their headquarters."

Such was the terrible, most ancient power of committee. The second most powerful force in the Magical world.

Albus had reached the top of the stair and reached out for the dull iron handle on the oaken door.

But it was that /first/ power that brought him here today, and compelled him to return every year.

He turned the knob and stepped through.

The room was not overly large, though it's space was further halved, bisected by the row of goblin-wrought silver bars at intervals of 6 inches. The walls were cold stone and, thought it held the highest perch in this fell fortress, little light reached the interior.

Through the bars, on the far side of the room, a bundle of rags stirred itself.

The rags spoke, "You came early this year. Though... perhaps time has finally escaped me..."

Albus shook his head, "No, you have the right of it, Gellert. Allow me, then, to wish you an anticipatory 'Happy Birthday'."

"How thoughtful..." The rags whispered. "Did you, by chance remember my gift?"

"Every year," Albus said softly, "you ask."

The rags coughed. "Ja."

"Before I enter, they dispossess me of everything save the clothes on my back."

The rags chuckled dryly, "And I always hope that their policy will change..." He looked up to meet Albus' eyes, "...One way or the other."

Albus could not help the smile that quirked the corner of his mouth.

They chatted for a while, about the good times: the adventures shared, the great quest endeavored, and of the nights. Only the good times, that was the unspoken rule. And those times, short as they had been, /had/ been good enough to endure.

But as the conversation drew on, the prisoner began to eye Albus curiously, near suspiciously. At last, the reverie of things remembered was broken with a question.
