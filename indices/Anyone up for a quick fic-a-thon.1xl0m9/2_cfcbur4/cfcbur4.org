here's a bunny from my "musing from my madness file" on ffn that i never got around to following up:

*Harry pulled back a bit and spoke in a near whisper, the sound echoing in the hallway as if carried by the storm itself "It's said that Odin gave his eye for wisdom. I can't help but be envious of what you are about to learn."*

*Not even the thunder could keep quiet the sounds of enlightenment.*
