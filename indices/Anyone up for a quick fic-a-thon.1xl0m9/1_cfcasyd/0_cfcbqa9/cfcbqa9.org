/"And this ability of yours... to detect Voldemort's presence, even when he is disguised, and to know what he is feeling when his emotions are roused... has become more and more pronounced since Voldemort returned to his own body and his full powers..."/

It's like being watched. This nagging sort of up-all-night, over-your-shoulder watched. Sometimes it creeps up like a long night: darkness, the whisper of a touch. Other times it is a full-body heave, or a lightning strike. Just when he thinks there is nothing but himself, that he is alone, he feels it, like a lick on the nape of his neck, or a finger tracing up to the crown of his skull. Not his head, but his skull. It is inside him, a very part of him, skulking in his bones, a gathering storm. It wakes him in the middle of the night. His body is quick to consciousness, a jolt, all tension. His eyes are slower to that point, his mind further behind. When he opens his eyes he isn't quite sure of his surroundings, the darkness is familiar but he can't trust it - like déjà vu.

It takes more nights like this, sudden thrusts into wakefulness, his heart pounding, this feeling of eyes in the darkness, both trained on him, before the ache begins.

"Are you paying attention, Harry?"

"Hm?"

"Did you hear what I just said?"

Ginny is sprawled on the grass by the lake. The day is hot and calm, her ankle socks are disposed of near her school bag. The air stirs in brief intervals, like quick, slow exhales. Steady. But still, it is hot, the first really warm day of the year. /Unbearably so,/ Harry feels, yet doesn't quite feel at all.

It's happening more and more often, these feelings he can't quite reconcile as his own. Yet they exist in him fully formed, reflexive, instant responses.

"Of course I did. You were telling me about Potions?"

"Well, five minutes ago I was!" She throws her head back, letting it fall behind her in a stretch. A single drop of sweat rolls down her skin, down her throat and to her décolletage, down further, lost between her breasts.

Something stirs inside Harry, a conflict, a longing. Open-mouthed, gazing, he gets lost in her skin. He feels the way he thinks he must have always felt while gazing at this creature. The way she lies - she is all at once this woman, barefoot in the grass, and the pale girl, close to death, he rescued from a chamber. She relaxes into her pose, limp in the sun. He is both watching her and watching himself watch her, his mind drifts to the question he once had of what would happen if you faced a mirror before another mirror, and what if one of those mirrors was the one of Erised? What would you see? What would eternity look like, magnified by desire? Is that a sight of which humans are capable?

He imagines it would look like this.

Ginny opens one eye and holds Harry in her squinted gaze.

"Potter. You're drooling."

And it isn't that he wants to, but more that he has to, in fact all of his mind screams and rails at his tensing muscles, but their momentum builds and grows and carries him, there is jealousy burning through his skin and boring into his very marrow. It happens both in slow motion and quicker than he thought he was capable of moving, over and over again in replay. He pounces, teeth bared. His hand catches her throat and she splutters incoherently, the breath trapped inside her lungs. Her arms flail and move to throw him off of her but he is consumed by something inhuman, his one hand driving her closer to the ground and the other coming down on her arm, his knee coming up to pin her entirely.

Her face loses color, her eyes flash at him, frightened, but then soften.

It is not the first time she has been held this way. To her, Harry is both the boy who carried her away on phoenix-back from an underground cavern, and the boy who once kept her there.
