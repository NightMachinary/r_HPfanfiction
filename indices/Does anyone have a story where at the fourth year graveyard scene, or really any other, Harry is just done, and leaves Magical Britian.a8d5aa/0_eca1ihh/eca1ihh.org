Harry GTFOing out of Magical Britain or just turning his back on their bullshittery is an amazing genre. I'm going to recommend some, but they aren't necessarily after the graveyard:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7573003/1/Harry-s-had-Enough]]) and its sequel linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7782623/1/Damn-Wizards]])

by the same author: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7053661/1/Harry-Potter-The-Forgotten-Brother]])

harry and hermione gtfo after the final battle: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6445945/1/Prophecy-Smophecy]])

another one where Harry leaves them to rot in their own filth after defeating Voldemort: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8837257/1/Wizards-Fall]])

this one also sorta kinda works linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2275101/1/No-Thanks]])

[[/u/InquisitorCOC]] already mentioned a fic by chem prof, but I think in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3867175/1/Notebooks-and-Letters]]) they leave Britain as well.

There's probably more, but I don't wanna overdo it.
