Probably my favorite OTP from HP is Harry/Luna.

For Naruto, it's Danzo/Tenten. I also like Naruto/Tayuya, and Naruto/Tenten; I hate Naruto/Hinata, because most authors just use the "WOW HINATA LOVED ME ALL THIS TIME I LOVE HER TOO EVEN THOUGH WE ONLY TALKED LIKE TWICE AND WE'RE BOTH STILL TWELVE" excuse. I read Blind, and enjoyed it; their relationship made sense in it.

In AGK, it's Tatsumi/Seryu. Justice is best girl.
