For my "not limited to Harry Potter" ship, I got into Percy Jackson fanfiction right after the third book had just come out (the Titan's Curse). I really liked the Percy/Thalia ship which admittedly doesn't seem like an odd ship. The thing is at the time the community was kind of critical of ships that weren't Percy/Annabeth, to the point that some people were doing some bad flaming towards authors that were writing the Percy/Thalia stories. That along with Rick Riordan as good as killing off Thalia in the following books stopped the pairing from really going anywhere...

So yeah, not really the oddest paring maybe but pretty rare. Maybe I should try writing a story for it one of these days...
