I think this was a few years ago. I recently skimmed the comments in one of the forum topics to see what the TL was like, and one main participant - possibly a moderator - dissed those silly LJ fests a couple of times. There may have been a perceived tension between LiveJournal members and ff.net back then; I gather there wasn't a lot of overlap amongst the fans. But now LJ is fading because much of its active fanbase has moved to Tumblr.

However, if you get HP Beholder Version II up and running, I will help spread the word. It is much missed.
