Well, anybody with modly powers and aspirations could probably start a fest along the same lines but with a different name. I get the impression, though, that ff.net doesn't understand the point of exchange fests (although this is an impression formed by a couple of offhand remarks made on the - what is it, the Teacher's Lounge forum?). It could conceivably do outreach to the LiveJournal community, which was the fest's life's blood and the reservoir it drew from for both readers and writers. Or it could start afresh.

One reason HP Beholder was so beloved was that the quality of the writing tended to be pretty high. It was all one-shots, and popular pairings weren't allowed, although popular characters could form one half of the pairing.

As with all fests, it needs a dedicated and organized mod and a certain amount of publicity. If the former audience caught wind of a new incarnation, I'm pretty sure they'd all want to check it out.
