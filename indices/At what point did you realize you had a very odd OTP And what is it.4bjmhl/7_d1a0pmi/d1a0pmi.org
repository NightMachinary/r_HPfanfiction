Oh, instantly. That was part of the point. "Ordinary" ships almost never hook me in fandom. Canons of all kinds supply that already. Plus my ficcish preferences tend towards beauty in ugliness, marginal characters, outsiders, older characters, history from the loser's or enemy's perspective, that sort of thing.

So almost every ship I enjoy is odd. My first and still favorite, my OTP, is Snape/Harry, and of /course/ I knew it was odd from the moment I encountered it. So is Snape/Dumbledore and Snape/Filch. Snape/Minerva is probably as 'conventional' as it gets.

I also love all kinds of unexpected pairings. HP Beholder (an exchange fest that ran on InsaneJournal for years, although it closed its doors in 2014) was my favorite thing ever, and its whole /raison d'etre/ was unconventional pairings.
