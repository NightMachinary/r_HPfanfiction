Hm. Interesting. I would've gone the other way 'round with the roles there on instinct, but now that you've mentioned it ... I could see that.

On a similar note, I'd like to see dom(me) fem!Harry x sub Tom Riddle/Voldemort. Or dom(me) anyone x sub Riddle. He might seek power and all that, but his incessant need to be /prove/ that he's the biggest, baddest guy in the room (instead of /acting/ it) just screams closet sub.

I might have to go in a corner and rethink my life, but frankly, I don't care.
