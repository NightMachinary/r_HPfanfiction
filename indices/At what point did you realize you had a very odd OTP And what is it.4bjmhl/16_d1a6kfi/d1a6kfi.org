Harry Potter/Tom Riddle through time travel or one just being born in another time period. I like their characterizations to be as close to canon as possible too. I know that comes off a bit odd and twisted to some.

Harry/Pyro (X-Men): I only found one author who writes them, but I love this pairing. - linkff(7748339)

Supernatural: I got hooked on Sam Winchester/Brady (the demon.) He was only in one freaking episode, but it gave him a history with Sam at Stanford that was so full of possibilities.

Star Wars: Han Solo/Anakin Skywalker. I have yet to find a fic with this pairing, but I want it so, so bad.
