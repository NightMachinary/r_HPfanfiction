If you liked roundabout destiny, I've got two for you (haven't read the other two). Linkffn(debt of time) which has a (nearly identical) plot to roundabout destiny. The writing is better, and the smut contained within is both frequent and excellent.

And my all time favorite fic. I am on a one man quest to make sure everyone knows about it, linkffn (one hundred sixty nine). Hermione goes back to 1981 as an adult - she has 169 days to stop voldemort. Sirius / Hermione isn't even my favorite pairing in the fic - Remus / earl grey is a love that shall not waver. Enjoy! And thanks for the recs!
