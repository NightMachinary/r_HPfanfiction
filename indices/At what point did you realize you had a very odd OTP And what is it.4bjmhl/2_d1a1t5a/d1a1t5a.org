Oliver/Katie is my OTP. I know some people only like reading fics about the trio, but I'm the opposite. I want stories about what happened with the background characters while Harry was doing his thing, or how the rest of the wizarding world functions. Some authors do an amazing job of fleshing out the world of Professional Quidditch.
