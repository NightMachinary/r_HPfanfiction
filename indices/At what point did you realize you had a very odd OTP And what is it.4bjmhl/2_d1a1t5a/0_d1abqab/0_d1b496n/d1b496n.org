A Whiff of Competition linkffn(7866813) is one of the best, with training facilities and inter-team rivalries. In progress, updated occasionally. I don't think it's been abandoned.

Neurotically Obsessed linkffn(4044859) similarly shows intra and inter-team dynamics after the war in a very creative way, you just fall into the story. I'm fairly certain it's been abandoned, though, but it's one of my favorites - I still reread it because what's there is substantial.
