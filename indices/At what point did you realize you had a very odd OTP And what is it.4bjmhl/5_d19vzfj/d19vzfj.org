My OTP is one of the polarizing ones but I don't know how "odd" it is. I'm a staunch Sevmione fan but I understand that it's a squick for many.

I realised it about 10 minutes after join my first fan forum discussion.

While not my OTP I have at least one other pairing favourite I've not come across written and that's Cedric Diggory and Moaning Myrtle
