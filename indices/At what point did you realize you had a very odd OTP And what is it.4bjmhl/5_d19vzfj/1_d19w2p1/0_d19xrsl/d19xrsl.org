Yeah a lot of people feel the same. It's either the age difference thing or the teacher student thing that bothers them usually. Neither of which gives me the ick. Though my favs are usually Post Hallows (and therefore EWE and AU) when neither is really a huge factor.

Yeah regarding Cedric and Myrtle I have a sweet little head canon about them I'll probably write u one of these days.

What is it about Sevmione that creeps you out? I'm always interested in understanding how other people view particular pairs.

That said, what is it in the Hermione/Bellatrix dynamic that appeals? I tend to think Bella is the prime example of why you don't stick your (metaphorical) dick in crazy, but that's obviously only my inclination.
