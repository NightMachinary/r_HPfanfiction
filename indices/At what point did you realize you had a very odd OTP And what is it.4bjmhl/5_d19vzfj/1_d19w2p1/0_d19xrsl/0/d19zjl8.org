For me I don't really like this because its more of a Snape thing. I know he turned out to be good in the end and his life was very tragic. I feel plenty bad for him and teared up myself when we found out the truth about him and Lily and all that. That doesn't change the fact that he wasn't a nice guy. He was bitter and took out his anger by tormenting the son of his childhood enemy. He was too caught up in the idea of Lily even though she is been dead for over a decade to even consider being paired with someone in my mind... especially with Hermione. Personally thats why I don't like it but I have nothing against anyones tastes. I've read some pretty weird stuff myself including Harry/Bellatrix which is even less likely than this.
