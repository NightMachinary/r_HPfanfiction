My main bag is for fics which have a plot centered on something other than a ship. I prefer romance as the garnish not the main meal. I haven't read any threesome, foursome or harem fics purely because the relationship dynamics involved usually occupy the whole plot. Which is fine its just not to my taste.

I've seen Sirius/Tuney and Lupin/Tuney although I wasn't particularly sold on either that was probably down to the writers' skill and story choices than the pairing I think.
