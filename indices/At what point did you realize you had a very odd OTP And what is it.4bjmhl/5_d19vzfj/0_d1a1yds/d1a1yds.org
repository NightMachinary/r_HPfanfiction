HG/SS was the first pairing I spent time looking into. I've since branched out to Hermione-with-essentially-any-male-not-Ron.

In terms of oddness I've found and liked a few triad HG/SS/LM fics. Sometimes it's Draco and Lucius sharing Hermione. Also HP/HG Harem fics.

... and I not-so-secretly love me some Ron bashing. Molly too. I like Ginny though.

The most random (not-crack) pairing I've seen Sirius gets together with Petunia in a fic or two. She usually realizes she loved her sister, magic isn't that bad, and Vernon's outed as an abusive bitch who gets his comeuppance.
