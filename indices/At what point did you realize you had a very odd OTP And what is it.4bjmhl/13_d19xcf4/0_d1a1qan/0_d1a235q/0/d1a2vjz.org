My gateway drug was Chasing The Sun by Loten. (The third act is not quite perfect but still excellent).

All time favourite is without doubt Self Slain Gods on Strange Altars by Scumblackentropy. It isn't complete and I doubt it ever will be but it is a bleak, brutal and beautiful piece even incomplete. I warn you however - this does feature student/teacher sex, the characters themselves are aware it is wrong but there is a certain quality of desperation to their coupling that makes it understandable if not forgivable. It's hard reading but well worth it.

The Art of Brewing by Note-A-Flat is a WIP, it's gentler and ventures into OOC territory a little but there is plenty of story here it isn't simply a ship fic.

The opening chapters of The Unspeakable Files are amongst some of the best I've read in terms of hooking the reader. It's a double header - SS/HG and DM/LL I haven't read it all yet but it's certainly worth a look.

That's a good start I suppose. I will be happy to link you my own as I start publishing as it comes under this heading as well.
