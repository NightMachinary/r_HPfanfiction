I don't think it's odd, but there's very, very little Viktor/Hermione, and it's the pairing I wish was canon.

I'm trying to think of weird pairings I've enjoyed. FanboyPhaedrus writes a terribly sweet Dumbledore/Draco and a compelling but terrifying Voldemort/Draco. I like some rareSlytherin/Hermione pairings, but you're talking a near OC then, usually. I just like seeing Hermione paired with someone who finds her ambition and ruthlessness admirable.
