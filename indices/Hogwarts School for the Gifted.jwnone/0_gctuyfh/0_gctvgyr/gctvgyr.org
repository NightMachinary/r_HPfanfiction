I like to think Harry would be put on some athletics track, possibly encouraged by Oliver when he gets the Seeker spot. Though Harry playing the flute would be great too, I did consider the idea of him doing something musical but completely forgot about the flute in first year.

I def live the idea of eventual Chess Grandmaster Ron Weasley and Hermione being queen of Trivia.
