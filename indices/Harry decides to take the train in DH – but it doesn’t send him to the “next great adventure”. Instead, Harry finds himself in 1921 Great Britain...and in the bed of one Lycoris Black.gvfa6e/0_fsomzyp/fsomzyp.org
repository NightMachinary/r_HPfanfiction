/"I suppose a train ride to the afterlife isn't terribly inconvenient,"/ Harry thought with a snort. He'd half expected to simply step aboard and arrive in...wherever he was going to end up. Heaven, he hoped; He certainly didn't think he belonged in the other place."/But then, who does,"/ He mused, letting his eyes slowly close as the train rattled along.

Harry's eyes shot open as he surged upright in the bed. A voice next to him groaned in protest, one hand swatting drunkenly at his side of the bed.

"Haaaaaaaaaaaal," she whined. It was a she, Harry noted absently, though even as his eyes adjusted to the darkness of the room, he couldn't tell much more than that. A mass of dark hair lay at the head of the bed, and a form hidden beneath the fluffy duvet.

"A dream," he muttered, it had to be. He'd fallen asleep on the train and now--
