Sacrafices Arc by Lightning on Wave. In it the Malfoys see Harry's potential and they become allies/second family to him. And Harry is in Slytherin. It starts with Saving Conner. There are eight books all together. It really is just an amazing fanfic, but really different from the original books in some ways.
