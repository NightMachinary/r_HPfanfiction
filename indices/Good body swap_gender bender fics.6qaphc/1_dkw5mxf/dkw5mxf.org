They're short, and just the initial scenes to what feels like could be longer genderswap fics, but, "The Matron of Hogwarts" linkffn(11933058) ch. 8, "Trouble Through the Ages" linkffn(11372853) ch. 9.

Then, this Percy/Oliver fic, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/304901][A Learning Opportunity]] on AO3 wasn't half bad for a genderswap fic if you don't mind slash.
