I enjoyed Linkffn(I'm A What!), in which teen Severus Snape turns into Selena Prince and gets tutored by his/her grandmother on how to be a girl. It's up for adoption because random-fruitcake04 wanted to focus on her Ron-centric story Choices, but it's still a nice story.

I'd self-plug my Hermione-is-Salazar story but it doesn't read like a gender bender
