Try this one. Harry actually started a little book exchange in it of fictional books he liked, and often quotes his favorite books, like Wind In The Willows. It's a pretty wholesome story with a Harry that actually gets to be a kid.

The Best Revenge

AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
