I'm a seat of the pants writer. Usually I come up with the beginning idea and ending idea and then I sort of faff around until I come up with a middle and get the two ends to meet.

I find that coming up with the end resolution is key. It doesn't have to be super complicated--it can be a very simple concept, say, Harry and a Thestral yearling become best friends. Now you can brainstorm ideas about how that comes to be. What sort of obstacles are there to Harry befriending this young Thestral? How are those obstacles overcome and how do Harry and the Thestral change and grow in the course of the story? These are all things that go into the middle, meaty part of the story.

I'm working towards becoming less seat of the pants and doing at least a rudimentary outline with the broad strokes of the story I want to tell. I also try and note down goals that I want to achieve in each chapter. Sometimes those goals are met, sometimes they're not or some goals get moved to new chapters.

Also, make sure that you're honoring the plot of the story. Go over your writing with an eye to what moves the plot forward and what doesn't. Maybe try writing a one-shot with a strict word limit so you get used to the concept of moving things along. I have some one shots that are 10k words and some that are 2k, but they are each complete stories with a beginning, middle and end.
