Don't feel like you have to write "linearly". Write whatever idea you have at that moment and piece it together later. For /Second Best/ I've written my 4th year, then I wrote my 3rd year and now am playing around with year 1. Like you, I tried to start year 1 and only got around 20k words in. I found it helped a lot to just jump later on and just write whatever I felt would work, even if it was far in the future.

Editing will let you make it all line up and work out, don't feel like you need to write part 1 --> part 2 --> part 3. It's ok to start with part 3. It's already been said, but outlining helps a lot, and if you don't have a good outline it becomes ten times harder. Best of luck!
