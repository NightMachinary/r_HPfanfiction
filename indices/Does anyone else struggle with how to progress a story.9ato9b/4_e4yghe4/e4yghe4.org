Ask yourself, what would Harry do? Or any other character that has a stake in the story really. Something happened in that 10-20k words you got down, and people react to events, so put yourself in their shoes. What do they know or not know? Are they upset or emotional in some way? How would they respond? Then it's a set of dominoes. If that character acts, someone's going to be impacted and how will they react.

If it's the writing itself that's problematic, then relax and write something bad. It can be down right horrible, but as long as it moves forward in some way, either towards an idea or fleshing out a character, it's enough. Then look back at it and decide what made it bad. You now have a better clue about what to avoid and what is good. You can review your own work and prune until it's not even recognizable as that initial bad draft. Don't be afraid to throw out crappy parts or to rewrite a scene.
