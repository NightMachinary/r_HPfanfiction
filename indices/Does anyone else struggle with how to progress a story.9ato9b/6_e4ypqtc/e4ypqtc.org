Yeah I think that's a very common problem. I think a huge amount of story ideas start with a single scene or chapter (for HP it was the epilogue, for ASoIaF the scene where they find the Direwolves).

Coming up with a coherent plotline from that is IMHO quite hard. I think it's easier to start with an idea for a basic plot, but in my experience that's rarer (though some people work like that).
