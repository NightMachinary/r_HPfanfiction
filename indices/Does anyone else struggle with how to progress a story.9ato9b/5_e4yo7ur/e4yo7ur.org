I generally don't start a story (past the prompt/snippet) unless I have the ending in mind and a rough outline of how to get there. That gives a direction. But when I write, I tend to follow the "action-reaction" method - I let the characters act and react to the situation at hand and the actions of others. That often leads to some unplanned detours, but makes writing the next chapter easier.
