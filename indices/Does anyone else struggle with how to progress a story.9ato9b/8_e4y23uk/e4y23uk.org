No I do not have this problem! :) My advice is yes write out the whole story before you make it!!! :) :) I got my whole story written by chapter, with important plot stuff written out and smaller stuff listed too, so that I do always know what to write in every chapter and how it will all fit as a whole! :) The only thing that is crap is if I get newer ideas or something because then I have to rearrange plot events and stuff to make some stuff make sense with other stuff. :)
