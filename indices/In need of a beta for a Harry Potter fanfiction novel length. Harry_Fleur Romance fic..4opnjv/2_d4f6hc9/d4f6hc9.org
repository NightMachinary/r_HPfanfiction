Just a quick tip on grammar: have a space after the comma (and colons) "Summary:Harry" should be "Summary: Harry", "girls love him,but even" should be "girls love him, but even", "Harry,Harry/Fleur" should be "Harry, Harry/Fleur". Basic grammar errors like this are picked up by most writing programs (Word, Google docs etc) and so aren't really acceptable to expect a beta to correct. Think of it like this, if you don't correct basic spelling and grammar errors which Word highlights, why should a beta waste their time doing so? It shows a lack of basic care, it isn't that hard to read over what you have written and right click to change the errors.
