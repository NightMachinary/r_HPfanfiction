- Post on forums. (Which does not mean that you should from now on post every three days on this sub!)

- Don't stop writing because you haven't found one yet. Chapters can always be re-uploaded.

- Provide as much information as you can

- Do as much of the work as you can on your own. (Correcting Word correction on your own, for example)

- Be *very* patient
