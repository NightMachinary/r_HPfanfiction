The very first time I utilized the FFN filtering system, I felt an irrational shame over what I was about to filter on, feeling utterly mortified over the entire situation, as if someone was watching and would mock me for my tastes. This actually delayed my use of the filtering in favour of just piggybacking on [[/u/FanfictionBot][u/FanfictionBot]] recommendations for a week or two -- it felt as if using the search filters would mean acknowledging something shameful.

Over time I just stopped caring about hiding my fanfic preferences -- era, setting, ships, etc. To each their own and all that. Some will consider my tastes absurd and I'll do the same with them. So I don't really have any guilty pleasure anymore.

I still keep silent on the Discord though, mostly because I was mocked by several people there for my tastes the one time I mentioned them. I wasn't offended, but see no point in repeating a pointless talk about it.
