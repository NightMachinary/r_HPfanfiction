linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10972919/1/The-Evil-Overlord-List]]) where an OC 'Jerry' lives in Tom's head, and seems to know the HP universe and the canon plot line from a reader's pov (so basically he knows everything). Half the fic is a thought conversation between the two with the use of bold/italics to differentiate and it's really a self-insert fic. But for some reason, I still liked it
