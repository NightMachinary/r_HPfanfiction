An obvious example would be something like linkffn(Ad Infinitum by Speechwriter). Or any other fic I read with a Tom Riddle ship.

Also, fics with bad spelling or grammar because I honestly care more about characterization, adherence to canon world building, personal enjoyment, and story. I save being hyper critical of prose, including typos for published fiction. Or next gen fics where Albus Potter basically retreads his father's school years as hero who solves yearly mysteries and fights the big bad in the seventh book, sometimes making the same idiotic mistakes Harry did, especially if it's blatantly paralleling Harry's different experiences. Not all those Albus ones are bad as stories, but not likely as the post-epilogue future for the children to pretty much perfectly parallel the previous generation. But I still prefer those to essentially any retelling of Harry's generation in school these days.

Edited to Add: Stuff with tons of cliches, among other problems, if they center on a character I like. Like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7467796/1/Choices][this]].
