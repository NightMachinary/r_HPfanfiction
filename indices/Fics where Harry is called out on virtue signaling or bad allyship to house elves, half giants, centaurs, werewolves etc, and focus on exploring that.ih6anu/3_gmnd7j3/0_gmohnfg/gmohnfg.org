As a far-leftie I respectfully disagree. Bad allyship can be performative allyship, and Harry's allyship to either Dobby and his struggles, or to the centaurs or goblins is hardly ever written as something else than Harry getting brownie points after saying he is friends with non-humans while seldomly reaching out to them or seeing what he can do for them without directly needing something.

For that matter I urge you to Google 'preformative allyship' in order to inform yourself, in order to recognise it, and actively play your part.
