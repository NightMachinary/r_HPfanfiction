What pissed me off into writing this post to begin with was chapter 2 of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2374939/1/The-Dark-Witch-and-the-Necromancer-ENGLISH]]

Sure I suppose I ought to be reading the entire fic with a grain of salt, but it actually got me thinking: how many fics do I know that take this unintended trope that basically makes Harry a bad ally and actually explore it?
