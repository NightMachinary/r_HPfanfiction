Imho, the best completed dimensional travel story is *Stages of Hope*, linkffn(6892925)

*Para Bellum*, linkffn(9754483), is the sequel to *Delenda Est* and features some really great inter-dimensional actions. Unfortunately it's still WIP and has not been updated for a year. [[/spoiler][Highlights include Bellatrix's daughters pranking the Dursley's, Harry's meeting with Chief Unspeakable Hermione Granger-Weasley, Ambassador Sirius Black's talk with exonerated Sirius Black, and capture of Azkaban by Auror Captain Nymphodora Tonks and Special Undersecretary to the Minister Ron Weasley]]
