My favorite alt. universe fic has recently been updated after a long hiatus: linkffn(Stunning Shifts by mindcandy). It has a bigger cast of characters with some unexpected additions in the mix. The basic foundation of the plot is greatly explored and adds new elements to the over-used dimension-travel-trope. I really like where mindcandy is taking the fic. I highly recommend it.
