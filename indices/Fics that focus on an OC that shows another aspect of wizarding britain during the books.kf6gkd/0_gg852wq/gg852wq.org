What I would like to see is an OC student in Hogwarts during an ordinary time where the focus is on the magical education itself, not on the adventures they're having in the school.

In canon, we only know some of the spells the students are learning, and the subjects in the school and the grades they get in OWLS and NEWTS but I'm curious to know what the usual graduate of Hogwarts, who didn't have any interruptions in their education would be like.
