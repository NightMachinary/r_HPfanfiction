Some that come to mind, aside from the others mentioned in this thread, are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5731338/1/The-Raven-s-Anger][The Raven's Anger]] Harry becomes a mob boss in NYC, around 50k words but abandoned apparently.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1617442/1/Potter][Potter]] Pretty good story of harry growing up as heir to Mafia boss, 100k words, complete

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2138102/1/Blood-Prince][Blood Prince]]Another growing up mafia story, 75k words, complete and has a completed sequel

Although not exactly crime world related, these too still have harry committing crimes: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5199602/1/The-Thief-of-Hogwarts][The Thief of Hogwarts]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood][Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood]] more comical than anything else, but still a really enjoyable read.
