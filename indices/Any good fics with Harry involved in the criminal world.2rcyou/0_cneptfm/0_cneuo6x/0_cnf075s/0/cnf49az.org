Not surprising at all. Also, every time Joe gets brought up I whore this out, but I like to think someone new will see it and enjoy. His [[http://joeducie.net/the-reminiscent-exile/distant-star/][Reminiscent Exile series]] feels very much like a spiritual successor to the Wastelands Of Time. It incorporates the same epic style of prose and storytelling, and uses many of the same concepts first explored in Wastelands. While not a direct sequel or related in any sense of universe, a Wastelands fan will recognize many concepts and shoutouts to the fic and to the fanfic community.
