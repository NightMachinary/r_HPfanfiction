Huh, I didn't even notice the update in the WbA section. Granted, Joe is a professional author, so expecting him to actually finish his fics is kind of unrealistic, but it's nice that he's taking the time to throw out an update every now and then.

Also, as an aside-I enjoyed chapter 6 of What You Leave Behind. Looking forward to 7 and more Fleur.
