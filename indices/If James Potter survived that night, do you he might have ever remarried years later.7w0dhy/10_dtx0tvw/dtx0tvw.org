I think he probably would. Most people who are widowed young eventually date or remarry, and men tend to move on faster than women. I think he'd take his sweet time, but he strikes me as a family-oriented romantic; aside from being lonely he'd probably want Harry to have a mother (and maybe siblings). It would make sense for him to struggle with the fact that whoever he's seeing /just isn't Lily/, but I do really like the idea of him being able to eventually let her go (in contrast with Snape's 20+ year long obsession).

This is my favourite scenario for James/Sirius tbh. I'd like to try writing it but it's so hard to get past he thought of killing off Lily :(
