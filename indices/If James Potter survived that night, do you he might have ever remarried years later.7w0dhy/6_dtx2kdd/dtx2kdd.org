It's tough but I don't think he might have remarried atleast until he defeats Voldemort

One thing people underrate in James is his loyalty .. he was extremely loyal to his friends who were actually a neglected rag tag group filled with a disowned child, a werewolf and a boy with no confidence

He was ready to be an aimagus , he supported Sirius financially and he basically believed that wormtail might be a good keeper

If lily had died , James would have made it his mission to defeat Voldemort and his loyalty to lily might have deterred from getting romantic to anyone

Snape not moving on from lily borders on obsession but James might have done the same
