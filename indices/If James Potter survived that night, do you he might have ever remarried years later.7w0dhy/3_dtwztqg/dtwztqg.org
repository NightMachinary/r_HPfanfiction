I've been wrestling with an idea for a one-shot chracter study based on him surviving and Lily not. Quite a few fics with just Lily surviving have her celibate and completely devoted to Harry and defeating Voldemort. Id give the same thing to James, after about 20 years (he focuses on the recuperation after the war) there's nothing left for him.

He lost the only woman he ever loved, one of his friends betrayed him, the other died fighting, and the last after living most of his life in pain and self-sabotage finally found happiness only to die, leaving his son behind. With the war and his own son no longer as a distraction, James is forced to confront that he's lost nearly everything he holds dear. What he does from there (co-parent Teddy with Andromeda or try to heal and move on from Lily) im not sure.
