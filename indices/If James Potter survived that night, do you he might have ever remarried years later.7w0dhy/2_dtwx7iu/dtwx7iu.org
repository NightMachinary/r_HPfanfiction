It depends on if you're viewing this through our real world lens or Rowling's universe lens.

If James was real, he'd remarry. It's quite common for widowers to eventually remarry, especially if they are that young.

But in the wizarding world, it doesn't seem so common. First, Rowling's pairings tend to be that true love, soul mate type. There are lots of long-term relationships that started at a young age. Not every relationship, but a majority I'd argue. And for those who lost their partner, you really don't see many examples of them remarrying. I think Blaise's mother has several husbands, but it seems clear she was never marrying for love.

So within her universe, while I wouldn't say James absolutely would never marry, it would be unsurprising if he never did.
