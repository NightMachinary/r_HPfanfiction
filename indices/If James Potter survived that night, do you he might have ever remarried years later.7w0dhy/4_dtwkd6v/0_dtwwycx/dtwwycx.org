I think that's a bit too unrealistic -- remember that she's only five years than Harry. With Remus it's a little different bc he didn't have any children himself, but with James it's likely that he'd be unable to separate her from the girl that likely had playdates with Harry or hung around the other children whenever he visited family friends

or on second thought that might just make for a entertaining sappy romance lol
