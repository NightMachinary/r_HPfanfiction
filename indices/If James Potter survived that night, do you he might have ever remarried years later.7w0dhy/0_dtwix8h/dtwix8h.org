I don't know who, but I think it's a very legitimate prospect. If James survives, he's just 20 years old. Consider this - the average wizard lives to be over a 100 years old, and some as long as 300 years old. James has more than 10 decades left in his life, why should he remain celibate? He can remarry and still love Lily.

With his survival comes a serious amount of fame. With that fame comes people who are more interested in James's fame than James himself. So I imagine if he remarries, it's someone that he would have known for a long time.
