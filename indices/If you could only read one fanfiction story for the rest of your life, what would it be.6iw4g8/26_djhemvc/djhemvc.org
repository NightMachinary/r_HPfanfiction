The Code series by Aduro on ffn.

Starts with linkffn(2750775) The Code, followed by: The Code Breaker linkffn(2989922), The Decoding linkffn(3648321), ending with The End Code linkffn(11603390).

I've been following the story since she started writing it around 2006 and have reread this series (up to wherever it was completed at that point) probably 8 times since then. The author abandoned it during The Decoding but in a fanfiction miracle actually came back after several years and finished that story. Unfortunately, it seems like she has again abandoned the final story in the series (as of last Oct) but I've still got my fingers crossed that she'll complete it.
