"Browncoat, Green Eyes". Not many fanatics have me wanting to reread them. I liked "Whiskey Time Travel" a lot but that's not been updated. There was also this one with a drunk Harry being found by Malfoy and it's a great funny story about trying to get Harry sober, and the interactions or wonderful.
