Hmmmm. Assuming this is the only fanfic I can read, and not the only literature I can read linkffn(7406866)

If it is the only literature I can ever read, I would probably give up now and find a new hobby.

If it has to be a Harry Potter fanfic, assuming it ever gets finished, Meaning of One. Not the best fanfic ever, but I read it during my worst point of depression and it really meant something to me then.
