Anyone still regularly talking about the fanfic several years after it's finished is going to be a very hardcore fan, as a general rule. [[/r/rational]] is where the people who like HPMOR-like fanfics, but aren't massively fanboying over that particular story, hang out.

I'd also recommend finishing the story before checking out the subreddits, since they don't always properly tag spoilers.
