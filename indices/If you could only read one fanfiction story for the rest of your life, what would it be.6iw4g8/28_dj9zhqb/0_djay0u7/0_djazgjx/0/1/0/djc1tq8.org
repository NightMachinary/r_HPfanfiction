Actually, I still haven't finished it. I chose it because the premise is absurd and mostly fun, and it's a fic where you really only want to read a chapter or two at a time. If you have only one fic to read for the rest of your life I wouldn't want it to be a fic that I get through in a week or even a month. If the question was 'pick the best fic you've ever read.' The answer would be very different.
