For what it's worth, I will tell you this: the fic is decent, which means it's better than most of the crud, but it could have been good if not great (check out some of Yudkowsky's other works, he does have the ability to write good stuff) and the only reason it didn't happen was because of the author's arrogance.

I see downvoting any mention of the story just because it happened to be very petty, but I cannot bring myself to say the same about cases where someone downvotes a mention that the story “pokes fun at the absurdity of the HP universe” or anything of that ilk because the way in which Yudkowsky did /that/ is ... frankly, to some degree nauseating, and feels like him saying “see Rowling, I am a better writer than you” which is just ... ugh.
