One of the most enjoyable aspects aspect of the Stygian trilogy is the same heist type planning that went into the robbing of Gringotts, with the planning included. Though you will have to read through Ignite to get to Starfall where they start doing those sorts of missions. It's a great series and absolutetly worth it.
