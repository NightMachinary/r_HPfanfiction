Unfortunately I don't have time to be a beta-reader right now with finals coming up, but here are some tips that might help:

- keep your sentences on the shorter side. If grammar isn't your strong suit, then try to avoid situations where the grammar might get tricky.

- keep your paragraphs on the shorter side. Keeping things straightforward is a great way to keep your writing legible if your grammar's not great.

- check to make sure your pronouns match (mismatching pronouns will very quickly make your writing extremely confusing)

- read a lot of professional writing, ie newspaper or magazine articles (and by that I mean the NYT and the Atlantic, where the writing standard is high). This will give you a better feel for what good grammar looks like, which will help you when you're editing.
