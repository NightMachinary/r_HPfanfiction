Someone writing a story in which Death Eaters win and kill their enemies doesn't mean this is what the author wants to happen in real life at all. Even if your main character is a murdering psycopath, that doesn't make you one (and it doesn't mean you write that stuff because you'd like to do it). Sometimes it's just an interesting exercise to write a story from the villains' point of view.

Although I agree that some fics that go for this go to extra lengths to bash the canonically "good" characters, when it's not really necessary. In occasions it feels like they try to justify their MC's actions by making the others unreasonably petty and over-explaining their side's motivations too much.

Maybe that's what you meant with the post? Because I agree it happens in fanfiction often, and in some stories it seems unnecessary. I'm more partial of just letting your MC be selfish and evil and go after the "good" guys for his own reasons.
