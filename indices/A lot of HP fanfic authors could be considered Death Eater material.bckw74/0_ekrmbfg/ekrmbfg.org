The definition of a Death Eater is a thug who uses magic to push an ideology eerily similar to the one of Adolf Hitler, just replacing the Jews with Muggleborn, doing so in the service of their leader Voldemort . Whether they are closer to the Sturmabteilung or the Waffen-SS is debatable, but the parallels are clearly there.

Now, I get the point you are trying to make, but calling a lot of authors material for a fascist street fighting gang is bad taste IMO. Especially since some of the points you raise are stupid. No sane person would fight a war without lethal force. To paraphrase Patton, the objective of a war is not to die for one's country but to make the other guy die for his. I mean, who'd be stupid enough to put themselves into more danger to save the lives of the people who are running concentration camps for a racial minority and have death Squads roam the countryside?
