I see looking at all the universally agreed upon examples that the word applies to and contrasting them with those who are not agreed to be within the confines of the group to be the best way. It ensures that we get everything within the group while not getting anything that isn't. Such as creating a definition of "Human" that accidentally encompasses sheep or excludes humans with disabilities.

I think part of the issue is that we just don't know what death eaters were really going for. We know about the death of mudbloods and blood traitors, but we don't know the motivation for such things. The analogies to Nazis were blatant. It's part of why Umbridge was a more compelling villain than Voldemort. At least her attacks were personal and explained to a degree.
