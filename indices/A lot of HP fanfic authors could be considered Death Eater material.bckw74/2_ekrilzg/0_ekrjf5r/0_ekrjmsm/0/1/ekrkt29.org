idk maybe it's because i ship a lot of slytherin/gryffindor pairings and have been bashed for it a lot that i've got this perspective. i also prefer fanon over canon since, as a slytherin, canon isn't too flattering of my house. i see people hate on snape so fucking much and he reminds me so much of myself that it feels like a personal attack.
