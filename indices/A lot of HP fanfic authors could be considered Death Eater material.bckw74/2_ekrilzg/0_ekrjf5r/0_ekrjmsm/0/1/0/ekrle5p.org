I understand that, I'm a ravenclaw and Canon doesn't portray us all that well either, and fanon even less so with the whole "hazing" business. But Snape is not a good person, almost every choice he made in his life were objectively wrong. He bullies his student and hurt house unity more than dumbledore has. Has he done some good things, yes, but that does not make him a good person.
