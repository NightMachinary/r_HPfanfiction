Oi, I resent that bit about Lavender. Romilda the rapist is one thing, and she can rot in prison for all I care, but Lavender bravely fought and most likely died in the Battle of Hogwarts. She shed blood, swear and tears to end Voldemort's tyranny. Which, in my book, puts her above any Slytherin character who is not just a name.

So she was an overbearing girlfriend. Yet she also repeatedly got the shitty end of the stick, be it that her pet was killed or Ron spun her along despite not wanting the kind of relationship she was aiming for. People like to bash Lavender far more than she deserves for being overbearing.
