  Bill Weasley nearly ruined Adi's life--until the fearsome Potions Master changed it.In 1990, Cho Chang's older cousin Adeline is not the only witch at Hogwarts to fall for the dashing, loaded Gringotts cowboy--with dire consequences. Now she must fight out of a fugue state to salvage her once-promising academic career with an unlikely ally in Professor Snape.Upon graduation Adi accepts a risky position on the International Task Force stationed in China, which has been plagued for centuries by both Muggle and Wizard political strife. A meteoric rise in diplomacy finally brings her back to Hogwarts in 1996 to visit as the newly-appointed British Ambassador to the United Chinese Nations (U.C.N.)There she finds a Severus Snape burdened by a Darkness both terrifying and alluring, and the charged, clandestine attraction between them is at last realized against an international backdrop of the Second Wizarding War. Though it may mean risking her very life, Adeline races to find a way to save the man who once was the only person who cared enough to save her.
