Soooo, I'm going to plug my current work, which will feature the exploration of other cultures. It will feature heavily, but it's not the main focus. I already have most of the stuff I want outlined, but it's still only 2 chapters of published work.

Also, I'd love to get some feedback on it, either here or on ffn.
