Feature request: can we get more methods of execution than the stone spike? (unless you consider it as Harry's signature and it's for plot reasons).

Also, random question (spoilers): Daphne never did tell Harry about the money her family already had when Harry gave to Astoria, did she? It's kind of a moot point with her parents dead, but it does showcase her to be a bit of a selfish bitch. I think I'm firmly in the Susan boat after the latest chapters.
