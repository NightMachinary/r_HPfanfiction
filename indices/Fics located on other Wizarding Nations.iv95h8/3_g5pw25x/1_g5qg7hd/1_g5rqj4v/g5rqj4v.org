Okay! Thanks for reading, first off :) It's been awesome hearing from people on this sub that read my story (most of the feedback i hear comes from discord).

Regarding your questions: the >stone spike was Harry's first 'killshot', so I've had him default to it as a simple, quick way to kill. As we saw with Rosier, when he wants to make someone suffer, he is more than capable. It's just a matter if him being angry enough...<

Daphne: >she never knew exactly what her dad did to gain the money. She really only knows what Lucas told her - vague generalities, and what he said when Sam had them captive. I tried to show, whe she visited Tori in the hospital after First Year, how she was afraid that Harry would not believe she was innocent in taking his money, and was too ashamed to bring it up <

Hope that answers your questions!
