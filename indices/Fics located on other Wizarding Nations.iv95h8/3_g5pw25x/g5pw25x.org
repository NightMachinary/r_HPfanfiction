Glad you liked all the traveling in ASAoV! I felt like it was a bit of a risk, but I really enjoyed writing my version of MACUSA.

As for other fics, I think that Bungle in the Jungle stands out as another "travelogue" (Harry goes to.. like, 4 continents in that one). Rise of the Wizards kind of has some international flavor, but it's pretty sparse. And of course, there's an excellent (and long!) oneshot set in Egypt with cursebreaker!Harry, called Valley of the Kings Massacre, i believe.

Happy reading!
