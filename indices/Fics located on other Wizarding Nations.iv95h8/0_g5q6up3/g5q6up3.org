Make a Wish is kind of the classic Globetrotting Harry recommendation. He goes the full circumnavigation.

There's also the second of the Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider series. Petunia is Lara Croft, basically, and she raises Harry on dig sites. The first series is mostly him at Hogwarts with bits of her around the world, but the second has Harry himself Globetrotting. I do think you kinda need to read the first for the second to make sense though. Link below is to the first one.
