and so harry had a basilisk fang stuck through his forehead for the rest of his days...

The Unspeakables say Snape died due to Legimencing Harry and his Sould touching leftover basilisk venom. Dumbledore never quite trusted Harry anymore, as he didn't dare read Harrys mind after that... Voldemort made eye contact and Legimenced Harry like he clearly did to any who met his eyes (the paranoid bastard) and his spectre got dissolved too... the Horcruxes are found hundreds of years afterwards by some historians now they rest in the Lovegood vaults.

Harry himself liked the new forehead bling he had, at least people stared at his forehead due to something he actually did!...
