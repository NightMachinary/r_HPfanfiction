In linkffn(Heart and Soul by Sillimaure), some professors conduct a ritual to sever the connection between horcrux and the main soul, effectively destroying the horcrux in Harry.

There's another Lunar Harmony fic (I don't remember the name) where they put Harry's head through the Veil of Death to remove the horcrux.
