I personally liked a couple of the "Harry gets the Dementor's Kiss" aftermaths. Partially-Kissed Hero is a solid crack in the first few chapters (though it admittedly falls hard later on), and The Merging has some of the best power with a price trope usage I've read.

Kinda wanna see if there's anyone else who can do it justice.
