I don't remember the title, but it was a soulbond Harry/Ginny fic and the author apparently died, leaving the fic at roughly 200k (1 or 2 chapters after the painful remote sex).

IIRC Harry sent himself a note from the future which told him to get in touch with Ginny earlier. They became Phoenix Animagi too, if I'm not mixing things up.
