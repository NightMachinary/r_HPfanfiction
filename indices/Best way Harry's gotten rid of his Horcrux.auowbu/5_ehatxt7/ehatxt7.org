Ignoring the quality of the fic overall, I liked what happened to the horcrux in Partially Kissed Hero by Perfect Lionheart.

In his third year when Harry has those close encounters with Dementors, he nearly has his soul sucked out. That destabilizes his soul and the horcrux enough that there's an internal battle for control which he wins, leading to Harry's soul assimilating the horcrux.

I like it because I'm a fan of powerful Harry and it seems to be one of the most canon-compliant ways of giving Harry a boost. I feel like it makes sense that a soul fragment accidentally attached to a person can't just happily sit there forever. Dementors having a weird effect on the horcrux seems completely reasonable to me.

Also, I think it works perfectly with the self-fulfilling prophecy theme that was going on. The Dark Lord will mark him as his equal.

Personally, I'd probably prefer for it to happen when Umbridge sends the Dementors after him. Or in a non-canon event. Just so that Harry is a bit older.
