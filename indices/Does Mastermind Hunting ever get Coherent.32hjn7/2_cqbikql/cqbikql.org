Yeah no it's really doesn't. But honestly, even the bad stories are worth reading to a certain extent. As a whole, most (probably 80%+) of the recommended stories just aren't good as a whole, but almost every single one has their own little Crowning Moment of Awesome that makes you go "holy shit this is so fucking cool!" Mastermind definitely ends on a sour note, but then so does Unsung Hero, and that's highly recommended too. My philosophy is "just read it". Except for pure smut, I will even "just read" those mpreg snarry and drarry fics I love to hate. Can't stand them as a whole, because of the rampant ignoring of all the nasty shit they did, and they're generally never written well, but I still have read a lot of them because there are often scenes that are interesting or inspiring (as a writer) to me.
