No I think it's perfectly fair to a certain extent. You wouldn't expect someone to reccomend a non-self-aware My Immortal here on the sub because we know to filter out such garbage. On the other hand we have widely varying taste and we often disagree on recs between ourselves so a recipient of the recs should also understand that not only is there a chance they may not like a recommendation, they may vehemently despise it. I think it's most fair to say we won't recommend a story with major technical issues but as far as plot and pacing anything goes.
