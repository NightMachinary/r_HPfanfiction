I think not, because in canon it was shown that Petunia was jealous of Lilly's ability to do magic and she even sent a letter to professor Dumbledore asking if she could also get admission in Hogwarts. So if Dudley was a wizard, outwardly she would show that she was upset but inwardly she will be secretly pleased that she had a small amount of magic inside her like Lilly, as she was able to pass on her magic to Dudley.
