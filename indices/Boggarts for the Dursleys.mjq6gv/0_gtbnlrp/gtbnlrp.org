I think I can say what Petunia's boggart will be. In canon, she is very self conscious, takes into account what other people think of her and hates anything extraordinary or weird outside of her world views. She has her own ideas and views on how a married women should live or behave. . . . And this will be her boggart, seeing herself as a whore who cheats on her husband behind his back for money so she could buy herself drugs. Being a bitch to her sweet little Duddykins. Being un-heigienic and worst of all, all of the society knows of her behaviour.
