I agree, it's hard to remember what is Canon and what isn't anymore. I actually keep on my writing desk a Harry Potter encyclopedia just so I can look stuff up and check what is Canon and what is fanon now.

I put on my plot outline that even after so long of being away from the Dursleys, Harry's boggart is still going to be Vernon in a specific non Canon situation from my fic.

This situation is already in the published story if you want to read it.

Part of that arc is going to involve Harry forcing them to see their own boggarts to get over his fear. Maybe making their fears be perfectly mundane would help him or maybe making them see him as a monster will help, I haven't decided yet.
