So if Harry is out of the picture for the potential greatest fear then I think these ones are quite possible (not that like I actually remember what is canon anymore but whatever):

VERNON:

• Dudley being a wizard (I agree with the opinion of IamPotterhead that Petunia wouldn't really mind but Vernon wouldn't be able to live with such a fact when all he believes in are “normal” things).

• A family where Harry is loved by Petunia and Dudley.

• Dudley's death.

PETUNIA:

• A younger version of Lily telling her how pathetic she is for not being a wizard.

• Receiving a letter from Dumbledore that she can't attend Hogwarts.

• Her parents telling Lily how great she is for being a wizard.

• Dudley's death.

DUDLEY:

• Being ignored or treated like Harry in any way.

• Not being the best one (Imagine a situation where he wouldn't be a gang leader but the one being bullied for his weight or stupidity for example).

• Ending up as a pig (The tail alone was quite a shock so a whole transformation into a pig would be quite a horror for him).

• Dementor (But I have no idea when the scene happens in your story so it's last).
