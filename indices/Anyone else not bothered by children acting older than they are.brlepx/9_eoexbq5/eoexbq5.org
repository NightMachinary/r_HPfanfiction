If I had the time to write a fic, I would have everyone be more enamored of magic. While I agree serious 11 year olds exist (I used to be such a child myself), the political games makes no sense that early.

I do think cliques as well as basic cronyism should exist. And magical society comes across as conservative, so look at how upper class children were educated before the industrial revolution.
