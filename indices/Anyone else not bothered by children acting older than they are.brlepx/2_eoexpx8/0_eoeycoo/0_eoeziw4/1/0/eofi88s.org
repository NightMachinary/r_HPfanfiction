While I agree with movies (who also didn't show her worst moments, like when Lavender's rabbit died), Fanon made it even worse with perfect Hermione that is the only reason Ron (and sometimes Harry) are able the pass their class, making them effectively as dumb as Crabbe and Goyle. Not to mention any plan used by Harry to fight Death Eater were inspired by her, while using spells she invented. And did I mention how more advanced the Muggle World is and how Wizards should take example of them.
