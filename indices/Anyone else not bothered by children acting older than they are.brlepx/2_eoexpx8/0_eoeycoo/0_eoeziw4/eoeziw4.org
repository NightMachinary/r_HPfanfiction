Well, bashing aside (Looking at Ron), most character are a step down from fanon characterization, from Mary Sue Hermione to Leather Pant Draco or Lord/ God Like Harry.

But she doesn't have to be a Crabbe or Goyle. It's just that, since there is the notion of "gang" and not just friendship (like Malfoy and Zabini, who seem equals), Pansy is a "leader" and must have something that put her at least a little over the others. It could be a big difference (Malfoy Vs Crabbe and Goyle for example), but also something not big. Just being a little more pretty, or popular, having a little richer family may be enough. I would think that Blood Purity could also work, but since both character seem to come from "Sacred 28", they could be both "very pure".
