It bothers me because while I can accept children being slightly more mature than their age (because writing a child is hard; and can make a very annoying character), 11 years old Occlumency trained, master politicians children is one of my pet peeves.

It make different character than canon (so different we are almost at an AU level), and almost justify Blood Purism (if Pure Blood Slytherin children are politicians behind closed doors while children of other houses are children, Pure Blood ARE superior).\\
I also don't really like the plot that are born from it (I remember reading that a character can only be as much intelligent than it's author, and since most of the authors are not politicians, their "plot" often feel . . . empty, rail guided).

PS : a character often victim of this is Daphne Greengrass, master politician who stay out of the Blood purist in Slytherin House. But even if I do like the character (who gives a nice alternative to Pansy if you want to have a Slytherin romance), the only thing we know about her, apart her name (and since it's not in books but from Rowling, this much is already discussable), is that she was member of Pansy gang, member, not leader. So she is probably a character comparable to Pansy, only less powerfull, intelligent, ruthless, rich and/or connected.
