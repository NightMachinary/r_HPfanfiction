It doesn't bother me on a couple of conditions :

- The writing is at least somewhat decent\\
- It isn't in enormous contrast compared to certain others (Ron..), and the adults are certainly not made hilariously stupid\\
- They are at least 13-14 years old. On this age, it's not impossible.

To write children well is a really difficult thing to do, honestly. It's why I generally avoid fics with first of second year included.
