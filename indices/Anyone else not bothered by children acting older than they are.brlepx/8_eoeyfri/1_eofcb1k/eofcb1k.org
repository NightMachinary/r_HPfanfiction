  12 year olds having meaningful political power? Nah, get over yourself

There is that thing called monarchy. Alexander the Great was 20 when he ascended to the throne. Charles XII even just 15 (without a regency). You will find plenty of examples of young monarchs who wielded a lot of power. By the time he turned 18, Charles had already defeated Norway and would crush a massively superior Russian Army at Narva before the year was over.

That is not to say that I like Slytherin politics, but teenagers leading even entire nations is not unprecedented. And most pureblood politics assume a system based on nobility.
