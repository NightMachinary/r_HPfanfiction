Th√© only time this bothers me is when the eleven year olds are so adult-like that they are /better/ at politic-ing than all of the actual adults. If you want smart children, I'm absolutely fine with it. Just make the adults even smarter. Smart children should become even smarter adults. It's sort of like a power boost across the board.

Being non-canon compliant /never/ bothers me by itself, so there is that. I read HP fanfics more for the magic and plot than anything else, so you could completely rework the magical society and I wouldn't mind.
