If I can suspend my disbelief about magic, accepting child Machiavellis isn't a stretch. It's fun, as long as it's done well. It's annoying only when the adults are fools by comparison.

The only thing I can't stand is when these little kids fall in love. Kids that age get crushes, not eternal love.
