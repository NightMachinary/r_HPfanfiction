It doesn't bother me per se but it's a problem because it leaves little room for realistic character growth over the years. That was the big problem for me with linkffn(My Brother!), where there was no difference between the way characters thought and acted in first and fourth year.

EDIT: The bot's got the wrong one but I can't find the right one either. Maybe it's not there any more.
