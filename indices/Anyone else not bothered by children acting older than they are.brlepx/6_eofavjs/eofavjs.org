It usually doesn't bother me. I find reading the political machinations we didn't see in the books to be fun as long as they are sensible. It bothers me some if children straight-up act like adults (and not just when romance gets involved), but a few years too mature is fine. Besides, child protagonists usually have to act mature for their age in order to be readable, just as when you're writing, you delete most of the um's and ah's.

On the other hand, I /hate/ it when characters act /younger/ than their age. Whether it's Harry crying unnecessarily, Ron acting like more of a childish, petulant berk than in canon, or Hermione failing to break out of her naivety in the face of hard evidence, it's likely to make me nope out of a fic a lot faster than if they act older, so I definitely err on the side of older.
