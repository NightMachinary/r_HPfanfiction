I don't necessarily mind it, /or/ the political stories. Given that these are not muggle children so I can headcanon their abilities as being derived from a charm or potion, an interpretation of accidental magic, or simply putting all of their points to that one 'stat'. Result = kids who are great at, say, politicking, etiquette and strategy, but absolutely hopeless at some kind of other basic task that we just never see bc its not story-relevant.

Especially given that even in muggles, child prodigies who've minmaxed their skills in one area at the detriment of another /do/ exist, just from having had their education keenly focused down one particular path from very young childhood. In a world where human modification is magically possible, why would you /not/ make every child a prodigy, if only to be able to fit in with the others? But that's getting into my headcanon of pureblood society as necessarily transhumanist, viewing muggles and muggleborns as people unhealthily and limitingly attached to default human limitations.
