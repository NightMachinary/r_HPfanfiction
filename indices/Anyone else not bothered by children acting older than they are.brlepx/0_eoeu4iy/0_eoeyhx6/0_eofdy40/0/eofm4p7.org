Sure. I just have always wondered if purebloods, not /had a point/ per se, but if they did just have a very different culture that none of our protagonists picked up on - Harry because he wouldn't think of it, Hermione because if society is pureblood-dominated as it seems to be, it might not be in any of the school books if its an established social norm, just like bathing or eating with a knife and fork might be in a muggle book, and Ron - or possibly all the Weasleys - because they'd assume Muggles had a similar version.

Compare that it takes them seven books/years to realise the wizarding fairy tales Ron grew up with aren't universal.

In this reading, Harry and Hermione's assumption that judging people based on blood is simple prejudice rather than a cultural conflict becomes flawed and adds depth to the conflict, while still being fairly canon compatible and not excusing the villains' actions when they cross over into violence and sadism.

It would be interesting to read postwar fics of Harry and Hermione only coming to realise these things and gain a greater appreciation of the politics behind the conflict in peacetime.
