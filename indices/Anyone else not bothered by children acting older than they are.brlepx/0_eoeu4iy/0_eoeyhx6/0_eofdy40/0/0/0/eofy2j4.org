Just the fact that there doesn't seem to be much to any crossover influence from muggle to wizarding culture, even among the wizarding family we see most of, who are outright muggle 'lovers'. Muggles are kind of looked down upon and infantilized, either in a mean way or endearingly, depending on the individual in question's politics. Muggle studies is seen as a joke topic. Etc.

Even if wizarding society as a whole wasn't pureblood dominated there definitely is a core of pureblood-exclusive subculture that provides most of our villain characters and no small number of our heroes either - the Lovegoods and Weasleys are pretty ignorant of muggle things even if they're not also intolerant to their presence.
