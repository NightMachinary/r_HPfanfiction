I agree. I'm pretty peeved when people get the time period wrong.

The statute came out the time of King William 3rd after the monarchy was deposed by Cromwell and people invited king William back as a Monarch. I still think that over throwing the Stuart Monarchy is he cause of the splitting. Cromwell's victories at home and abroad helped to enlarge and sustain a Puritan attitude of mind, both in Great Britain and in North America.

Assuming that what ever oaths magical had to their reigning monarchy was broken when the successions was broken, the Magical now had a right to Barter a Treaty with King William who at the time is busy with multiple wars but eventually won the "glorious revolution" a war won "without bloodshed" two years after, Statue of Secrecy was in operation. So I think he two years was preparation for the separation.

King William was succeeded by Queen Anne who was the last of the Stuarts who decided to unite the crown of Scotland and England which became great Britain.

Queen Victoria is from the line of Sophia of Hanover. Victorian Era came after 61 years after King George lost America. America is Older.

WIZARDS DIDN'T SPLIT OFF FROM VICTORIAN ERA. VICTORIAN ERA is fucking INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. You'd think Wizards will know more about machines if that were the case.

To put things to a perspective..

Queen Elizabeth never married during her lifetime. However, there was "ample" evidence suggesting that Lucius Malfoy the first sought her hand in marriage, but was rebuffed by her. She's the Last of the Tudor Dynasty followed by House of Stuarts. Her Father was the one who Ordered the Beheading of Nearly headless Nick for the backfired curse for a Lady in his court. Not for being a wizard, it was for his failure. Which is believable since king Henry beheaded his wife for failing to give him a son.
