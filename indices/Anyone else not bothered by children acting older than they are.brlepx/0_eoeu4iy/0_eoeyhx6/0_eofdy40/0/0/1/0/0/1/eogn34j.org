1) Gas lamp and no electricity : I won't say electricity doesn't work around Magic (because canon only say that for Hogwarts that may be a special case), but you seem to forget this is a Magic world. They use Gas lamp because magic deal with most of the problems who forced us (and Muggles) to inovate. If you have a gas lamp that still work after 200 years, that is magically refiled and you can easily clean the house, why bother to change it? Some parts of Hogwarts (as the Great Hall) still use candles, but if it works, why change it?

2) Victorian Architecture : Where did you get that? From what we say, wizards just do what they want when it comes to their house. The Black House and Malfoy Manor may seem Victorian, but I'm pretty sure neither the Rook or the Burrow are of this style. Neither are Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade.

3) Robes and riding boots : well, this is their fashion. Are you saying that because they don't wear pants, they are stuck in the past? Because if this is the case, some countries from Middle East and Asia may want to have a word with you. Also, magic, it's easier to sell leather boots when you can duplicate the leather of one beast hundred of times.

4) Kicked of family because of blood purity : Are you talking about Andromeda ? Because the Black family is probably not the best example to judge the mentality of a whole community. That's like taking a KKK family to judge all the US.

As for racial slurs, who use them? The rare times slurs like this are mentioned, they are either used during a private conversation (like Draco and Blaise in the Hogwarts Express), or in situation without any teachers (on the Quidditch pitch). From what I remember, the only time Draco truly use it in public, teacher arrive just after and are a little more preocupied by the seemingly dead cat and angry Rusard. Also, according to Rowling (and on Pottermore), most of the teacher of Hogwarts seem to be Half Blood.
