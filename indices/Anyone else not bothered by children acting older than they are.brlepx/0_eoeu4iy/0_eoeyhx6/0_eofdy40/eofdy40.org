That is a very interesting point of view. It could also be tied into the 'hereditary family magics' fanon. Bloodlines would become better and better at certain things, far exceeding muggleborn or diluted halfbloods practicing the same thing. You want some fiendishly-difficult-to-produce Felix Felicis? You can either call up a muggleborn master potioneer, who'll take two or three attempts to make a perfect batch or you can call up scion X of the Y family, who can churn one out in an afternoon while hungover.

Difficult points with this theory are the existence of monstrously powerful halfblood wizards, such as Dumbledore and Voldemort who outclass everyone else at a wide variety of subjects. An explanation for this could be old bloodlines mixing with 'new' muggleborn magic, or simply the fact that they are a rare breed of hyper-competent generalists who can practice a wide variety of magic up to a high level (but still falling short of very old bloodlines in their speciality).
