Sure, but any non-canon fic is necessarily the new author's choice and interpretation, resulting in deviations from JK Rowling's setting, events, reactions or endgame, etc. So while some fics may be deliberately and consiciously AU as a subgenre, /all/ fics written by other authors in a universe with the same bones, but subtle differences to JK's text, are also I would contend alternate universes. If they aren't, then what are they? They aren't canon, they can't be, by definition.
