I don't like this simply because it's not canon, even if it can be hand-waved by saying "magic hurr durr". In canon the eleven-year-old still act like eleven-year-old, and it seems logical because magic doesn't seem to remove humanity in canon (excepts for extremely fucked-up dark wizards like Voldy), so I'm not convinced by your story of engineered 11yo trained in politics with RPG stats, especially when some of them are muggle raised and thus have zero excuses not to be just childs (Harry for exemple).

To be fair, if a character don't act like he would in canon without a compelling reason to do so, like a change in their backstory for exemple, I'm probably going to quit, children or not.
