Yeah Ron in deathly hallows did the magical equivalent of storming out of the room. He went off to cool down for a bit and would have returned but got unlucky, was attacked and injured and was late getting back. (They really should have had a fall back plan, a place to meet or a way of contacting each other if they got separated.) And anyone who made it through high school without spending a few weeks pissed off at a friend for something that in hindsight was remarkably stupid had a markedly different high school experience than me.
