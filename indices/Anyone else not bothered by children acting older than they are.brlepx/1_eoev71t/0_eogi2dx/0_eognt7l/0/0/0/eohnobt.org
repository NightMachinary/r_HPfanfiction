His problem is that he is disliked/ hated by several groups of fan for differents reasons :

- "Harmony" fan hate him because he dare to be with Hermione and not Harry (a ship I never really understood considering Ron and Hermione start to show feeling for each other during year 4 while Harry and Hermione never showed anything other friendship/ almost brotherhood. Hell even during year 6 when Harry is convinced they will finally be together, he is only afraid to become the 3rd wheel.
- Movie fan : Realisators loved Hermione and made her a Mary Sue, taking elements from others character to do so, including Ron "Pureblood Knowledge".
- Also (for films), Tom Felton. They want a whitewashed Draco and since Ron hate Draco, he has to be bad to hate this beautiful leather pant guy.

Finally (and that may be only a personal opinion), Ron failling are not glossed other (especially in movies) compared to the other ones. Some people say Ron is a arse because he ruined Hermione Yull Ball, yet completely ignore Hermione inacceptable comportment during year 3 (/"Your rat, that you love, dissapeared and there is only traces of bloods in your bed, and you think it is my cat, that had already tried to attack him several times? Don't be riddiculous, Crookshank would never do that."/, plus most of her reactions to Divination and with the Firebolt). These same people will also be quick to notice Ron "betrayed" Harry 2 times in year 4 and 7, but will ignore that both time, Harry also said hurtfull things to him (in DH, they were under Horcruxe influence, but Harry told Ron to leave).
