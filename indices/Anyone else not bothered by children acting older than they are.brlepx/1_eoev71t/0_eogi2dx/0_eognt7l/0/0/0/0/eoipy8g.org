I like to mention on these occasions that the worst thing Hermione ever did was, in fact, abducting a reporter because said reporter wrote some stuff in a tabloid. It's quite amusing how completely unrepentant she is about something that should, by all rights, land her in prison. She doesn't, of course. Because it's 'funny'.
