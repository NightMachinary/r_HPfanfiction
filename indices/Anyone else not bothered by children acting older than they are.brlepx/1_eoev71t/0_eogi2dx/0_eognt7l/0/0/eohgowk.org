That's an interesting point, and -- to a degree -- I think I'd have to agree. On the flip side, many characters are supercharged with tropes and stereotypes, many of which have little to no grounding in canon. Now, I'm no canon fanatic. I like Rowling's world, but I couldn't care less about some obscure essay or twitter post of her about XYZ. But it annoys me that characters that are, effectively, tabula rasas have so many weird tropes associated with them. Luna isn't omniscient or a genius. Daphne isn't some cold-blooded princess. And, yes, Ron isn't a coward. In a way, I think he's the most innocent of Rowling's main cast. Is he perfect? No. That doesn't make him an arse.

Anyway, long story short, most characters are OC by definition as soon as you start writing fanfiction.
