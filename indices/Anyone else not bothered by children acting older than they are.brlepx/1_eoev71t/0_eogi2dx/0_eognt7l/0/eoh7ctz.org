First off, you may actually be entirely correct in saying that authors did not read the books. I've seen several times now, authors saying they never read/finished book xxx (many years after publication) because they didn't like it. /Shrugs/ Others who have finished the series probably haven't read the books in 10 or so years.

Anyways, ignore the rest of this post. I was going somewhere with it and went off on a tangent.

In many of the fics I read, 90% of the characters are OOC, and I don't particularly care. I just consider them to be OCs and read along. I still prefer for them to take a canon name though, because it tells me their background.

Eg. there's an OC named Hermione? Probably a muggleborn, and smart.

Or. An OC named Harry Potter? He (or she) likely has an invisibility cloak that will be passed down.

TL;DR I don't care about the characterizations, but rather use canon names as guides to their family backgrounds. This makes me very open to weird interpretations of characters, since I read everyone as OCs. Ron Weasley to me is just a guy with siblings, little money, and overbearing mother. He could be the sneakiest guy or an absolute idiot and I won't care either way.
