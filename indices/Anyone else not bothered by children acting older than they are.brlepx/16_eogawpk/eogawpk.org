I personally enjoy the fantasy of children raised to rule a small community and being highly educated, intelligent and scheming.

Unrealistic? Sure. But then again, I can't do magic, even as an adult.

One just needs to listen to child actors, how they think, talk about their careers, how controlled when talking. Like twelve year old adults.
