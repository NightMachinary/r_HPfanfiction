I completely agree with you. But I also want to bring up 3 points for others reading this thread.

1. Children and especially teens actually do act older than they appear quite often and are capable of quite a lot of more adult things. But as adults, we often fail to recognize this and because we think of them as younger and inexperienced, in our minds they "shouldn't" or "don't" act that way. This is especially true in wealthier or more well to do areas of the world. Go to more poverty stricken or tougher areas of the world and you will see children and teens especially, very much acting like adults with all the responsibilities and hardships that may entail.

2. Children who suffer at a young age from hardships in whatever form (Like Harry), often have to "grow up" faster. Harry may be stunted in terms of recognizing relationships and love perhaps, but he was cooking, cleaning, and taking care of the Dursleys from a young age (or so it's implied). He dealt with abuse, and full awareness of the lack of parents, along with experiencing strange occurrences of accidental magic. He is not really a true child and so stories that have him acting older than he is age-wise are not really doing anything wrong and in fact, are more accurate than folks may realize. Again, he certainly may be stunted in some areas, but it would not be surprising for an 11-year-old Harry to embrace the Wizarding world and "grow up" mentally VERY fast because of his childhood.

3. The wizarding world is NOT MODERN BY DESIGN. It is a world that, in large part, has not kept up with the muggle world advancements because it has not needed to. Magic solves many problems that both societal and technological advancement solves in the muggle world. This means that we can't look at the wizarding world from the point of view of modern society. In the past, children DID grow up faster and had more responsibilities earlier. There are elements of Wizarding society that would force this, the most obvious one being that you wield a deadly weapon from the age of 11 (or younger). JK wrote the series from the mindset of school children dealing with a hard world, but never really dived into how much the setup of the wizarding world would affect how quickly the children had to grow up.

--------------

It is almost expected that in HP fan fiction, the children should act older than their age. The world and the setting demand it, and it's not as far off reality as many would like to believe.
