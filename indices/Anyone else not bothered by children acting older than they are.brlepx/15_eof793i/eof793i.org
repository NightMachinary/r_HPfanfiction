I hate it when people write first year stories where every kid is either an experienced political scientist or a neo nazi in training. Like someone else said here, it's not a stretch for a 12 year old to act like a 17 year old sometimes, but don't get carried away with it.

I generally avoid any stories that start before 4th year now partly because of this. Having older characters means that the characterizations can make more sense and the power levels aren't as outrageous for the age group (usually).
