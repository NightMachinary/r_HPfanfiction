Only caveat is that the writing quality in the first couple of chapters is terrible. That's only in the first 2-3 chapters, then he stops treating it as a fic for a competition and starts taking it slowly.

Unrelated, but I had no idea he put up a new fic recently. I thought he had left fanfiction permanently to focus on his professional life.
