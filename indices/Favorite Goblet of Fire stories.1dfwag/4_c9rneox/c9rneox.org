I love GoF stories, but unfortunately I canÂ´t remember the names of most of the ones I've read.

However some really good are:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244813/1/A-Champion-s-New-Hope][A Champion's new hope]] A HP/DG story. Adventure

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8135514/1/His-Angel][His Angel]] A HP/FD. Romance/Hurt/Comfort. WIP but very long so it will take some time to catch up.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6091629/1/Triwizard-Tournament-Take-Two][Triwizard Tournament: Take Two]] Adventure/Romance. Very much WIP, but it an interesting premise. I have heard from the author that he is working on a new chapter but it has been a while since he has last updated.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7544355/18/When-a-Veela-Cries][When a Veela Cries]] starts at the third task, very different story. Not GoF but still in a way related to it. WIP
