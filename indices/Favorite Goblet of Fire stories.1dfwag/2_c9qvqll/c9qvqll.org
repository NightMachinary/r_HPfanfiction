Since GOF is my favorite of the series, I've enjoyed a handful of stories with different scenarios:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5483280/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Champion-s-Champion][Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion]] - Idiot!Ron Bashing humor

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7222456/1/The-Fourth-Champion][The Fourth Champion]] - Harry who was in hiding/raised by Sirius is drawn as the 4th champion.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7392700/1/Banking-on-Her][Banking on Her]] - H/HR Love Story that starts in GOF.

I've also read Champion's New Hope and Lie I've Lived and enjoyed both of those as well.
