[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6990881/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Alternative-Tournament][Harry Potter and the Alternative Tournament]], by twistyguru: An awesome crossover with Mary Poppins, of all things. "The Goblet of Fire creates a binding magical contract, not only on the student but the school...so what school is Harry representing? Harry gets a new Headmistress who's practically perfect, and the Tournament gets the Guru treatment! Xover, imp. Slash!"

There are bits of both Comedy and Drama, and even a Plot. But mainly a Fluffy Romance between Harry and Cedric. Slash. Characters owned by J.K. Rowling."
