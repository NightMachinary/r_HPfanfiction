Harry Potter and the four founders by Darth Marrs seems right up your alley! It's a contained, non expanding harem, with real emotional connections and equality between Harry and wives, and the wives are treated as actual strong independent witches, not sex slaves. In fact, they rather enthusiastically consent. It's also got some very sweet romantic scenes, and a little bit of plot.

The girls are Luna, Hermione, Susan, Daphne, and Ginny. (small but not really important spoiler, harry inherits the lines of the 4 founders and thus can legally have a marriage for each line, so Hermione is lady gryffindor, Luna lady ravenclaw, and so on. Ginny marries the Potter line, so she gets what she's always wanted, just Harry.)
