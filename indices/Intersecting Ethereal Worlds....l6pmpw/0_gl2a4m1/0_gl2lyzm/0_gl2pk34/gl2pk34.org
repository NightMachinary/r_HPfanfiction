Oh, it's a thing. I mean, there's literally a tabletop RPG called 'Cat-thulhu' and there's a few video games and books around that look at the beauty of the cosmos instead of the horror. Just not so much a thing in this fandom is all. The closest we've got is 'It's the end of the world aa we know it' by Quartermass, but even that's not quite there.
