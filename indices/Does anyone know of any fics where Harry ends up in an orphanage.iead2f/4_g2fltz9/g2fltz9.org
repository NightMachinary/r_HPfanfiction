There one that I read that was super duper duper fucked up and incredible to read. Draco and Harry were friends, Harry was Slytherin, and ended up really Dark. It was a crazy read and very fun. Not good if rape or torture triggers you though. It's called [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12867536/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Homecoming][Harry Potter and the Homecoming]] and it's a series.
