Souls Touch, and the Future Changes by sunmoonandstars. linkao3(13893606)

Plot synopsis: Ruthless Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore took care of all the horcruxes but still abandoned Harry to Petunia, who abused him for a few years then dumped him in a Catholic orphanage where he was shunned and persecuted by the other kids. To be fair, Dumbledore thought "family" would keep Harry from becoming another Grindelwald or Voldemort, but he still knew it would be less than ideal. He also is deliberately crippling Harry's political standing, but that's been less effective than he hoped.

Ironically, the author orphaned it, which is especially strange after the last "chapter" was an author's note saying the story would never be abandoned and was already planned out through sixth year with a rough outline of the rest.
