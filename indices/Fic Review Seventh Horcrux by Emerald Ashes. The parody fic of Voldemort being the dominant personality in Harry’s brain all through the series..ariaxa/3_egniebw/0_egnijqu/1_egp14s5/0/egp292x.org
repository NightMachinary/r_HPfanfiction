I don't know that that's true. Voldemort entrusted two of his horcruxes to his most trusted Death Eaters before his fall - Lucius and Bellatrix. Both were expected to protect these relics, but without knowing what they truly were. Lucius acted independently when he gave the diary to Ginny, partially because he believed his former master was gone forever and therefore wouldn't miss it, partially because he was under ministry scrutiny for possession of Dark Objects at the time, and partially so that he could mess with the family of the man pressing the charges against him. Voldemort would have absolutely lost his sh*t when he was brought back and learned what had happened to the diary. Every one of them was keeping his life force afloat - I can't think of any canonical reason why he would have valued one of them above or below the others.
