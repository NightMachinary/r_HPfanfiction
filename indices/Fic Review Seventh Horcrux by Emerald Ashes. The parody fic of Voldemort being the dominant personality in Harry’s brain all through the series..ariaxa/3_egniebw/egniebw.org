Nice review!

I thought the Diary thing was mostly because HarryMort didn't like the idea of more of him running around, or the fact that he'd have to potentially share any of his spotlight. He /did/ order the DiaryMort to "go back, young man," and when he refused, Harry!Mort called destroying the Horcrux a necessary evil.
