  Eh, I think the plot and characterization are really internally consistent, which makes for a very strong backbone.

The plot and charactiersation are consistently absurd, yes. Stuff like Voldemort starting the Death Eaters because he got drunk - this is not intended to be a serious attempt at characterising Voldemort. He is a cartoon. There is humour to be had in it for sure, but it's not a particularly clever type of humour, and so it grows old fast.
