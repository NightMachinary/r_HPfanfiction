Eh, I think the plot and characterization are really internally consistent, which makes for a very strong backbone.

It's almost more like a TV comedy. If you have a bunch of characters the audience understands, then the plot is more about seeing how the characters react to it and each other.

Like, "FRIENDS" did not have epic plots, it was mostly just "How will they react to this thing?"
