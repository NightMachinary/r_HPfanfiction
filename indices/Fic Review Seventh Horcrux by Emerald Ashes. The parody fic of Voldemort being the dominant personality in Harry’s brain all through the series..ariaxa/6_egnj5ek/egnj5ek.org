Seventh Horcrux is enjoyable crack, but like most crack fics it's trading on a single joke for an entire novel-length story. It's better written than most crack, so we do at least get some distinct "sub-jokes" like the ongoing joke about Hermione being more evil than Voldemort, but ultimately I think the core joke wears thin.

Some time around sixth year the author seems to try to take the fic more seriously, coming up with reasons why Harrymort is the way he is (all that Imperius Curse nonsense) but it's a house built on foundations of sand, given that all the characterisation and worldbuilding up to that point has been completely absurd in nature (as is the nature of crack).

It would be interesting to see the core concept of the fic (Voldemort!Harry, not just a Harry who has inherited Voldemort's knowledge) done seriously. As far as I'm aware, there's only one other example and even then it's Harry posing as Voldemort rather than genuinely believing himself to be Voldemort (Curse of Fate by Mistress Nika). Plus it's a vampire slash fest.
