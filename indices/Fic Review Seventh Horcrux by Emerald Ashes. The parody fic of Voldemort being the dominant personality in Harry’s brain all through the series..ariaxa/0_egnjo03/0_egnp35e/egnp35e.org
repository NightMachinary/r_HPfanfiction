Oh wow! I didn't mention the ending because I just took it to mean that Harrymort has finally achieved all his goals and is now perfectly happy. He's assured his immortality, made himself the dominant horcrux, managed to get a relic of Gryffindor for his last one anyway, got the philosopher's stone for extra insurance, and of course is at last the DADA teacher. I did love how it sort of pointed out that in canon it was easier for Voldemort to take over the wizarding government that it was to score the teaching job he wanted.
