Yes, the consistency of its quality and internal characterisation was a huge strength of this work. And I agree that plot complexity was not a necessary ingredient to make this story work. It's an excellent example of a somewhat crack-y comedy.

I did read the author notes as well, and whilst I think Ron's lack of jealousy works within the internal narrative of this story, I don't think it can be applied as an accurate comparison of the canonical Ron, who would never have offered his friendship or loyalty to HarryMort to begin with.

I did particularly enjoy the comment where she compares her version of HarryMort to the canonical young Tom Riddle in the orphanage, and I have to give her credit - they lined up extremely well.
