This is honestly one of my all time favorite fics, simply because the characterization is so strong and consistent.

Yes, the initial premise is crack, but it is rock-steady in its execution (Very similar to A Black Comedy, in that respect.)

As I said in another comment- the plot is fine, but it's not some complex masterpiece... and that's /fine/.

Character-based comedy thrives on taking characters executed very well, and putting them in different situations.

Reading Author Notes, you can see that she thought a lot about how these twisted versions of canon characters "work. "

For example, Ron isn't nearly as resentful of Harrymort because Harry obviously loves fame (and does tons of amazing things)- canon Ron was more resentful of the fact that Harry had amazing fame and adventures and was ungrateful about it.
