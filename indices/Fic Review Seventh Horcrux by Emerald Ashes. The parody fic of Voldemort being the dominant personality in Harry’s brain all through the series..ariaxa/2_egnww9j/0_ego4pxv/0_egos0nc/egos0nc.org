I did wonder about this a bit. Honestly I don't see much of Harry in the mix though. in the first two books he murders Quirrell and Lockhart (though the later was sort of accidental) and has no qualms having Hagrid thrown into Azkaban where he remains for several years before Voldemort breaks him out again. He has to be forced by Hermione into saving Ron in the third book. Oh, and he also murders MoodyCrouch and a whole bunch of Death Eaters. Ron and Hermione make a comment at some point about how Harry says all these horrible things but never actually does evil things, but I put that down to they genuinely don't know what he gets up to. he frequently does quick calculations to see how fast he can kill someone when he becomes worried that they've figured him out, and I don't think that changes throughout the series.

By the end, I got the impression that he had simply managed to secure his position and remove any competition for being the dominant Voldemort, thus eliminating his chances of being discovered as the Dark Lord. He's content, not because he has grown and mellowed as a person, but because he achieved everything he had ever wanted
