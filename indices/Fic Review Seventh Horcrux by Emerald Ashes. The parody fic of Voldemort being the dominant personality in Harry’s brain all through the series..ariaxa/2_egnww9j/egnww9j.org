Harrymort becomes progressively less evil as the story goes on. At beginning, he had no problem using Ron as the bait, but in the end, he uses himself as the bait so Ron could snatch Nagini.

Ron also grows. He started out by offering himself as a minion to Harrymort, and end up playing the werewolf politics. He neither has any jealous fits, nor does he show much insecurities.

Hermione is pretty much her canon self, and Harrymortâ€˜s inner thoughts about her CANON DEEDS are a highlight of this fic. Another funny thing here is that Harrymort doesn't treat her as a minion, but as an apprentice and a successor (so he could retire and teach DADA forever).

Ginny is obviously a little messed up by the Diary. On the other hand, she picks up its Parseltongue and Legilimency powers. To her credit, she never uses magical compulsions to win over Harrymort, and finally succeeds in the end.
