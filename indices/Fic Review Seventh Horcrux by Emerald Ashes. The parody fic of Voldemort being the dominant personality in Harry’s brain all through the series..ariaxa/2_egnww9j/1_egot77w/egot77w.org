  At beginning, he had no problem using Ron as the bait, but in the end, he uses himself as the bait so Ron could snatch Nagini.

Yes, but at the finale Ron is back to being bait.

  Ron also grows. He started out by offering himself as a minion to Harrymort, and end up playing the werewolf politics. He neither has any jealous fits, nor does he show much insecurities.

I have to disagree on this one. He doesn't actually offer himself as a minion. He genuinely thinks he's HarryMort's best friend. His lack of jealousy kind speaks to the lack of intelligence he's portrayed with in this story. He doesn't get jealous because it never occurs to him that he's on the same level as HarryMort. I enjoyed the Werewolf activism end to his arc, but it seemed like more of a funny follow on from Ron's being seen as a werewolf by everyone else for so long because HarryMort kept saying he was.

  Hermione is pretty much her canon self, and Harrymort‘s inner thoughts about her CANON DEEDS are a highlight of this fic. Another funny thing here is that Harrymort doesn't treat her as a minion, but as an apprentice and a successor (so he could retire and teach DADA forever).

On this point I agree entirely. Hermione could genuinely have used some checks and balances for some of her actions throughout the series, and though this is definitely not the method I would have chosen to do it, it did highlight some very intelligent points about how dodgy some of her choices are.

​

Lastly, I remember Ginny's Parseltongue, but not her legilimency. When did that pop up?
