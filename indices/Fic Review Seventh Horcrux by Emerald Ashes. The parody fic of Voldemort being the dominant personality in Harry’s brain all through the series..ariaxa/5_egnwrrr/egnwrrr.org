That fic read like an experiment in how to write 100k crack using only one technique. Felt like a drag for some stretch in the middle, but on the whole I think it was a great accomplishment given the severe self-imposed constraint.

What I will always remember of it is that it managed to end on /the/ perfect note. Like, in a way it would be literally impossible to improve on that.
