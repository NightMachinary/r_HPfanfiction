One of the first vampire stories I remember reading was over on HPFF. Took some digging to remember the name of it, but it's here:

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=319285]]

There's 3 parts to it (though it looks like the first was redone at some point, the post date is later than the second story, which is 2009 which is when I would have read it). I don't remember much, other than the female vampire being a massive Mary Sue, which shouldn't be a surprise given the site that it's on. I have an inkling that the story is also probably pretty bad.

The Santi also has a femvamp x Harry story somewhere out there.
