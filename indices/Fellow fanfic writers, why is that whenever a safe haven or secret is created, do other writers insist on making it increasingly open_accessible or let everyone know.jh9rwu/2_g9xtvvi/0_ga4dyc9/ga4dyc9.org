I think the key is to focus the secret on who it directly affects. Super hero unmasking is about public scrutiny, but secrets like hidden loyalties/relationships, secret knowledge, or secret plans have a narrower focus. So long as the MC is keeping smart about it, maybe they chat with the bartender about their affair/crush but not the affected parties, even though we hope that by the end of the story the tension from the secret gets resolved.
