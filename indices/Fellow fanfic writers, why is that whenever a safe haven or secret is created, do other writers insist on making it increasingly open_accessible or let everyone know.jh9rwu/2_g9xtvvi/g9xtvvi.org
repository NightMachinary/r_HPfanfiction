Thats pretty much all of fiction, it's ussually very rare for a secret to not get revealed to tons of people. Think of Persona 5 and the amount of people who know jokers a phantom thief, almost everyone he spends time with finds out on like their 12th time interacting with eachother.

I think this happens because secrets sort of feel like an occam's razor if the secret is revealed to the audience before certain characters, with it feeling like the audience is cheated of payoff if the secret is not revelead to the people affected by the secret.

I dont even think I do know of many secrets that were revealed to the audience early on but never to alot of character, almost every superhero ends up demasking themselves to a good thirty to forty people each iteration, especially of that character is slated for death lol.
