I think the MC can keep some secrets to themselves, so long as we can see the character drama in their own mind it can work well. Or a secret doesn't come out because the concerning party/event is no longer an issue. It can feel a little unresolved, but a confession to a gravestone and other such regrets are a big part of real life and should be in stories.
