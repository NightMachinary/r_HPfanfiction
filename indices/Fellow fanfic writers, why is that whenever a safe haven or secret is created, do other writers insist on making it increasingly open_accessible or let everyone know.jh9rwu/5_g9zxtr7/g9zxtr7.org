Chekhov's Secret. You never tease a secret in a story without it getting out. You never introduced flaws like a twisted upbringing or a checkered past without exposing them at some point in the story. Secrets that never get out in a story may as well not even be included in the first place if they're not going to contribute to the plot or the drama.
