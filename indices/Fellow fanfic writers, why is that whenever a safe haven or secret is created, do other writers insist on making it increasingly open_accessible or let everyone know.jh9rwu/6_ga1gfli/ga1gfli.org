In my opinion/ preference, I honestly don't like it when the traveler reveals the secret to anyone. Maybe 1or 2is acceptable for me. But if it's the whole gang or team? It's a nope for me.. Or I just drop it.

BUT! It depends on the reason whyyy they reveal it ya know? If they really NEED that character because they have no choice, because they already use ALL resources then, that's alright for me. But if the only reason why they found out about the secret because they accidentally heard or due to eavesdropping. Then obliviate.

I actually look for the importance of the characters that knows the secret.. Because, if they're just there? What's the point? Because they like that character? Or for extra drama? Will they achieve the goal with or without them? Most fanfic that I read that knows the secret is Snape because he vow to protect Harry and he'll be a good ally to achieve the goal because he spies on the Dumbles and to Voldie

This is one of the reason why I don't often read Harry travelling back to the Marauders era as Harry himself and then he use a different name but because they have the Marauders map, then they'll know the truth and in the end Harry has to reveal everything. I just read Harry being MOD because he'll be able to change his name because MAGIC!

sooo yeah! Whattabout u guys?
