The main example I come across is they want to make a safe haven for everyone to be safe in which is why the reveal the secret to them, but it's usually a safe location under a Fidelious Charm. Revealing to everyone that you're a time traveler is usually a bad idea though. They'll expect too much. At the same time, being the lazy person that I am...if I was a time traveler I would find someone trustworthy and tell them everything I knew so that the responsibility/burden could be shared.
