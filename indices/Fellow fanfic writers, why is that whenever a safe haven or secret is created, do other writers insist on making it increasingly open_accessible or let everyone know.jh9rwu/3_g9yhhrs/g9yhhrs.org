I have speculations.

1. A writer is writing to share what is in their mind. It can be hard to separate wanting to reveal a story in their writing and also write about not revealing things. Especially if the focus of the story is something other than 'keeping secrets'.
2. Probably tricky to have a main character not sharing a few things but still being open and engaged on other things. This comes into play when wanting the character to have close relationships, etc.
3. Without a full outline that incorporates a secret held for a long time it can be hard to maintain the focus to hold back on the secret when so much can happen if other characters are brought in on the secret, one at a time or several at once.
