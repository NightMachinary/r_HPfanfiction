Depending on how it works, the Fidelius. If I just have to stand next to the thing I want to hide and cast the spell, which should take a few minutes at most, great! Now I can be left alone by everyone in my new mansion nobody knows exists. Also pranking. "The door to my sisters room is opposite the bathroom door". Nyehehe.

Otherwise, Accio.
