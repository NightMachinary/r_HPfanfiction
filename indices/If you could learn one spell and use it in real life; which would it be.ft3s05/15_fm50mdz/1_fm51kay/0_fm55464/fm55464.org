Why would you have a problem reaching those in power? You have the imperious curse! It might take some time googling and messing about on various wikis, but I could probably get myself alone (except for my pawns, of course) in the room with probably any world leader I wanted in a month, tops. Even with the current travel restrictions from Covid.

It's not like you have to go straight for the top. You just need to find exposed people that can help you get to slightly less exposed people until you have a critical mass of compromise that you can not only walk right in, but you have an appointment.
