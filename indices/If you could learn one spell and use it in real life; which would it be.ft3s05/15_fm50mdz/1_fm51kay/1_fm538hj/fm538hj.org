Yes, but I could do it stealthily. For example, in my country it's ridiculously easy to get to the proximity of even the highest-ranking politicians. A few years ago I walked right past our Prime Minister with no security guards in sight when he was hosting a party conference in a university campus. Imperius him, order him to arrange me access to foreign prime ministers, Imperius them, and so on.

Of course, if the Imperius Curse allows the caster to dominate only those who have weaker will power, it would be quite useless for me, because I'm a timid and awkward person. In that case I would probably choose wandless Legilimency, because it would help me overcome this personal weakness.
