That's somewhat unclear. It was painful for Harry during the Occlumency lessons, but my interpretation is that Snape did his part poorly for Harry to be able to try to resist. However, there is a fair share of wandless Legilimency in the books, and the victim doesn't seem to notice. Snape used it on Harry to learn that (1) he had sneaked to Hogsmeade, (2) that the empty parchment contained instructions past the Dementors, and (3) that Harry had learned Sectumsempra from Snape's Potions book.
