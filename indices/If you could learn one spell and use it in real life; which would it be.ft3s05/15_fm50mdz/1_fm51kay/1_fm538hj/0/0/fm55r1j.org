Well, even Legilimency is just a tool. Like any tool, it can be used unethically, but not solely so. I wouldn't want to rummage anyone's memories just because I can. But if used to detect lies, misleading, and meanings behind poorly communicated words? I wouldn't consider it wrong. Come to think of it, wandless Legilimency would allow the Legilimens to understand any foreign language when it is spoken and there is an eye contact with the speaker. Immensely useful.
