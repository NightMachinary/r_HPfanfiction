The Imperius Curse, obviously. I would cast it on the most powerful individuals in the world and become the ruler of the world unbeknownst to everyone. You see, most problems of the humankind (global warming, overpopulation, desertification, pollution, wars etc.) could be solved if we used our resources and expertise with sufficient determination. From a utilitarian point of view it would be extremely irresponsible not to choose the Imperius Curse. Imagine a global disaster caused by humans, something that could have been avoided, taking place because you choose some "good" magic skill for your use. Healing injuries is nothing when people die by the billions.

The Imperius Curse would allow me to achieve my selfish goals too. It's supreme in its versatility.
