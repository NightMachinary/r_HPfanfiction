Ok, the number of creepers who want to use imperio on people is disturbing. Obviously, I'd choose Crucio because- no just kidding. I'd learn to enchant an every burning flame so I could create infinite power sources. Selling them would make a bunch of money without crashing the economy, would help save the planet, and I can think of a number of tech trees that would open up.
