I'm stuck between: Apparition; so I can get rid of my car along with the expenses and the insurance, Imperious; to help with global issues and selfish issues of course what I can gain from the imperious selfishly I'm not quite sure yet but I'd probably think of something eventually Shrink/Grow Charm; because organizing my room would be so much easier if I could just shrink everything and then place it where I needed to be before enlarging it again and I have extra space in my closet if I could just shrink down all of my clothing
