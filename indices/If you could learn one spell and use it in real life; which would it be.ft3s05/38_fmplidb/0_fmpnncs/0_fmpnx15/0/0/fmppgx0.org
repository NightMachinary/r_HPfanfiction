That question is very similar to the question of what superpower I would choose. I have thought a lot about that one.

In the end it comes down to if I'm the only one who has or will have a superpower. If I'm the only one, I'd be able to let my ravenclaw side out. What I would choose would depend on how far you would stretch your question. Fanon occlumancy (mindscape, avatars, organising knowledge, faster thought process) is something I'd love to have as are ancient runes (again fanon with it basically being programming for reality). But if you were to be stricter, I'd probably go for repair and make a loiving repairing stuff for a couple hours a day while reading and learning the rest of the time.

If there are others with powers in the world or there will be or if I'm unsure, then I would have to let !y slytherin side out. My first choice would once again be occlumancy but now not just for personal improvement, but to shape myself into someone akin to Mycroft Holmes. Failing that I'd go for the imperious curse, for the same purpose.

All very clich√© I'm sure, but I've literally spent dozens of hours thinking this over. I've got lists and drafts of fanfics with this as a topic and everything.
