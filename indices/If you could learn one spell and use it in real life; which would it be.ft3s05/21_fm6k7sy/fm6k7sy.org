Legilimency. I mean, mind reading is op as hell anyways, but Voldemort could also implant false memories, right? So if I got good enough, I could do the same thing. Then the simple but op mind reading spell becomes a much more subtle, long-term and... well, even more fucked up version of Imperio. I don't think I'd use it on everyone unless I drop my morals somewhere, especiall the "reprogram people to be whoever you want them to be" part, but shit man, it'd be a good skill to have just in case, you know?
