Gamp's Law says that food cannot be conjured or out right created. It can be multiplied or enlarged however.

/It/ */should/* /be noted that while/ */food/* /cannot be outright created from nothing, it/ */can/* /be multiplied if one already has some/ */food/* /to multiply, it/ */can/* /be enlarged or the/ */food can/* /be summoned if one knows the approximate location and is fairly sure the/ */food will/* /still be there./
