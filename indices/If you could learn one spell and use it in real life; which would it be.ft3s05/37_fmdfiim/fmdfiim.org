Something that breaks the laws of physics in a simple, consistent and reliable way. I'm thinking ideally the ability to enchant something to do the physics breaking for me, like an enchantment that could be put on a water bottle that refills it so it provides an unlimited amount.

Breaking conservation of mass has the neat side effect of also breaking conservation of momentum, which makes a ton of really interesting engineering exploits possible. Travel to Mars in a week? Totally doable! Just attach the unlimited water source to a nuclear reactor and let the resulting high pressure steam out of a nozzle and you get unlimited Î”v!
