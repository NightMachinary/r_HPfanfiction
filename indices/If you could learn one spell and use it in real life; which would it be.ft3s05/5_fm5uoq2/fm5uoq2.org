I am split between the Impervius Charm and the Imperius curse,

the Imperius would allow me to save the world by mind controlling politicians to strongly decrease things like poverty, global warming and wars, on the other hand the Impervius would allow me to see in rain despite my glasses.

I think I'd take the Impervius Charm.
