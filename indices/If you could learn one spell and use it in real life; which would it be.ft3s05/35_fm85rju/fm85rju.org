Legimens Or Legimency spell. Mind reading is dead useful, if you're not a natural mind reader Legimens is the way to go.

If not that apparition or Animagus

If those are not counted then that unnamed 'surface level' transformation Hermione did or the one Gellert Grindelward used that was removed with a revelio. Because using illusions to change face or appearance is dead useful. Be a literal illusionist.
