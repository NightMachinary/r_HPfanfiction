I mean, since we don't really know too well how it works, it could be a spell (ie. using magic to allow suppression of memories and thoughts and emotions and such) that's just constantly maintained. Especially given that we Muggles can't really do it. Passive spellcasting is a thing in other media.

But you're probably right. Hmm. In that case, I change my answer to Legilimency, but only if I can read myself and my own unconscious thoughts so I can find out where I left my keys. The information is still there, even if I'm not consciously aware of it, I just have to find it.
