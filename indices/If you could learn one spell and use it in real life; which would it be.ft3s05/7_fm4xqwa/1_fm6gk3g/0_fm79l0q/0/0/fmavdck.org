Fair. Like I said, you're probably right, we're just not really given enough detail to exclude all that many interpretations. "Clear your mind - Legilimens!" isn't exactly all that specific. :D

And a good point - we don't really know if Snape was making an honest effort or not. Though, I'm curious if anyone has actually asked Rowling about that sort of thing (Snape's lessons and Bellatrix's Crucio Primer, etc) and how honest a Death Eater-turned-Spy and a Death Eater Fanatic would really be to someone they hated and/or opposed.
