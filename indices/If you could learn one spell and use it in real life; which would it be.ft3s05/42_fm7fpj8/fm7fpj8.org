Notice me Not, or whatever spell makes you unnoticable by people or technology. Imagine being able to do literally anything you can physically do. Get rich? Rob a rich dude. I mean, aside from that it depends on what the person would do. There are very morally grey areas of activities and there is the darker side of it like rape, murder, bombing the US embassy, etc. But yeah I would love to be able to do a spell that makes me literally un noticable ergo invisible.
