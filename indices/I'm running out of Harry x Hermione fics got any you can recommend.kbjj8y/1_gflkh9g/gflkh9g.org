I recommend blindness by Angelastarcat. Harry is blinded at birth which makes petunia sympathetic to him so they raise him kindly and the wizards don't think Harry can do magic is he's blind so they cast him aside and somewhere in the process he meets hermione (because there was no one to protect her from the troll). And that's it I won't say anything else, don't want to spoil too much. It's a great Harmony fic, definitely recommend.
