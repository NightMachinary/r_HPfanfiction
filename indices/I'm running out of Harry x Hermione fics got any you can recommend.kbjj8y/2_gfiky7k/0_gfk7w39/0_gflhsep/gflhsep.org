Use square brackets for the text, and round brackets for the link, with no space between them.

For example,

[Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]([[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]])

will result in:

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]]

(Which is a story I favour if you like the Harmony relationship to develop quite slowly and organically.)
