Harry/Daphne linkffn(The Fall o the House of Potter). Bashing of Weasleys, Dumbledore, Hermione, Lily and James.

Linkffn(Do Not Meddle In The Affairs Of Wizards by Corwalch). This one was a bit dark for me. All the injustices and hurt Harry went through, Dumbledore's manipulations. There's a lot of a rage in this story and yeah they deserved it.
