Harry is more of a film geek. I accidentally a plot.

Enjoy:

--------------

*Prologue*

'Harry Hunting' sucked, at least from Harry's perspective, so he did pretty much anything he could to avoid Dudley and his friends after school. As chance would have it, Harry escaped one afternoon into an old movie theatre. Normally, this would not deter Dudley and his goons, but the old proprietor stepped out of a staff room and stood between Harry and his assailants.

"Go on home, boys. Get!"

The old man took a look at Harry cowering in the corner.

"Friends of yours?" Harry frowned but didn't say anything.

"Gotcha. C'mere. Ever seen Gremlins?"

--------------

*1st year:*

"Troll? In the dungeons? Pfft. That movie sucked." Some older students were giving Harry looks, which he was quite used to by now.

"What's a movie?"

"I knew having the same name as those people was a bad sign." (The family in the original Troll film are named Potter, with the brother being Harry Potter Jr.)

--------------

"What do you see in the mirror, Harry?"

"I'm old enough to smoke, and I got like, a wicked Freddy Kruger tattoo."

Dumbledore frowned.

--------------

*2nd year:*

"I saw Arachnophobia last year, I'll deal with this."

/Proceeds to burn down the entire Forbidden Forest/

--------------

"Mate, you ever heard of a basilisk in one of those freaky muggle movers you watch?"

Harry winced at the word 'freaky': "Movies. And no, but its sounds familiar."

"I've heard of them referenced in Shakespeare," Hermione said. "You know, Shakespeare? Richard the Third? You've /no idea/ what I'm talking about, do you?"

Both boys shook their heads.

"Is he like a famous director, or something?"

Hermione smashed her head into the open book, startling half the library.

--------------

*3rd year:*

Harry stepped forward, but Professor Lupin put a hand on his shoulder to stop him. "That is all for class, today. I want a foot on boggarts by next lesson."

"Why did you stop me, Professor?

"I've seen some of those films you like to reference, Harry, and... no. Just, no."

--------------

"Ha! I got him!" Harry stormed into the Headmaster's office, where Snape and Dumbledore were already waiting.

"Harry? Why are you carrying a box with a rat inside?" Harry slammed the box down on Dumbledore's desk, causing both adults to jump back.

"I got him!"

"Potter, I know your brain is addled from all that /muggle/ entertainment, but try using some semblance of English to explain."

"That's Peter Pettigrew!"

"Impossible. Pettigrew is dead, killed by Black. Why would you--"

"A map told me. And it's always like this. There's a murder mystery. Wrong guy gets blamed. The good guy turns out to be a werewolf. Sometimes the end is tragic, or bitter sweet."

"Potter, I thought your area of interest was the more /disturbing/ facets of muggle culture..."

"They only moved the headstones, but they didn't touch the bodies..." The adults gave each other a worrying look. "I've been pretty on edge ever since the /freaking DEMENTORS/ showed up. Sorry. There's Hellraiser and Vlad Tepes chasing me, getting eaten by plants, ghosts sucking me into the tele..."

Dumbledore gave Snape a questioning look. Snape shook his head in warning.

A few moments later, Pettigrew was stunned and bound on the floor.

"Severus," Dumbledore inquired, "I can't help but notice the tattoo on his left arm. Did you know anything about this?"

"I..." Snape managed to look distinctly away from Dumbledore's eyes. "The Death Eaters were very compartmentalized."

--------------

*4th year*

"You're going to love it! Quidditch World Cup. Can't believe it's finally here."

"Harry, are you okay?"

Harry stared at the device in his hands.

"Mate, you look a little stiff. Something wrong?"

"Oh. Oh, God no." Hermione stuffed her face in her hands.

"Why. Didn't. Anyone. FREAKING. TELL ME. YOU HAD FREAKING CAMERAS. THIS WHOLE DAMNED TIME?!"

"Mate, I didn't know until now--" Harry threw his arms in air.

"Fine! Let's watch some Quidditch. At least we have some Omnioculars now. Hermione, I'm going to need you to help me figure these out so--"

"--Say no more, Harry," Hermione sighed.

A moment later, gigantic screens unfurled from high up above the middle of the pitch, and one by one started to display the live action on the field.

"OH COME ON!"

--------------

"Harry, did you put your name in the Goblet?"

"No," Harry crossed his arms. "I can prove it."

Everyone except Snape and Dumbledore looked confused when Harry pulled out the Omnioculars. The two Hogwarts professors sighed in unison.

"I don't suppose your contraption managed to see the culprit attempting to kill you /this/ time, Potter?"

"I reviewed the footage. Whoever it was was under dissillusionment or an invisibility cloak. I also noticed Mr. Crouch spending an awful lot of time in Professor Moody's office."

Everyone turned to where Mad-Eye had been standing just moments ago.

"Are you sure this is wise, Harry?"

"What? Of course it is."

"Shouldn't we be practicing something more... practical? Like Defense Against the Dark Arts?"

"No way. Think of the possibilities! Wizarding tele! Wizarding films! You know, like plays on the radio, but you can see them! I know we're limited by props the Room can supply until the twins can make us the things on my list, but this will be great. Trust me.

"Now, Colin, Dennis, I need you to frame these shots like... so. Remember the dolly effect I taught you. Good. Neville, you have the lights. Luna, any edits to the script? Good. Ron, Hermione, do you remember your lines?"

Ron looked confused. Hermione looked incensed.

"Great! Already in character! Now, you're having the argument when the monster slowly creeps out behind the mist.... and... ACTION!"

--------------

*6th year*

"Ah, this must be Harry Potter! Truly a pleasure!" Harry's face lit up as they shook hands.

"You've seen my film, mister Slughorn?" Dumbledore gave Harry a nudge.

"Er, Horace is a little behind the times, Harry."

Later...

"Welcome to the screening of Toadacolypse: or the High Inquisitor's Bane, starring Dolores Umbridge."

"Slug Club..." Horace whispered under his breath.

"You know you are truly disturbed, right, Potter?"

"I'll get you a bigger role in the next one, Draco. So. This one turned out to be more documentary than I'd liked, but I have some plans for my next project. If you'd like a part, I need actors, gaffers, and some new prop masters now that the Weasley Twins have left. Here's the sign-up list. Professor, I heard you know Celestina Warbeck? Think you might be able to get her to help with the score?"

Slughorn took another shot of vodka and melted into his chair.

--------------

"You have inspired me, Harry."

"Really? How so?"

"Have you ever heard of a Pensieve?" The Headmaster produced a basin-like object made of stone.

Harry had not, but after experiencing the memories Dumbledore supplied, Harry thought he knew where Dumbledore was going with this.

--------------

The Elder Wand flew from Dumbledore's grasp.

"That's it, Draco. Very good. Now there is one thing more you must do..."

Draco screwed up his face, tears gathering in his eyes.

"AVADA KEDAVRA!" A green bolt lanced out of Snape's wand, striking Dumbledore in the chest, sending the Headmaster off the Astronomy tower.

--------------

*7th year*

Voldemort strode into the Great Hall like the victorious conqueror he was. Most of the school was bound or disarmed and gathered in the Great Hall, held up at wand-point. Poor Minerva looked beside herself. Hagrid was a mess. Snape bowed to his master.

"It is my pleasure to present to you Hogwarts, my Lord."

"Excellent," Voldemort hissed. "Excellent work, /Headmaster/. Where is the boy?"

"You're pretty good at this," Harry said. "You're a natural. Are you sure you've never acted before?"

"I've heard of your peculiar nature, boy, it is another to witness it in person. Pray tell, what on earth are you talking about?"

Harry looked around, gesturing. "The film we're making. OH! You're a method actor. Got it." Harry winked.

Voldemort looked perplexed.

"Now that I have a body, my loyal followers, and the only wizard in Britain who could match my power dead, there remains one step unfinished in my plan, Potter."

Voldemort aimed his wand at Harry and said the words. There was an explosion of fire and green light.

"As the Phoenix rises from the ashes!"

Voldemort whipped around, surprise painted on his face, but the older wizard was already casting spells.

Adult witches and wizards, as well as a company of Aurors appeared from seemingly nowhere, spells flying. Snape kept his wand moving, but strictly in defense of himself and his Slytherin students.

The resulting battle was dramatic, but over quickly, and decidedly in Dumbledore's favor when he had Voldemort bound and stunned. The rest of the Death Eaters surrendered.

"He always had a flair for the dramatic..." Snape stepped over Voldemort's prone body and looked up at Harry: "A well played ruse, Potter."

Harry smiled and shrugged. "It was mostly Dumbledore's idea. Muggles used to believe a lot of things they saw on television or heard on the radio when the technology was newer. I figured wizards would be /at least/ as gullible."

Snape frowned, but there was no ire in it.

--------------

*Epilogue*

"I thought there would be more muggles." Ron, Harry, and Hermione strolled through the movie theatre lobby, admiring the posters and snacking on sweets. Harry poured half a box of his M&Ms into the jumbo tub of sweet savory popped corn.

"Normally there would be," Harry explained. "But I bought the place. Shall we?"

The trio sat near the center of the massive auditorium. An Omniocular-projector lit up, painting the hundreds-foot screen with white light.

"What are we watching, Harry?" Hermione asked. Harry smiled.

"Anything we'd like."
