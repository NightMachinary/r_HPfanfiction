Harry facing a vampire- Harry shook his head and shrugged.

"Sorry, you're just not that scary."

He felt a stab of pity at the vampire's sudden crest fallen look. "Don't feel too bad. You're scarier than Louis and Lestat, though that's not a high bar for me. You're actually somewhat close to being as scary as one of the Lost Boys, not David though. More like the blonde one with the mullet.

I'll tell you what. Give me a pen and some paper and I'll write you of list of movies for you to watch. Study those and you'll be almost as scary as Jesse in no time."
