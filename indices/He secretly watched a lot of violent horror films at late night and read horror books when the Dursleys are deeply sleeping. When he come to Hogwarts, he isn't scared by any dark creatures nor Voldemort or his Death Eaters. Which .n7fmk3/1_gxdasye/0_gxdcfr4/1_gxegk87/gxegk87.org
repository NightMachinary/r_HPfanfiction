While I can respect the classics, I wouldn't exactly call the Bela Lugosi Dracula movies or the character scary. From what I've seen he just doesn't have that air of almost unnatural menace or danger that more modern vampire movies manage.

Especially not compared to the likes of /The Lost Boys/ or /Near Dark/, which is a criminally underrated movie in my opinion.
