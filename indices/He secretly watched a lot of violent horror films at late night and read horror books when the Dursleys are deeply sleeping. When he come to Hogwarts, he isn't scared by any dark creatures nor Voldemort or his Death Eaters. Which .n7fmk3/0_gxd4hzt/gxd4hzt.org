The Boggart scene would have to be legendary to pull this one off.

"Harry? Your Boggart is a... Dog?" Hermione asked.

"Don't get close." Harry said as he slowly put his wand into a fast casting position. "You'll provoke it."

Hermione looked at Harry, then at the dog. The dog looked at her and moved towards her-

"Incendio!"

A wave of fire hit the dog head-on, causing it to erupt into a mound of shrieking flesh and whipping tentacles.

"That's for three months' worth of insomnia you bastard! Hahaha!"

Screaming in pain, the Boggart retreated back into the cupboard and shut the door. "Phew, thanks Professor!" Harry said to Lupin. "That was nicely therapeutic."

"What the hell was that?" Ron asked.

"Do you really want to know Ron?" Hermione asked back.
