I read a lot of Drarry, so here's a few well written ones I read over and over. They may not meet all of your specs but they're really well done so i hope you give them a chance: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7985741/1/The-Descent-of-Magic][The Decent of Magic]], [[http://thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=16931][When it Alteration Finds]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6435092/1/Turn][Turn]]. Also, I know you aren't looking for angst or h/c, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9471590/1/Kiss-the-Joy-Until-the-Sun-Rise][Kiss the Joy Until the Sun Rise]] meets your other standards. I don't like angst, but this story is so well done and I read it often.
