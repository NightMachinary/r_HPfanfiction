Browse through her work, she does mostly Harry/Draco and her writing is very clean. As for themes, depends on the fic... she has 328, the great majority of which are finished, and she varies from fluff because why no to deeply psychological stories. She also updates extremely regularly, though she has some fics that have stalled out she does address them in her bio. The major advantage to her writing besides how clean it is is that they all tend to be believable even if you don't find the pairing believable. She also has a couple of other pairings she has done (notably one Ginny/Luna). I promise you will find SOMETHING. This woman made me think cannibalism was completely reasonable in one fic and made me giggle madly in others.

I'm a fan of angst, so take the next two with a grain of salt if you wish:

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/v_g_marks/OW.html][Oscillate Wildly]] is amazing. "After a particularly gruelling Occlumency session, Harry practically comes apart at the seams and finds himself living partway between two lives. One is his life at Hogwarts. In the other, he's been in a mental institution for the better part of six years. What happens when Harry realizes his whole life may be one elaborate fantasy? Harry/Draco, Partially AU" I read it a long time ago and just corrected a spelling error in the summary, but it is one that has really stuck with me.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1318020/1/][Faith]] has an amazing plot *IF* you can slog through the first couple of chapters. I went to reread and the beginning hurt so bad, the first time I read it I was younger. But it DOES improve dramatically as far as the writing goes and it is another one that has haunted me. /I am honestly not positive of the quality/ anymore, but it pulls in Celtic mythology in a really beautiful way.

Hit me up if you want more Harry/Draco. That is really my ship and I am always reading more.
