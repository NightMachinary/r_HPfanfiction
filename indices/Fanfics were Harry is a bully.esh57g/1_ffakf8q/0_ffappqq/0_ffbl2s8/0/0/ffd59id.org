It can certainly be told from Harry's and Ron's perspectives only. It wouldn't change the substance of it, though. Harry would still come off as an unpleasant, unsympathetic character. And, it'd still be up to Hermione to organise the Gryffindors to oppose the Sytherins' bullying; and as the one with the most talent and drive of the group, she'd end up being their best fighter as well.

If the redemption arc happens, Harry would still have to abase himself (in his own mind) before the Gryffindors and deal with their open distrust.
