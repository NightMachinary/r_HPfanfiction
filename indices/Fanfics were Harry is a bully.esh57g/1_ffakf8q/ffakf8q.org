It would be refreshing to see more fics in which Harry is a straight antagonist: not an angsty anti-hero, not a sympathetic con artist, but an actual unsympathetic antagonist to another protagonist. There are fics in which Harry is a bully, but he tends to be portrayed in a flattering light---in how clever and powerful he is---and never gets a satisfying comeuppance.

One premise I'd like to see is where Vernon and Petunia would have spoiled Harry like they had Dudley. (Rationale: After hearing from Petunia what wizards are capable of, Vernon declares that they are going to stay on Harry's good side, whatever it takes.) And so, Harry would have absorbed Vernon's attitudes and bonded with Dudley over stealing lunch money from other children. He would take one look at Draco's expensive new robes and Ron's tattered hand-me-downs, and immediately know whose friend he wanted to be and in which House he wanted to be.

Once there, he would take the easy way out, following Draco's lead in sneering at Gryffindors and bullying Muggleborns. He would mock Hagrid, badmouth Dumbledore, and ingratiate himself with Snape. He would exploit his Quiddich talent and his BWL status to the hilt, thinking himself clever because he gets a lot for doing very little. On those occasions when Harry is absent, Draco would rile up Ron by shoving the fact that Harry chose him in his face.

The actual protagonists of the story---Hermione, Ron, and, later, Neville---would have to rise to the occasion, fighting the bullies despite being outnumbered and dealing with some of the threats to Hogwarts that Harry dealt with in canon. For 4 or 5 years, there would be an ongoing feud: vicious pranks, hexing in the hallways, sometimes outright duels. The Gryffindor trio quickly becomes too dangerous to bully, but even when Draco and Harry switch targets, the do-gooder Gryffindors have the gal to intervene.

There could even be a redemption arc for Harry. When Voldemort returns, it turns out that Voldemort isn't the libertarian meritocrat that Draco talked about and isn't particularly interested in recruiting Harry. It also turns out that Harry's Slytherin friends value their own safety far above their friendship. The most he can get from Draco is a whispered, "Sorry, Potter. My family's more important. It's been fun."

And so, he has to go to the Gryffindors for help.
