Pick just about any independent!Harry fic out there. Nine times out of ten, Harry's going to be a bully... even though the author doesn't think he is. Fics where Harry is intentionally portrayed and named as a bully are a lot rarer... the only one I can think of is "The Golden Age," which is less a fic and more a long rant about why Harry, Ron, Hermione and every single character apart from Snape and the Malfoys are despicable human beings, DISGUISED as a fic.

The first line paragraph of the story is Harry screaming "I want to see some punishment!!" and it just goes from there.
