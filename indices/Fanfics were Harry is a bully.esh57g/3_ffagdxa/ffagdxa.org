Here are two that come to mind:

- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7800970/1/The-Fine-Line-Between-Love-and-Hate]]) is a Dramione fic in which Harry, Ron, Blaise, and Draco are in Slytherin and are bullying Hermione and Neville.
- In linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7659033/1/They-Shook-Hands-Year-1-New-Version]]), Harry accepts Draco's offer of friendship and is sorted into Slytherin. He joins Draco in bullying Hermione and others. (However, this is a Harry-centric fic, so he is portrayed sympathetically despite that.)
