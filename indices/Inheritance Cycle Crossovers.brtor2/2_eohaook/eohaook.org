Regrettably the two that I most want to see update are abandoned. Naturally. I'll link them anyways, as they really are quite interesting.

linkffn(Who am I? by epsi10n) is a unique premise where MOD!Harry gets summoned by Galbatorix and made into a Shade with Shruikan. Understandably, he takes offense to this.

linkffn(Last Wish and Testament by Silent.Storm) is another abandoned one that I remember fondly, Although it is regrettably kind of short.
