Yeah, I just can't get into fics where the MC/primary narrator is female, it just doesn't do it for me. As a guy, it's just much easier to identify with a male narrator.

Don't get me wrong, I like reading different perspectives within a story - recently I read a ASoIAF crossover that had great chapters from Aeryn (female OC) and Margery - but for the main character, it doesn't work for me.

It's just a personal preference, and part of it is the different interests and focuses women naturally have; it's especially strange when the romance/lemons come in.

Funnily enough, I actually read and liked a couple fem!Harry and fem! Voldemort stories - but the MC was Harry. So I don't know if that makes the first pairing incest or masturbation... Or what that says about me, lol.
