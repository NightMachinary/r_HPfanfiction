I know, I can't read slash at all, even if the plot seems good. Though curiously enough, I love and sometimes prefer femHarry. Never other genderbend characters, but I do read and like female MCs just as much as male(i'm a dude). I also usually read for the romance, so there's that. I can't read femVoldemort or any fics where he/she is the pairing, though. It would be just too OoC for me. The only one I've enjoyed was one where femHarry became a wolf animagus and started living in a forest and was found by Nagini, who adopted her. Really cute fic and funny.
