Both are femHarry, there's no slash in it. Sorry, but yeah, its femHarry. If you can get past that, both are fantastic stories with intricate magic system-mesh, fairly original plotlines(mostly on Slowly) a good romance(on BCaL) and it scratches that Inheritance Cycle Itch. Really do give it a try, its worth it, imo.
