Killing curse might be useful to stop rampaging beasts that are resistant to less powerful spells. Cruciatus would be useful if the goal is to not kill it. For example dragons are rare, endangered and take several stunners from multiple wizards at once to subdue. If there's only one wizard available to stop a dragon from flying into a city possibly killing thousands, normal spells wouldn't be enough.
