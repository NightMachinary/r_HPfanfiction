This is a quote from the books, right?

/"A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it"/

The fact that they use something that Voldemort said as a grounds for their argument speaks volumes. This and 'I barely knew my parents, I'm sure they're good people" when Harry teams up with Voldemort. Like, no, that is not how it works. There is something wrong there if you can wave off the murder of your parents and still show emotion for Hermione Granger, who is getting bullied and that is not nice.
