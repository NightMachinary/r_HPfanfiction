To be fair, it is extremely easy for things to be labeled dark when that label really shouldn't apply (not all werewolves are Greyback; yes they need to be careful for a night or two a month, but the rest of the time they are just people with an illness), and other things to be labeled acceptable when it really should be labeled dark or at least extremely restricted (for an example of the latter, look at the implications of obliviate and love potions).

In a sort of counter of the obliviate and love potions thing, I'm curious what kind of magics there may be to force a tense arm holding a knife at someone's throat to relax and remove the knife without any spell impact jerking/spasms/knockback or otherwise letting the crazy person have a chance to react aside from imperious, because if there aren't that could put it up there with obliviate as extremely dangerous but theoretically having fringe cases where it could become acceptable.

Also don't kink shame, I highly doubt there would be absolutely zero BDSM people who would have no interest in or at least curiosity about the crucio and/or imperio in the bedroom under explicit mutual consent (admittedly few, but still >0 lol).

Oh, and I will say that using lethal force /in times of war/ should be an acceptable norm for anyone not willing to engage in serious reprogramming (which brings up moral dilemmas all its own and should only be considered if the gene pool is unviably small as-is), since not doing so when magic can reverse nonlethal takedowns in seconds makes nonlethal war an extremely deadly tactical error in and of itself. OTOH, I will agree that the killing curse isn't something that just anyone can/should use, as canonically it requires hate (not just intent to kill like some fanfics suggest), and probably damages the soul of the caster far more than say a lethally aimed reducto. Afaik we lack confirmation on the question of magic-resistant creatures like basilisks, dragons, or nundus facing the AK too, as theoretically they may be able to ignore it or survive with just a chunk of skin/flesh blown off, which puts a big hold on arguments about using the AK for rampage control.

As for those rants, a lot of that boils down to how the little of the world we've seen looks kinda bad TBH. Maybe not /that/ bad, but definitely not perfect. Love potions being openly sold? Ludicrously laughable kangaroo courts sentencing people to death or worse with minimal deliberation or even being skipped entirely (FB&WTFT + Sirius references, respectively)? The human rights violation that is Azkaban (admittedly we don't know how Nurmengard works, for all we know that could've been built in some kind of magical dead zone or on some ancient something or other nobody knows how to reproduce making dementors a more practical if regrettable means to prevent accidental/wandless magic among prisoners)? Quill and parchment (I think I saw a fic somewhere suggest this actually had a function of imprinting and holding a magical signature of sorts from whoever did the writing, which could make this a legit anti-forgery method if true)? Rampant corruption (look at me, pot and kettle given IRL politics lol)? Systematic bigotry (seemingly worse than IRL issues)? Apparent extreme ignorance of muggle tech /by the person supposedly functioning as an expert/ (which admittedly could be an act but if so Arthur never reveals it to Harry or the reader) in an era when surveillance and instant worldwide communications are becoming more and more prevalent almost by the day and casual digital video photography is in active development and maybe a decade or so away at most (even if magic shorts it out automatically, that doesn't mean nobody will ever start to notice and get curious about dead zones)? Yeah there are issues with the wizarding world.

That all said, yeah some tropes are stupid and annoying and it's generally best to keep certain magics as off-limits regardless of intent (somehow I doubt good could come from horcruxes, but then again D&D did come up with the concept of the Baelnorn so I dunno), but sometimes I like some corny cheese if I'm in the right mood so yeah to each their own.
