i always like the sentiment “magic itself is not good or evil, it's how you use it” which is similar, but still different to what you said. like someone invented those unforgiveables & those spells themselves are evil & probably were invented solely for evil, but magic itself isn't inherently good or bad...idk! i heard something similar on bbc's merlin, but obviously their magic structure & world building is different lol.
