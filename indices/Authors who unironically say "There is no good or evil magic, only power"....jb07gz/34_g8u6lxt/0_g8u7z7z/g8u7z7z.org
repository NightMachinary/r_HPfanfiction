Yeah, but this isn't putting a label on 'magic' in fact magic is clearly differentiated between good magic and evil magic, like you said the unforgivables are bad, in particular the cruciatus curse. Which I'm not joking when I say I saw another comment suggest using it as a magical taser O.O Maybe in MACUSA...
