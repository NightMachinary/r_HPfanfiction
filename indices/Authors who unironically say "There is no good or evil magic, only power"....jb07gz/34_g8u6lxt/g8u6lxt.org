Is a gun inherently evil? Or is it the one pulling the trigger?

I agree that the Unforgivables and the Horcrux ritual are clearly dark magic, it's why they are /Unforgivable/ in the first place, and even the book named "Magics Moste Foul" warns the reader that the Horcrux is some fucked up shit. But aside from those, I can't think of a single spell mentioned in the books, movies or most fiction that is inherently evil. Some might point out the Entrail Expelling or Flaying Curses (I honestly can't remember if they where ever mentioned in the books, but it's ubiquitous in fan fiction) as prime examples of "dark magic".

But tell me, would that make your local butcher a dark wizard? After all, he would use those spells every day when rendering carcasses, the flaying spell to neatly remove the skin, and the entrail expelling curse to remove the internal organs without damaging the flesh.

Some might argue that /any/ combat oriented spell such as Stupefy, Reducto or Flippendo are dark magic, because you cast them with negative emotions, in a negative situation with the intent to cause harm or discomfort. Yet Aurors and "good" wizards use them all the time and no-one bats an eye.

Magic (for the most part) is neither dark, nor light, it merely is.
