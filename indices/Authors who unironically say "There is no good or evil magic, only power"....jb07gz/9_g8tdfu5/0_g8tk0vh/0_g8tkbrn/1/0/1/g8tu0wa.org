But there is torture and murder and even knives that are illegal. There are things that are just irredemably terrible, like a triple edged knife for example, which are rightfully banned by the Geneva convention.

And- just because some kind of torture on some kind of person is currently legal, does not mean it /should/ be legal or even that will /remain/ legal in the future. Everything that happened in nazi concentration camps was perfectly legal at the time. That didn't stop Isreal from prosecuting the perpretators years later.

The law is only ever an approximation of morality, bur it's the best approximation a society can come up with at the time and dismissing it outright as inherently flawed and disconnected from objective right and wrong is - frankly - stupid.
