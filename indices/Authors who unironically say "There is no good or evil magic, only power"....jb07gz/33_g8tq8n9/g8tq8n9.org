Expanding on what [[/u/PuzzleheadedPool1][u/PuzzleheadedPool1]] said

If you back your HP fanfiction to where there is a.. more sensible magic system behind it all (and clearly it simply isn't studied/known to the practitioners), this not only makes sense, but is almost a requirement. This usually isn't done with "the spell isn't evil", but more of "blood magic isn't evil, just all of its users/known applications" or something.

The problem is that doing the above is *really* hard in a fanfic so it usually falls flat.

The other option, which is basically 'there is no logic to magic' and lots of 'rule of cool', then yea, it makes little sense to say there is no evil magic, since, you know.....
