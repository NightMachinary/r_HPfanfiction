Well if you look at the concept of the killing curse its strange. Draco couldn't cast it at all but we are met to believe you can cast it when you are under the imperious curse. Auror's were allow to cast the curses during the first war. Here's my question a psychopath who tortures victims to a near vegative state or the equivalent of wizard hitler does wanting them dead make you a bad person.
