In their defence, one may note that the unforgivables are justifiable if it is to save a life or for just retribution. For example, an imperius can be used to stop somebody from committing suicide by jumping off the cliff and the killing Curse for self-defence or for euthanasia if the caster is willing to kill. The cruciatus on the other hand, can be used for just retribution as when Harry tried to crucio Bellatrix after she killed Sirius to avenge his godfather and it will be idiotic and unfair to Sirius if Bellatrix isn't properly tortured. By her deeds, Bellatrix has shown scant regard for the law and therefore she merits no protection under the law.
