I generally dislike the idea that Magic itself has any sort of morality built into it, or at the least, if it does have morality that it would give any sort of a shit about human morality.

Thus I think magic isn't inherently evil, it's what's done with it that can be.

As mentioned by most others, I can easily see the unforgivable's having more benign or practical origins (whether or not those origins are actually practical or even feasible doesn't matter much to me as I'm willing to suspend my disbelief for magic). For example, I've seen in a couple of fic the killing curse originally being created as a humane and bloodless method of killing livestock. It only became an unforgivable after it was perverted by some magicals into the killing curse we're familiar with.

The important thing is not the magic itself but the user of said magic. Are there evil magics? Of course there are. But that's not because magic itself has deemed them to be evil, it's because evil magicals /made/ them to be evil.
