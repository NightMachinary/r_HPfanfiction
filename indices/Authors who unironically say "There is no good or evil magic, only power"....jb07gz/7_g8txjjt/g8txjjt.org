I think fics like this are probably mostly down to three things:

1. The popularity of moral relativism among fanfic writers. The idea that something could be inherently good or evil is seen as old fashioned, prejudiced, etc. I think a lot of this is probably due to a backlash against "traditional Christian values" and imperialism- morality has come to be seen as a tool to oppress other viewpoints, cultures, sexual orientations, etc.
2. Some of it is also probably just writers trying to show how "edgy" they are.
3. Most SI fics are probably written as, essentially, power fantasies on the part of the author, and having to worry about whether an action is right or wrong gets in the way of the fantasy.
