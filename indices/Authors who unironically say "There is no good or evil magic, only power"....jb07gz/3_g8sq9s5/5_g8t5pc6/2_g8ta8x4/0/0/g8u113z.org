AFAIK Rowling never got into specifics of the killing curse mechanics.. The appeal of the curse is that it's supposedly painless and doesn't leave any marks anywhere..

You also have to bear in mind that for people who have solved just about every other problem they've come across using magic, it probably seems reasonable compared to severing flesh or otherwise harming the body like some kind of barbarian..
