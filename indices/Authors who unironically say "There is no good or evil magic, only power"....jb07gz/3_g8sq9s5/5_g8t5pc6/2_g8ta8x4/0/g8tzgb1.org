If we go by the theory that the killing curse dislodges the soul, my D&D logic tells me it's a necromancy tag we're working with (given so is /raise dead/, but jesus wasn't a zombie so we love that one). Like, couldn't you make a heart-stopping, spine-severing or gently-asphyxiating curse instead?

That's what I meant by directly. The body needs a lot of things to keep living and denying one of /them/ to euthanize a anasthezised (stunned? potioned?) patient just seems like less of an affront to magic and human decency to me in general.

Is the soul-dislodging thing fanon, btw? my muddled memory recalls mostly talking about the killing curse giving no clear cause of death in the eyes of muggle investigators.
