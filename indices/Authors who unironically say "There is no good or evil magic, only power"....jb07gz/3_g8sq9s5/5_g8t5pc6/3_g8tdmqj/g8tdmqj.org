  It's /not that hard/ to kill a patient painlessly in their sleep. Why must you use your magic to do it so directly?

Because if you are considering it, it means that all other means and resources are tied up in healing/stasis effects.

I mean, with Draught of Living Death and human transfiguration both being a thing, if there is no shortage of potions AND personnel skilled at precise applications of magic, euthanasia would be almost absent, because short of some seriously dark magic, you can pause the patient and spend days, months or even years finding the solution.

KK would, theoretically, be a way to end a life with minmum of focus, no interference, and no time wasted. Not that I believe it likely, just playing devil's advocate.
