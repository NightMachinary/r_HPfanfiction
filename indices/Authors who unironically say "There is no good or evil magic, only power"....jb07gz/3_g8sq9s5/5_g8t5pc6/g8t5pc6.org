  Killing Curse- Used by Healers to grant a painless, humane death to people who cannot survive
#+end_quote

That's crazy. I can't really imagine the kind of /healer/ that decides they need a swift and perfect way to perform euthanasia.

1) I don't believe most doctors are crazy about euthanasia in general

2) It's /not that hard/ to kill a patient painlessly in their sleep. Why must you use your magic to do it so directly?
