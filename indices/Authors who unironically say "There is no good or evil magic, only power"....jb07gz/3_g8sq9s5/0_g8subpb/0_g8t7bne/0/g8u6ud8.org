I imagine the unforgivables originating from corruptions of spells that weren't meant for harm. Spells can be created and modified.

Like the one about cruciatus being originally intended to start a stopped heart -- perhaps someone took a medical spell that did something along those lines, and experimented with it like a sick, maniacal doctor. Tested it on patients (victims), tweaking it and twisted it to make it cause intense pain, and pushed it so far through hatred and willpower that the abomination of a spell that it resulted in requires the hatred and intent, and that corrupted version is what became known as the cruciatus.
