See, this is fine if you remove the need for negative emotions. If you don't, yeah, right. :) I think I read this fic, and they did say negative emotions weren't needed.

I'm honestly fine with the idea of most "dark" magic not being inherently evil, outside obvious cases. It makes sense to me that the Ministry, as corrupt and lazy as it was, would simply declare something Dark if they didn't want to deal with it or it impinged on someone.

Moral relativism... no.
