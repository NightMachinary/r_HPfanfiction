I feel that the original story is flawed in a way that made the world building a lot more... child friendly(? I guess) That magic that could literally warp space and time is just made a lot more stupid. Like Hermione being the "brightest witch of her generation"? Bitch please, it's just that the "wizarding world" is made purposely stupid, the only magic she actually uses are the ones taught it school. Another thing is Voldemort having traveled and learned magic and is just written to be some dude spamming AKs. Death Eaters be using curses and spells aimed to kill and the rest use stunners and disarmers? Oh sure like you haven't introduced spells to wake someone up or shield spells. With Harry being if not physically then emotionally abused and still end up just like a regular kid that should not have been able to been someone better trained and DECADES older, much less Voldemort "Equal to Dumbledore". End point Magic was severely underplayed, characters unrealistic and story filled with plot holes. If nothing else it provided a very vast and flexible magic system and a setting for other writers to pick up and make a fan iteration of.
