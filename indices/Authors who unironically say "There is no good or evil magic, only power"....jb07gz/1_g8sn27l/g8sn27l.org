Well a wise man once said that "If we do not learn from the mistakes of the past, we are doomed to repeat them" and then another wise man said that in order to truly understand history you have to view from the eyes of the perpetrators because otherwise you just compartmentalize it(or I guess identify as the victim). I think that one of the reasons why certain people write and think and speak in such a way, like your example is because for them it is abstract. Maybe it's a self insert but not in the turest sense because they don't make it real, they keep it abstract.

It would actually be a very interesting read of a self insert when someones then has to actually struggle with the moral ramafacation if his new powers. Where does on draw the line? Your kid is grumpy? Why not a cheering charm? Everyone does it! Hey LovePotions seem to somewhat legal. Soo there is that super cute girl....I mean everyone is doing it soo no big deal right?

You are suddendly in this world and you know that certain people will do terrible things. Wouldn't it be morraly right to dispose of them? But how to be certain that they are really guilty and where does guilty start.

History describes you and it not all that comfortable to read history as if it were you doing these things but thats the best way to learn, to understand.
