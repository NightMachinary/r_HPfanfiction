Like magic kind of lets people create their own spells so there is no good or evil magic, it literally is only Power and what you do with it. You can make spells that are just torture just like IRL you could create bombs and use them from household items. Dark magic is defined in a separate category from the unforgivable and the description of what dark magic is in the series is broad enough that spells which probably exist or existed at some point would have literal mundane uses which could be used for great evil with just a little effort. There are a lot of troupes that are genuinely terrible both logically and in how often they come up, I'd suggest getting up in arms over them rather than something that at least has some reason for existing.
