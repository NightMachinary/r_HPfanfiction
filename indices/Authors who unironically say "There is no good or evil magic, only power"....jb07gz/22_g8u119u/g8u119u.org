It depends on how you classify Dark Magic, the Unforgivables, sure, because they require hatred and bad intentions.

Cutting curse? Blasting Curse? Ritual Magic? That depends on how you use it.

It depends on assembling an actual Magical System, and adding more things than just three evil spells and the others beings mostly Neutral ones.
