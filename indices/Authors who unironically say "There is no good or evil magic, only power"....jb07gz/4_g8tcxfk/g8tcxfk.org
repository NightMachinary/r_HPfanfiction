I've commented already with a comment about the stupidity of many authors' mechanics of the cruciatus curse.

But to provide my own thoughts on the ethical discussion in many comments:

1. Both sides are taking incredibly reductionist approaches to the issue

   1. On one hand, you have "Harry's torture of Bellatrix was good." No, no it wasn't. Torture is never okay. For those who say that torture is fine in a situation where lives hand in the balance, remember that torture simply does not work. Which we know from actually torturing people.
   2. On the other hand, you have "nothing's okay if it's not legal." Great, tell that to the civil rights movements in the 1960s in the US. Tell that to the people who smuggled Jews out of Nazi Germany. Not all laws are ethical. Not everything unethical is illegal.

2. I do also think the context of spells matters as well. I don't think anything can really be reduced to "good" or "evil". Using the killing curse on an animal about to kill you is not an evil action by any means. Nor would I consider it good. That said, it's hard to justify the imperius when confundment exists for the situations given as examples (stopping suicide). Why use the imperius when you can just confund them?
3. Many, many people here need to review the unforgivables. For example, see how the cruciatus is, in fact, blockable in HBP. The issue of the intent behind them is not as clear-cut as many people make it out to be (See Deathly Hallows, GoF, and OoTP).
