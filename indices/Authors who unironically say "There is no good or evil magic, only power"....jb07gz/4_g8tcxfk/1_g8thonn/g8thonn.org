that torture doesnt work is not true it doesnt work alone and must be either used on multiple people who are keept apart from each other or far more effectiv as a tool to psychologically weaken another person and the whole thing has something to do with negativ reinforcement so it is false to say torture doesnt work at all. however the torture curse has no otver use besides torture.

but that is not all that is meant with dark magic is it?
