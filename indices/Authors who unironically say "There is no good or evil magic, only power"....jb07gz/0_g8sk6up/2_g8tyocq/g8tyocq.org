I could imagine that it originated as a medical spell, easily. You can look at the history of actual medicine irl and know that those doctors desired to cause to cause their patients pain and harm.

Edit: I'm not saying it /worked/ as a medical spell or that it was good practice. But if someone was paralyzed, the doctor cast the cruciatus and got a reaction, and pointed to that as proof they were 'helping'- well, that sounds a lot like the kind of snake oil us muggles have dealt with in centuries past
