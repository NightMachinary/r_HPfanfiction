My thinking is that most spellcrafters would have an effect or result in mind from the word go, and then figure out how to get there and how to power it.. Thusly ending up having to channel some disturbing emotions to get where they wanted.. Rather than starting with an emotion and seeing what effect you get in the end..

I can also easily see people not knowing better if you roll the clock back a few hundred years or so..

Much like how stuff like arsenic was used in medication 100-200 years ago but is looked at abhorrently now..
