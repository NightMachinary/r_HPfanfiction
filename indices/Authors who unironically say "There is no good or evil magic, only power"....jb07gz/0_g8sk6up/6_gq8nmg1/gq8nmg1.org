Maybe having magic accelerates healing (this is why Quidditch players aren't all dead yet), but some dark spells damage the map of what counts as part of the body and gets to be rapidly healed. So what you do about that? You force every nerve ending to send a brief "I exist" message to the CNS, with the details of the message decided by the caster's intent, so that a person's magic can intercept those messages and rebuild a map of where the body is and isn't. The problem arises when dark wizards use this specialized medical spell on healthy people, with the intent to cause as much harm as possible.
