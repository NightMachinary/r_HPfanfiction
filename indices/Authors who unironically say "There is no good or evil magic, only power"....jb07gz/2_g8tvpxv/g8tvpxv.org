The way I understood it, "Spells" in the Harry Potter universe are used to standardize the will of the wizards. During their childhood, Witches and Wizards use "Accidental Magic", but their effect are unpredictable. A child who "wants" the cookie jar may summon it to his hands, just like he could teleport right next to it. So spell are learnt and used to "control" their power.

Because of this understanding, I always liked to compare the "Spell" used in Harry Potter to tools. Just like Muggle created specialized tools for each different tasks, Wizard created Spells. And in the middle of all these Spells, the "Dark Arts" are the weapons of the wizards, created to fight, hurt and kill.

Basically, "Light" spells are the spoons and forks of the Magical World, while "Dark" spells are the swords, spears, and axes. Technically, someone could use a Light Spell to hurt someone, like someone could use a spoon as a murder weapon; and someone could use the Dark Art to do something harmless, just like someone could use a sword to cut a load of bread. But it doesn't change the fact that each spell was created with an intent, using the Sectusempra to cut paper doesn't change the fact that it was created in the intent to cut "enemies".

I agree with the idea that Magic is not Dark in essence, but it doesn't change the fact that anyone using the Dark Art is Dark himself.
