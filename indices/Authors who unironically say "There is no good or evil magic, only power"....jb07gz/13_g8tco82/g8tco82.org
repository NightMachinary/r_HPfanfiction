Well, it depends how you define 'magic'.

a) a group of abilities, spells, of various effects = you can make a clear division based on costs, effects and casting requirements of given spell. Trying to argue otherwise is.... Well, not necessarily stupid, but certainly pointless.

b) a mysterious type of energy that interacts with reality in interesting ways and can be directly manipulated by a fraction of the planet's biosphere, including some humans = it can't be good, evil, or antything in between. It simply is. You can only judge uses of it (spells) and its users (the wizards).
