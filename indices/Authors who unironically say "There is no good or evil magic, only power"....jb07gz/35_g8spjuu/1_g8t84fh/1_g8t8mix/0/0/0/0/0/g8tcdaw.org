  they are still used for good purposes in the original series. Harry... uses the Cruciatus to defend McGonagall's honor

You say that Harry using the Cruciatus to defend McGonagall's honour was for a "good purpose". You are saying that Harry had a good reason to use the Cruciatus. I could have worded my opinion better, I agree, so here it is again- I don't think that Carrow insulting McGonagall is a good reason to use the Cruciatus. I think that Harry's actions were morally wrong.
