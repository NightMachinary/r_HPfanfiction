Alright, then don't be a hypocrite. If you are allowed to give your opinion, then I'm allowed to give mine. /I/ wasn't rude to you. I simply said that I don't believe that Harry casting the Cruciatus to "defend McGonagall's honour" was a good thing. Our argument was not at all about what you took out from the books. I'm not denying that Harry used Crucio. I am not getting angry. You got angry and said you didn't care what my opinion was because Harry Potter is a work of fiction, which, quite frankly, is rather strange to hear from someone on a HP sub, and was not at all what we were talking about.
