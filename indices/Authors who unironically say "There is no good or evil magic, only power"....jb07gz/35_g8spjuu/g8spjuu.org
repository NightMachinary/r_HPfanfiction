As far as this: linkffn(12418957).

Also with regards to the Unforgivable Curses, they are inherently evil. That's why they are called "Unforgivable" but they are still used for good purposes in the original series. Harry uses Imperius to get Voldemort's Horcrux, uses the Cruciatus to defend McGonagall's honor and Snape uses the killing curse to put Dumbledore out of his misery and save Draco's soul.

I think the original idea was that Voldemort was justifying his actions through that statement but as the book started to orient itself more towards more mature audience, it would also imply that the use of dark spells was subjective and dark magic was not evil in itself but the purpose for which it was used determined that.
