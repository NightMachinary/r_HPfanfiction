I fully agree. You hit a point right there:

Think about it, what way of dying can grant a painless death? Like the Avada Kedavra is said to give? What if there was a chronic incurable disease? Do you use the Killing Curse to put the patient out of their misery with their consent? Or stubbornly refusing to do so?

While the Unforgivables are called Unforgivables for a reason, i.e requiring you to actually desire to cause pain, the use of the Unforgivables may sometimes be subjective.
