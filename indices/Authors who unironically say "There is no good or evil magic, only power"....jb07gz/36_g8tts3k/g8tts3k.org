Why are we having this discussion again? Its FAN-FICTION!!! A exploration of possibility's and what ifs. Nothing is wrong with using older tropes, doing a spin one that old one, or a new trope in a series. If you want the canon story read the books over again.

There is a LOT of things authors do that are a lot more egregious out there, other then redoing the origins of a spell. (cant talk about them here, R.8 or the like)

Because if the 3U are the worst spells imaginable, there is a reason for magic users to fear the muggles, there lot that you can do to a person, to hurt, to kill, and to control without magic.

There is a time and place for torture, someone your planing to kill anyway and want them to suffer more then death could do or to punish a person quickly. Why are so many people soft skinned nowadays, letting crimes go unpunished properly because somehow we are better people now with technology and such. (Its mostly a western thing) ...Or you know they are in to that kind of thing, don't kink shame the masochist (it only encouraging bad behavior).

A story can have nice Goblins or worse Goblins, how much interaction did we have in canon to really decided what they could act fully or what they are fully capable of. There was WARs between Wizards and Goblins, they have to be able to do magics and stuff somehow.

It can have buildings in trunks, there is a premise for it in canon. Expanded trunks and Tents.

Again its this is Fan-Fiction.

...Fan-Fiction of a Story that's world building is still Swiss-Cheese, with post books work done through other means. Don't hold yourself back by the imagination of a Author.
