It would be really useful to teach someone complex motor skills. It's just like guiding someone's hands with your own when they're learning to play piano, except more precise and the learner doesn't have to experience skin-to-skin contact if they don't want to. Also, when someone gets themselves into an unpleasant situation and then panics, someone who knows how to handle it could imperius them with directions of how to get to safety. Like if a small child accidentally locks themselves in a room and is too panicked to figure out how to unlock it again, and the door is designed to resist unlocking charms, a parent could imperius the child to unlock the door.
