It's just an issue of moral relativism versus moral absolutism. Is killing a person always a bad thing regardless of context or circumstances, or is killing sometimes okay under particular circumstances?

I can't think of a legitimate use for the cruciatus curse as it's presented in canon, but otherwise, I think that every 'dark' curse we come across has a potential moral or amoral application within a moral relativist framework. Something like the imperius curse could be very helpful for quick and dirty anesthesia in an emergency, which is a moral thing within a moral relativist framework, but is an unforgivable thing in a moral absolutist framework.

Considering there seems to be only one purely awful spell that everyone can think of, a moral relativist could absolutely unironically say 'there's no such thing as good and evil magic' while still being reasonable within their own moral framework.
