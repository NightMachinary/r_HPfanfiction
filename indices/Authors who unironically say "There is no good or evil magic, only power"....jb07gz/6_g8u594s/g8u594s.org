The cruciatus curse could be used as a magic taser. If dark spells are more powerful and you needed something to get through an opponent's shield, a quick crucio could do the job. It's hardly ethical, but not that much worse than a deep cutting curse?

AK sounds quick, clean and painless. Definitely preferable to the dementor's kiss.

Imperio could be used for any number of things and is obviously a violation. But so is obliviate, and that's government policy to use on innocent muggles.

I think there would be some spells in the HP universe that cannot possibly be justified under any circumstances.
