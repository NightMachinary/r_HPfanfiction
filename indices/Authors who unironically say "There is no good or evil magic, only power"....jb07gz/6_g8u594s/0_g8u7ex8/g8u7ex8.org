It's my reading of canon that what makes the unforgivables so unforgivable is that they have an emotional components to them. We know that you have to "really mean" them, but what does that mean?

In my mind, it means that you have to want to torture, no, you have to know deep in your heart that those you use the cruciatus on aren't worthy of anything /except/ torture. That the person you kill with avada kedavra life was so utterly meaningless that killing them isn't even on the scale of consideration when it comes to whether you have the right to kill them or not.

Killing someone is bad. Being able to have the mindset that allows you to kill them with the killing curse? That's unforgivable.
