In canon characters end up being either forced into using these spells by circumstance (Snape-AK), using them for a greater cause (Hermione- Imperio) or using them in a moment of emotional upheaval (Harry- Crucio). I imagine even the most ethical people have a moment of weakness every now and then where they slip into blind rage- and a magical duel to the death with one's mortal enemy would certainly qualify. Perhaps this person is even capable of manipulating their own emotional states to use the magic they need. Either way, from a strict utilitarian standpoint, motive is meaningless. Does it really matter if someone's totally rotten on the inside if their actions are good/neutral?
