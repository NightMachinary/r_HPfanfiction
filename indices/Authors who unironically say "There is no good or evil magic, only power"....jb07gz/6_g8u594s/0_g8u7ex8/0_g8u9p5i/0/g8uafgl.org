  Does it really matter if someone's totally rotten on the inside if their actions are good/neutral?

Short answer: Yes.

There's a reason why the military likes to drum out psychopaths, even if they are great in combat.

Sure, /today/ they might be pointed in the "right" direction, but when their core personality is the magnitude of the pointing rather than the direction of the pointing? They're dangerously unpredictable.
