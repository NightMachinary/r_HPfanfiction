I firmly believe that we haven't had world war 3 because of the deterrence effect of nukes; otherwise, I believe Russia and the US would have had a war in the 60s or 70s. People's fear of what potential horrible chemical weapons the other side had is also why no one used chemical weapons in World War 2 unlike the first.
