I'm going to say one thing and then back out. Downvote me to hell if you want, I'm not going to respond to any replies this comment gets, BUT...

Regardless of what you think construes proper retribution, things can look very different both in the heat of the moment and/or if there are strong emotions tied to the action. If someone deliberately murdered your beloved mother right in front of you, you likely wouldn't have a calm and collected reaction, rather attempt to get retribution. It's all well and good to sit here emotionally detached and rationally thinking and condemn the actions and thoughts of others, but at least in the example of Harry casting the crucio at Bellatrix /moments after she murdered his godfather in front of him,/ it's a foreigner conclusion that unless he was sociopathic, which I don't think JKR has retconned yet, he would /not/ be in a stable emotional state /or/ thinking clearly.

I would like to clarify in this that I am using the general â€˜you' rather than the second person singular form so that you (2nd, s.) don't think I'm attacking you specifically.
