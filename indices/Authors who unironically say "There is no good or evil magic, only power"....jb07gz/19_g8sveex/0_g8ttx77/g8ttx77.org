  threatening to use it hopefully scares most criminals from using it too.

If you actually feel the need to use the Cruciatus and are willing to do it then you probably don't care anymore about what horrible things might happen to you when you get caught - you're either already too far gone or you completely believe that you won't get caught. The threat of the authorities using it on you will not stop you. Ignoring that the authorities in the HP world /don't/ use the Cruciatus or /any/ unforgivables, they send you to Azkaban instead which is worse.
