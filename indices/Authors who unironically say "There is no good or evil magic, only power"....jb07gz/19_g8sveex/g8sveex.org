I'm going to make the assertion that Rictumsempra can be a far worse torture spell than Cruciatus. At least the ancient Romans thought tickling someone to death was a lot worse than Crucification. But do you know what the worst form of torture is? Muggle torture, such as a dentist drill, followed by healing spell so you can torture them day after day, night after night!

Avada Kedavra is very humane when it comes to killing, at least far more so than beating someone to death with a Muggle golf club.

Imperio is great for preventing someone hurting or killing themselves or others. Maybe it was the Wizards who prevented Muggles from launching their nukes in 1962 or 1983?

*Intentions*, not the means, matter far more. Same with nuclear and other weapons: you need deterrence to keep the peace and prosperity.

As for how to prevent you from abusing the power, the answer lies in the balance of power, because the other side is not stupid.

The Unforgivables exist as they are, and as nasty as the Cruciatus is, threatening to use it hopefully scares most criminals from using it too.
