No mention of linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) yet? I'll throw that in, then.

Sirius accidentally escapes from Azkaban five years early, but doesn't have any leads on Peter, so he instead comes to check on eight-year-old Harry, and finds him unhappy, so offers him another home - while the Wizarding world is in an uproar, assuming he's kidnapped Harry to bring him to Voldemort. I like it because it's focused on the people, not on any secret Black family magic or politics. It's about Harry getting a parental figure and a childhood, Remus getting caught up in the search and meeting Tonks much earlier than canon, Harry and Hermione being at the same primary school without knowing that the other is magical.

Books 1-4 are complete, with 1 being pre-Hogwarts and each book after that covering a year. Book 5 is in progress. Recent chapters have been getting a bit dark; Voldemort is a nasty evil little monster-baby.
