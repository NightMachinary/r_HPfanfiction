Great! And yes there are two universes in the fic, but I'm not going to spoil what's supposed to happen in the rest of the fanfic haha

I'm surprised gen fics are your favourites! Lots of people are put off by gen fics unfortunately and they bypass fics like mine.\\
I am cross-posting, but I usually just link ao3 bc it's sort of annoying to link both sites. And promoting through ao3 is a little easier, they have a feature that connects ao3 to tumble!
