Premise sounds interesting, I like dimensional travel type stuff, which is I assume what happens from the summary, so I'll give it a read. And gen fics are my favorites.

Not sure if you are cross posting or not, but the premise sounds like it might appeal to FFN readers moreso than AO3 ones. Though I figure at this point most readers probably use both sites.
