  And that's assuming Dumbledore isn't a conniving manipulative SOB primarily interested at this point in keeping Harry away from his godfather. My reading of canon suggests otherwise.

lol

the reasoning used in this fic. is wonky. at no point that we're supposed to believe snape is in the shack did remus even mention that peter's animagus was a rat, or that he was scabbers. if snape thought remus was helping sirius, why would he bring him wolfsbane, which would make him into a conscious werewolf aid to a murderer? or, you know, he just rushed off. he only heard that they became animagi, and that's how sirius got into the castle- which would convince him even more that he was right

  And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it... so, in a way, Snape's been right about me all along.‚Äù

is what he heard. he also obviously assumed that they're lying to manipulate the trio. 'my friend is a rat who framed me for murder' is pretty easy to dismiss
