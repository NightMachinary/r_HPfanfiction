If anything, I would see Snape being more angry at Black because they shouldn't have switched secret keepers in the first place.

With Fudge, the only thing that might change is the prophet starting to dislike Dumbledore early on if Dumbledore decided to say that Black is innocent. Snape would likely end up siding with him, which could lead to problems with Malfoy, ect.
