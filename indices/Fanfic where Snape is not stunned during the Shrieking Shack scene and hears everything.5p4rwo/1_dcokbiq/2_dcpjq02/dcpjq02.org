Um, the life debt was canon. Sirius deliberately trying to kill Snape is strongly implied, but not certain, I think. (I believe Snape already suspected Remus, so he should have known better than to fall for it.) But pureblood politics in general is mostly fanon. Dumbledore covered up the incident because it would have gotten Remus (who was innocent) expelled or worse, not because he favored Sirius.

Snape wanted Sirius dead because Sirius tried to kill him, and he thought Sirius was the traitor. Snape also tried to kill Remus, with premeditation, by leaving the Wolfsbane Potion at the castle. He doesn't like Remus in general, but I suspect his immediate motive was seeing the Marauder's Map and thinking Remus and Sirius were colluding.

If Snape had been restrained and still conscious, he would have seen Pettigrew alive and heard a plausible story about switching Secret Keepers. Snape hated Sirius so much that he might well have believed Pettigrew over him, or he might have gone after all three of them.

Fudge does believe in Dumbledore, but only when it's politically expedient. Snape probably couldn't convince him that Sirius was innocent if he wanted to, but he probably could have made breaking Sirius out easier.
