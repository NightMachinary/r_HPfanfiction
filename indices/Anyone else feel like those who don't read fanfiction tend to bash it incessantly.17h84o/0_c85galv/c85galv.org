People tend to criticize any subgroup they don't really have serious exposure to.

There's some pretty awesome fanfic out there. However, if you go looking, it's not hard to find some that's utter dreck.

What's important is that YOU enjoy reading what you're reading. People who want to bash it don't have to read it if they don't want to. Just ignore 'em.
