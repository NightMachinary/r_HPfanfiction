I think the thing, in general, is that fanfiction communities can support or even engender bad writing habits. Basically, people read the fanfic and like it, so they say so. Fair enough. An author gets enough of those and he or she may be unwilling to listen to any criticism, because it's the odd voice out that's saying anything bad. I have seen this happen a few times. So for people who read fiction and fanfiction, there /can/ seem to be a gap in writing skill.

But that's really just Sturgeon's law in action. Most of any group of writing is bad. I think that's just the particular reason for the most common forms of bad writing in fanfiction.
