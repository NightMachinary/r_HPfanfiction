I'm a huge fan (in general) of people willing to take on the challenge of fanfiction, which is a whole different ball game than writing one's own fiction.

But even I'm guilty of being less than appreciative (to put it kindly) of fanfics I don't think are up to snuff...

edit - I guess what I'm trying to say is that there's a difference between GOOD fanfiction and BAD fanfiction. I don't excuse bashing of the first, but I can at least see where the posts are coming from when it's poorly written in some way.
