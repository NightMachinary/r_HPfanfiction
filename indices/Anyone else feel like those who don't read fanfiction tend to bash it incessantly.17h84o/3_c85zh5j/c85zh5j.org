I second (or third) that even if people give it a try, it is more likely than not they stumble into really..REALLY bad fanfiction, either poorly written, Harry/Draco Slash (with no buildup, just all of a sudden "Draco, its obvious that the tension beween us is sexual! Now take me you beautiful twink!") or both.

Even the good pairings can be done very badly, not to mention for every good HP Fic, there are several bad Twilight or My Chemical Romance fics.

Ladies and Gentlemen, its time to put the GOOD stuff you read into perspective, and be sure to review for the authors who don't suck so that maybe they will continue writing.
