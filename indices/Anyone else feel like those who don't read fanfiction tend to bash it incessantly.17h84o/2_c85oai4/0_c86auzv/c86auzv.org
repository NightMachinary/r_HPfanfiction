Exactly. I tend to get frustrated with these people because there are books out there that are literally giant best selling fanfiction. Take the book Scarlett which is widely accepted as the sequel to Gone With the Wind. Its a best seller and has movies and tv shows made off of it. Of course there are fanfictions like 50 Shades of Gray as well but there are some talented writers out there who can truly capture a character.
