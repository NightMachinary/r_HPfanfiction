I used to be embarrassed that I read fanfiction, like it was this awful dirty secret. Now I've stopped caring, my friends all know and make fun of me (in a nice way), and I make fun of myself, because sometimes it can be pretty silly.

But those who refuse to give it a try, or who mock it without even knowing what they're mocking, are just close-minded. There are some truly excellent authors out there. Not that anyone is obligated to enjoy reading fanfiction themselves, obviously, I couldn't care less if you do or don't -- just don't bash what you don't understand.
