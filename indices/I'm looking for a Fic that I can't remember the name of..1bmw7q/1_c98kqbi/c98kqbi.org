I'm looking around, but looks like we could use a little more help :)

Is Harry the main character? Is it first or third person? Are there any pairings?

Do you remember when you read this? Do you know what site you read it on? Was it popular/did it have a lot of reviews? Did the author write author's notes?

Was there ever an attack on Godric's Hollow? Was Voldemort defeated? Were James and Lily abusive towards Harry? Is the brother Harry's twin, or is he older/younger? Did the brother have a unique name? Do the brothers get along? Did Sirius adopt Harry? Is Sirius friendly with James and Lily? Are Ron and Hermione around? What about Draco? Is Harry in Gryffindor? Is the BWL in Gryffindor? Did canon events still happen (sorcerer's stone, reopening of the chamber of secrets, etc.)? Can you remember any events that occurred before/after Harry kills James (ex: was Harry a certain age? did it take place during a school year or over the summer? was it during the 5th year events at the DoM -- with the prophecy and whatnot? was it at the end of the story?)?

Does the story span all 7 years? About how long is the story? How many chapters are there?

Anything you can give is useful!
