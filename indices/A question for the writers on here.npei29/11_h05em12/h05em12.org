Once I come up with an idea, I then start brainstorming some of the big plot points, themes, and character relationships so that I generally know what I want to do with the story.

Then I start writing.

I'm not one to do a huge outline or meticulously plan things out-- some of the most fun time I spend writing is when the characters start surprising me with ideas that I didn't plan when I sat down at my computer.

I'm sure some people might criticize my way of doing things, but it works for me.
