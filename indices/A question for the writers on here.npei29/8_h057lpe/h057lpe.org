I usually have ideas at really inconvenient times- at 2 am when I'm in bed, at work, in class- I grab my phone and write it down. Then when I have time, put it in a word doc titled: /HP Prompts I'll Never Write,/ then spend the next hour brainstorming.

It will stay there and rattle around in my brain for the next month while I slowly expand an outline. I'll write key emotional moments (because those are easier), and then upload it.

The most valuable part (I've found) is figuring out how your character thinks. For example, in my TMR fic I've got pages that go:

- Tom's relationship with magic: /(insert pages of rambling)/
- Tom's relationship with Mrs. Cole
- Tom's relationship with physical touch
- Tom's relationship with money
- Tom's relationship with his idealized father

If I can't think like my characters I can't write them. I only do that for characters like TMR because we don't get a strong sense of his character in canon. With Harry, Ron, or Hermione- I know how they feel, and don't have to think much about it. But with Ginny? I'd need to write that shit down.
