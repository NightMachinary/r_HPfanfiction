I usually have a pretty good idea of where I want to end up and a few specific scenes that 'stick out' but often I find myself doing quite a lot of fluid re-writing to get it how I want it.

For my current AU fic in part one it pretty much happened in parallel to canon so I only alluded to book events on the edges of it. Part 2 is seeing a real change in how stuff went down so that is taking more thought.
