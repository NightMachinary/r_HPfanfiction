It usually starts with an idea, often from the middle of the story, and then I start constructing plot backwards and forwards so that it makes (in-world) logical sense. I.e., getting rid of all the "why didn't he just ..." moments you know as a reader. That's always a sign of bad planning. It's basically a puzzle where you create your own parts -- I have character X in situation Y, but he's currently in situation Z, now how can I get him from Z to Y while keeping in mind aspects A and B, which I need at a later time for character C etc.

Like that, the whole of the story is constructed, until every single scene is a bullet point or twenty. Half of it in my head, half in actual docs. In the process of doing this, I notice things that don't work out, things that I don't like after all, I get better ideas, I shift plot around etc.

And once all that's done, the story is finished, and the only thing I need to do is to write it. I pick the scene that appeals to me the most, and start writing it. That's one of the things I appreciate with this approach, because all pieces of the puzzle fit, I can write in whatever order. Usually, I jump around in the story like crazy.

Keep in mind though that this is super-individualistic. Everyone has to figure out their own approach. I couldn't write a single word without a plan, because I wouldn't know /what/ to write. And for other people, it's exactly the reverse.
