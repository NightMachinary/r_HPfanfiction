Once I've mulled the idea around in my head for a bit I write a coupla sentences for the first and last chapter, then fill in the blank in between, again just a couple of sentences per chapter, that process tends to find glaring plot holes but also helps me figure out where the chapter boundaries are.

If any chapter requires some research then I flesh out those chapters first, then flesh out the rest, then rewrite the whole lot because it's inevitably a pile of incoherent crap.
