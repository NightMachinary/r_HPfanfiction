It depends what kind of story I'm writing. In general though, I tend to write character-driven stories so I have a loose idea of certain plot points I want the story to hit. I write down an outline a chapter or two in advance with the ending in mind.

As more characters become involved, I keep a separate doc of everyone's motivations and impending story points. I edit it as I move through the story and weave it into my outlines.

If there's a central mystery to the story, I write down the answer to it as a reference guide. I end up expanding this doc to include backstory, since there's usually a lot of overlap.

This method seems to work whether I'm writing something short or long (I definitely tend toward long). The longer the work, the more concentration is required to keep everything consistent.

I'm gearing up to start the final part of a series that's already running at ~775k words, and I find myself taking longer breaks between parts to refresh myself on the past material and prepare for the next leg of the road. Especially now that I'm writing the end, I want to make sure I give the readers closure on everything as well as stick the landing.
