Write the summary in three word lines. Don't bother with grammar. It should be around thirty words total, but anything between 21 and 60 is fine. This is an OUTLINE.

--------------

Example:

Bob lives orphanage Bob run away Bob meet Timmy Bob not trust Bob Timmy argue antogonist Ben appear Ben fight Bob Timmy help Bob Timmy and Bob Bob like Timmy They win fight

--------------

Now, read through a few times, and make any little changes.

--------------

Bob lives orphanage Ben threaten Bon Bob run away Bob meet Timmy Bob is wary Timmy is angsty Bob cry, haha antogonist Ben re-appear Ben fight Bob Timmy help Bob Timmy and Bob Bob like Timmy They win fight

Start writing little bits of the story, not necessarily in detail, just as it comes. If you feel like you won't use a part, save it to the end of your Google doc, or whatever anyway. Also, writing basic personality traits out for characters, ie. sarcastic, girly, immature helps. After you got all that, you might wanna write a blurb that's less than a page long just to see if it all makes sense. If yes, continue writing your story. If not, go back to your three word thing.

Also, use Harry Potter stuff for this. Y'know...

Harry lives orphanage Tibby (OC) threaten Harry Harry run away Harry meet Ron Harry is wary Ron is angsty Harry cry, haha antogonist Tibby re-appear Tibby fight Harry Ron help Harry Ron and Harry Harry like Ron They win fight it

I kind of just used Ben-Timmy-Bob as a general formula. Also no, i don't mean use this is your plot. This is an EXAMPLE. I mean, you could use this as a ploy bunny or whatever, but i don't suggest it. So yeah. Hope that helped.
