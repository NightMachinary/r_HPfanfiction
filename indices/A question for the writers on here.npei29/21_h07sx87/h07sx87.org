I write the bits which are living in my head in my notebook. Most of these will not make it into the story, but it anchors /what I found exciting/ about the idea in the first place.

Then I write from the beginning. I've found recently that starting a new document for each scene is really helpful, because it's easier to scroll up and down in it. I also tend to insert more scenes earlier on after I've written awhile, but I find that if I write out of order for the "actual draft", I end up explaining the backstory over and over, because I don't want to forget to put it in.
