Okay, so here's my creative process

1) Have an idea

2) Keep that idea in the back of your mind for around a month, continually tweaking and developing it.

3) When that idea is ready, start writing. You'll know when it's time.

4) Work on the first several chapters until you have a good grasp of the characters and how they act. With that in mind, try to figure out what direction your story is going and how it will end.

5) With that knowledge in mind, keep writing. Be prepared for unexpected twists, as some characters don't like to behave. Don't fight them --- just let them be themselves and adjust the story as needed.

It works for me, but I have ADHD, so...
