It's been a while since I've /actually finished/ anything other than a one shot, which I usually bang out in one drunken sitting (no planning), but here is the ongoing process I have with the Witcher crossover longfic I've been playing around with for... oh... way too long.

There are some good organizational writing apps like [[https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview][Scrivener]]. Personally, my motto is "where it's free there's me," so I just have chapters in a Google Doc with a spreadsheet to link / rearrange / give descriptions to individual chapters.

- I start by writing some exciting scenes first, in any order in terms of "plot" or where you think they might end up (they won't end up all in the same place you expect, at first). This helps me because I'll be very inspired to write certain things some days and have no motivation on others. Writing "from the beginning" is actually pretty rare for many professional authors.

  - This also helps me get a feel for the characters. It takes me, on average, 3-5 full chapters worth of material before I feel like I actually know what's going on with the story. I treat these scenes as completely optional to the plot / story; they're just things I /like/ to write and think would be cool to see, but I'm totally okay with scrapping any and all of them if the story needs it.

- I ascribe to the advice of Jack Bickham from [[https://www.amazon.com/Scene-Structure-Elements-Fiction-Writing/dp/0898799066][Scene and Structure]] which gives an excellent blueprint on storytelling structure. I look at the overall story... what is this /about/? What's the main motifs, and how can I structure the story around that? For the most part, when I'm not writing, I'm /thinking/ about the story and what should be in it and where it needs to go to be satisfying. *Set up: Pay off* routine is crucial to a good story.

  - With my crossover, I like to take ideas from both universes. So, in the Witcher series, there's a lot of prejudice and racism driving the story, from the character level all the way up to the political level... guess what? Harry Potter has the same thing! So, it's fairly simple to make sure I've got these little moments where CONFLICT can happen early on in the story, to be referenced throughout, and addressed at the climax. You've also got the dynamics of magical power, body modification, sacrificing humanity, etc. All these little things I try to sprinkle in as much as possible.

So, I think about *Plot*, *Character*, and *Setting*, a lot, and try to make sure that every chapter is advancing one or more of those pillars, while also just being interesting. It's hard, if it was easy anyone could do it, but it takes a lot of writing and re-writing until things are coherent and in decent shape.

I no longer publish until I'm confident the story is in a nearly complete state. Too many times I've started a story and got to chapter 5-6 and been like... yeah... this isn't good or what I was aiming for.
