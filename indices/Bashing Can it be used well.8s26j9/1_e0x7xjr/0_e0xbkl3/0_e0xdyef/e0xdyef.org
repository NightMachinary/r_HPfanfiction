Never said that Dumbledore is incompetent (ok, he partially is! Because he truly should have checked the stone/ring for curses and he should have never relied on only an age-line for the tournament etc. - not that mistakes don't make him human, but he makes too many of them (unless they aren't mistakes and he wanted things that way?))

No, kids don't network unless they are shown (I myself shared class with dozens of well connected kids but nobody showed me how to network, so I never did and now I am REGRETTING IT every god damned day! I could have a damn cushy and well payed job if I did, but no I didn't! Thanks parents for not showing me...then again: My dad wasn't raised knowing this and thus didn't do it himself!) or are more intelligent than then is the norm (sadly for me: Nope, not Einstein, so as I said I didn't and now I regret it)

Yeah and that makes the story this bad, this messiah-complex of Harry (and that society agrees with him, when they aren't villyfying him!) and his un-earned forgiveness! Frankly deleting this would make the story more intersesting and realistic (it would mean that Dumbledore has to make it up to Harry somehow and that Ron and Hermione both can't walk all over Harry because of course he will forgive them if they just say that they are sorry (they don't even have to mean it!))

HP canon isn't great, IMHO it's the world that draws people in (at least it was for me!)!

Does Harry truly hold a childish grudge if he doesn't like a headmaster who condemned him to abuse? I think that is a better reason to dislike somebody than being bullied by that guy's father! Same for being pissed off about being treated like shit by the guy with the childish grudge (I myself would have probably made them drag me to potions after that first lesson! Damned, I got a whole class of people (well: Half, all the boys!) to stand up and leave the classroom once because the teacher was teaching stuff that was not on the curriculum that the girls liked but the boys hated! We banded together, organized that and even did it! Damned, I was bullied by many of those very same boys, but in this instance we came together! But Harry just lets Snape walk all over him!)

Not really! Remove Snape from teaching, but keep him on as the resident potionsmaster! Brewing for the hospital-wing and doing research on the side (I bet he would be more friendly if he didn't have to teach "dunderheads")...hell, maybe even keep him as head of house (those should IMHO not be teachers anyway and neither should they be deputy headmistress!)
