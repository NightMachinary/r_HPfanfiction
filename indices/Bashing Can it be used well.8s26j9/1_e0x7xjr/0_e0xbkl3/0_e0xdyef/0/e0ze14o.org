Children I knew had networks, but they didn't do it consciously. Not until much later. Nor do they necessarily respond well to networks. The average, or even the exceptional eleven year old, doesn't go and create political or social networks. You would need an exceptional prodigy and if we're honest that sort of level of ability tends to isolate people rather than making it easier for them to interact with people. If you have an adult in a child's body the likely result is not that t the other children will like them, but that they will be shunned as weird. Personally I find networking a bit distasteful, rather too much of an old boys'/old girls' network going on anyway.

I'm not sure that's actually a flaw to the story, its an aspect, but only a flaw if you don't believe in the virtues and values of unconditional forgiveness. I would prefer to aspire to act like that, rather than behaving as a vengeful god. People who spend their lives obsessing over the faults are normally the ones we'd consider villains. Do you want to live with bitterness and hatred forever? If so Snape might just have found a friend. I'm not sure it would make it more realistic either, because there really are people like that out there, look to the examples of numerous people who were almost insanely self-sacrificing in the concentration camps. Yes, there are people who took other paths, and yes they can have compelling stories, but it doesn't mean that one is necessarily more realistic than another. The beauty of humanity is in its infinite variety and insanity. Also, Harry does behave pretty poorly to Hermione and Ron in turn, most friends have faults, the principal of friendship is (I would argue) that we find the people whose flaws we can tolerate and forgive those faults.

How many teachers who annoyed you at school, or adults in your life have ever had to make it up to you? You mentioned your Dad didn't give you coaching in networking. How did he make that up to you? How many people do you know who operate like that? What do you do to make it up to people who you've hurt?

I'm inclined to agree that HP Canon isn't perfect, but I think the fact that it creates flawed people who forgive, hurt and make mistakes is one of its stronger points, not one of its weaker points.

How deeply did say Victorian children hold vendettas against their parents? Harry may have been abused by some criteria (and I'm not going to touch on the debates which rage over his treatment), but given the circumstances he's raised in he's more likely to see it as fairly normal. I'm not very surprised he doesn't hold much of a grudge given that there's a lack of alternate experiences for him to draw on. I think it would also be fair to say that he does hold a pretty big grudge against Snape for years, but he decides in the end that he won't be defined by it. Harry's ability to move forwards is one of his greatest strengths. Harry smashed Snape into desks, knocked him out, insulted him, and repeatedly opposed him. I think you may also be forgetting that to some degree Snape represents an institution which (were he removed from it) could see him thrown out of the wizarding world permanently.

If you feel that Dumbledore might protect him, well consider that Dumbledore in the books says that the prophecy is not binding. If you want to believe in evil Dumbledore then his logical solution once he knows Harry is a horcrux would be to kill Harry and then finish off Voldemort efficiently, if Harry is too much trouble.

Heads of Houses traditionally are teachers in my experience. We have no evidence to suggest that's even a remote possibility anyway, you're imposing a lot of fanon ideas there. I'm not particularly sure Snape would be nice under those circumstances, he would just have a smaller range of people to take out his bile on. He is a twisted man who was broken by events which he'll never forget. He shouldn't be a teacher if we're applying modern muggle standards, but on the other hand ... have you ever read 'Decline and Fall'?
