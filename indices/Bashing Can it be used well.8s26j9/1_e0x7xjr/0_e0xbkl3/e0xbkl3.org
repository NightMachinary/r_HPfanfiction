Even if you assume that Dumbledore is the root of all evil that doesn't mean that a story which plays up whichever bad features you believe he has, whilst combining that with a complete uselessness which leaves him as the butt-monkey for the heroes to beat up repeatedly, or humiliate isn't bashing. You can try to spin character interpretations, but bashing (I would argue) strips the character of all nuance and leaves him, her, or ze as a pale imitation of a human being. Does the bashed Dumbledore in fanfiction actually behave in any way which really resembles the original, or any human being?

Even accounting for the examples you give (some of which people might suggest are perhaps a little open to interpretation) it doesn't mean that Dumbledore wasn't acting according to the social norms of his society, and wasn't trying to prevent a genocidal maniac from taking power. Flawed, without a doubt, but he wasn't without virtues either. Does taking that away really improve a story?

I would argue it might result in rather unnatural interactions. 'I will have to learn magic well and I will have to network with my peers ...' Neither of those are things which people are actually necessarily going to naturally do, and in fanfiction they often appear as an unpleasant volte-face.

Ignoring other reasons, Harry is basically a Christ figure. Forgiveness is practically his middle name. Also, you would have a pretty good reason not to give an interview to a woman who is suggesting that you murdered him and will continue to do so. Possibly find another outlet. Don't you think it might be a little ironic to take out a grudge against people for taking out grudges on people?

Snape is an intensely flawed individual, and I can't pretend to like him as a person. However, attacking him or removing him from play could easily have made matters turn from bad to worse.
