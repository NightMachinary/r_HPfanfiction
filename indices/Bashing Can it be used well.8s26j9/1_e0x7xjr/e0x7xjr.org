Is it really "bashing" if it is true? I mean IMHO Dumbledore really is the root of all the bad things that happen in Harry's life (ok: Not all, he didn't kill Harry's parents - unless it's and AU-Fiction where he did or you are making the case that the order should have regularly questioned the members under veritaserum to route out all traitors (which I think they truly should have done at random intervalls!)) from having him placed at the Dursleys to having Snape "teach" (what this guy is doing is anything but teaching IMHO! I mean in every chemistry or physiks class you get a savety "briefing" before doing any experiments and making potions is more delicate and dangerous than most experiments! "The recipe is on the blackboard, get started!" is NOT teaching, that is endangering of students and would get you fired IMHO!), to keeping secrets (Sirius should not have died for example!), to not trying to remove the 'crux (he simply stashed Harry like a weapon! You might be able to make the case that at first he didn't know, but even when he did Dumbledore never tried anything!), to not letting Harry have grief-counseling (Harry has survivor's guilt after both Cedric's and Sirius' deaths!) etc. etc.

So yes, I "bashing" (as in: Dislike/Hatred for a character!) can be used well...hell, it could be the driving force that makes a story AU ("I want my revenge on Dumbledore, Snape and Voldemort, so I guess I will have to learn magic well and I will have to network with my peers to get access to the influence of their parents, so I might strike a blow against them!")

ps: I am still baffled how Harry could forgive Dumbledore and Snape! I frankly would have probably endorsed Skeeter's book "The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore" and given her an exclusive interview to add my story to that book :) and I would have talked about Severus "I am totally a bully and an asshole and love holding childish grudges" Snape, too!

pps: Don't get me wrong I love Snape as a character, but I still hate him, too - Same for Dumbledore! I love to hate the old goat!
