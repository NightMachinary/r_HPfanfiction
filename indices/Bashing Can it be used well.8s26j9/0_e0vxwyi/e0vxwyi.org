The only (/only/) way that bashing as such can be of any interest is in a self-aware crackfiction. linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stepchild)'s Voldemort is cretinous to an absurd extreme, but it's clear it's not /intended/ to be the author's honest feelings about the canon Voldemort, more of an exaggerated parody that's as much a parody /of/ Voldemort-bashing as of the actual flaws of how Voldemort is written in canon. In a slightly different way, linkffn(Core Threads) had a brief "dimension-travel" adventure where Harry ended up in the world of a typical Manipulative!Dumbledore Fem!Harry story, and again, that Manipulative!Dumbledore was hilarious, but only in a self-referential way because the reader already knows about the actual bad Manipulative!Dumbledore fanfictions that it's making fun of.
