Ok, I'll give a "yes" example. Bashing is a comedic art. When placed in a non comedic story it breaks the tone and takes the reader out of the story, unless it's done very subtley. And even in comedies it can move past the point of comedy and into the realm of "ok, I get it already."

linkffn(Triwizard Tales) is a comedy where Ron's eating habits are so bad a dragon gets named after him. I don't recall us ever seeing Ron eat in the story itself so the bashing, while subtle, is there. A much less subtle bashing is performed on Draco and is arguably over done.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion) is also Ron bashing, but, while amusing, was just massively over done.
