Hmmm... Could work either way, thank you for that insight!!

Also, everyone setting reminders... See, thank you, but it might take me a long time to release it. So don't get your hopes up please. Thank you for all the appreciation, really, but yeah. Although I do have a drabbles story that has 3 parts with this very idea. Very basic drafts, of course. If you would like to check that out, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13068827][this is the link, chapters 1-3]]

Anyway, thanks again!!
