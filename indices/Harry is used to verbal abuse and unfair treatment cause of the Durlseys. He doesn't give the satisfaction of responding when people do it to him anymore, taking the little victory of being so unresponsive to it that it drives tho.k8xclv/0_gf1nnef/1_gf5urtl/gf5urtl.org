I am considering writing a 'Lucky!Harry' fic where Lily was brewing Felix Felicis for a Masters in potions when James accidentally dropped Harry in the cauldron as he came in to check on her. As a result, Harry has pretty much the same power as Domino from Deadpool 2, except with regular magic too.
