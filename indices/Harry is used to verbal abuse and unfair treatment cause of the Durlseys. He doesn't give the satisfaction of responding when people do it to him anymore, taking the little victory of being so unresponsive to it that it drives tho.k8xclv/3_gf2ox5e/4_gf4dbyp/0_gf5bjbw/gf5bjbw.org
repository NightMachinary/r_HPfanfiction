Because the writer has a beautiful case of Severitus and I might even call this fic a character study. It's over the course of book 2 till the end of 7, and in this one Snape's character grows and develops as he pays close attention to his student Luna.

It still follows canon though so Snape has to deal with having killed Dumbledore and being a headmaster of Hogwarts and the news of Luna's kidnapping.

Tbh, my tearducts only ever work when I am close to my monthlies and if I want to keep dry eyes that week I'd probably skip it as a precaution.

Tldr; Snape is a prickely hedgehog that slowly unfurls and shows his soft belly in response to Luna's unwavering kindness.
