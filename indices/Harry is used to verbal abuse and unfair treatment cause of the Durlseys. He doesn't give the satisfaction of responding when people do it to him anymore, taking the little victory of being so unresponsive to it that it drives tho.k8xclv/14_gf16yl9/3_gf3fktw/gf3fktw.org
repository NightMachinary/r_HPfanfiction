Yea, I'm always surprised that the Dursley's failed to beat that out of him, dispite the fact they had about ten years to do it.

Really, they're horrible child abusers, in both turns of the phrase.

They're horrible people for abusing a kid; and horrible /at/ abusing that kid.

..unless you choose to believe that the whole of the wizarding world, and even the letters, are a figment of Harry's imagination after being beaten over the head with a frying pan one too many times. In which case they're actually quite good at being horrible people.
