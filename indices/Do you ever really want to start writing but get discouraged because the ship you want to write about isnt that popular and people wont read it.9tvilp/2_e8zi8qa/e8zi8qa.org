The Harry Potter fandom is so large and diverse that there's always SOMEONE who wants to read just what you've written, be it an X-rated multi-kink ficlet starring Uncle Vernon and Dobby, or a 500,000 word chaste slow burn between Padma Patil and Terry Boot.

That said, I did once write an obscure pairing in another fandom. I started with the knowledge that only a few people would read it. And only a few people did--- but they were the best sort of readers who always left thoughtful reviews. More importantly, I got the story out of my system and wound up with a fully developed headcanon that enhanced the source material for me.

There are lots of good things you can get out of writing. The pseudo-validation of thousands of favorites and follows is just one, and not necessarily the best.
