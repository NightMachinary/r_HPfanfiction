Well, the people interested in it will, and they are your target audience after all. You don't want some hardcore canon shipper to read it and leave a review telling you that Harry belongs to Ginny instead of having a triad relationship with the Patil twins because that's not their OTP.

You can get a lot of attention with background ships as long as you "market" things correctly (and your story allows for that).

Take my own "No Longer Alone" as an example. Harry/Lisa Turpin (who?) as a pairing and still nearly 1000 favourites and over 1500 follows. And why? Because the story also includes popular characters so it automatically gets more exposition than without those involved. The "Harry P" tab updates very quickly, no one checks "Lisa T" regularly, but "Andromeda T" and "N. Tonks" are also pretty popular and do not have that many stories, which means you stay on page 1 of the results way longer.

The pairing choice was inspired by "Call Me", which, in my opinion, is a great story and, despite a similar length and being around 3 years longer, only sits at 422 favs and 310 follows. And I am willing to bet that the main reason is that the author did not include popular characters besides Harry.

Tl;dr: Try to fit Harry in somehow, that gets you a lot of potential attention which "Milicent/Marcus Flint" won't get. Additionally, try someone popular in the fandom like any of the Black Sisters, Tonks, Sirius (or Snape and Malfoy if you want attention from that crowd).
