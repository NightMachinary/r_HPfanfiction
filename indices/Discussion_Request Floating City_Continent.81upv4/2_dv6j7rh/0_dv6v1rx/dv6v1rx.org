I was at first thinking the magical world would create something like a giant empty pot plant but then thought in the magical world there might be some truth tot the saying "magic's in the air". so Instead a Giant hollow sphere.

The Wizards designing and making it would have to world in Shifts so they could Use felix felicis to make sure that the project was perfect.

First they would make the sphere out of common crystal so that is was easy to carve the giant runic array into the whole sphere before having Nicolas Flamel use the philosopher's stone ability to transmutation of common crystals into precious stones and diamonds to make it into a Better Substance than crystal at channelling magic.

Then to Charge the Magics of the Sphere they would use A fusion reaction along with a Magical energy conversion array to use the energy from the fusion reaction to charge it.

Then they would Transfer everything magical under the earths crust and all things living in it into the Sphere, then using 90% of the sand that powers time turners they would Speed up time inside the Sphere so 20,000,000 years needed for the environment inside the Sphere to stabilise would only take one year.

Next they would transfer the magic in the oceans and all things in it before using 9% of the time turner sand to Speed up time so that the 2,000,000 years needed for the environment in the Sphere to stabilise again.

Next the Magic in the atmosphere before using age speed up time for 200,000 years. using 0.9% of the time turner sand

next would be the transfer of all Non-sentient magical life that is not living under wards before speeding up time for 20,000 years inside the Sphere.

They would begin the transfer of all NON-human magical Sentient beings. which would also include the second last time the environment inside the sphere would need to be sped up for 2000 years.

Then they would begin The process of going from Country to Country to manually transfer all Magic left. The magical civil war caused by Voldemort would Cause England to be Skipped over when the rest of magical Europe was transferred into the Sphere causing the English wizarding world to have to Wait more two Decades before it was there turn.

IN the 90's when all but Magical England had been transferred to the Magical continent. It would undergo the last Period of time dilation with Time being speed up so that 200 years pass on the Inside while only one year passed on the outside.this time with all Magical life(including wizards) apart from the English being inside when it happened.

Then work would begin for The transfer of all magic in England with The World Cup and The triwizard tournament bith happening in england to help cover up Negotiations from most of the Wizarding world while all Non-Human magical life Being slowing transferred over.

this were Going smoothly with the Transfer of THE English wizards to be announced at the end of the tri-wizard tournament until Voldemort Returned
