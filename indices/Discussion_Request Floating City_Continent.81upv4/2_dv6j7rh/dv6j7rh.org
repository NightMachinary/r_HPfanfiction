IF I were to write something like that, I'd make the Wizarding World live in a slightly shifted dimension - like an empty version of our world. The entrance would be located on an flying Island made from Granite.

The only way to access it would be to go to the entrace - another island, located on the Pole of inaccessibility. I'd make it look like an old, gigantic pyramid. Made from perfect slabs of Granite. It would be perfectly clear to anyone, that this construct was made by a higher power (than the regular human). Stairs would lead the way up to the Arc, in which a simple Floo Hearth would sit, waiting for Magicals. It would be framed by two Gubraithian Fire.

How would I go and have my characters create something like that? After decades of bloody war, Harry Potter and subsidiary his parents, ended the reign of the most terrible Dark Lord. The magical world was close to being annihilated by Dark Lord and Muggles alike. The thread of magic was getting out of hands, for the regular people. In the aftermath a more ruthless Minister decides - enough is enough. A plan was concocted - use Sacrificial Magic to create a dimensional rift. Send in dying prisoners, and let their death fuel the ambient magic. The more people live and die there, the stronger and more stable the dimension becomes.

And so on and so on. Well, look at that. I managed to type all that while waiting for my Netflix Movie to load!
