  Dudley wasn't the one Harry saved during his fifth year. When Dementors attack him, he ends up saving the fiery, eccentric heiress to a hidden country of wizards. She has a private army and would love to repay her rescuer - by helping with his Voldemort problem. Look out, Britain. Captain-General Harry Potter is coming home. Violence, rating may go up
