My fic Lords of Magic had a floating city. This was a massive AU however.

Canonically, I don't believe that HP magic could do such a thing. HP magic can do almost anything but only within a relatively limited range(1). "Time and space matter in magic" says Snape. Being able to cast a spell over an entire city at once is not a piece of magic that seems possible. Supporting this, Hermione comments in GoF that she's not sure if McGonagall would be able to transfigure something the size of a dragon due to how big it is (interestingly, she specifically identifies the size as the problem, not the fact that /it's a dragon/). That implies that "dragon size" is around the upper limit of scale for a skilled user of HP magic.

It's true that in DH, Flitwick and McGonagall both cast spells over all of Hogwarts. However I'm not sure how much we can infer from this, given how little we know about how Hogwarts' protections work. Were they casting fresh protections out of nowhere? Were they activating or otherwise reinforcing pre-existing protections? Hard to say, and therefore hard to draw conclusions. But at most it would mean extending the maximum scale to around Hogwarts-size, which is still well short of city size.

Of course the magic system has clever ways to get around the physical limits - casting magic on abstract ideas and information which has no location (Fidelius is magic on a secret, Taboo is on a word). But it's not clear that there's an abstract medium which would allow you to levitate a city.

(1) This is one of the many reasons why I consider the "could magic stop a nuclear bomb?" question silly. There's actually there's two separate issues in that question. Firstly, can magic create a zone of safety within the area of effect of a nuclear bomb? Secondly, can magic stop a nuclear bomb in its entirety? I would submit that the answer to the first is "yes", given magic's ability to override physical nature within the range of a wizard's magic, whereas the answer to the second is "no" - not because the bomb is too powerful, but because the area you need to cast magic over is too large.
