  Consider transfiguration. It's possible to transfigure things into animals which are physically identical to real animals, despite not knowing about that animal's biology or chemistry or really knowing much about the animal at all. The magic fills in the detail for you. What you as a wizard need to understand is how the magic works, not the non-magical details of the result.

I never said they need to know the non-magical details. But they need to have a concept of what they are defending against. They need to give magic a direction. They do not tell magic "protect me" with their spells and then magic looks around decides which danger to apply itself to, the spells tell magic "protect me /from this/". And with some of the dangers from a nuclear weapon they need to know that a particular danger exists in the first place to devise a defence against it.

Otherwise you get wizards erecting a shield charm in the direction of the explosion and dying very surprised torn apart by the blast winds.
