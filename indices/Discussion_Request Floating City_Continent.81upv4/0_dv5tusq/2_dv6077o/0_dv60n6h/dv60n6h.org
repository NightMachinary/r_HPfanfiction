I don't believe that magic works that way.

Firstly, I think you have identified the wrong category of knowledge as being relevant to successful magic.

Consider transfiguration. It's possible to transfigure things into animals which are physically identical to real animals, despite not knowing about that animal's biology or chemistry or really knowing much about the animal at all. The magic fills in the detail for you. What you as a wizard need to understand is how the magic works, not the non-magical details of the result.

Secondly, I think you are misunderstanding the conceptual nature of HP magic. It doesn't run off physical values or work via physical mechanisms. The shield charm isn't a filter system running off a list of definitions of things to stop.

The shield charm is protective. Its nature is that it will attempt to protect you from harm. It doesn't matter what the type of harm is, because the magic is capable of distinguishing for itself what is and isn't harmful. We've seen the shield charm adapt for various different situations depending on what the harm in question is, whether it be a physical or magical threat. The caster doesn't need to tell the magic this, because it doesn't run off the caster's subjective intent. Magic itself has a concept of protection "built in" to its rules.
