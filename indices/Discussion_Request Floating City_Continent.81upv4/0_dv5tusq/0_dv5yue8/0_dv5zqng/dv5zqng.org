  That would only be true if one did try to levitate the entire city at once. What about building a city ex nihilo from a lot of individually-charmed levitating stones, that you could then assemble into a platform?

That seems impossible from a different perspective - magically possible, but logistically beyond wizarding capabilities. It would be such a massive project I can't see it getting off the ground (pun intended).

Re: bombs, getting to it before it explodes would of course be ideal, but I'm not sure how likely it is. Surely it would require you to be in the right place at the right time, and very quick reaction times on top of that. Seems to me that locations enchanted in advance with protective spells are the best strategy.
