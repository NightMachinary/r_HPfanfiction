Which still leaves you to the problem that you have to stop a supersonic nuke before it reaches its detonation height (usually 300-3000 feet above the ground). You need to accurately point your wand at an object of the size of a car while it is miles away and moving with 1000 to 8000 feet per SECOND and then keep it above the detonation height while disarming it. That is simply impossible.
