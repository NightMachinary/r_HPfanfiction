That would only be true if one /did/ try to levitate the entire city at once. What about building a city ex nihilo from a lot of individually-charmed levitating stones, that you could then assemble into a platform?

On the subject of the bombs, I think that thinking about how magic could protect from the blast is thinking about it the wrong way. They need to cast at the bomb /before it hits the ground/. Hit it with /Arresto Momentum/ before it lands and you're safe, it might even be really easy to Vanish it.
