In canon do we ever read about a group of magicals working together towards a magical goal? Yes, a city would be too much for one person to handle, but what if you had 50 or 100 or 1000 capable magicals working towards that goal?

You run into logistical issues, sure, but using the HP magical system do you think it would work?
