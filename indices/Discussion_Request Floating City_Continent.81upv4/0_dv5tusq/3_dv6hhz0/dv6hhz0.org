I was thinking of it being a bit like a magical manhattan project. Exept it's being done by the best magical mind from all over the world.

I sort of see it as them creating the core of the city/continent that they will slowly add to over time as they move from country to country.

I guess one of the questions is that if you put the Continent under the fidelius charm and then add to its mass over time will the new mass be hidden by the secret. I think it would provided you worded the secret right like"the magical continent is hidden in the sky" doesn't matter how much mass you add to the floating land mass it doesn't change the fact that it is the magical continent.

It would be easier to put permanent magics on a small corner stone of what would grow to be there magical continent. Then for them to try to put permanent magic on the finished product.
