This is a bit of a tough question, to be honest.

I think I'll say no on the Patronus for a few reasons. I didn't really have a good childhood and I never really grew up around it. I was never strong enough to really come to terms with it and so it became a crippling weakness that I now look back on with bitterness. There is no real event in my life that I could conjure up and be able to bask in that happiness because it has never been a constant thing. Yes, I felt happiness when I got my cat, but aside from that? There is almost nothing that I could use as a focus.

The Cruciatus Curse is a bit simpler because of how I am. However, I can easily sum it up for each point.

On a stranger? Most likely not as I would have no connection to them to be able to channel hatred or anger.

On someone who wronged me? Easily. I hold grudges and I shroud the anger around me. I have never really trusted people, a by-product of my youth, and so the number of people who have wronged me to a point is zero. I burn bridges long before people hurt me.

On an animal? No. It would never cross my mind to torture an animal. It actually makes me feel sick that someone could do this. I would sooner torture a human that an animal.
