in a normal state? probably neither, leaning towards the patronus

when it counts the most? crucio. if i already strongly hate someone and want to do them harm, using crucio would be the ultimate expression of that

where the patronus counts most is against a dementor. where you're actively fearing for your life against a creature that's depression given form. switching to a happy memory and letting it fill you up in the midst of that seems almost impossibly difficult to me
