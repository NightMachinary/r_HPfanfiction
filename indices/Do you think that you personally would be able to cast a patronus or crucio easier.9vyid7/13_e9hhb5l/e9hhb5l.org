Does the patronus have to be corporeal? I'm a poor uni student who gets immense joy out of not failing a particularly difficult and/or boring class, so at the least, I could get a silver mist going (just like Harry with the first quidditch win, I imagine). I realize a more profound memory would have to be used for it to take on a form, and on good days, I'd probably be able to do it. Love and acceptance of family and partners comes to mind. On bad days, I'd surely doubt myself enough to falter.

​

Crucio I'd be able to cast on only a handful of people, all of whom had a significant role in my life at one point, and not a positive one at that. And even then, I'd have to rile myself up, and remind myself how they'd made me suffer, to be able to do it.

​

So in the end, the net results would probably be that casting a patronus is easier for me, in general/ in most situations.
