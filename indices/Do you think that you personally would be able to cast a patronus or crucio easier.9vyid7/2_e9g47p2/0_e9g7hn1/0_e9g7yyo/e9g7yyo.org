At least to me, I see their emotional requirements as follows:

- Patronus - memory of joy, usually related in some way to family, friends, love, or self-actualization

- Imperio - Sense that it is just and right that one's will reign supreme over all others

- Crucio - Joy in pain of other, desire to enjoy the pain of another (divorced from any secondary, such as revenge)

- AK

1) Desire to cause death, reveling in death

2) Desiring the death of specific being.

The mindset of 2 is scarily easily to induce - one must merely have a being who one hates enough, and everyone has an Umbridge somewhere in their life.

Joy is harder to summon without already being kind if neutral to start, whereas hate is easy to call upon always.
