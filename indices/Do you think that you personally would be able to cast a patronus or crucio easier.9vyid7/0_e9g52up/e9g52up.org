I don't think I'd be able to do either, to be honest. I hate, but I balk at the thought of actually hurting people, and whenever I do by accident I always feel terribly guilty.

Unfortunately, I don't think I have any memories quite happy enough for a patronus. It's perhaps more likely than me casting crucio, but it'd be very hard coming.
