I think I'd have a really hard time casting either. The Patronus would be difficult because I struggle with depression, and it taints essentially every memory and thought I have. The Cruciatus would be difficult because I don't see how it'd be worth it. I don't gain anything by causing others pain. There are more effective ways to get information and/or obedience, and they're more palatable as well.
