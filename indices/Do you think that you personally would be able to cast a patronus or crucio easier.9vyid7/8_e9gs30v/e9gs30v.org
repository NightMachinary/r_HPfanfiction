Assuming I was angry enough not to think of the consequences (which is unlikely since I've never even broken anything in anger), I could probably sting someone with the Crucio, like Harry does to Bellatrix, fairly easily. But I'd never be able to sustain it past that single instant, and I'd almost certainly be so shaken I'd never cast it again.

I'm actually less confident in my ability to cast the Patronus, not for lack of good memories, but because my good memories don't really have a heavy emotional aspect to them. I'd probably have to cast it in the moment to have strong enough emotions; when I remember a happy memory, it doesn't make me feel that joy again, it makes me think, "Yeah, that made me happy." Sometimes there's a vague pleased feeling, but nothing as strong as when it happened.

Conversely, when I remember an /embarrassing/ memory, it makes me blush and bury my face in my hands and wish I could go back in time to prevent it, as though it had just happened a minute before. Even if it was years and years ago and I'm literally the only one who remembers.
