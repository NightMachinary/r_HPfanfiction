I don't think I would be able to do either.

When I get angry at people, most of the time it feels more directed at myself than others "for being dumb enough to trust them". I do cringe tho at the thought of causing pain to other people.

But I don't think I have a memory that brings enough joy to cast a Patronus, or concentrate enogh to do it.

Regardeless, I would be very excited to learn Accio.
