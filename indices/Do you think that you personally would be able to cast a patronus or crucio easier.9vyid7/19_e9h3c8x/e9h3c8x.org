If faced with someone completely horrible, I think I'd be able to cast crucio for a quick second, but as it happened, I'd second guess whether it was the right thing to do and lose focus. My natural impulse is to feel that someone who is acting truly maliciously is a genuinely shit person, which would give me enough crucio juice until I was actually doing it.

I do have happy memories, but I'm a bit...scatter-brained, I guess? I don't think I'd be able to viscerally imagine them well enough while focusing on casting the patronus at the same time, although I'd like to think I could learn with practice.
