It seems that for a lot of people, hate and rage is easier to put into action. For me there isn't a single person who I personally hate so much I'd cast a crucio.

But if circumstances lead me to want to cast the person at someone, I think at that point I'd already be able to. However I think the curse needs some sort of emotional distance. I don't know how to exactly put this into words but, If you want to hurt someone that much and go through with it, you need to be able to come to the fact that you're committing the action, but you're fine with it. Or convince yourself that It is justified, or that the person receiving the curse is less than human, so you can deal with what you've done in an easier manner.
