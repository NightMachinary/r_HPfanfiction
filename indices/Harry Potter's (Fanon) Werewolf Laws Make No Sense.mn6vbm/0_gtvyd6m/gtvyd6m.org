You have to remember that the Death Eaters are a terrorist group who are opposing the Ministry. So no-one knows who exactly the Death Eaters are. This means that members (like Lucius Malfoy) can push through restrictions on Werewolves while acting like a part of the 'Ministry' agenda.

Having tighter ministerial laws is more likely to push werewolves into either of the two other sides. Since the "light" side is working closely with the ministry (Dumbledore being Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot), werewolves would rather join forces with the dark side, who would be using people like Fenrir Greyback to sell a narrative that the Death Eaters care about werewolf rights.

Since a common trope in fanon is having the Ministry being practically controlled by Death Eaters, it is clear to the reader that the 'dark' faction is pushing for restrictions on werewolves. But from the perspective of any random werewolf, who doesn't know that, it just seems like the Ministry is against them.
