There are more than two factions.

There is the "Light", there is Voldemort, and there is the Ministry (pre-takeover).

The fact that both the Order and the Ministry are fighting Voldemort doesn't mean they agree on anything else, in the same way that Harry and Voldemort are mortal enemies despite both apparently wanting more freedoms for werewolves.

This is very good evidence that the sentiment "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" is /garbage/ (and that is a lesson very much required in many circles).
