And no, in canon the 'Light' side doesn't actually seem to participate in politics at all. All save Arthur's Muggle Protection act in book 2 and Kingsley in the end of book 7. Well... and Dumbledore, but I don't think he was on ANYONES side. Then again, there is also only a total of 2 werewolves in the 7 books as well. Hence why I stuck to fanon.
