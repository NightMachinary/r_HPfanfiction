Is the light side trying to loosen werewolf restrictions? Because the 'Light' side were in power for 12 years and very little was done (though, that's to be expected from british politics... cough 4 years for Brexit cough)

I adore wizard politics, particularly werewolf rights in HP (which yeah, how specifically fucking boring is that). But how Remus would have been treated by governments is so fascinating. And the consiquences of war besides.

The best story that tackles this is linkao3(Break by K1toftheworthies). It's an incredible look at the 12 inbetween years of Remus and Sirius and is criminally underappreciated.

It focus's a lot on werewolf rights and what the war was about from a muggle perspective. I now take it as canon. The part that sticks out is this::::

/"Philip tuts impatiently.“Don't you see? It's all the same thing! You live under a regime that denies people the right to their privacy, that restricts and moderates your contact with fellow human beings, simply because they don't have magic; a regime that can shove a vial of truth serum down a man's throat or take him into custody at the drop of a hat because he suffers from a debilitating condition through no fault of his own. It's a regime that allowed you to spend most of your adult life in solitary confinement without a trial for christ's sake! A one-party state that controls the media and marginalises those who do not or cannot conform. And not only do neither of you oppose this regime, you both ACTIVELY FOUGHT TO SAVE IT IN AN ACTUAL WAR!”"/

If you want an insight into how dumb wizarding politics is, this is the fic.
