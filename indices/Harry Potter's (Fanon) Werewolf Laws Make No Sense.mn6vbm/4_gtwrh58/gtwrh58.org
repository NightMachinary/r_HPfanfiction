One head canon I've seen is that the DE-aligned werewolves want to reject their humanity and embrace the wolf side. So they don't have jobs, live in packs with a low level of technology, eat only meat they've hunted themselves, stay transformed as much as possible. So from that POV laws that exclude werewolves from society are a good thing as they force others to adopt the same lifestyle.
