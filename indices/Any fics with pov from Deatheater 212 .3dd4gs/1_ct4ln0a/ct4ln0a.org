I always imagined the average Death Eater joined because he lost his job to a muggleborn or something and was pissed off, just like the EDL (English Defence League) and their hatred for immigrants.

Small minded bigots who grew up hearing how Purebloods are royalty even if he lived in poverty like the Weasely's.

Would be interested in a fic exploring this for sure! :D
