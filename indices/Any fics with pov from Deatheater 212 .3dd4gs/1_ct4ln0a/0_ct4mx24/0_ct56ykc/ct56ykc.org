kind off, while I appreciate the links and i've not read them all, most of them seem to be way too high ranking. Having personal connection with voldemort, beeing known and feared. I was more looking for the minion who would never get mentioned in a normal book. The pov of a stormtrooper, not some sith or boba fett.
