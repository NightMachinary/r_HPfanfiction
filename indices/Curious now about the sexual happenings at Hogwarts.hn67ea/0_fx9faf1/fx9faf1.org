  Are the fanfictions far far off or was Hogwarts way tamed down for the audience?

It really depends on the individual. I knew a girl who was openly asking pretty much everyone about sex, masturbation and the like as well as her own experience at age ~14. I also knew a girl who waited two + years (18-21) before she slept with her boyfriend. Same goes for guys, some are basically Barney Stinson and aim to fuck everything that moves, others went through their entire education without as much as making a female friendship. There's plenty of middle ground.

So for Hogwarts, you'd probably have some who sleep around, some who look for long-term relationships, some who aren't interested at all and some who aren't lucky when it comes to relationships. The castle presents the opportunity though, some 300 teenagers and 10 adults makes things rather easy, and the amount of room there is (the grounds, abandoned classrooms, storage rooms, bathrooms and so on) helps as well.
