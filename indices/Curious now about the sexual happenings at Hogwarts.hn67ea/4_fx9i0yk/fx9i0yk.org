I went to a real-world boarding school of the same age range and about the same size. I remember there being /one/ pregnancy in the five years I was there. I suppose it's possible some were hushed up but none were ever visible, no girls mysteriously disappeared. There were plenty of relationships, but hardly any teenage boys boasting to their mates about losing their virginity, so I think it's reasonable to say that there was far less sex than most outsiders would think.
