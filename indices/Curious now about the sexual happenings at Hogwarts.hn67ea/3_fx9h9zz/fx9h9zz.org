Well Hogwarts was majorly toned down as the books were written for kids up to young teens not older teens or adults so therefore the concept of sex in the books was toned down by the author to snogging as the upper limit. But come on. Hogwarts had to be a hotbed for sex (unless there was a real magical reason not to partake).

Consider you had kids age 11-18, at a co-ed boarding school for ~9 months of the year ( over 2 month summer break, over 2 weeks winter break). Where there were so few adults they had to have 13 pairs of older students patrol the school at night (head boy and girl, and then boy and girl prefects for 5th, 6th, and 7th year for each house).

I know when I and my various friends started having sex and it was well within the "years" covered by Hogwarts. Imagine having access to empty classrooms, secret passages, large school grounds. Then add things like the Room of Requirements etc., and little adult supervision and I'm sure I would have started much earlier than I did (which was still very early).

So unless the school and grounds were charmed to lower/reduce/restrict everyone's libido, or everyone was potioned at meals, or everyone was told how detrimental to their magic/health was premarital sex then Hogwarts had to be awash in teenage hormones.

I would also expect that sex crimes would be high unless somehow the school protected against it what with love potions, confundus charms, and obliviation. Especially when you consider the spawn of deatheaters was taught to look down on everyone else, and if they want something it's their right to take it. Add Dumbledore's everyone deserves a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 500th chance and I see little in canon to stop someone from following that path.

You would hope the adults would take steps to prevent that kind of thing but considering they took no steps to stop firing hexes in the hallways, or to stop bullying I doubt they did anything to protect the students from sexual assault.
