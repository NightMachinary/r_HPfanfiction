I think a lot more than snogging happened in those broom cupboards, but I don't think that's the case for Ron.

I also think Hogwarts was tamed, but not entirely for the audience. JKR either kept Harry from truly dating for the sake of the trio or she just struggled with that side of a super famous, teenage jock. That's not to say Harry should have been having large amounts of sex, but there's a middle ground between that and how she wrote his teenage years.
