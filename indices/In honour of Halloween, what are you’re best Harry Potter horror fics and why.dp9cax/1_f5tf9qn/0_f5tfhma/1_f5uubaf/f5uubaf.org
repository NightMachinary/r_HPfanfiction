Ive read this fic for halloween the last few years. I think it takes me about two hours or so but i also lose track of time while reading it. Its enjoyable to sit in with a nice drink and be absorbed by the story. The author has produced some very interesting works and crossovers. I truely wish more were finished. This length one shot is better than many fics ive read which were much longer. Im not a big fan of horror but this was not bad. I would definately suggest this to anyone who hadnt read it yet.
