A lot of people like this one, myself included ( thank you all the people who recommended it in other posts so I got to know about it - linkffn (Mandragora by NothingPretentious) I also love three fics by TheDivineComedian - a dementor fic linkao3(How to be happy by TheDivineComedian) as well as a really gruesome capture fic linkao3(Not by Force by TheDivineComedian) and the chilling masterpiece of linkffn(Blackpool by TheDivineComedian) I also want to mention linkao3(dead things by EclipseWing) which is the only Dark Harry fic I really find credible. Also linkffn(Wither by Concept101) which is a Harry/Ginny horror.
