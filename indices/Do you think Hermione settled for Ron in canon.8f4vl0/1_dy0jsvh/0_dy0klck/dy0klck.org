  Nah. However unbelievable I may find it, Canon makes it clear she was attracted to Ron.

dito. She was clearly heads over heels for the guy. I just find that to be a huge stretch. And even if she felt some physical attraction "my" (headcanon) version of Hermione would fight that with her rational mind: "I don't want a serious relationship with Ron and a one-night stand is out of the question and might ruin our friendship. I'll get over it."
