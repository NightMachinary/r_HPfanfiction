"What happened to Demelza after?" Lily whispered.

"She actually got into designing broomsticks. She's done well for herself. Go on, now--scoot aside."

Lily didn't want to move. Her legs felt very heavy. It wasn't until several of the figures in the old photo began shifting that she realized her mother had been speaking to them. Oops.

"There's Uncle Neville and Aunt Hannah."

It wasn't nearly as sad seeing Uncle Neville (It was summer--Lily was not calling him Professor Longbottom until the next term started) as a young man. His face was rounder and there was a nasty gash on his cheek, but he looked mostly whole. He and Hannah were not quite holding hands...

"Had they started going out yet?"

"No...that wouldn't happen for a while yet. But I do know they liked each other...they had only been going out for all of a month before they got married."

Lily smiled as the Old Neville and Old Hannah blushed deeply at hearing that. She recognized Seamus Finnigan punch Neville on the shoulder.

"Aah, that's Seamus. He did fine in the War--nearly lost his arm to an Arcomantula, but he recovered well enough."

"Hmmm..."

"Oh..." Ginny murmured. "Adeline..."

A /tiny/ wisp of a girl was standing between Hannah and Aunt Luna.

"Adeline was in Ravenclaw...she joined up after the Carrows took over...she was the only other girl from Ravenclaw in our year to join the DA."

"She was Luna's roommate?"

"Yes...she was the only one who hadn't picked on Luna...but they didn't really become friends until that last year either. But after a while, never saw one without the other."

"What happened to her?"

"She was hit...I'm not sure with what...the curse was horrible...I found her outside and helped her to the Great Hall...Luna was there too..."

"But..."

"She died. The curse destroyed her insides. The last thing she told us was that she'd tell Luna's mother that we said 'Hi.'"

Lily felt like crying. This wasn't at all like she had thought it'd be.

"There's Lavender Brown...Fenrir Greyback got her...she bled out before we could save her."

"Uncle Neville and Uncle Ron got Greyback didn't they?"

"Yes...two blasting curses mixed with a Jelly-Legs pulverized Greyback's legs, and then Neville got a cutting curse at his throat."

--------------

It went on for almost an hour, and Lily felt as if she may be sick.

"And there...I think that is everybody. Or everybody in the photo at least..."

"Dumbledore's Army..."

"We all have scars Lily. Some of us more than others."

"You all gave so much...was it worth it, do you think?"

Ginny hugged her. Lily wasn't nearly as resistant to hugging as her brothers. She leaned into her mother's shoulder.

"Yes honey...It was worth it. We owe it to the fallen to make a better world. And make life worth it."
