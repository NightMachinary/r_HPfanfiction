/Owe it to the fallen to make a better world...And make life worth it./

Lily blinked back tears as she entered the sitting room. James and Albus were alphabetizing their Famous Witch and Wizard cards.

Losing a brother would be like losing one of her arms.

"Hey James," Lily called.

"Yeah, Lily?"

"I have a question..."

"Yeah?"

"What's that card in your hand?"

"It's a Circe card. Is that all?"

"Circe...could you spell it for me?"

"C-I-R-C-E," James scowled at what clearly sounded like a stupid question. But it gave Lily the perfect opening.

"No, silly--"It" is spelled "I-T! How'd you get past first year, Jamie-boo?"

"Gah!" Color flooded James's face. "You're gonna pay for that one!"

"Hmmm...sorry James, but I think teasing dopey big brothers should be free."

"Lily," Albus warned looking between her and James, as if deciding who he should help.

"I'm not gonna pay you either, Albus."

"What?!" Albus spluttered. "I'm gonna...gonna..."

"Gonna what? Use your words."

"Get you!"

Lily smirked. "You'll have to catch me first!"

"Albus! Help me get her!"

She broke off into a run, with her brothers hot on her heels. Lily relished it. She honestly couldn't remember the last time she had teased her brothers to the point where they chased her. But thinking about Dennis and Colin...and Uncle George and Fred...she had to relish this.

Maybe she wouldn't let them catch her after all. She was faster than them, and had a head start on her slowpoke brothers. Through the sitting room, and the kitchen, and then up the stairs and then through Albus's room and then James's room and then the study...

And then James hit her with a Trip Jinx.

"Aaah! We're not allowed!"

"I'm of age, Lily!"

Lily squeaked as she fell to the floor, right outside her room. Her brothers pounced on her--Albus pinning her arms above her head while James pinned her legs. Lily saw Albus's green eyes widen and then his triumphant smile turned into an evil smirk. She felt James begin to untie the laces on her trainers.

Oh dear...

--------------

I'm tempted to end it here. Lily's "dread" at being at her big brothers' mercy makes an amusing ending.
