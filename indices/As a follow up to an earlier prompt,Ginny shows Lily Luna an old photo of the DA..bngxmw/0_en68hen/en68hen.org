"I want to know." Lily Luna set her jaw in the exact same stubborn fashion as her mother had done at the same age, more years ago than Ginny would care to admit.

"Lily...the War was really, truly awful. You're..."

"Too young?"

"That wasn't what I was going to say."

"Yes it was. Mum--I have the /right/ to know. I'm as old as you were when you joined Dumbledore's Army, under Umbridge."

Ginny pinched the bridge of her nose. "It's not that simple, love."

"Yes, yes it is."

--------------

"This was the Dumbledore's Army that I helped Neville and Luna lead during the War."

The photo was old and ragged but it still clearly showed more than three dozen teenaged wizards and witches.

"There I am, next to Demelza Robbins and Colin Creevey and his little brother Dennis."

Demelza was slightly built and had shiny black hair. Colin was even smaller than her, with wide, eager eyes. Mum, or the teenaged version of her, had her arms around Demelza's shoulder. Colin had a smaller boy who looked very much like him in a headlock, both roaring with laughter. His brother?

"Colin died in the War, right?" Lily murmured, though she already knew the answer.

"Colin threw himself at Dolohov, right after he got Lupin with that awful fire-curse of his. The last spell Colin ever cast was a Shield Charm...over me and your Aunt Luna."

Lily had seen Dennis Creevey, Colin's younger brother, once. Five or six years ago, at one of the memorial shrines. He hadn't spoken to anyone, but had caught her eye just as he was leaving the memorial shrine for Colin. She hadn't even known who he was.

Dennis carried himself as if he walked with a limp, even though Mum had said Dennis hadn't seen much battle in the War.

It reminded her of Uncle George and how there was always a trace of sadness in his smiles.

Losing a brother...It was like losing a limb, only for your heart. Lily thought about James and Albus and how when Albus wasn't being teased by James, he was helping James tease her. They'd pull her braids or chase her around the house. Pin her to the floor and draw on her face with a marker. But they hadn't caught her in a long time.

The next time they chased her, she'd let them catch her. Even the worst teasing torment from her brothers would be worth it.

Lily shook her head sharply.

"Mum? What happened to Demelza?"

"She was too young to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts...but she sneaked back."

"Was she..."

"She wasn't killed, but she was hurt badly--she had her leg mangled by some horrible curse...I forget who she was dueling. She had thought of playing Quidditch...but she couldn't fly with one leg."

I may come back to this.
