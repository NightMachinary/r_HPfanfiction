Harry versus the Droid Army in linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For)

With a single spell, Harry /obliterates/ the largest invasion force seen during the Clone Wars. During the spell, Harry is described as a conductor of the chaos that he unleashed.

And the aftershocks of the spell change the very nature of the Force.
