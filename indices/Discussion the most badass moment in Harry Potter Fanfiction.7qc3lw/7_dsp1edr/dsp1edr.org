I've always been partial to chapter 18 of linkffn(The Merging) where all of the aurors and Ministry personel, inc Fudge just watch in awe as Harry and Dunbledore do a doubles duel to the death with Voldemort and Bellatrix.

And the ghost/poltergeist fight scene in linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) which is chapter 20.
