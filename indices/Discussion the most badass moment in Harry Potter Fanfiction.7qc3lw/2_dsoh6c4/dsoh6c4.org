This is the most memorable scene I have ever came across. Ever. Period. I was just in awe how the author can make me imagine that scene with such detail and made me scream: “Sirius Orion Black is so badass!” Basically, it's how the author reimagined JK Rowling's motorbike chase scene with Sirius escaping from the Death Eaters. However, this story is from Regulus' POV after he changed his his alliance from Voldemort so he is trying to protect Sirius.

  Then he gasped and clumsily turned when Sirius made another one of those reality-defying swerves and entered a side-alley that finished in a dead end. Cursing under his breath, he was about to mutter something about Sirius apparently not knowing muggle London as well as he seemed to when he got first first real reason to panic.

  His brother wasn't slowing down.

  It was like watching a train wreck. Horrifying, mind-numbingly shocking and yet somehow impossible to tear your eyes [a]way from it. Sirius drove forward, accelerated to the maximum and then hit the breaks, leaning backwards and pulling the front of the bike along, looking every bit as though he was going to start riding up the wall.

  With a cracking blast of raw magic, the motorbike left the pavement. Sirius pushed the accelerator all the way through, just as his bike slammed into the wall wheels-first...

  ...and then proceeded to ride up the wall as if it had always been meant to do that.

  The roar of the engine got cleared the higher the bike came, like a dragon rising from the depths of a volcanic lair. The bike picked up speed with every meter it ascended and then the 20-story building suddenly came to an end.

  The death eater broomstick pursuit squad broke ranks when Sirius shot up from below like a cannonball, right into their midst. One of them lost his hold on his broom and fell with a muffled scream. Regulus didn't pay attention, nor did he care if he would remember to apparate or cast a Arresto Momentum before completing the process of plummeting to his death. More interesting was the sight of Sirius Orion Black righting himself and spinning on his two wheels as though he were on the highway, outlined perfectly against the half-moon. It was like the sky had chosen to be miraculously clear of London's normal pollution on that particular night just so the scene would be possible.

  /Damn/, his brother was cool! The /definition/ of the word.

I agree with you, Regulus. I definitely agree with you.
