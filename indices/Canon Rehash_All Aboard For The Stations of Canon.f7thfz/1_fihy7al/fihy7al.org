[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/][Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions]] is probably my favorite canon rehash. Part of the reason I enjoy it is that the author mostly only includes the scenes that happen in-between the 'stations', so the story feels fun and new even if the plot doesn't diverge much at all from canon.
