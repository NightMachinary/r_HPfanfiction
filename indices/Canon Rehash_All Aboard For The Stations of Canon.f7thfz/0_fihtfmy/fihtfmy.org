Stations of canon are shit on as far as most fics go here, so it will be interesting to see what suggestions come up.

It's on my mind from another thread so I'll suggest it here as well.

The Green Girl by Colubrina follows a Slytherin Hermione. Harry is a background character and he follows the stations of canon throughout the fic and up till about the Battle of Hogwarts.
