Of a Linear Circle features a proper villainous Dumbledore, who has an actual motive (The Elder Wand didn't like how he didn't kill to take it and saw a prophecy forcing the holders of the other two Hallows as the perfect opportunity. It basically fried Dumbledore's will and drastically exacerbated his controlling tendencies.)

Instead of the usual paper tiger manipulation, the protagonists spend chapter after chapter working to figure out what's going on and working against him.
