In 'Harry Potter and the Ring of the Ancients' (sorry can't find a link these days for it), Dumbledore is the final villain and he is really powerful. For a while the situation seems hopeless once he reveals himself as evil and the only reason Harry manages to escape is through some quick thinking on his part. Unfortunately the story ends with a cliffhanger and as I've said, I can't find it anymore. Maybe someone might have it as a PDF.
