I'm a big fan of [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1140833][Ut Malis Melior]], where Harry's parents are at St. Mungo's and Neville is the BWL. He starts off living at the Dursleys'. There are a lot of politics in the series but I think it's done well and age appropriate (adults at the Wizengamot and children learning from them). I also like that Harry and Neville become friends, there's a lot interhouse friendships here. The author is currently writing book 4. The series gets really tense as it goes on!
