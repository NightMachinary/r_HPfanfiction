So I only just started this, honestly I'm just one chapter in - but I remembered your post. Try [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25440826/chapters/61701526][Dripping Fingers]] by May_May_O_O. You may have read it already-it's the only one I've read so far where Harry draws in the diary. It's a work in progress-but it seems regularly updated! Hopefully it's good! I'm going to go read the rest now lol
