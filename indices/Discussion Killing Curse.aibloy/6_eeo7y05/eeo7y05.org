The Killing Curse doesn't require any hate, you just need to want to kill the other guy. Casting it while aiming to kill X will still kill Y if Y jumps in the way, since it is a fully formed spell that is fired, and not a dud. The exact situation happens in Book 6, where Rowle throws around the Killing Curse like crazy, and hits one of his comrades, Gibbon.

None of the Unforgivables require any hate - you can want to dominate, torture or kill someone without any feelings attached.
