If I hate X and I cast the killing curse at him, I still cast a fully powered killing curse. Y will die even if she wasn't the target.

See: Fawkes' forced burning day when intercepting the killing curse intended for Dumbledore. Fawkes wasn't the target. Under your theory, he wouldn't have been harmed at all.
