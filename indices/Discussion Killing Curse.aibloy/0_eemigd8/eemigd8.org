The Cruciatus requires hate and the desire to deal out pain (according to Bellatrix).

We have no idea what you need to cast the Killing Curse (even the wiki still states "citation needed" for that claim). We can only go off a few points here, one being Barty Crouch Jr. who claims that no 4th year could cast the spell successfully. The books don't provide a lot of pointers here.

However, it would make sense that the spell requires some emotional or at least intellectual foundations to work. If that in itself could create a "shield" for people who were not supposed to be the target is a question I'd rather answer with "no".
