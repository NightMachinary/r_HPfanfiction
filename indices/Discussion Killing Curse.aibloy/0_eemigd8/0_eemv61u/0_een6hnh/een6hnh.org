Sadness overrules the anger in this situation I guess, though we may never know, but I don't think Harry felt that much anger in the moment of Sirius' passing and more pain and sadness.

While Carrow spitting in Minerva's face was just fueled by pure hatred. McGonagall had not that close of a relationship with Harry, I agree, but the act itself can be described with hatred towards someone Harry respected.

As for the killing curse, we know that someone can sacrifice himself through the power of love. But I think the mental state to be able to cast a killing curse should probably be something close to a point were someone threatens another person with a pistol, e.g. Robbery, intense hatred, self protection etc.
