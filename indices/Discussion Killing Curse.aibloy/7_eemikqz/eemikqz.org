It's one which intrigues me.

I mean, it's possible, but then again Bellatrix can just fire off a killing curse and slaughter a fox without knowing who or what it is. It may just be that if you hate everything enough it doesn't matter anymore and the killing curse will be effective in any case.

Alternatively, the power of the spell might just be imbued in the spell as soon as it is launched. I don't think we really have sufficient evidence either way.

I would like to think that your theory is right though.
