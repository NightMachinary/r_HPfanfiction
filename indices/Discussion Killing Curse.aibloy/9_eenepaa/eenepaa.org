I've always thought it more that you had to truly desire to rip somebody's life from them. I feel like the idea of hate and anger may contribute to it. I remember Harry Potter and the Boy who lived by the Santi had the dark arts being spells that you had to truly desire something, ie he had tried casting the trauma curse and failed because he wasn't thinking about someone/something he truly wanted to feel real terror.
