linkffn(5341211) How Chocolate Cauldrons Destroyed The World.

Harry decides to eat the love-potion laced chocolates from Book Six. The result of which gets him and Romilda expelled, thus Voldemort wins. Safe-for-work.

An Hour Of Wolves: I should probably not link this one because of underage content.

Romilda force-feeds Harry a love-potion and then rapes him. Realistic portrayal of the aftermath. HEAVY TRIGGER WARNINGS.
