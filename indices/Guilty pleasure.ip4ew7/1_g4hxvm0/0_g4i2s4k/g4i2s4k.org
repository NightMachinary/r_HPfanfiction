I've honestly gotten to the point where I prefer fanfiction over the canon material. Especially with all the TERF nonsense going on with Rowling lately. I honestly can't believe that an author who portrays male characters wearing high heeled boots, long robes that resemble dresses, and have long hair is so transphobic and has such a binary view of gender It's truly disheartening.
