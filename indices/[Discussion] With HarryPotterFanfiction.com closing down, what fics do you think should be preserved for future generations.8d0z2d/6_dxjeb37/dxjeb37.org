Do you mean that site specific, or on the whole? I personally haven't read anything I'd put on the level of Moby Dick, Frankenstein, Faust, Crime and Punishment, Max Havelaar, etc etc. I don't even know if Fanfiction can fulfill that role literature does, or whether it should.

Anyway, I think the piece of Fanfiction that stuck with me the most were the first chapters of Nightmares of Future's Past. It hit me, especially after I just reread and rewatched the original series, to open a fanfic and see everything ruined, broken, destroyed, so vividly. That was powerful stuff.
