The first story I ever read was some Tonks/Lupin story from the Dobbys section in 2008. I never finished it, because I guess even 20 year old me who had never read a fanfic before realized it wasn't very good.

Also, the Resonance trilogy didn't originate on HPFF. I first read it on that site as well, but some research has showed that it was actually posted to FFN first (by about 10 months). The first sequel was posted nearly simultaneously, but still to FFN first by a couple of days.
