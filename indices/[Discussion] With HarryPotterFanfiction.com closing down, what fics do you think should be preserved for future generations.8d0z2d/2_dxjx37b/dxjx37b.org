Almost everything in "The Dobbys" section is worth reading. Maybe not the best ever, but definitely above average.

I particularly liked "Running with Wolves" by Aurora Dawn and "Arabesque" by CelticKisses.

Also, in the Top 10 section, the severitus series by greengecko, starting with "Resonance."
