Ugh part of me will still never forgive JKR (or her editor) for prominently introducting two /clearly/ queercoded, positive, helpful characters and then backtracking on it and pairing them up and insisting that there was no chance they were ever even bisexual. So much for being Ms. 'I support fanfiction'!
