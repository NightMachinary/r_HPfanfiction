  Is a little AU flavor an absolute necessity to stave of the dreaded Stations of Canon, or merely a nice touch?

People new to HP fanfic are likely to be confused if you diverge from canon without an obvious reason. Old hats are likely to be bored by rehashes.

Personally, I can't stand to write about Harry Potter as a protagonist or POV character most of the time. I have a WIP about Tom Riddle in the late 40s (which I might eventually return to), and I have another about Hermione Granger circa 2010. This doesn't even give me an option to maintain the stations of canon. As for AU, the first is close to a single point of departure fic, and the second has backstory involving Harry going to Azkaban around 1995, breaking out, enduring a siege at Hogwarts, killing Voldemort, and seizing control of the Death Eaters, then conquering much of Europe in the name of eradicating Dark Lords.
