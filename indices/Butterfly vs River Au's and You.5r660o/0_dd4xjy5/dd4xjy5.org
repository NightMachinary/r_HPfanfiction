I'll be honest, sometimes in time travel stories it is super annoying that the main character refuses to change anything because that means their knowledge will become less valuable. But not everything changes and reliving a life while causing minimum ripples is boring.

Some stations are practically inevitable such as the Sorting (though the house might be different), but if something is the same then it's fine to not focus on it so much - describing the event in detail is probably unnecessary and may be suited to a flashback so the actual story doesn't feel too slow-paced. I find that trying to describe event significant event that occurs in canon can really slow down a story.

Honestly, while some stations make sense, if you can justify having them switched up then it's often a good idea even if it seems like a stretch. - with the triwizard tasks, having a different task may seem unlikely but it might provide a fun unique challenge, keeping the story fresh.

By the way, does a story where Hermione died in book 1 exist? Because I'd totally read it.
