Oh, because Holmes is just Harry's guardian but I won't be going into the Sherlock side of the story so basically it'll be after Sherlock's investigations are done. Holmes won't be a major character, kinda like Remus in the original- Harry's guardian and he'll get some screen time but not as much as say, Harry's classmates.
