Good point! However, it's freedom of speech that's unchecked with unverified sources and quotes...I hated that ethics weren't applied and no disclaimers about the content. Harry Potter was a child with a traumatic past and she had no qualms about spinning lies and making him a "gossip rag" topic. It was already terrible sneaking around as a beetle to get scoops and invading privacy but when she took advantage of an elderly historian and then, sent her a copy of the Dumbledore book liberally mocking her...I totally and thoroughly hated her lol.
