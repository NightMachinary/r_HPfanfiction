- In OotP, he is the suspicious ass who clearly doesn't believe Harry but still come to the DA.
- In HBP, he is the petty ex-boyfriend who is more concerned about mocking Harry's team than commenting a Quidditch match.
- In DH, he is the coward who hustled kids to flee faster.

He never had a good scene in the whole series.
