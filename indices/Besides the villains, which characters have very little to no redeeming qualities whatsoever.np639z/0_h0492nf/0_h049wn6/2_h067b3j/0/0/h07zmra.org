Lee spends an entire game commenting on the Firebolt features. He also uses his commentator position to hit on Angelina Johnson. If I recall Zacharias didn't comment on the Gryffindor vs Hufflepuff game because he was a player. We don't know whether he commented during the final game as Harry was in detention.

With that being sad, the guy made some rude remarks but Ginny knocked him out of the stands. She could have killed him. Also she hexed him for asking her what happened at the DoM. Most socially functional people have other more diplomatic ways to deal even with annoying people.
