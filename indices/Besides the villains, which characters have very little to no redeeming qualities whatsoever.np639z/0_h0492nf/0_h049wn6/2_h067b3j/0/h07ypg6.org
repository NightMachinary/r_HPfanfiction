  To be fair, Lee Jordan was just as biased of a commentator. Only he was biased in Gryffindor's favor.

From what I remember, while not being impartial, Lee Jordan biases was mainly calling the Slytherin cheaters, /after/ they cheated. While Smith was just attacking Harry from the start without any reason. I mean, he was clearly accusing Harry of recruiting Ginny and Ron because they were his friends, and (begrudgingly) changed the subject only because they clearly carried the team.

It's probably the reason why Lee was a commentator for at least 5 years, while Smith only got one match.
