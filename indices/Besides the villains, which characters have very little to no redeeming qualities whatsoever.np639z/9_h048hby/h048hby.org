Everybody has chance for redemption, it just depends on the author how she/he writes it. I have read redemption for all possible persons (not all of them very good): Bellatrix Lestrange, Tom Riddle, Dolores Umbridge, Vernon Dursley, Romilda Vane, everybody could be redeemed, it just depends on how well it is written.
