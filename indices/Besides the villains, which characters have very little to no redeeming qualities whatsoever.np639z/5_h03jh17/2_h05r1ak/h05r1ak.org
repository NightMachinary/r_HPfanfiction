I wouldn't call Snape's feelings for Lily love, or at least not a healthy type of love, but eh, we could discuss that for days. Now, I'm yet to understand people who argue in Bellatrix's favour that her loyalty to a /mass murderer/ is a good thing. What next? Her amazing duelling skills that she uses to torture and kill innocent people?

Not assuming that's your opinion or anything, but I wanted to point out this might be the weirdest apology excuse I've ever seen (and I've actually seen it quite a few times).
