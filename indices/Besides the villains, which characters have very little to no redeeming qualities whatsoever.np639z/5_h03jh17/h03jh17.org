One could say about Bellatrix that she was loyal or about Snape that he loved Lily. Still terrible characters but they did have some qualities of their own.

Some characters however are simply the worst. No redeeming qualities whatsoever: Umbridge, Draco, Fudge.

If I was writing a time-travel fic, I'd definitely make the protagonist murder these three at the first chance.
