I agree, but my point is that it might not have been with the intent of raping. Amortentia is the /strongest/ love potion there is. It produced an infatuation so strong that it allowed Merope to rape Tom Riddle Snr.

Romilda Vane tried to give Harry an unknown type of love potion. It isn't mentioned to be Amortentia and we don't know how strong it is. Again, as I said, the effect could just be get Harry to say cheesy stuff, profess his love for her and want to be near her. Maybe the potion isn't strong enough to get someone to have sex or even kiss.

I'm not saying it's okay to impair anyone's judgement, but this doesn't mean Romilda Vane attempted to rape Harry. It doesn't mean it would even be possible with the potion she gave him.
