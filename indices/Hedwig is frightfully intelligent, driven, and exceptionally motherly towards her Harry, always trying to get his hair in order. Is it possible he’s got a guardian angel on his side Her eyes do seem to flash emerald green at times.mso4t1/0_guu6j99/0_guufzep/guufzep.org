Maybe Lily is stuck in the Animagus form and Snape accidentally frees her when he does this?

"Animalis hominum!" Snape yelled and a bright blue/white spell struck Potter's bird.

Like a sped up muggle film, the bird began to change, shifting and morphing until...

There she was, the only person he ever loved, Lily Evans. Her once blood red hair had turned snow white and her body had been slightly disfigured to be bird-like from the long-term use of her Animagus form, much in the same way Peter Pettigrew had been slightly disfigured to be rat-like, but this was unmistakably Lily.

Her mind hadn't caught up to her body, her face was scrunched up as she was rapidly flapping her arms, attempting to escape by flying away. "...Lily?" He asked in shock. Only when she heard his voice did she open her eyes.

"...Sev?" She asked, it had been so long since anyone had called her that, since she had looked at another human being with human eyes. If it hadn't been for Harry, her old self would have been completely forgotten, it nearly was forgotten, like an old dream fading away.

"Harry!" She yelled, bolting up onto her shaky feet. "I need to see Harry!" She almost fell over, only Snape was there to catch her.

"You must wait." Severus said, still reeling from the shock of this discovery.

"Wait!? I need to see Harry, I need to see my son!" Lily said viciously, kicking the air manically as she tried to scratch his face with her feet unsuccessfully.

"Lily! You must wait, at least until you're clothed!" Snape barked in his teacher's voice. Suddenly Lily stopped and her eyes slowly looked down at her body, completely naked except for a few feathers.

"Oh... OH!" She squeaked, pulling the cloak off of Snape in a desperate attempt of covering herself. "Don't look!"
