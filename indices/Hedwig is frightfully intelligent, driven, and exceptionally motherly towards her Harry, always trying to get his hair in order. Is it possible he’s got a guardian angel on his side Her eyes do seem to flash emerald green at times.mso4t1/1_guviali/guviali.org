So... Lily Potter somehow manged to effect magic, so she came back as Headwig? Wow. You wanna know something sad if that's true, Harry saw her die twice, once as Lily Potter when he was one, and the 2nd when she was Headwig during the battle of 7 Potters, the first time he knew, but the second time he didn't, wow, that'll be sad.
