I'm also not famous but I think the way the OC helps Harry deal with the fame will be determined on the kind of person the OC is. Is he like Gilderoy Lockhart and embraces the fame and likes to be center of attention? Is he more private and goes out of his way to make sure he stays out if the spotlight to the best of his abilities?
