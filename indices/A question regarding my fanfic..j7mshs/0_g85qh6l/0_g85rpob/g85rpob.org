It's a bit more complicated than that because, while the OC prefers not to be put in the spotlight, he also takes a great pride in it. He looks up to his father a lot, and inspires to be like him in the future. If someone comes up to him and talks praises of his father, he doesn't feel uncomfortable at all. On the other hand, he doesn't flaunt his fame around. He wants to work hard and become a well known wizard through hard work just like his father did before him. He has to earn it in a sense.
