In that case I think maybe the OC would tell Harry to embrace the fame because it's not going anywhere but to stay true to himself and focus on his own goals and not try to live up to what people say he should be. Maybe OC would give Harry tips on how to avoid any publicity if he really wants to be left alone sometimes. Or maybe if Harry is shy and unsure of himself when people come up to him and ask him questions about Voldemort, the OC would kind of step in and take over if he notices Harry isn't doing too well. Idk if that helps at all
