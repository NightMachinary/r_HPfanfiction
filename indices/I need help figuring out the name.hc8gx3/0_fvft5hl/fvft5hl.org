If you don't get an answer you should re-ask in a few days, but make the title more informative. Eg. “What's the fic where dark lord Harry and light lady Luna are chosen by magic?”

It also helps to include as much other information as you can in the body of your post. Things like the site you think it was on, its genre, other plot points, etc.
