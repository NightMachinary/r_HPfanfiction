A lot of fics make the Fidelius charm based on conditional information. So, if the information that's being hidden is no longer true, them the fidelius breaks. So, if the fidelius phrase was "The Potter family is hiding in Godric's Hollow", the one could argue that the fidelius would collapse as soon as Lily died, as there was no longer a "family" hiding there.
