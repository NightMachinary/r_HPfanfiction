As I understand it, the Secret was that Lily and James and Harry were hiding in their safe-house (Godric's Hollow is the name of the village, not the house). I'm vaguely recalling a line that Voldemort could be stood outside the very house, nose pressed against the window, and still wouldn't be able to see them because of the Secret.

Once they had died and Harry had been removed, the Secret became irrelevant and the Fidelius was lifted. Snape, Hagrid, and Sirius all entered the house after they had died - Sirius certainly /didn't/ know their location beforehand because the whole point of making Peter the Secret-Keeper was that Sirius was too obvious a choice. And for the Fidelius to work, the Secret has to be kept within the soul of a /single/ Secret-Keeper. Not even Dumbledore knew where the Potters were when the Fidelius was active.

In the years after their deaths, many witches and wizards travelled to the Potters' safe-house and wrote notes of support to Harry on the gate. Hermione knows that Godric's Hollow was where the Potters die because it's common knowledge in the wizarding world.
