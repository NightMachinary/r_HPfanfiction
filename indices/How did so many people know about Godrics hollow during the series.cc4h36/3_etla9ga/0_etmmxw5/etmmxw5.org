Not really the point but I don't necessarily agree that Sirius (and/or Dumbledore) didn't know the Potter's location. The point of the spell-from my understanding- is that only the Secret Keeper can /tell/ the secret. Not that other people don't /know/ the secret. Sirius was too obvious a choice as far as making him the Keeper goes but that doesn't mean that Peter didn't tell him the location after the spell had been cast.
