I recently read a harry potter being Moriarty Expy on wizarding world one shot but can't find it in my browser history. He opens the wizarding world's first brothel, first casino, and the first organized crime operation with him at the top. Also, there is no Sherlock equivalent to stop him. It finishes at the ending of the triwizard tournament.
