A lot of what the Joker does seems to fall perfectly under the umbrella of terrorism, in particular when he tries to spread anarchy. But there are many different renditions of that character and it probably doesn't apply to all.

In any case, most of the Dark Lord Harry stories I've seen only lack the "silly name" to fall under the supervillain umbrella. But that's probably because I don't see your distinction. Super-villain = A villain with some kind of super powers. Any Dark Lord is a supervillain by default.
