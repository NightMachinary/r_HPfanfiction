I'll second the rec for A Year Like None Other. It's one of my favorites, along with its sequel [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=13093][A Summer Like None Other]] and the third story in the series, [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=17466][A Family Like None Other]], which is sadly incomplete.
