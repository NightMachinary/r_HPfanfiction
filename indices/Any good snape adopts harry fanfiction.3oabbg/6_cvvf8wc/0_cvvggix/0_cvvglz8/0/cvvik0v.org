OOC, whitewash, bashing, all of the above, or is it something else that they mess up?

I mean, the one i read was about 20%, he can be reasonable with others, about 40% snape has issues and one of them is that he really doesn't make new freinds, and his old freindslist is all death eaters and corpses, 30% snape couldn't hate an abused... something really young, especially when he isn't that much of a bother, and most of the remainder was harry decided he liked snape. His character wasn't ideal there either, but it didn't feel that far off-base for a possible future snape when he's not deliberately being nasty.
