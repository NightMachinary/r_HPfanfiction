Ao3 or do you have M filter set to off? pretty sure FF used to elimitate those.

Snape is shippable with a finite number of characters, and the further you diverge from canon the greater that number is, but it's still low. Anyone from a different generation just hits squick, though it could have been plausible in canon- when snape falls, he falls hard. The fact that he was willing to die for lily demonstrates that, and that is what he was risking.Still, it would need to be mutual, or he'd be quite content to pine or force it from his mind, but snape is, at the minimum, a complete jerk when teaching, so that is implausible.

assuming his social circle never expands, and with students out, that leaves narcissia- but she's married- mcgonnagal, but they don't really like each other, dumbledore but snape shows no signs of being gay, and any other staff member. in short, canon snape isn't the type to have a commited relationship, he doesn't interact with enough people. narcissia, of all people, is the most likely.

As such, any ship-fic requires snape have some character growth to work, if just enough to leave his shell and develop a deep and meaningful freindship that then corrupts into a romance. Most solid snape ship-fics would take multiple years, because snape is messed up pretty badly, (and he seems the type that falls in love from solid freindship, rather than having a split between love and freinds) and therefore snape would need consistent interaction with the character choosen. As such, the most plausible shipping targets are characters from hogwarts, members of the order of the pheonix, and other teachers.

in short, snape is doomed to be single, or not really be that enthusiastic and just doing it because he feels obligated to.
