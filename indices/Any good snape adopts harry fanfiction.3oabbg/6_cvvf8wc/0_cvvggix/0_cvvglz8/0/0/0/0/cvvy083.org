That's a big reason all those Marriage Law fics exist, because canon Snape would never get with anyone on his own. You need some kind of external pressure or something to force him into a relationship and then see what he does with it.

If you like that kind of thing, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7170435/1/Bound-to-Him][Bound to Him]] is a pretty good Snape/Hermione. Voldemort decides he wants to spy on Harry and kidnaps Hermione during the summer and does an evil soul-bond thingy with her and Snape so that Snape can control her. Then they both have to live with it, which is rough on them both.

I like the way Resonance handles it maybe the best, pretty much Snape only gets a girlfriend because he's adopted Harry. She's a very mellow, accepting person and an accountant so more logical than most Magicals and yet without Harry in the mix as a family member it wouldn't work at all.
