The only good one is linkffn(1795399) - Resonance. It's the first part of a trilogy. It starts off iffy, but there's some seriously awesome magic in the story, as well as some Harry/Tonks. Naturally, if this fic didn't have Snape at all, it would be even better, but even so, it's still pretty good.
