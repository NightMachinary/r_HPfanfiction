It won't be abandoned.

I wouldn't have created this thread had I not had some measure of ... confidence - in my ability to finish it.

Funnily enough it started out in the another story I had in my head - where the main character is just in awe of the magical world - and it would end with platform 9.75 ... but it got kinda out of hand, so that main idea snowballed into a massive collective of ideas that I thought would work quite well together.
