On the other hand your changes better make sense

For example I read this Female!Harry fic last year it started nice and stuff made sense (how she was treated by everyone etc.) but then when Harry reaches hogwarts she can't do magic because (i don't remember but I remember it not making sense) the author didn't explain how harry becoming a girl made him unable to use magic, then dumbledore teaches her occulmancy, and her eyes become like emeralds or some bullshit... i dropped it right there.
