Pahahahahaha

Gemstone descriptions for eyes are /so/ last year.

I don't want to lavish my main character (MC) with descriptions, I'm hoping a vague description will be enough to fuel the reader into creating their own image.

Even now I thought of three ways that he could lose his magic via dick-girl transformation.

1) Male!Harry used his entire magical core to change gender permanently.

2) Male!Harry was naturally weak in magic, and women are less magically powerful (for some reason), thus "she" loses the dregs of magic "he" had in him.

3) His ability to control his magic was destroyed the moment he started thinking of himself a girl, with "him" not being "him" anymore etc...

My story is not even really a Harry Potter story, it's more of a brief look into Harry Potter, and perhaps some interference throughout, though should mostly be a stand-alone, independent of the main story-line.
