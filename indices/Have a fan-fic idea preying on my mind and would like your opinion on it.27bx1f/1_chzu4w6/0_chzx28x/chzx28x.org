1) We've probably read the same fics! I'm hoping I can make a pretty logical explanation for magic, more than simply swish-and-flick and say a word.

2) I would say it's more like a person with vision like the Hubble telescope looking at a petri-dish and saying "there's some colours and stuff", shouldn't be anything remotely impressive - at the start it will be like putting shapes into shape holes, before we move on to more complex things.

The MC will be trained - by different magical beings - specializing in a multitude of things, but she's also lazy and learns only what she likes to (Hermione would put her to shame almost everywhere etc... Hermione is more like a device to introduce complex ideas by "studying" - imo) - it works well within the original story so I'm not quite against it. In my own story, as said before the MC is more complex, thus why I wanted to add "booster" sessions of learning by having time being manipulated (I have a decent idea of how to implement this.)

3) Magical sensitivity will become a device in both runes/wards and travelling, so I try and view that as some kind of individual tale of it's own with the drama and whatnot thrown in to develop and snowball until some likely heroic action occurs... or some great misery is flung at our beloved MC.

I am hoping the magical sensitivity will be seen as /part/ of the MC (much like Harry's connection with LV), the travelling expands the plot and introduces newer ideas as well as expanding on those already briefly mentioned (such as runes and wards etc...). Oh yeh - did I mention I wanted to have a more thorough look at Gringotts bank?... and Diagon Alley is getting a relatively huge makeover...

I appreciate your answer though, it helped immensely in judging how subtle and creative I'll have to be to make this all come together realistically.
