I have no experience with writing, and only commenting as an avid reader - treating your comment like I would a story summary/intro if I was considering reading it, and what reactions it would elicit.

1) i've read a few fics that toyed with idea of magical sensitivity including powers like being able to feel enchantments on things/people, being able to identify who cast a spell or placed an enchantment by reading "magical signature", being able to forecast which spells are going to be cast by sensing patterns of magic at time of casting...

In all of them these powers made the MC overpowered and spoiled the story for me - and none of them really used these to their full advantage either.

2) Age-wise be careful about which years/age you choose to focus your story on - young age of MC severely restricts the topics you can plausibly weave into the story and very few authors can pull off a "realistic" kid MC without boring the readers. For example the whole "helping a wizard with centuries of experience in his research" - maybe plausible if MC is being used like a magical microscope and her contribution is describing what colors/patterns she sees. However that's going to be somewhat boring to read. On the other hand a girl pre-Hogwarts so age 10-ish or even a young teen being able to contribute anything else to Dumbles is like having a kid of that age assist Ph.Ds - going to get even more objections than HPMOR did about plausible intellect level of kids.

As age goes up, these "restrictions" disappear for most readers. If you are estimating only 50k story, you probably aren't going to be covering more than one year. For example you mentioned "no slash", meaning you are going to be trying to include some romance/sexual content somewhere in it of the hetero variety - so starting at pre-Hogwarts age 10 for MC might leave you 40k words into the story and still nowhere close to being able to start the romance bits, or really doing any of the "dark and cruel" stuff you mentioned without squicking off a lot of the reader base.

I don't know if you've read Firebird's Son or Grey Maiden story, but these are some examples, besides HPMOR, that come to my mind that involve young MC at age 11 but were still interesting to read without getting too implausible.

3) Stories that try to shuffle a deck full of ideas ending up with "everything but the kitchen sink" usually fail at all of them.

Best stories usually take 1 or 2 deviations from canon and expand on these deviations directly and gradually.

An OC outside perspective on the usual main characters is a good idea.

Magical sensitivity is a potentially good, separate idea.

Dumbledore singling out a young student for extra training is a third good separate idea.

Runes/wards 4th, Europe and and travelling magical world 5th...

that's already quite a lot to juggle together and fully "explore" each one. Any one of these by itself could make a good long story - so if you do 5 of them together, either some of them will feel tacked-on and underused or you are going to have to weave together 5 stories' worth of content. Doable if you are set on writing a long epic. But doing a good story with all of these elements in under 50k words is going be very hard (in fact I have yet to read a story under 50k that handled even half of that number well)

Most of all just remember that all critique/advice represents only a subset of views and it seems that a LOT of people read fanfic - pretty much anything you write is going to appeal to someone out there. So just get yourself into a mindset to disregard any input that impedes your writing and might prevent your story from ever getting written.
