  If you want to avoid the Mary Sue aspect, remove all mention of talent equal to... anyone.

Understood, I must say I didn't explicitly state that "X ranks even higher than Y in raw magical power" or some such nonsense. It was more of a passing remark from Minerva to Albus "She's astonishingly powerful for her age" (she's around 8 or 9 at this point, and been approached after it is assumed she can control it by herself).

I will be revising my opinion of Minerva (McGonagall) when I re-draft it meticulously. I should add that her being "sensitive" to magic innately - she is quite rare, and thus quite useful to magical establishments (spell making/St Mungo's Magical curses/Tomb raiding (awh yeah, hidden spell manuscripts and all that...).

I'm not even sure it'll be a "she", I was writing a faceless character at first and a female took form and molded best to what I wanted my character to be. I also don't really mention her looks more than in passing generalized ways, describing someone as button-nosed and having hair that fell like golden waterfalls doesn't tickle my fancy.

  The really spooky version

Gellert is indeed mentioned already in the fic!(passingly) Though due to what we know from the original books, I just can't imagine him as being cruel to a person he grew up with by tainting such a sacred memory (Ariana). It is quite the idea, though will not quite fit into my idea of the plot so far.

  Also, to make this relevant but new, I'd suggest placing the girl as older, like Tonks' age so she can interact with Bill, Charlie and others during a time when Albus was only watching Harry from afar.

Hmm, I had intended the character to be around 10 (but look 13 or so) and start Hogwarts, quite a bit of my more interesting ideas revolve around certain things happening early on before Harry appears.

Harry would hopefully be a passing character, I have ideas that could make the main character be away on interesting errands, curse-breaking and ward-assessing and all that jazz.

  ...if you're going to make a big story out of it to know at least in general how it will end. Otherwise you don't have a goal to write towards. During the writing, you can change the goal or even the purpose, but don't kick it off if you don't have an exit plan

I won't neglect the story - it has begun, and I enjoy the hell out of it so far. As I glue in my ideas into the plot I imagine I will get a brief glimpse of the finishing line - though I dare not speculate how that would be so far. I think it will be quite interesting though - I just wouldn't forgive myself if it was anything less than an epic wrapping-up, no matter how long it takes me to think of it, even if I have to re-write large parts and take stuff out to get what I want in the end, I will be content knowing I've justified my even starting the story :)
