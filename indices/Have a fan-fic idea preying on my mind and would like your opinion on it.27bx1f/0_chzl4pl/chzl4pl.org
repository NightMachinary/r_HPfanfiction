If you want to avoid the Mary Sue aspect, remove all mention of talent equal to... anyone.

You want to make her a special case in a way that doesn't conflict with Albus' reticence in directly teaching Harry, then make her a personal challenge for him. For instance, how much harder is it to learn magic if you can't hear or speak? If you choose to go this route, it might make sense to make the circumstance even more exceptional- she looks like Ariana, and has similar issues with control.

The really spooky version: Grindelwald escaped Nurmengard during Voldemort's first rise and cooked her up by using his mad alchemy skills and some of Ariana's hair that had been saved for just such a purpose- to screw with Albus. The headmaster isn't even aware of her until he sees Gellert on his annual visit and the man asks his old friend if Gellert's 'daughter' can come to Hogwarts, now that she must be approaching school age.

Also, to make this relevant but new, I'd suggest placing the girl as older, like Tonks' age so she can interact with Bill, Charlie and others during a time when Albus was only watching Harry from afar.

As [[/u/Bulwersator][u/Bulwersator]] mentioned, it's important if you're going to make a big story out of it to know at least in general how it will end. Otherwise you don't have a goal to write towards. During the writing, you can change the goal or even the purpose, but don't kick it off if you don't have an exit plan..
