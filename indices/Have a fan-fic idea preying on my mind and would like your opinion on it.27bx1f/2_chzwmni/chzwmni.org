I'll just give you some general advice just on reading your ideas here.

- You need a plot. You have a lot of ideas for your MC, but if you base everything around your MC, you will quickly abandon your story. You're going to need a plot. A beginning, middle, and end. Other characters. All of the details don't have to be filled in, but the worst thing you can do is create your main character and have nothing else. Lots of good ideas about runes and time travel manipulation but these are just ideas. Whenever you first start penning your fic, you need to have more than just a main character and things you want your main character to do. The ideas with runes and time manipulation are just background things. Ideas that set the rules for the world. They are not the actual plot.

- I'd strongly suggest aging your characters. First year rewrites are boring. Eleven year olds talking and holding grand conversations with Dumbledore are implausible at best. Dumbledore teaches, he mentors. Your MC might have other ideas, but for the most part, your MC will listen and absorb.

- Just give it a shot. If this is your first fic, you're going to look back at it and hate yourself. You're never going to get better if you don't write. Ask for feedback, negative and positive. Ignore the trolls but don't mistake everyone as a troll. You can only get better
