My first idea of this meeting was to do with preparing defenses for the Philosophers Stone, which will not be as in the original timeline (really, flying keys?)

Quirrel will be quite interesting, though to my dismay I don't think he should become a genius - merely a semi-capable stuttering mess - with ulterior motives obviously...

How the main character finds the two elder wizards is quite one of my better ideas for the story, I don't know how Flamel will fit into the story, I don't think I want him to be more than a very intelligent, intensely private man (he's just too interesting as a character to avoid completely).

I'm focusing more on Dumbledore the man, and the genius wizard. I will expand on why he is "the only one you-know-who" feared.
