I have three ideas as how to start it; Very dark, dark, and somewhat light. The age of the MC I thought would best create sympathy for the character, there are a few ideas with time manipulation that would age her beyond her years. I have only a few ideas for relationships, and they are mostly ...tragic - a device to destroy young naivete also.

  I would have difficulty believing in an 11 year old developing new magics without you portraying her as a super genius.

As do I!

Which is why she will have a remarkable amount of experience, and spend a lot less time in Hogwarts. She'll be pretty intelligent, and have a huge interest in warding and protecting people - due to one of my more friendly plot twists...

There is also an idea floating around for speeding her aging by a few years - it fits well with what I had planned to happen in the story.

In addition to that... it's like imagining a snooker player who can see the required trajectory of the ball before he takes a shot... or something, all she needs to know is what the things she sees means, then the hardest part is building a foundation of knowledge about it all.

  As a reader, the primary reason why I will stop reading a fic midway is when characters seem implausible for their age.

I won't have it online until I'm confident with it, and have had a couple people I know read it.

Even as I write this I have many tabs open that I'm learning from to make my own portrayal of the child appear more authentic and natural. I imagine it will take three to four revisions until I'm satisfied. I don't begin the first major and complete revision until I have around 40,000 words (at 10,000 now). If I really enjoy it and think it's a charming story by then, then I might just make it a shorter story and not include other stuff. If not I'll continue as scheduled :)

  Another issue that could arise is the relationship with Dumbledore and how that affects the other interactions with characters. I can't really see justifying a a very personal relationship between the two and Dumbledore showing such interest in her if she isn't some kind of prodigy, but then it can difficult for her have 'normal' interactions with other students and such.

Instead of a "prodigy" or "gifted", a more appropriate term would be "freak of nature", something massively rare. Thus Dumbledore is curious, and will help her moderately - they will develop a bond like teacher / student. Normal interactions with other students will be minimal in my opinion. I hope she turns out normal in the end, as the story seems to write itself despite my nudging.
