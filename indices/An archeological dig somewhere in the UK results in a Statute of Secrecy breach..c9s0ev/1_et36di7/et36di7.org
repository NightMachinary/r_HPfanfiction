"Here in the Scottish Highlands we have an entirely unique opportunity on Time Team. Behind me you can see the crumbling ruins of a massive, previously unknown castle.

With no roads leading to the area its discovery was by complete happenstance as hobby archeologist, Philip Grey came across the ruins on a back country hiking trip. Philip originally wanted to go poking around himself, but as he got closer and he felt the urge to leave immediately and call us in to investigate.

So what do we have? A norman keep? Or something later? As usual we have three days to find out, starting with a quaint little village just down from the ruins, which suddenly sounds much smarter of a place to go than up on the ruins themselves. Let's see what we can find out before bringing out geophys and putting in our first trenches."
