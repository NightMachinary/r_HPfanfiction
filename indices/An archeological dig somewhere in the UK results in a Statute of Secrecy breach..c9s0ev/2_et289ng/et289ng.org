Here's a little drabble. Admittedly I'm not much of a writer though, so the idea is probably better than its execution.

"I can't make any sense of these runestones," Sven said. "Solveig, would you have a look at them for me?"

Sven's old norse was still a bit sketchy, but when Solveig looked equally puzzled, he felt the excitement that only a new discovery could evoke.

"How peculiar," said Solveig. "These inscriptions are, in artistic style as well as content, like no others I've seen before. The sentences contain grammatical errors I'd expect from my French students."

"You mean they could be a forgery?" asked Sven disappointedly.

"No, I don't think so. It appears more like a group of Norman conquerors got re-assimilated into a norse culture."

"But why would they, when the Normans defeated the Norwegians?" asked Sven.

"That's what we have to find out."

Solveig stepped beyond the runestone. Suddenly, a blinding flash of red appeared in front of them and hit Solveig square in the chest. She was knocked off her feet and thrown several meters backwards. She was unconscious, but Sven could feel both a pulse and her breathing.

He quickly called emergency services. But before he could finish his phone call, a man with long red hair, a younger black-haired man and a short blonde woman, all dressed in ancient-looking robes, appeared out of thin air.

"I am Bill Weasley, curse breaker for the Ministry of Magic. And there are Harry Potter of the Auror office, and Healer Astoria Greengrass.

Whatever had hit Solveig must also have messed with his own head, thought Sven. This made no sense whatsoever. Well, the doctor would be there in a few minutes.

"I am hallucinating," said Sven to himself.

"You aren't," the man called Harry Potter said. "Us wizards usually keep our world hidden from non-magical people like you. I only learnt that I was a wizard on my eleventh birthday. I couldn't believe it either at first."

The woman whom Mr Weasley had introduced as Healer Greengrass had turned her attention to the unconscious Solveig.

"Some archaic form of the stunning spell. She's in no immediate danger, so I won't risk a counter-curse until you've had a look at those runestones," Healer Greengrass told Mr Weasley.

"What's your name," Mr Potter asked Sven.

"Sven Andersson," he said.

"Alright, Mr Andersson. I am an Auror, which is something like a wizard policeman. Please tell me everything about this accident as well as you remember."

Sven recounted the accident, hoping that he had not violated any magical laws.

"You have nothing to fear from magical law enforcement," Mr Potter assured him. "We do not persecute muggles for stumbling on magic."

Meanwhile, Solveig had regained consciousness and Healer Greengrass was giving her some sort of wizard medicine to drink, which apparently tasted not very good. Mr Weasley was still studing the runestones and was bombarding Solveig with questions regarding their ongoing excavations.

"So I wasn't all that far off with my initial hypothesis," Solveig said to Mr Weasley. "Norman witches and wizards came to England, where they copied the use of runes in magical inscriptions."

"Exactly," he said.

"Should I call the obliviators," Healer Greengrass asked.

"Fuck the obliviators," Mr Weasley said. "These two have made the discovery of their lifetime. It would be cruel to take it from them."

"Obliviators?" asked Sven Mr Potter.

"Due to persecution in the past, us wizards keep our existence secret from muggles - non-magical people like you. Obliviators erase the memories of muggles who have stumbled of magic, like you. I am uncomfortable with the practice, but I don't have the power to go against the International Confederation of Wizards."

"There is another option," Bill said. "Under the Research Cooperation Act of 2001 I can invite qualified muggles to create a joint working group. As an accomplished caster of the Fidelius Charm, I am capable of ensuring compliance with the statute of secrecy."
