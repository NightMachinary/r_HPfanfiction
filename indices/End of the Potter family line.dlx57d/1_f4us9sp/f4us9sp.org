James Potter is son of Fleamont and Euphemia Potter, not Charlus Potter as fanon assumed for the longest time before JKR said otherwise.

If Charlus and Dorea Potter were Harry's great uncle and aunt, and they had their own kids, then there would still be Potters around.

On the other hand, JKR handwaved all Potter and Evans relatives to be dead, just so Harry would have no one to raise him but the Dursleys. This makes no sense, because wizards can live up to 150 years old, and James and Lily were only 21 when they died. But Word of God, I guess. ðŸ™„
