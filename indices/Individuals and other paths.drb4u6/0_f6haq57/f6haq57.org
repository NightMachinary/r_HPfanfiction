I'm super bored so I'll bite.

  Do you agree with me?

No.

  Are the charecters too codependent
#+end_quote

No, the point of series is that the hero inspires the people around him (see Harry consistently give Neville confidence boosts from book 1 to the end) while also realizing he needs the help of those very people. This not only separates him from Voldemort but also Dumbledore to an extent.

  Feel underdeveloped after the Fourth book
#+end_quote

Yes, but not for most of your reasons. It's the holding of the idiot ball for plot.

#+begin_quote
  does Harry's sudden skills in combat feel forced and undeserved
#+end_quote

No. Harry, Ron, and Hermione go through books for the entire month of June in preparation for the 3rd task. Starting from PS we see he is quick on his feet and from CoS we see he can pick up defensive and offensive spells quickly. He reads the books Sirius and Remus give him for Christmas as well as the Prince's book the next year. We see him engage with Lupin in PoA over more than the Patronus. Harry reads when and what he wants, but he reads.

#+begin_quote
  Neville was way too ignored
#+end_quote

No. Neville is a background character we see often enough. In fact, one could say we know more about his early life and family than we do Hermione's.

Just a few more points: Hermione is as dismissive of Quidditch as Harry and everyone else, including Neville, are of SPEW. Hermione also snaps at him both in PoA and HBP when she and Ron are fighting. Even if he doesn't enjoy her company (JKR did her best to make them incompatible), he /does/ try to spend time with her when she and Ron are at odds.

  He would be a great person to work on her social issues
#+end_quote

The blind leading the blind. That Neville/Hermione paragraph also strips Harry of a good bit of post GoF character growth and the Harry-Neville dynamic. I didn't know it wasn't super obvious Harry had a hand in Neville's growth and vice versa.

  Lets see who he is without the world holding his hand

We saw it in the graveyard when he threw off the Imperius, overpowered Voldemort's wand, and brought Cedric's body back.
