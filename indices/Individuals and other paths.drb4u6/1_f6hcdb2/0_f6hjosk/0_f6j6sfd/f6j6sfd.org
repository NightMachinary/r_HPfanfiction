It's very gracious of you to now acknowledge Harry did accomplish something in years 2 and 3. I still strongly disagree that his hand was held throughout the series.

Yes, he definitely had a few get out of jail free cards that saved his ass a few times in the books. The only reason those protections came into play at all was because Harry stood and fought, repeatedly, despite the odds being against him.

Yes, the dual cores saved Harry in the grave yard. You disregard the fact that Harry chose to stand and fight instead of giving up or trying to run after watching Cedric be murdered, being tortured by cruciatus several times, fighting off the imperius, and having to face 10+ adult wizards. After all this he was still able to keep his head enough to summon the cup and bring Cedric's body back. How you can ignore this is crazy to me.

Like I said previously, it's like we read two entirely different book series.
