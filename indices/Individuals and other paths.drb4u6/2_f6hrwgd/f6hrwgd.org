I agree that the DA's skills seemed a little forced and came to quickly. A year of practicing school spells for an hour a week and then six kids can take on a bunch of death eaters who are highly skilled and dangerous.

See what Harry is like without the world holding his hand. Don't know about that, Sure he gets lucky and he needed to to do what he did but saying that the wirld held his hand every step of the way is just completely destroying all his struggles. Second, fourth and fifth year he was ostracised by the school and left on his own, Hermione petrified in second and Ron leaving fir the start of fourth. You make Harry out to be exactly how Snape sees him.
