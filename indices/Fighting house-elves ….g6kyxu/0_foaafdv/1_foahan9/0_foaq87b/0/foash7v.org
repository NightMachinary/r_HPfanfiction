Because its completely unnecessary, Canon already has the frequently used term of 'protective enchantments' to describe such things, using wards is like replacing the word wizard with mage. I am not going to drop a fic over it,. But it will certainly make me feel like the writer has gotten lost in fanon to the point that they dont know the canon words anymore. It has even gotten so bad that multiple people I have discussed things with didn't even know what I mean by using the term protective enchantments in the context of Harry Potter.
