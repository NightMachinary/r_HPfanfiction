  But "protective spells" isn't quite the same as "permanent protective spells".

Neither are wards, and in canon the same spells seem to be used for temporary or permanent protection.

  (Not to mention that JKR uses "warding off" herself - a step to "wards" isn't really much in that case.)

That was in the context of Luna claiming a magical plant stops 'Gulping Plimpies', we both know that this isn't the context warding is used in fanfics.
