I ever only seen mage used as a gender-neutral term for witch and wizard because writing â€˜witches and wizards' every time is long and redundant, just writing wizard is not really inclusive of the witches because I don't think it was ever used as an umbrella term (is that the right word?) and magic-user is... ish at best. Considering that the books already have the words witch/wizard, sorcerer/sorceress and Warlock, I don't see why the word mage couldn't be included as a gender neutral term.
