That could work, too. I'm just so much engrained in the educational/title pyramid for witches and wizards that don't necessarily think about something's possible meaning or potential meaning. In my head it's: N.E.W.T.s level of education, Mastery level, Doctor of Sorcery, Grand Sorcerer/Sorceress, Archmage. Of course, you need multiple Masteries and Doctors to become a Grand Sorcerer like Dumbledore, and you need to be trained by an already existing Archmage and do ground-breaking discoveries or innovations in a specific field of magic to become one. At this point, if you're an Archmage - in my headcanon - you've become some kind of Cardinal Elector of Magic. Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel would be Archmages, but Dumbledore is only a Grand Sorcerer. Not one of them is under the age of 110 so much it takes work to become one.
