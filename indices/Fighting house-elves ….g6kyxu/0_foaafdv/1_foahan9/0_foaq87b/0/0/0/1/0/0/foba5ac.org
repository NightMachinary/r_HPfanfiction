Not just that. Lupin also talked about "warding off dementors" when he offered Harry training.

And in canon, when a spell is permanent, it's mentioned - as in the case of the Permanent Sticking Charm holding the portrait of Sirius's mother to the wall in Grimmauld Place.

(Not to mention that the use of wards adds to the world. Not everyone wants to limit themselves to what JKR wrote.)
