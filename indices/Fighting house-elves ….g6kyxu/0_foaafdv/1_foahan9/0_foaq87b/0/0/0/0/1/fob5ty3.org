The only time I can remember mage being used in fanfiction, it's been a title/descriptor for very powerful magic users. Eg, Dumbledore would be powerful enough to be a mage, as well as Flamel and Merlin previously. That seems like a rather fitting way to do it to me - though using it for a magic user regardless of gender could work great too.
