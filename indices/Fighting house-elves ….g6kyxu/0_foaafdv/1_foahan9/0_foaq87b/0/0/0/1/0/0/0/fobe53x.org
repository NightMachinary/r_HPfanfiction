  Not just that. Lupin also talked about "warding off dementors" when he offered Harry training.

That still isn't the same context fans use ward in, like nobody when reading a fanfic sees the word ward and think of the patronus charm.

  And in canon, when a spell is permanent, it's mentioned - as in the case of the Permanent Sticking Charm holding the portrait of Sirius's mother to the wall in Grimmauld Place.

Apperantly not in the case of protective enchantments since the spells Harry and Hermione used are the same ones that are used permanently for other locations, like the muggle repelling charm.

  (Not to mention that the use of wards adds to the world. Not everyone wants to limit themselves to what JKR wrote.)

So instead of using one of multiple terms used in canon you instead only use a single one, how is that not just limiting yourself even more?
