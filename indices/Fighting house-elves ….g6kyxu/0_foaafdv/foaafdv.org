It would've been a very "why didn't they call the elves for their war much sooner?" moment if the elves could have snapped all the Death Eaters around.

As it is, it strains my SoD that elves can apparate through wards (or, permanent magical defences for the anal fanboys) and no on, ever, used them to save all their friends under attack.

"Death Eaters are attacking us!"

"Call the emergency elves!"

/Pop pop/

"Give Dobby hands! Give Twinky hands"

/Pop pop/

Or do that to lay down some Fiendfyre in Malfoy Manor and have the elf get you out.

(I tend to change elves into not being able to do that stuff in my stories.)
