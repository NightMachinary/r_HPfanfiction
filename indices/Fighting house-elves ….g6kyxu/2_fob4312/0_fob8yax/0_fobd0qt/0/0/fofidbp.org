I'm not sure how that relates... What I meant above is that sane elves would find the idea of magically attacking a wizard or transporting a wizard to be unthinkable, and be shocked and horrified at the suggestion. You could still /order/ them to do it, but many would consider that order worse than how the Malfoys treated Dobby.

As far as wards, my understanding is that wizards just don't bother to consider or understand other races' magic, and so don't have any wards against such. House-Elves in particular aren't something they'd ward against - why ward against the furniture?

In terms of making use of House-Elves, the above explanation comes into play again - people just don't think about them (and most of the people that own them are on Team Evil and thus especially closed-minded).
