My point is that even if elves would find the idea of attacking a wizard abhorrent, why would they have problems with saving wizards by separating them out of danger? Or transporting wizards, say, to the basement of Malfoy Manor, where the wizard cast Fiendfyre before thee elf transports them out again?

If elves are truly as powerful as shown in the books, not using their talents makes no sense. I can accept that most wizards won't realise how powerful they are. I can even accept that the first time anyone realised it was when Dobby had his moment in the spotlight.

But afterwards? How stupid does every character, on both sides of the war, you have to be to not realise how useful and powerful elves are? After Dobby demonstrated it by saving the trio?
