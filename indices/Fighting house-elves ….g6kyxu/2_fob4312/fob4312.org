I figure that it's because Dobby is, at least by House Elf standards, insane. For any Larry Niven fans, think something like Nessus.

Attacking Harry, attacking Lucius with magic, carrying people out of Malfoy Manor - these are things that would be as abhorrent to a normal House Elf as something like cannibalism would be to a normal human.
