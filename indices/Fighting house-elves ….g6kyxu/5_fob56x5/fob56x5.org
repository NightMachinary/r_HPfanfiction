I always like the explication given in linkffn(The Arithmancer) which I think fits very well with wizards in canon: house-elves are simply overlooked. People don't think about them because they are a fixture associated with cooking and cleaning and people don't honk them capable of other things. But Hermione, who in her first year explored the castle and discovered the house-elves' quarters, became friends and learned more about them than possibly every other witch or wizard except perhaps for Dumbledore and Hufflepuff herself. House-elves are used greatly in this story and towards the end even the likes of the Malfoy learn about the threat they pose and ward their manor against undesirable elves.
