First of all, dude, seriously, how fast do you read? You start like daily 10 new request posts. I'm really impressed... it usually takes me like a month or so to read a 100k word story.

Secondly, I hate lord Potter Black stories because the trope is so talked about that I get sick of it. I've read some parodies, but probably the closest to the trope serious one that I ever read was Harry Crow and even for that I only read like the first two chapter and then the conclusion. But if I recall... even that one didn't have lordships and stuff (or maybe I missed the part).
