Depending on how busy you are, and your domain over the english language, reading speed can be surprisingly fast.

The prologue of one of my favorite fics is 51 pages / 26,105 words long. It takes about 40 to 50 minutes to read.

I still remember reading OotP during one school night because I didn't have money for it and a friend let me borrow it.
