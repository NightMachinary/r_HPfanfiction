A fanfic where Harry's friendship with Luna helps her become more sane and stable would be nice as well. Seriously, Luna's personality in the book makes me seriously uncomfortable sometimes.

She is basically a conspiracy theorist being played for laughs, but remember that Alex Jones is not joking.
