Alex Jones? Apart from that, nah. I'm all for leaning into the insanity. It would at least be fun, and better than most where she's either as you said played for laughs, or a prophet. I like fics where Luna is the way she is, because she just sees more. Maybe because of her mothers death having such an impact that it broke her in a significant enough manner that her mind just doesn't work like a normal persons, and because of that mixed with magic it allowed her to see, and understand more that our minds would protect us from by making us ignore. That or she does it for shits and giggles. Both is good.
