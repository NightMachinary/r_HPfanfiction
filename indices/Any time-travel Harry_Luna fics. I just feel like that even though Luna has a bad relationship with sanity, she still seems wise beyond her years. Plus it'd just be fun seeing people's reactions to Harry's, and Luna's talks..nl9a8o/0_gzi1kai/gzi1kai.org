I love Harry/luna, and I love her brand of reality disconnection, but it think my favorite ever explanation I've seen behind crumpled horned snorkacks is that Luna walked in on her parents doing the dirty, and they explained they were looking for crumple horned snorkacks, and even though she knows what it is now, she and her dad still go on expeditions to try and find them as a way of remember her mother's unique way of looking at the world, and as family bonding, and I just thought that was really sweet.
