If you don't mind renamed Fem!Harry, Engineer4Ever has some really good ones. A bunch of different fics/series in various stages of completion with Harry being a daughter of each of the Big Three. Linkffn(11324421), linkffn(10793290), linkffn(11309061). They were all great and I highly recommend reading them all. Ever Twisting Wind (Zeus) has 3 fics, Unrelenting Frozen Seas (Poseidon) has 2, and Consul of the Underworld (Hades) also has 2. All the “Harry's” have super different personalities, but if you read them all at once, they do tend to blend all together a bit. That's the only downside.
