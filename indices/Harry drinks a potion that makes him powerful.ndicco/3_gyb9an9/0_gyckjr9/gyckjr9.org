Actually I always wondered... considering that the TWT is a competition of magical prowess, resourcefulness and skill... would taking Felix Felicis if you could prove you actually brewed it be considered as not cheating? I mean being one of the most complicated and dangerous in case of failure potions it should definitely prove a point should you use it successfully.
