If large squids and octopuses can attack and kill sharks (apex predators) in RL then I can easily see the giant squid beating a dragon. The key would be having the squid drag the dragon to the deepest part of the lake. Having the battle underwater puts the dragon at a disadvantage. How much of a disadvantage depends on how deep the lake is and how long you believe a dragon who doesn't normally spend any time underwater can hold it's breath.

Any and all activity would start reducing that time frame. Then the beak of an octopus or squid is very strong and many species use poison. So if the squid can get positioned on the dragon's back you either have poison injected or the potential for the backbone/spinal column being severed. At a minimum you may have one or both of the wings broken making it harder for the dragon to get out of the water.

Depending on their relative strengths and speed the simplest attack maybe grabbing the dragon's tail, pulling the dragon deep underwater and then rapidly dragging the dragon backwards through the water. By being underwater you may have eliminated the dragon's fire as most stories have them breathing in large amounts of air before blowing out flames.

You can also think about use of the terrain. Is there an underwater cave where the squid can fit but only part of the dragon fits. If so and the squid has the initial strength to drag the dragon underwater retreating into that cave trying to wedge the backend of the dragon in there and then holding on until the dragon drowns might work. It would also keep the dragon from using it's primary weapons of teeth and flame.

Now of course all of the above is predicated on the dragon ending up in the water. If not, the fight can go to the dragon but the squid needs to be in shallower water where it's head is susceptible to flame. Or where the dragon can land on the squids head and use flame, teeth and claws to rip into the squid's head where it can tear it apart (inside the mantle are the heart and gills) and close to the mantle but above the eyes are the squid's brain. Since the squid is a soft body that shouldn't be an issue.

So the squid wins if it can keep the dragon from attacking it's mantle/brain and getting the dragon underwater. The dragon wins if it can get stay above water as much as possible and can attack the mantle/brain
