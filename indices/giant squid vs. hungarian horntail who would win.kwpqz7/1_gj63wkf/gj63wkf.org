As some have stated. It could go either way.

That squid gets a good grip and drags the dragon under? Odds are it would end up drowning in its struggles to fight the squid off. Even if it grieviously injured the squid in the process, it would be wasting oxygen trying to flail and bite.

That dragon manages to pull the squid *out*? That's charbroiled calamari boys.

It's like the lion vs a shark. It comes down to where the majority of the fight occurs.
