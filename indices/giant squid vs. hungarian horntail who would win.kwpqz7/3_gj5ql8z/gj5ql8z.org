It'd be more awesome-looking the other way around, IMO. Either Harry riding the Giant Squid into the arena with the Horntail, or the Giant Squid leaping from the water and fighting the Horntail in the air. :D

Giant Squid is actually a specific species. Their 'giantness' is about ten meters in length. As is the 'Colossal Squid', incidentally. Though they're only a few meters longer.

Squids are also presumed to be mostly ambush predators rather than toe-to-toe fighters.

In terms of whether it could win, I guess it'd depend on whether you think Dragon Scale can be cut by the teeth along the Squid's tentacles or broken by them clubbing or squeezing. If it can't, then the fight is over pretty quickly on account of the Squid not being able to do anything and Dragon scale canonically being magic resistant. Also whether Dragonfire would work underwater or if the Dragon would be hurt by water getting inside it. Given that Dragons are fictional and the HP Dragons in no way follow the Speculative Biology guesswork at whether or not a Dragon could naturally exist, I'd say that's all up to you. I personally can see arguments for both sides.
