Well. The entire dragon can't possibly be 100% impenetrable. Even in canon it's told that key points on the body are notably weak. The inside of the mouth. The eyes. The nose. The ears on some species (one or two have external ear openings). Hell, even the wing membranes on some species are said to be a touch weaker than the scales (don't remember where I read that part, but it does make sense. No scales on the membrane and it's relatively thin.)

You also need to account *what* is said to be in effective. Spells. Dragons are told to be essentially immune to most spells. They are *not* said to be immune to crushing forces, physical harm, and the like.

So yeah. If you account that it's entirely likely dragons aren't as immune to physical attacks, it's completely possible the squid could bite through some locations. A handful of specific points come to mind, like the underside of the neck, the place where the wings of legs connect to the body. Essentially anywhere the body needs a high degree of articulation physical couldn't be heavily armored, not without sacrificing mobility it would need to move around.

Also, the giant squid in canon is something far more akin to a Kraken. From what I can remember just one tentacle was like 40 odd feet in length. It's a massive animal by any account. Black lake being presumably fresh water, it couldn't be a regular giant squid by any means, without being magical in some way.
