linkffn(11446957) A Cadmean Victory. Harry is overly angsty at first, but imo the fic gets better once he and Fleur finally get together.

linkao3(863648) Sarcasm and Slytherin. Probably won't like it if you hate WBWL fics and associated tropes (bashing of James/Dumbledore), but it does have a truly grey Harry Potter, as in neutral between Dumbledore and (a non pureblood-supremacist) Voldemort.
