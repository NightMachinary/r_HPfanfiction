Everytime I see this fic I also see it get a lot of pushback for it. There was a lot of anti-religion in the early chapters. There was a lot of ubder age sex in the early chapters. Student/teacher, student/student, the author held nothing in reserve. If you missed these incredibly obvious flags, you have only yourself to blame. Harry is an absolute cunt in this story and makes no efforts to change that behavior. He lets Voldemort run free because he has research to do. He brushes off Dumbledore because he doesn't respect him. He lets Sirious die in a egyption tomb because it was an easy way out. He uses a blood curse on a Mosque to fascilitate anti muslim sentiment in europe, to stop immigration-friendly policies from being implemented. He goes to a live TV interview and claims to be able to accomplish all the miracles that Jesus did.

I think that people took it entirely too seriously, especially for what it is. Worse, people got invested in it and felt betrayed when they realised the lack of depth, and distinct anti-religious tones weren't just there to spice up the story and make Harry 'original'.

It's not any sort of commentary, or great work of art. It's a semi-self insert powerwank, with quality grammar and a consistent update schedule. The dude who writes it is a self-confessed shutin who claims to not be in contact with regular people, by choice.

If you treat the story as anything else, you will be dissapointed. Very dissapointed. Despite all these very obvious faults, it is well written, well thought out, and absolutely hilarious. Everytime the Harry spouts off about the stupidity of religion, and by extension the people who practice it, I laugh. It's hilarious.

At one point, Harry puts a curse on a Mosque in order to drive out Muslim immigrants in Europe. He uses his own blood to do it. The sheer gall of writing this situation displays just how hilariously hateful Harry is. In my opinion, it's on the level of my immortal, but with actual grammar.

If anyone bothered, the Author made a sequel where this same Harry goes to the world of A Song of Ice and Fire. Harry procedes to beat the crap out of the new Gods, and study the heck out of the Old Gods. There is no respect, just arrogance and the power to back it up.

Granted, the under age sex was also just as over the top, but that's to be expected, it's not like the author held back on that part either.
