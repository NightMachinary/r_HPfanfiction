Even that's a stretch, to be honest. I'm not going to say that atheism is new, or anything, but it certainly didn't become quite so normal until much later than the early 90s.

I was raised Christian, so perhaps this is a bit of confirmation theory in action, but I don't recall ever hearing anyone talk about atheism in the 90s.
