It's not as if anyone talks about Atheism here in Western Europe - it's just that we don't give a damn about Religion, apart from a tiny minority.

Here are some [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_Kingdom#Attendance][statistics]].

  "Society in the United Kingdom is markedly more secular than it was in the past and the number of churchgoers fell over the second half of the 20th century.[64] The Ipsos MORI poll in 2003 reported that 18% were "a practising member of an organised religion".[59] The Tearfund Survey in 2007 found that only 7% of the population considered themselves as practising Christians. Some 10% attended church weekly and two-thirds had not gone to church in the past year.[24][65] The Tearfund Survey also found that two-thirds of UK adults (66%) or 32.2 million people had no connection with the Church at present (nor with another religion). These people were evenly divided between those who have been in the past but have since left (16 million) and those who have never been in their lives (16.2 million)."

It's not a recent development, [[http://www.vexen.co.uk/UK/religion.html][according to this site:]]

  Religion in Britain has suffered an immense general decline since the 1950s. Between 1979 and 2005, half of all Christians stopped going to church on a Sunday. Four in five britons want religion to be private, not public, and have no place in politics5. All indicators show a continued secularisation of British society in line with other European countries such as France.
