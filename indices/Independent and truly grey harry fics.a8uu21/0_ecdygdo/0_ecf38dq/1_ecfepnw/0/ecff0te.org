I've gotten so used to seeing the same plot points in HP fanfiction that I find myself reading 100k words per day easy. Not because I've gotten "better" or "faster" at reading, simply because I can skim over so much of it without missing anything.

I find myself making the same mistake as you sometimes and wonder if the two aren't somehow related. Like I'm skimming over the same requests over and over because my brain tells me it's not important and then I end up missing tiny differences which would render my normal recommendations useless.
