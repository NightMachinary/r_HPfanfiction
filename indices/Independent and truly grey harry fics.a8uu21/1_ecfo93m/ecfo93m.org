I'd say linkffn(For Love of Magic) is close, Harry is a bit too evil to be 'truly gray'.

The rest is all there though:

Harry starts above average but improves himself constantly and ends very powerful.

Harry is entirely independent to the point of basically being a faction unto himself.

He isn't adopted by nor does he like snape.

He doesn't get with or even like Ginny or Hermoine.
