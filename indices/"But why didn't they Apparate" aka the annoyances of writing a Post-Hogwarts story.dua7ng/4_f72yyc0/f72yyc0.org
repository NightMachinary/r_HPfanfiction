Why not just apparate, why not just buy supplies and multiply them, why not just ask a house elf? Harry Potter magic was written with so many plot holes that you can fill in whatever magic answer you want.

Or just hand them the idiot ball. For the werewolf example, they panicked and forgot apparation was a thing. Kinda like how I panicked and forgot that scissors were a thing when confronted by packaging.
