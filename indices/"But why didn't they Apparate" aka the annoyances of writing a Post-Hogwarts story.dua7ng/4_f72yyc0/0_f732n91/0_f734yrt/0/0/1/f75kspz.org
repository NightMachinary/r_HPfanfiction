Sending any teenager into a grocery story and expecting them to come out being able to make a good meal is a bit of a reach, I think. Unless the teenager has experience cooking, which Harry maybe has, but doesn't seem to have the mind to try very hard, being the most comfortable with hunger and so focused on Horcruxes. If we're talking about non-perishables, then I'm on your side, but turning that into tasty hot food is another beast.
