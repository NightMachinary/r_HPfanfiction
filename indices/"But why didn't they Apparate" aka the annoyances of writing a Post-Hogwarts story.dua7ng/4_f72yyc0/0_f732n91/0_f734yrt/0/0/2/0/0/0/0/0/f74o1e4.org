Oh, thank you!! I had so many issues with CA:CW and it frustrates me how most people I talk to think it's some masterpiece. It wasn't a bad movie, but aside from all the issues you just mentioned, it was such an abrupt tonal shift from every other Marvel movie that preceded it that it was kind of obvious that CA3 became CA:CW way too late in the production process. It was totally motivated by marketing and not what the narrative called for. I didn't even like the original Civil War arc in the comics, but it was better executed than /that/ whole mess.
