hee, I'm that obvious huh? :D yeah, it's Captain America Civil War. The writers said the only reason they did all the stuff they did to Tony throughout the film, broke him and Pepper up, crippled Rhodey, threw every other Avenger against him on the accords, etc etc, was to pull every possible source of emotional support out from under him, so he would snap when he found out Steve had been lying to him all this time about his parents' deaths. Lazy writing, imho.
