  You can argue any plothole away with "perhaps XYZ and just nobody mentioned it". That doesn't make it any less of a plothole.

I tend to think the word plothole is overrused to describe things that /could/ be explained, and while in theory I'm okay when words change meaning, I still feel it's useful to differentiate between "can plausibly be explained" and "cannot plausibly be explained" when discussing writing, and "plothole" seems to be shifting from meaning just one of those things, to now meaning both of those things, and it's causing a bit of confusion in these sorts of conversations.
