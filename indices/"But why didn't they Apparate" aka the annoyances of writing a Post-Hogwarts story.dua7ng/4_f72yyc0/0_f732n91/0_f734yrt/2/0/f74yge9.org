If the ministry could track them the moment they entered any urban area then that should have been mentioned in the book as a reason for staying in the woods. You can argue any plothole away with "perhaps XYZ and just nobody mentioned it". That doesn't make it any less of a plothole.

Regarding the food, you can buy meals in cans that you just need to heat up. They aren't what they are uses from Hogwarts or Molly's cooking but they are /fine/. Definitely leagues above what they had.

And you'd think that Hermione, who seemed to be prepared for so much and packed everything she thought she might possibly need in her bag, would have had the foresight to also pack some non-perishable food because she /knew/ that she can't create food with magic and it is completely unreasonable to think that you can just live off the land /if you never learned how to do that/.
