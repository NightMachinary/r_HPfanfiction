You know those 5 minute instant soups whichoonly require hot water to prepare? Or all kinds of canned meals which don't taste bad (eg ravioli) and only require to be heated?

They would have done the job better than whatever the trio was having. Get a few spices on top, or mix the soups, and you can further improve your food options. Without any cooking ability whatsoever.
