  My usual go to is during Deathly Hallows, the argument over lack of food. You can multiply food you already have, so why did muggle born and normally raised Hermione not think "hey, let's get some non-perishable food from an Asda in a muggle town and just multiply it for dinner"

Because they had plenty of food? Their conversation about not being able to magic up food was in the context of having fish and mushrooms.

Their problem wasn't lack of food, it was that they didn't know how to make it into something nice to eat.

And presumably the reason they didn't go buy food was because they were in hiding and thought that if they entered a Muggle area the Ministry would know. We have a very small knowledge of the Ministry's tracking abilities in canon, but they seem to be extensive - it may well be that the Ministry would be all over them the moment they entered any urban area.
