If they had a way to freeze the food, then I think that would work, but I imagine multiplying food does not make it fresher, so it would still have the original foods' expiration date, and therefore would still go bad within days/weeks, depending on the food, still requiring frequent (and possibly dangerous) trips without their Invisibility Cloak. Having said that, non-perishable and freezing the food solves part of this problem. (although eating snack bars, dry cereal, and canned stuff long term doesn't sound too fun on my stomach, but probably hungry teenagers wouldn't mind it so much).

But I also highly suspect they did not actually have too much trouble with food over the long run. Of course it was worse and more complicated than what they were used to, but that's to be expected. We know they entered towns when they could to scout and stuff, and while we only see Harry do it once unsuccessfully, it is implied that this is something they do regularly, and that Harry's lack of success is what is notable this time. So I think it's fairly plausible and natural to believe they (probably Ron, let's face it) purchased some of their food over the course of almost a year on the run.

And just getting a sense of how much three people eat, especially growing teenagers, is daunting. After moving out on my own, it was hard for me to understand how much food I ate in a week, I'd get it wrong every shopping trip for a while, and my fridge was always emptier than I would think it should be. And then when I moved in with my husband, it took us months to get a knack for how much food two people ate, how much it would cost, etc. Hermione's sense doesn't necessarily means she can easily feed three people for months and know how much money to pack at the beginning of their trip, how to store it for long-term use, and how to make it into something tasty. It would be a learning curve regardless of magic, and I'm not surprised they had trouble planning proper meals. Ted and Dirk Cresswell had a better time, I think, but they're adults who are used to acquiring their own food, and used to the spells needed to make it worth eating.
