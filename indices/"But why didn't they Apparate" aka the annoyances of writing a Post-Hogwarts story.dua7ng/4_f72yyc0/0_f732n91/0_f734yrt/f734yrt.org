A lot of the stuff that gets brought up often has an explanation. But there are still a good number of things that just make no sense other than "the author just wanted it this way"

My usual go to is during Deathly Hallows, the argument over lack of food. You can multiply food you already have, so why did muggle born and normally raised Hermione not think "hey, let's get some non-perishable food from an Asda in a muggle town and just multiply it for dinner"

Harry, being the closet goblin he was, I understand not making that connection. But Hermione had a relatively normal childhood, I can't think of any in-universe reason to not think need food - go to grocers
