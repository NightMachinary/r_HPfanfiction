There are explanations for most of these “plotholes”

But I agree that sometimes you just forget. And apparition is difficult even for grown wizards. If you are in the middle of a werewolf attack you might simply not be able to muster the concentration to apparate somewhere else or you might want to save someone or the DE attacking put the anti apparition wards in place before they attacked. Could be a first sign. Someone wants to leave, realizes they can't - get attacked.
