Well, canon descriptions of Lily have her as smart, and fairly serious (given how she treats the Marauders). If we take those comments as accurate, she's /definitely/ well above average in skill.

It's fine to take the view that those were exaggerated, but I think canon supports Hermione-like study habits more than an average student.
