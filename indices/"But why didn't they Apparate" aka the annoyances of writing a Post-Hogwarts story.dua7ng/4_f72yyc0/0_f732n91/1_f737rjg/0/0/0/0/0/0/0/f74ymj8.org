While it'd amuse me, my headcanon of Lily has always had her be a somewhat average student, perhaps above-average, with particular skill in Charms (encouraged by Ollivander's remarks) and Potions (by virtue of having been friends with a prodigy for several years, and Slughorn's view of her).

For some reason a lot of fics like to make her have Hermione-grade study habits, and I just can't see this.
