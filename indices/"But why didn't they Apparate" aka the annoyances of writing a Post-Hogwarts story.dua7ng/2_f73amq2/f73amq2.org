I remember reading a fic about Harry and Ginny post-hogwarts broken up but on some kind of investigation and they steal a car or something and find the trunk is full of guns and are worried about being pulled over by the muggle police. And I couldn't help but wonder why they didn't just vanish the guns. Sometimes I feel like people want to write a story and just don't have enough faith in their own writing to come up with their own characters and instead decide to use characters everyone already likes as avatars for characters that are only mildly similar in personality and shove them into a setting where they don't belong
