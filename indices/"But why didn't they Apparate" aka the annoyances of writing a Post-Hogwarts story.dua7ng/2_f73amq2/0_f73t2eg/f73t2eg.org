It's easier to use familiar characters as the base rather than building entirely original characters (and even worlds). Say “Harry Potter” and everyone can conjure a general picture in their head. Say “Random Original” and the author has to be able to give a base physical description and general personality or the audience doesn't know who that a character is. Weak (or new) authors usually can't pull that off, so they mutilate existing characters.

To be fair though, in some cases when the author completely restructures how the world works, using familiar characters helps the audience get a grip on the story. But that's familiar characters in an unfamiliar world. When the characters /and/ the world have been fundamentally altered for no discernible reason - that's the crutch of a weak author.
