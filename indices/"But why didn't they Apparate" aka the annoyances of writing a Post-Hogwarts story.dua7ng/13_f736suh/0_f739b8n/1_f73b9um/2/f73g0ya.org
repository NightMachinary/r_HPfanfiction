Considering accidental magic to be even roughly equivalent to wandless magic unnecessarily opens up plotholes. A lot of canon-depicted bouts of accidental magic correspond to powerful/advanced feats of wanded and incanted magic, let alone NEWT-level nonverbal magic and the wandless magic that doesn't even seem to be part of Hogwarts's curriculum. I'd say that, canonically, control or the lack thereof matter a lot when it comes of casting magic.
