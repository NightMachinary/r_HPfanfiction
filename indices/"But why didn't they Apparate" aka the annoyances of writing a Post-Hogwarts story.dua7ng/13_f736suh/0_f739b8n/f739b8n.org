That's debatable. In DH we see Ron "trying to Disapparate without a wand" in Malfoy manor. The fact that it mentioned his wandlessness instead of just saying "Ron was trying to Disapparate" could imply that the wand is somewhat important to the apparation process. They are never explicitly not required nor are they stated to be required. I can't think of any examples where someone has apparated without a wand somewhere on their person (Elves and phoenixes excluded)
