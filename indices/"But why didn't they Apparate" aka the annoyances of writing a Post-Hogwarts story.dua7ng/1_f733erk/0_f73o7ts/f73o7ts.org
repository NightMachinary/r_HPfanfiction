  During the whole stupid 7 potters thing, why didn't they just apparate or portkey out?

  Unless we assume everyone had an idiot ball, there must be a reason. Maybe apparation and portkeys are able to be traced and/or intercepted?

Because the Order was stupid, there is no other explanation. The Ministry made up laws aimed at creating such a scenario and the Order took the bait. The trace got, once again, reworked so that it detected magic around Harry (which didn't matter when Dumbledore or the Order were casting spells around Harry in books 5 and 6).

There were many alternatives, even if you wanted to respect those laws. For example, Harry simply walking out under the invisibility cloak to the nearest train station and taking the train somewhere where Tonks (best stealth ability) was waiting for him and apparate him to Grimmauld or another place under the Fidelius (so the trace they are worried about is not an issue). Or outright ignore the Ministry laws and write them off as lost cause.
