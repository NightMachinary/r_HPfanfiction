I wasn't referring to Moody's eye. I was thinking of the Caterwaul charm (and beside that they don't actually know Harry's cloak is impervious to normal charms). They would only need to monitor movement from the area.

And they are without a doubt keeping that area under lockdown. Anything in or out is probably being checked and scouted for anything even remotely suspicious. Same as weird Nagini-Bathilda keeping an eye on Godric's Hollow.
