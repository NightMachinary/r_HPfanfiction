And your suggestions are utterly unfeasible because it is a Muggle neighbourhood and Voldemort was not yet in control of the entire Ministry. He had the department of magical transportation and a few officials. So any charm on a Muggle neighbourhood would be dispelled. And there's nothing stopping Harry from taking polyjuice to look like one of the neighbours and simply walk out. Hell, Hermione is old enough to learn driving, so they could even car jack one of the neighbours cars while under polyjuice and Apparate from a Sainsbury parking lot or a service station.

What you are suggesting might have worked after the takeover, but not before.
