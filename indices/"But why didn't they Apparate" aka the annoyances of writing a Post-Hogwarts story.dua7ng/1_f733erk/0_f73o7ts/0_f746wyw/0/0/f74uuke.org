ðŸ¤£ I can just imagine one of Voldemort's Horcrux sitting on the nightstand of a shitty muggle motel. It's aware of what is happening in the room with it.

Half of the time it's stuck listening to the motel room TV repeating the same 2minute loop of nearby events and advertisements.

The only respite from the madness comes from the worst types of muggles he can image: the disgusting and degenerate acts by the resident streetwalker and the innumerable /johns/ she brings back.
