That's exactly the problem though, what the trace does and does not detect changes from book to book. Book 2 Dobby gets Harry in trouble by casting near him at privet drive, book 4 mr Weasley casts a bunch of magic while picking him up, no warning (could be a “detected a wizard adult/ministry worker” thing, TBF). Book 5, Order members are guarding Harry daily, no letters or warnings, but can't apparate him out. Book 6, Dumbledore magically intimidates the Dursley's and apparates Harry out, no warnings. But book 7, NOW the trace picks up on apparating again? It feels really contrived, and even if the trace would pick up on apparating why not pop him to a random location and then fly from there, or pop straight into a Fidelius, or 1000 other reasonable things.
