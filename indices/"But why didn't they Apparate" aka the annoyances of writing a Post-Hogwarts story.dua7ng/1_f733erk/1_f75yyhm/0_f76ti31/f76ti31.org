Because it was super important that Harry have the confrontation because How else can Hedwig die, Fred lose an ear (or was it George) and Harry's wand do something nobody has heard of. All of those things become inportant later on right. Harry's wand thing gets used again... oh right it doesn't. Well what about Hedwig, she needed to die so Harry has no form of communication with the outside world. She could have been attacked when Harry sent a letter. And a twin losing an ear had absolutely no effect on anything. So simply put it made a bunch of changes that didn't need to happen.
