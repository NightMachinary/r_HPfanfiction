Oddly, I'm reminded of pre-modern warfare

Before the advent of gas vehicles and modern long range weaponry, field battles almost never had to happen. It took less time to just leave than it took to set up to attack an enemy force. Most battles were sieges where the opposing force couldn't just up and leave.

But field battles did happen. Sometimes it was thanks to ambushes, but mostly it was because both sides figured they could come out ahead in the battle.

And so it would be with wizards. Either it's a siege where one party is defending an objective they must defend, or it's a battle they both think they can win and they're both too busy fighing to muster the concentration to leave without successfully disengaging first, or it's an ambush.

But there's also an in-universe implied releasing. During the whole stupid 7 potters thing, why didn't they just apparate or portkey out? Why bother physically traversing the distance anyway?

Unless we assume everyone had an idiot ball, there must be a reason. Maybe apparation and portkeys are able to be traced and/or intercepted?
