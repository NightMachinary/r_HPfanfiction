Hell you could keep endless apparition as something Dumbledore invented and other wizards require set up to do such things like the dark mark ties the death eaters to each other allowing them to appariate onto each other with ease leading to the terrifyingness of the death eaters in the first war as they could teleport in and then disapear after a brutal attack

Most wizards would require rings or stuff, tying them to family homes or other such places which is not that good in a fight as teleporting back home does not really save you
