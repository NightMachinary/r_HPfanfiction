Magical transportation is one of the disasters of the Harry Potter universe. JKR just created new modes of transportation as she needed them. Not many fans remember that even humble Floo was not invented (discovered, ...) in the first book, so Dumbledore flew to London on a broom (which otherwise doesn't make any sense outside of bashing!Dumbledore ideas). Apparation was created in HBP (completely uselessly, Dumbledore & Harry could visit Slughorn by Floo as well), and then it was misused in DH, but if Apparation never existed (or was usable only by some exceptional wizards or using some weird magical artefact or something) there would be a way less plotholes in JKR novels and in numerous fanfiction stories. Generally, when writing I try to ignore Apparation completely or limit it to some special wizards (e.g., Aurors).
