I feel like one answer to this is that trying to apparate during a stressful situation greatly increases one's odds of getting splinched (consider Ron losing a sizable chunk of flesh from his shoulder/arm in DH, and I'd wager that he came out of that lightly); and if the splinching is bad enough, it could very well be fatal.
