Most of canon also takes place in Hogwarts, where Apparition doesn't work, and involves underage characters, who don't yet have their license, so it's not as much of an issue there.

Edit: I'd get rid of Apparition altogether if I could, it just introduces unnecessary complications. Portkeys can do whenever you need instant transportation for story reasons, and since they require preparation and are illegal to create by non-Ministry personnel, it's believable that one wouldn't be able to create one during a heated confrontation.
