  Most of canon also takes place in Hogwarts, where Apparition doesn't work, and involves underage characters, who don't yet have their license, so it's not as much of an issue there.

^ I was mainly pointing out there are lots of times in cannon where we as readers might quesion why a wizard or witch wouldnt do something when they have magic. Apparition is just one of many such problems that crop up.
