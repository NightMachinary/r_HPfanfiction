This is an issue in canon itself. There are many times in the original books where if you took the time to think about it, you would wonder "but why didn't they _____".

Yet folks still love the story. Readers can overlook such things if the story is good and characters interesting.

That said, as another person pointed out, with regards to Apparition specifically, I don't think people value its danger enough. Apparition not only requires focus in the process itself, but knowledge of where you are going. It is glossed over by many but the reality is that it is not simple and in fact in HP lore you see many OTHER methods of transportation used RATHER than apparition, suggesting that while some choose to use it somewhat consistently, many don't and choose to play it safe. So as a writer, you really shouldnt have to overstress it if your overall story is solid.
