You need focus or else you risk splinching. If you're distracted, say by mortal danger then you might struggle. It might be strongly advised to not apparate under stress. Situations you want to apparate out of are often high stress. Someone like Harry might be able to pull it off anyway due to the large amount of time spent in life or death situations. For everyone else you could splinch. Take Hermione in the 'there's no wood' situation from first year. She's better by the end of the series but most witches and wizards wouldn't be. Make splinching really dangerous and a real threat and not wanting to apparate can be a real issue. Add it that you need to pick a location, if you are in a group then would you all know where to go or would you end up scattered?
