Well, here's some Harry/Tonks I really enjoyed, if i remember correctly (read it ~1 year ago) Harry is fairly mature, though Tonks is still older. This fic is sort of similar to summer of change (Harry/Tonks, grows more powerful over summer, playful Tonks) if you like summer of change i think you'll like this fic.
