Eh, not sure there's a definite answer to this. In HP canon, it seems unlikely that even Ollivander's view on the best magical wand cores being the ones he uses is true (some powerful stuff is mentioned in side material that isn't a dragon, unicorn or Phoenix core, like the one that Sayre lady has from some magic serpent).

But broadening out into fanfic, well, it can work however you want! Just have some general idea of what the wand parts indicate and don't have something stupid like a "best" combination that of course your MC will get. As for alien or other weird materials, I did consider this for an HP/Marvel crossover that I have a few unreleased chapters of (I randomly abandoned HP fanfic), where one of Thanos's followers is a sort of alien mage who's scythe weapon isn't a traditional wand per se (more like a magic staff), because wands are an Earth invention. But since I had it made out of vibranium, I thought it'd be interesting if that made it better suited for defensive spells. I dunno, something like that maybe.

Tbh I don't really see the point of a magicite wand cores since wand cores are already magical, but just make it interesting I guess, lol. Not just "Omega Wand because rare thing inside".
