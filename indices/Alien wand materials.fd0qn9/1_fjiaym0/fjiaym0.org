In my personal headcanon of wands, the wood gives the wand character, preferences, and traits, while the core gives it personality and power, and the combination gives a goal. For example, Harry's wand.

Holly wood likes to act as a tempering agent for impulsive and anger prone wizards, it looks to promote growth, it is prone to dangerous and spiritual quests, it is associated with protection from evil, and is connected with the idea of death and rebirth. Wand wood is special in some way. Not any Holly tree can produce wand wood, there is something special about it, and every wand tree and even branch will have different characteristics that affect the wand.

Phoenix feather is also associated with death and rebirth, they are a preserving force. Phoenixes are protective, animated, prone to action, and picky. Harry's wand would carry specific personality traits not just from Phoenix in general, but from Fawkes in particular.

Together, these components indicate a wand suited to defensive and protective magic, especially against evil. It is a questers wand, and specifically wants the quest tied with its brother. It indicates the wands ability to learn and act on it's own to protect Harry, as seen during the Seven Harry's battle. And is practically prophetic regarding the end of the Voldemort conflict and Harry's sacrifice.

I think that for Alien or Other Universe wand components symbolism is key still. The wood of Lothlorien would certainly make for a good wand. I personally think that the wand wood must be plant matter and the wand core must be animal, but I think any magical animal would work.
