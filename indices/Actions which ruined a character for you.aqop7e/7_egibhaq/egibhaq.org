How Molly treated Fleur in the lead up to the wedding. All of them were pretty terrible to Fleur for no justifiable reason, but Molly was the worst. Kids are taught shit opinions and learn by observing how their parents treat people. I'll bet they learned that judgemental, blatantly disrespectful behaviour from Molly. What the kids called her and how they treated her was bad, but the fact that Molly was the one to set the tone permanently put me off of her.

Along with her Sirius bashing...well, I don't think I'll ever like her.
