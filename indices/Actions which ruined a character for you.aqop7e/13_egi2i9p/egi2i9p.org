/Well,/ if we're including The Cursed Child as canon...

Harry being an absolutely awful father. What kind of dad point-blank tells his kid, "I wish you weren't my son"?!? I mean, kids can be little turds sometimes, but /really?/ Also telling him to stay away from adorable Scorpius. I was about ready to burn the book at that point.
