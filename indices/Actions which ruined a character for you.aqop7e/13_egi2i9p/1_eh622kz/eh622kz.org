There's a lot I hate from CC, and I'm not saying Harry wasn't a shitty parent but this particular line I'm fond of applying my headcanon that "I wish you weren't my son" meant "I wish you weren't so similar to me", aka "I can't believe you broke into the Ministry to steal a time-turner and f**ked a lot of things up, because that sounds exactly like something I would do."

Because I know shitty parenting can come from perfectly good intentions, and I can imagine Harry being like that.
