I want to read a story where Molly is being Molly in his house and Sirius turns to Arthur and asks something like "When did you guys buy this house because I know your wife isn't treating me like her child in my own damn house." and then goes on calmly and quietly berating her. Not bashing or anything, just a reality check for Molly.
