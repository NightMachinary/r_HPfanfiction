I don't know... I think I'm actually with Molly on this one. When Sirius decided to go after Peter he decided (whether consciously or not) to abandon Harry in favor of revenge. A Godfather is supposed to take care of their godchild if the parents are dead. Lilly and James would have never wanted Petunia and Vernon to raise their kid. Worse, its very likely that Sirius had met the Dursley's at some point and knew what kind of people they were.

I think that if Sirius had lived, there would have come a point in the series where Harry realized he was the adult in their relationship.

Having said that... I do think she's very controlling as well. And saying it at this point doesn't help at all.
