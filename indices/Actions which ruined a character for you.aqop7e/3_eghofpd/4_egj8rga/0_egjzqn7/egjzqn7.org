Quote is Hagrid in POA. Sirius /didn't/ abandon Harry. He very explicitly tried to get custody of him first, before anything else, but Dumbledore stepped in.

Without Peter to prove his innocence, I'm not sure how Sirius was to have gone about convincing Dumbledore that he wasn't the Secret Keeper in order to get Harry back. Offer to take Veritaserum, perhaps? But, it's cheatable and at this point, Dumbledore would be thinking he in league with Voldemort. And even if he proved to Dumbledore he hadn't betrayed the Potters and was fit to get his godson, there's still the issue of /Peter and the other Death Eaters would want to kill them both./

Getting the rat first was like Occam's razor to his issues here. To say nothing of the fact that he's clearly in shock in this moment (quote before this talks of him being white and shaking with grief, and of course, the infamous laughing) and not acting rationally.

To take that scene and have Molly throw it back in his face is just really nasty for a supposedly nice character.
