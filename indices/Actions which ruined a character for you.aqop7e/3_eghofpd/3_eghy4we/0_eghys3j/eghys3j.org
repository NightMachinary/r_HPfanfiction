Given that the Weasleys are the only family of wizards we actually spend time with for years and watch the kids grow up, I'm more curious to see if children leaving the home shortly after graduation is the norm.

But I'm incline to agree that most of that stuff is fanon--George actually says outright that now that he and Fred are on their own, they've grown to appreciate Molly's homemaking that much more.
