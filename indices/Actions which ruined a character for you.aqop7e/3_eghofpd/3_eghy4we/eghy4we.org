I feel like this is mostly fanon. Percy, Fred, and George left for reasons that had very little to do with their relationship with their mother. We don't know much about Bill and Charlie, but they both have talent and (presumably) lucrative jobs that happen to require a lot of travel. Griping about things like Bill's hair is something plenty of mothers of young adults do, and being overprotective of her youngest child and the emotionally-abused orphan she's pseudo-adopted are only natural.
