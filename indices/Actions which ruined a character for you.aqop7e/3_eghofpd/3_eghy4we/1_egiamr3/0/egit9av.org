FWIW, Molly's behaviour towards Fleur in book 6 was prime [[/r/JUSTNOMIL]] material. Disrespecting Fleur, allowing Ginny to make fun of her accent, being cold to Fleur when she was trying her best to fit into her husband's extended family. Couple that with some casual prejudice against her background and Fleur didn't have the best of times in Book 6 .Thank god she saw the light at the end but it didn't need for Fleur to "prove" herself worthy in the first place, And her treatment towards Hermione after Skeeter in Y4 was one of the Yikes moment as well
