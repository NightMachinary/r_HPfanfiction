This is what happens when a simplistic plot aimed at children gets stretched into THE SERIES for a generation. I agree with all your points most especially about Tom Felton. It's unfortunate that the casting for the movies had a huge impact on how the original book characters are perceived (short Harry trope is my least favourite).
