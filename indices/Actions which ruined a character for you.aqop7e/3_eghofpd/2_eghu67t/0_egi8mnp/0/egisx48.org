What I use for his height is book 5 where he is an inch shorter than his father in Snape's memory (even though James in the memory is several months older than Harry) and James is described as tall several times in the series. Again in DH Harry is described to be as tall as his dad in the ghosts scene.

The trope is that Harry is 5'5 or similar which is no where near the book version and I don't consider the movie version to be a good guide for height just because the actors were picked before they reached their full height.
