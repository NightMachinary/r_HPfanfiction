As someone who writes short Harry, the Dursley abuse is all the justification you need. He is described as very short in the first book and doesn't really have a constant supply of food to justify growing to heights like he didn't suffer through that. The Dursleys do not feed him well for two months each year and the emergency supplies Molly sends aren't exactly healthy, balanced food either. Add the starvation during the hunt and I fail to see where the growth is supposed to come from. I mean, I don't expect Harry to be 1.5 or 1.6, but 170cm is shorter than average without making him comically short.
