Well, actually the shift happened during the shift from Paleolithic to Neolithic culture and diet. The Paleolithic people were a lot taller than Neolithic ones, if way smaller in number. It had nothing to do with the Middle Ages (the Dark Ages fallacy is something of a pet peeve of mine, but I won't go there).

​

As to Harry, he was thin for his age but he was not starved at all. The Dursley abuse is almost always overplayed in fanon. All they did was yell at him, stunt his social growth (which didn't do much, Harry was a sarcastic asshole and not a meek child) and tell him that his parents were drunks. Not stellar, but not really child abuse (apart from the whole cupboard thing... but that's a children story device, that doesn't really fit with their depiction elsewhere).

​

As to why they did nothing... perhaps there was nothing to do? Harry is fairly tall, said to be the same height as his dad, who was spoiled rotten. He's not as tall as Ron, but definitely not described as short by the end. Also fanon writers forget that magic has limits: it couldn't fix Moody or George's ear, Wizards have to wear eyeglasses, Mundungus stank, Snape had oily hair and crooked teeth, the list goes on...

​

Of course most of that is due to JKR's laziness and poor world building, but still, the point stands.
