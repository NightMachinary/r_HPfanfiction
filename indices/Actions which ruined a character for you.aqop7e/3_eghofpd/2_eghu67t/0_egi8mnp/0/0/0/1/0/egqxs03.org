Agreed. Honestly canon is pretty inconsistent, but everything is so tangled together that in order for it to make sense (the 'light' side are good, Harry is willing to make smart mouthed comments within hearing of the Dursleys, etc.) we have to be optimistic about what was going on especially with regards to Harry's early years.

When it comes down to it, the Dursleys being abusive (instead of mostly neglectful which is still child abuse) would force the story into a much darker path since the 'light side' would be condoning/turning a blind eye that abuse while the 'dark' side are terrorists/prejudiced elites. There would be few if any legitimately 'good' characters in Harry's corner and he himself would be a socially and emotionally stunted wreck.
