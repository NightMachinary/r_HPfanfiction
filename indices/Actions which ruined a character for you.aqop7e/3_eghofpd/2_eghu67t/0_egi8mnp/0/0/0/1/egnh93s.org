  80% of height is genetic
#+end_quote

I don't want to be that person who says, /"Well, actually..."/ and then espouses some contrived nonsense, but, the 80% number is closer to the maximum variation observed, according to [[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-much-of-human-height/][this website]], with the floor on genetic effect being around 60%. So 20-40% of variation in height is due to nutrition.

Keep in mind how short the average person was in the middle ages and how height in modern industrial nations have steadily increased since then faster than genetics could account for, and beyond the 20% disparity.

It is possible that good nutrition from 11-years and onward counteracts some of his malnutrition as a child, but the years through age 10 are probably the most important for development with the occasional growth spurt thereafter.

I do wonder why people obviously noticed the issues but never seem to do anything about it. It's a pretty common trope in fanfiction to have whoever is Harry's guardian come up with some nutrition potions / diet plan as a direct result of canon-characters' failure to do jack-all about it.
