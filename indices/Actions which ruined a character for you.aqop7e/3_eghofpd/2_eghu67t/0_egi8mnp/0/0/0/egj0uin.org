From personal experience, that's not how it works. 80% of height is genetic, he gets solid nutrition most of the year ages 11 on, and before that the Dursley's did allow him to eat (he sat down at breakfast with them or was given basic food when being punished) but gave him less than Dudley which isn't saying much. His magic fixes anything else. Beyond that, I find it weird that Madame Pomfrey would not notice his malnoutrition (if it existed) the first time she checks him over (after first quidditch game) and fixes him up with nutrition supplements to counter any negative effects.
