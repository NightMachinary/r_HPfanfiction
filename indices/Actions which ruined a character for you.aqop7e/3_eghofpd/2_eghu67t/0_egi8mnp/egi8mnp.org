I'm not sure that short Harry is really a trope just based on the movies. I was trying to find information on this, and found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/452di8/how_tall_are_harry_and_the_other_characters/][this thread]] talking about heights based on the books, and all of the references to height from the books would imply that Harry is, at the very least, not tall. He may not be Daniel Radcliffe levels of short, but he's definitely shorter than a vast majority of the other male characters.
