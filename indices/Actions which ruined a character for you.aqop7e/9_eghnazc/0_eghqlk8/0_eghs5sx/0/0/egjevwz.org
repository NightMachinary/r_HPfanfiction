I don't think it's just a plot device, hiding his head in the sand is kinda Remus' core character trait. He didn't say anything to his friends when he was a prefect in school to reign in their bullying, he didn't ever contact Harry before or after the third year (and even during the third year, he tried to avoid mentioning to Harry his connection to James and didn't show much interest in Harry's life beyond their lessons), and he tried to abandon his pregnant wife. So I don't think it's out of character for Remus not to mention Sirius' animagus form to Dumbledore because he was afraid of facing Dumbledore's dissappointment. I imagine him growing more and more conflicted about that as the year progressed, but he kept silent because he didn't know how to explain why he hadn't said anything before.

Unanimous love fandom seems to have for Lupin has always baffled me.
