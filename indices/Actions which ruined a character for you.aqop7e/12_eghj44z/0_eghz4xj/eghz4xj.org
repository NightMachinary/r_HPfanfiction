  Ginny refering to Luna as Loony.

That only happened once, and later on Ginny insists that people don't call her that.

  I know it was Ron who gave her the nickname

That's not true though--while Ron is the last major character to stop calling Luna "Loony," he didn't give the nickname.

Given that Luna's housemates steal and hide most of her possessions, I thought the nickname was from them.
