  That does seem like something Molly would do, but seems apparent from the book that she didn't.

Molly also implies that she was very worried about Harry's home life in CoS but doesn't seem to care enough to inform the DMLE/the Police (and Arthur ought to know how to do that in his line of work). Or show up and threaten the Dursleys with the death of their son should anything happen to Harry.

She just feels like a woman of words rather than actions tbh. And "incompetent adults" does not explain why Harry cannot be adopted later on.
