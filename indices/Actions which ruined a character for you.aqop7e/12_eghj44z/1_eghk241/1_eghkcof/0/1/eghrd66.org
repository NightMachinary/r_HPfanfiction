I'm not sure why Molly would insert herself into Luna's life or feel maternal towards her at all.

Luna's mother died, and that's very sad. Her father is a strange bird, that's for sure. But Xeno has a business (however disreputable his tabloid, and however modest the income may be) and a home, and Luna is generally cared for and happy. She and her father have a close relationship.

Oddity alone should not trigger intervention by a meddling neighbor with no particular prior social attachment to a widower and his daughter.

Harry is a different matter entirely. He was an orphan whose relatives neglected him. Molly first met Harry when Harry asked her for help getting to the platform - he was only eleven and completely alone. From that point he and Ron quickly became best friends, Harry got to know the other Weasleys in Gryffindor as well. And of course, for several years at least, there was literally nobody in the Wizarding world looking out for Harry on a personal level, outside of school.

Molly definitely has plenty of maternal instinct to go round, and she isn't beyond some meddling and intervention, but we don't see her step in to parent any and all of her children's classmates at random. Harry is a unique case, where Molly stepped into a major void in his life, and Harry needed that (and almost always appreciated her for doing it).

In Luna's case, Luna didn't have the same void that needed filling, and she never had the same relationship with any of the Weasleys to warrant that kind of intervention either.
