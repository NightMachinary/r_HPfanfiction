  The Lovegoods being the Weasleys' neighbours, but Harry never meeting her before fifth year doesn't make much sense either.

Ginny probably fell out of touch with Luna after her mother's death - you could say that it was Mrs Lovegood's death that caused Luna to become more /Luna/. And in school, they were sorted into different houses, and Ginny had to deal with the possession in her first year, and recovery from possession in later years, so...it more or less makes a lot of sense when you look at it from that angle.

Also, the Lovegoods aren't the Weasleys' neighbours any more than the Diggorys are. They live in the same village, but that's it.
