The obvious answer is that JKR didn't invent Luna until Book 5.

--------------

The alternate answer is that Harry hadn't actually spent much time at the Burrow:

- After Year 1, he was there like two weeks.
- After Year 2, he wasn't there. The Weasleys themselves were in Egypt.
- After Year 3, he was there like two weeks.
- After Year 4, he wasn't there.

The Lovegoods might have visited, but Harry and we readers wouldn't know.

It was also possible that Luna became increasingly weird after her mother's death that she and Ginny (and Ron) fell out. With the stuffs Xeno had been spewing out in The Quibbler, Molly should have strong reservation getting too close to him, and Luna was super defensive of her father.
