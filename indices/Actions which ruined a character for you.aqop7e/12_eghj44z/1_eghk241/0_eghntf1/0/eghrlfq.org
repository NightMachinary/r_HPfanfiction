  With the stuffs Xeno had been spewing out in The Quibbler, Molly should have strong reservation getting too close to him, and Luna was super defensive of her father.

This. Xeno is clearly an involved father, but he's also an odd guy with demonstrably poor judgment.

Neighbor or not, widower or not, I would not want to be close friends with Xeno if I were Molly. And I certainly wouldn't be sending my kids over to the Lovegood house to play.
