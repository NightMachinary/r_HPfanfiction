  While it doesn't 'ruin' Hermione at all, I find her calling Luna 'Looney' very odd, considering she was teased herself a lot for her 'odd' ways during her first months at Hogwarts - and presumably a ton during primary school.

That was only in the movie, though. In the book of /Order of the Phoenix,/ Hermione never calls Luna "Loony," though she goes out of her way to be as rude and condescending as possible.
