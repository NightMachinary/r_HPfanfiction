He didn't tell him about the Marauders, but that's something else entirely.

I'm almost certain that he told him about his relationship with James and Lily shortly after Harry asked about why he stopped him from going near the boggart.

As for whether or not he got too involved, he gave Harry private lessons so he could master a skill that most adults couldn't do, and lied to a colleague so he could hide Harry's secrets.

I don't think he got too involved, I just said you could argue that if you want. I certainly don't think he was unfair towards Harry. The only mistake he made that I can think of during his teaching career was for getting to take a potion he'd been taking for years in an environment where it could have done a lot of harm.
