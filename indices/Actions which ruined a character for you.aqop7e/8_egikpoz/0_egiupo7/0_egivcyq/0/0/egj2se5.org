  “I don't want to hear explanations,” said Lupin shortly. He glanced around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice. “I happen to know that this map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago. Yes, I know it's a map,” he said as Harry and Ron looked amazed. “I don't want to know how it fell into your possession. I am, however, astounded that you didn't hand it in. Particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around. And I can't let you have it back, Harry.”

  Harry had expected that, and was too keen for explanations to protest.

  “Why did Snape think I'd got it from the manufacturers?”

  “Because ... ,” Lupin hesitated, “because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school. They'd think it extremely entertaining.”

  “Do you know them?” said Harry, impressed.

  “We've met,” he said shortly. He was looking at Harry more seriously than ever before.
