Dumbledore:

- "ten dark and difficult years"... enough said
- complete ineptness and incompetence as a leader (for example, members of the Order learn from a *Ministry leaflet* that it might be a good idea to ask security questions as a tactic)

Snape:

- joining the DE out of his own volition. I don't care that you hated your daddy.
- bullying school kids

Remus:

- never visiting Harry or even sending a letter for 12 years.
- being a sad and pathetic barely half of a man, even though he had two fantastic friends doing it all for him
- forgetting to take his Wolfsbane after living with the curse for his whole life, *while* being in a school full of children. Remus makes the point for the Ministry very well, the point being that werewolves are at best useless bums and at worst extremely dangerous.

Ron:

- tent abandonment and almost succumbing to the jealousy horcrux.
