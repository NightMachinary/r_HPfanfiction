Ginny was soured for me when she made the comment to Ron about him being a loser for not having kissed anyone yet at sixteen.

As an adult now, I recognize that Ron was being a prat and it wasn't any of his business who she dates or what she does with them. But, when I read it, I was a twenty something who hadn't kissed anyone and took it VERY much to heart (I was very much ashamed of my lack of experience then). My animal hindbrain still has her labeled as a 'bitch' even though I know logically that isn't fair.
