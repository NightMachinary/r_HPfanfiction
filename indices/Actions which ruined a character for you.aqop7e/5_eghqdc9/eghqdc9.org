I don't like Snape. I think his whole justification at the end was kinda shit. It made me actually say « ... that's it? » This dude had a boner for his childhood friend that he pretty dropped the equivalent of a hard R on and never got over it, deciding to torment children and SHIT on her only son after her death. Wouldn't a rational (psycho) treat the kid extremely well??
