This! Oh man. I never understood Snape's spy role, or the excuse he had to act that way because he was a double agent. It makes no sense. I honestly believe that its another one of those things that JK didn't have planned out and just sort of decided after a certain point to make him a spy.

Logically, he should have been more like Minerva or even Binns. Either very helpful and trustworthy or just there and blending into his role as teacher/spy.
