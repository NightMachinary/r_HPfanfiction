I never said Snape excused himself. Snape doesn't really offer much justification for anything he does, and that's fine. That's honestly fitting with his character. But fandom does use his spying as justification for him treating people horribly. Which...as I and I think the op was saying, isn't a logical excuse. Or even a logical way to play the role of spy. It's not about justifying Snape as he is, but the way it's presented as a whole idea. Like 90% of the book people think Snape is bad and no one trusts him. From literally everyone but Dumbledore, no one trusts Snape, or if they do it's literally only because of Dumbledore's word. On Voldemort's side, how useful is having a spy when that spy is hated by everyone? When there's constant suspicion on him? It's just... illogical.

And that's cool of you think Snape was planned from the beginning, I don't think so. I think there is a fair amount that jk worked in as she went that sort of clicked into place on happy accidents but wasn't planned from the get go. And that's fine. A lot of authors have that happen. I just think she likes to come across as having everything planned, when she doesn't... obviously. I.e. all her current 'canon' adds.
