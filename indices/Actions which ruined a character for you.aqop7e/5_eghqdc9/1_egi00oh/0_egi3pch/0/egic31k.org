He... didn't excuse himself acting that way because of his spy role? Please excuse me if I'm remembering wrong, but I'm pretty sure he was just a bully without remorse or justification. The things he /did/ try to justify were things like, you know, killing Dumbedore and letting Hogwarts get overrun by deatheaters, and all other death eater related stuff. Him being a dick was just his personality, and there's no reason for him to change it. It's not like Voldie didn't believe him already.

Also, Snape seeming to be on the other side but actually being on Harry's side has been a theme ever since PS. JK didn't drop it out of nowhere.
