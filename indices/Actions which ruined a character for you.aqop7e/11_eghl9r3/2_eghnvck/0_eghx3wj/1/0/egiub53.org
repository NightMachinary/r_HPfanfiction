But that would imply that Tonks has no other friends who could be her confidant. I mean, said friend doesn't even have to be a fighter.

Also, they have vastly different experiences in life. Lupin seems to be self destructive and defines himself through his curse. He makes three friends, all of whom are dead by HBP. Compare that to Tonks, who seems to be easy going and fun. She was 8 when the war ended. At that point, Lupin had spent his youth fighting. Tonks time at Hogwarts was also vastly different (with the possible exception of the Quirrel year). Then she went out to have a stable job while Lupin couldn't keep one.

And it's not like Tonks sat around Grimmauld the whole time. She had a full time job, so she might do the odd job for the Order, but she also has a life outside of it. Unlike what we see from Lupin.
