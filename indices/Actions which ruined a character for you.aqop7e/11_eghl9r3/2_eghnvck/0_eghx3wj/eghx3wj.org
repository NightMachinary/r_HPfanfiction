  But the entire Lupin romance feels off.

Aside from Tonks being much more of a free spirit in Book 5, the biggest problem is that it happens almost completely off-screen. We don't know what happened between them (though I'd guess commiserating over Sirius's death was part of it), but it seems to come out of nowhere. It's more troubling to me in a meta-sense, since it feels shoehorned in to (1) foreshadow Merope's depression leading to a loss of magical ability and (2) leave an orphan behind after the war for thematic reasons.
