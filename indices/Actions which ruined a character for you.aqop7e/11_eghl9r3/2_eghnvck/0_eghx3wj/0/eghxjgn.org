I don't mind offscreen romances if there is established chemistry between characters. I mean, Bill/Fleur would have been decent if he actually stood up for her and all we get is one bit of foreshadowing in GoF. But the only connection I can come up with for Tonks and Lupin would be through Sirius, and that would mean that Lupin knew Tonks when she was a baby and he at least 13. Which gets weird really quickly.
