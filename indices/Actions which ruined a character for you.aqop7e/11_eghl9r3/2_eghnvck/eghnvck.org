Given that she is a metamorph and can do rather significant shifts of her face, giving birth would probably be a five-minute affair for her. And painless.

But her whole character is just inconsistent. I love her in OotP where she is that casual badass who is the only one not openly scared of Voldemort. I even get that she is depressed over Sirius' death in HBP. Survivors' guilt and the whole thing.

But the entire Lupin romance feels off. She could have pretty much anyone. Lupin has very few positive traits depicted in canon (he is always treated as a good person, yet his actions speak otherwise). He is neither some pick-up god like Barney Stinson nor does he look like Mr Universe. So what exactly does Tonks see in him? She takes him back after he broke their vows three months into their marriage. Honestly, the whole romance is nothing but a character assassination for her. And now I feel like writing a story where she and not Lupin shows up at Grimmauld.

Edit: Also, if the battle is lost, her life is forfeit. As is Teddy's. It is a shitty situation, but unless you want to go with an utterly anticlimactic battle (eg the defenders just mow down wave after wave of Death Eaters or "1 Mandrake kills them all"), the one way she can make Teddy's future safer is to fight at great personal risk.
