Many of these are sound points, but a few, I'm not so sure.

I don't know that we're supposed to actively dislike Fleur (/maybe/ for using her Veela powers on Cedric). She's more of a non-entity in Book 4, and JKR (at best) wrote herself into a corner, making Fleur the designated loser in the Tournament. And while the other women dislike her in Book 6, I don't think she's directly portrayed in a negative light.

I'm not sure /what/ Umbridge oozes, but I'm not convinced it's femininity. The pink, kittens, and cutesy voice seems more like little girl stuff, so it might be immaturity--or consciously projecting sweetness when she's anything but.

Casual use of magic on people without their consent goes a /lot/ further than Molly and love potions. In fact, with widespread use of Memory Charms on muggles, wizards have built their entire society on a foundation of this kind of corruption. How about the Ministry renting a field from a muggle farmer for the summer and not caring if they give him brain damage keeping him from noticing magic in real time?
