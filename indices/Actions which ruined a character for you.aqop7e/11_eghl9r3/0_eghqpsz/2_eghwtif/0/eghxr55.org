  I don't know that we're supposed to actively dislike Fleur (maybe for using her Veela powers on Cedric). She's more of a non-entity in Book 4, and JKR (at best) wrote herself into a corner, making Fleur the designated loser in the Tournament. And while the other women dislike her in Book 6, I don't think she's directly portrayed in a negative light.

If anything, I think the reason that Fleur is disliked, is that she's a snob. She scoffs at the idea of Hogwarts being a comfortable home, continues to wear her traveling shawl long after most of her fellow students have abandoned them (though maybe there are some biological differences being a part-vella), and calls Harry "a little boy" when he says he's a Champion.
