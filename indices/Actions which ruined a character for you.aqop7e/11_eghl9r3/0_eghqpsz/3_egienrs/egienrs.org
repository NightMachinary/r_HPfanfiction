James's sacrifice is ignored because it didn't accomplish anything, whereas Lily's did. Of course that's only because Voldemort would have let Lily live if she stood aside (presumably this is why Harry is the only one to survive the killing curse even though other parents would try to give their lives for their children, normally there's no true sacrifice as the killer fully intended to kill the whole family).
