Your point about Ron and Harry being comically insensitive in GoF has spawned so many bad fanfic tropes.

All the girls are giggling behind the curtain, just waiting for those dumb men to wise up and realize their feelings. Meanwhile, all the guys are absolutely clueless and have the emotional maturity of a daffodil.

Agency is removed from all the characters, just to serve the tired "Men are dumb yet desirable, women are smart and conniving" trope.
