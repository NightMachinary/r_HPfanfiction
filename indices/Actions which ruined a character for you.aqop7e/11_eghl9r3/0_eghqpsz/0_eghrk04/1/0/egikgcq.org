I guess when I say that, I'm picturing fics where Ron and Harry ask some girls out, mess up something obvious (like talking about how hot another girl is in front of their date), and then are baffled that their date got mad.

Then they go to someone for advice (usually Fred and George or Sirius) and the advice is "I don't know, women...what are ya' gonna do? Get them flowers....women loooovvvveee flowers." And then they do it and everone's happy.

It's just all such a weird view of relationships, even teen relationships which /should/ have some awkwardness.
