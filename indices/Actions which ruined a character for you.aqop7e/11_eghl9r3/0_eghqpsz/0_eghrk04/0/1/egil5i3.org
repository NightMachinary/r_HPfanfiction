I'm still pretty dense at 30. I doubt it will ever change.

Once went bowling with a big group, female acquaintance walks up and sees all the seats taken. Being the gentleman that I am, I stand up and offer her my seat.

"Oh, that's okay, we can share!" she says.

"It's fine! I don't mind standing."

She was smoking hot, too. Took me like a whole week to realize she was flirting.

I'm an idiot.
