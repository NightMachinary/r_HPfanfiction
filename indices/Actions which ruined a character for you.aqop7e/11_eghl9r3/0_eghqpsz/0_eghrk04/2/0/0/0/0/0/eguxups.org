I'm sure some are insecure, and some probably just cannot tell if a dude's face is meant to be attractive or not.

I think most people can probably tell, though.

Though sometimes I think men and women might value different things in what they find attractive. Like I would say to my ex "wow, that guy's hot" and she didn't really think so at all. I was usually ogling dudes that were fuckin' ripped, though. I think she more preferred classically handsome guys.
