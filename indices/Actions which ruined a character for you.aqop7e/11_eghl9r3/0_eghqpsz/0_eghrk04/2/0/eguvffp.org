What I always think about is some scene like this:

"Oh wow, that Delacour is just...gorgeous. Like, on a whole nother level from Hermione or Parvati."

[their dates storm off. Ron and Harry look at each other, incredulous]

"Witches, mate, I'll never understand."

"Me neither. What're we supposed to do?"

"I dunno, flowers, maybe? Girls like that sort of thing, right? Flowers and loads and loads of chocolate."

Even back when I was in high school and was scared to talk to girls, it was more fear of rejection, or really just fear of putiing myself out there. But I wasn't /clueless/ as to how women "worked." Even nervous as I was, I understood not to, like, insult my crush to her face or something. lol

And another sin if these types of stories is that they'll still have the women pining after these clueless dudes. "Oh, don't worry Ginny. Harry'll come around eventually."

At least canon had her date other people.
