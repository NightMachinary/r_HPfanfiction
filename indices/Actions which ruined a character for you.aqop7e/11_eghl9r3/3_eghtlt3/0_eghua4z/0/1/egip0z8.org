So, trying to put him together myself:

In canon, he hid who Sirius was, even when he was getting into the castle through secret passages that he must have known about, and in disguise in a form he certainly knew about.

Then he also hid the fact he knew Harry at all (I know, I said before). He was perfectly good with all the kids, but he didn't forge a personal connection until Harry was all on his own at the Hogsmeade weekend in the week of the full moon, and when Harry went to him for lessons. Then he drops that connection as soon as he's fired. Harry mentions/thinks about the fact he doesn't write.

Confronted with Tonks, he refuses a connection until he's worn down into accepting marriage. Confronted with fatherhood, he runs off.

He's skilled and capable as a caster. He's not stupid. He does what Dumbledore tells him to do, rather than stay by Sirius Black's side. He doesn't hate Snape, who brewed his wolfsbane, but doesn't like him either.

And, as a teen, he pretended to be reading rather than call out his friends for bullying.

So... I see him as being passive-avoidant. He does whatever draws the least drama onto himself, and has no personal ambition whatsoever. His instinct is to retreat or hide from difficult emotions or from being tied down. Telling anyone about Sirius would mean broaching schoolday wrongdoing and being interviewed, so he hides it, since he's the only one alive that knows.

His motivation is whatever leads to his not having to make difficult decisions or take on responsibility, but given the choice between an argument or responsibility, he'll go for responsibility over drama - then flake out on that. He is the broken reed that bends and cannot be leaned upon. Very agreeable and nice, since he's non-confrontational, but not someone you can rely on.

So, starting drama is OOC, but flaking out is very IC. I can see him being too busy for engagements he doesn't want to go to, rather than saying he doesn't want to go. Confronted with something, he'll go along with it. Dumbledore can obviously get him to act, then Sirius, then presumably Tonks. He'll say yes and fail, rather than saying no.

He was perfectly ready to help Sirius kill Peter, but I honestly see him as more being ready to go along with Sirius and rely on his wand to do the job, or hoping/knowing Harry would step in, than his actually /wanting/ to kill Peter.

At the battle, I can see him going along because it's expected, then mainly fighting in self-defence, or seeing off Dementors, but not really attacking, and definitely not making command decisions. It being a form of suicide makes sense, but so does his going along because his friends will all be very angry if he doesn't.

I like him better than any of the Death Eaters, but really /not/ as a parent at all, he'd be terrible.
