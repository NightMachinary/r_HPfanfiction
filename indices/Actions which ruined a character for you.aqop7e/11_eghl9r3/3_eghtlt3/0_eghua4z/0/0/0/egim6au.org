Same. I characterize him as a depressed, lonely individual who is sort of just going with the flow of things. When the call comes to defend Hogwarts, he sees an opportunity to at least die honorably rather than take his own life.

1. He's lived with a disease that ostracizes him from society, preventing him from having gainful employment and so he's forced to rely on favors and friends.
2. He's the type of person who resents this -- "owing" favors -- even if there are no expectations of reciprocation. I'm much the same way, I *hate* asking for help, whether it's $5 because I forgot my wallet or even just a friend helping move furniture. It irks me to receive a favor when I can't just immediately balance that scale.
3. He's been at the "negative" end of that scale for most of his life. Dumbledore did him a favor, his friends have done him favors, his best friend and his wife died to save everyone, his other best friend is a perceived psychopath that betrayed everyone.... and when they reunite and truth comes out, his friend dies a year later.
4. He has to constantly rely on the Wolfsbane potion, which is brewed by Snape while he's at Hogwarts, further flaming the guilt and other complexes, especially given their past.

It's just a lot to deal with as a 20-something. Maybe Lupin tried to write Harry, but the letters all got blocked by the Owl-ward Dumbledore set up, and maybe he just grew more and more despondent to Harry's situation and never knew exactly how to broach the subject. Maybe he figured, like everyone else in the Order who worships Dumbledore, that the kid was fine and in good, caring hands, and that there would be plenty of time to catch up later. Maybe he figured his involvement in Harry's life would just inevitably lead to conflict or more bad times. What if Harry grew up hating werewolves?

I think Lupin tries, and he's at the very least a competent professor that engages his students and makes learning enjoyable. For his personal issues, the man could very well have demons eating him alive like everyone else in the story, but they are not readily obvious to a teenage boy's point of view, so we don't get to see them "on screen."

Just my random ramblings.
