Tonks leaving her month old son in order to go and fight in the Battle of Hogwarts. Even if witches recover more quickly from childbirth itself, it's unbelievable to me that a reasonably well-adjusted woman would put her husband ahead of her newborn child. I don't blame Tonks for it, I blame Rowling, but I genuinely have a big problem with it.
