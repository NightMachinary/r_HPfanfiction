People have lines, and it's not unreasonable that they hate someone who has crossed them. If you can love someone while still disliking some aspects of their personality, you can certainly hate someone while still liking aspects of their personality. At the very least, you can hate them while still /acknowledging/ that they also have good traits.

I believe this thread means "ruined" not in the sense that, omg this character became 100% awful" and such, but rather that it spoiled their feelings about the character. The opposite of rose-colored contacts, so to speak.
