But it is a matter of perspective. For example, quite a few people dislike Lupin and Tonks for going into battle while leaving behind a newborn. Yet to me it is a necessary action because if the battle is lost, their lives are forfeit. So is Teddy's. Therefore, the best chance to ensure a future for their child is to fight.

Don't get me wrong, it is a shitty situation to be in, but depending on your perspective it can be unforgivable or a necessary evil.
