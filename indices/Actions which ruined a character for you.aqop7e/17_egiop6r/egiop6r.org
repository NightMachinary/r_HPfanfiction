...I just look at the comments here and I don't get it. I mean, with the possible exception of Neville and Luna, every single character in the series get at least one, often several moment, where they say or do atrocious things. But I don't think that ruins any of them as characters.

On the contrary... I like that the series is so unapologetic about people's complexities. Even people who are otherwise fundamentally good people can still have moments where they act like total assholes.... and even the darkest villains can have moments where they show redeeming qualities.

The HP characters aren't saints, bit for the most part they're written well enough that I still enjoy reading about them. I wouldn't have wanted to hang out with Snape IRL, but as a character in a book he's pretty enjoyable.
