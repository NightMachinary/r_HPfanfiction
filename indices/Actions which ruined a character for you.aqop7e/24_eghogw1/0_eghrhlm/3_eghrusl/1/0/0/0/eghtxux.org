I am not opposed to teenagers having consensual sex in a story if they are above the age of consent (14 here in Germany, 16 in the UK) because I know that it happens. Random explicit scenes are not good for the reading flow, but fade to black or even implications work just as well to get the message across. I mean, horny teenagers + no adult supervision...

I am sick and tired of all these Hogwarts students suddenly acting as if they are from the bible belt because clearly sexuality is evil. I am also sick of the regular romance arc which ends with either the couple getting together, their engagement or marriage. Get them together by chapter 5 and show me how the couple faces hardships together.

Somehow, that apparently makes me a paedophile or something.

Edit: To further clarify, I don't mind such themes if they are naturally integrated into the story. I have no wish to ever read about teenage pussies or budding chests ever again. But you can mention and even depict consensual underage sexuality without fetishising it.
