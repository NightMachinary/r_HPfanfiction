  regarding prisoners of war
#+end_quote

Hermione was held prisoner by Umbridge, not the other way around. And Hermione is not responsible for any actions the Centaurs commit. She holds neither a position of authority nor a position of power which could be used to stop the gangrape or brutalisation from happening. I mean,

- There were more important things going on than saving a woman from the situation she had gotten herself in through ignorance and incompetence.

- Centaurs are not humans. They are not subject to any UN treaties.
