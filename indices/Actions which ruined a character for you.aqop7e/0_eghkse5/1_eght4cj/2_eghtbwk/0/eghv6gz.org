  Algie's great-nephew Neville might have been a Squib, but Algie was determined to catch Neville off his guard and "force some magic" from him.

  He once pushed Neville off the end of Blackpool pier; however, he nearly drowned. While over for tea one time when Neville was eight, Algie hung him out of an upstairs window by his ankles, and accidentally dropped him when he was offered a meringue by his wife Enid. Instead of getting hurt, Neville bounced safely down the garden and out into the road, thereby proving that he was in fact a wizard.
