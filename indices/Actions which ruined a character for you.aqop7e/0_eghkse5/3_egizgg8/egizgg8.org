Canon Snape and canon Malfoy both "ruined" their characters for me. In the sense that I generally can't stand "good" depictions of them. Especially fics that seemingly forget all of canon and suddenly have them parading around as great characters.

I refus to read all Dramione and Snape/Hermione fics because of canon.
