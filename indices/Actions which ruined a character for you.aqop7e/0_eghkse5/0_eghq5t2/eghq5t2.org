I wonder if Snape ever realized that he became what he hated most - a bully, particularly to nervous/shy/dorky/not-fitting-in-well kind of kids like he used to be.

My thoughts on him can be summed up by that post that says something like "Lily and James fought FOR the light because it was the right thing to do; Snape fought AGAINST the dark because it had pissed him off." There's a world of difference in that.
