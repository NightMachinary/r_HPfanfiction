he doesn't expect anything of voldemort, and holds himself accountable for endangering lily

he expresses fear and respect for voldemort, not hatred. how he reacts in other situations isn't indicative of how he'll react in all situations. canon /shows us/ how he reacts towards people he does hate. that isn't how he behaves toward voldemort, or when talking about him
