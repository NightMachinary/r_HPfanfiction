which is half of my point. snape does think of himself as someone who's trying to do right thing- contrary to starfox's opinion.

the other half is that what he thinks of as the right thing is also what others e.g. harry, dumbledore, the order, think of as doing the right thing- saving lives and opposing voldemort

i don't think how he treats children is the 'doing the right thing' part

'lately, only those whom i could not save' is
