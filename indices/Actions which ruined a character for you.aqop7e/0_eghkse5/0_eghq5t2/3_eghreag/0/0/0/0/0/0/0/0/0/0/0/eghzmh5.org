He also did it to keep his position in the death eaters, he is a good enough Occulmens to say hitting a DE was an accident.

But the fact of the matter is, Snape is a terrible human being. Fighting to kill a madman does not make a person good. Neither does the fact that he was pivotal matter either towards that.

Snape may have had good qualities... But in canon he is a bully, a murderer, and arguably obsessive. He may have been brave, cunning and fighting for the Light, but he made school children cry, murdered someone infront of children, allowed the use of torture on children (if he didnt know about umbridge, look at book 7) and allowed the use of restricted potions on them. (book five). Morally, he isnt a good person.
