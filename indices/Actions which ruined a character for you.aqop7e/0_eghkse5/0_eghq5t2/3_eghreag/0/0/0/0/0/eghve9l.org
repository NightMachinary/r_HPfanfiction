That the characters, especially Dumbledore, don't act in character so Snape can abuse kids and be the evil teacher is a fault of the books - rooted in JKR's fixation on plot before characterisation.

If Snape cared about doing the right thing, it would show. All we see is him fighting Voldemort because he is still fixated on Lily. We don't see him caring or thinking about doing the right thing in the books.
