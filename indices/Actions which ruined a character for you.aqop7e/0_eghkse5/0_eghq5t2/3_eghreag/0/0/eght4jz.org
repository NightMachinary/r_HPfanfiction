i know you think that, you've said it before. your opinion isn't supported in canon. it, like the post i responded to, is just a soundbite that tries to reconcile the actions of the most complex character in the series. snape doesn't hate everyone. nor does he ever even express hatred for voldemort. i don't think he has any strong hatred for him, even after he killed lily

'if grindelwald cared about doing the right thing, he wouldn't torture people or murder children'

that's not how people work. snape is doing what he thinks is right, re: the DEs. he doesn't care about his day to day behaviour, nor does any other adult in his vicinity seem to care either
