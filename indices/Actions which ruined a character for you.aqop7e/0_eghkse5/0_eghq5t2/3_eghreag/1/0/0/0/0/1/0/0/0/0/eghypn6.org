draco never used slurs when he could hear them. we do see him oppose phineas nigellus. i can accept that he does go soft on draco due to personal attachment, though

you can say the same for slug, and snape is in an even more delicate position than he is. snape can't force them to go against their parents' ideals

where exactly do you see that revenge is a motivation of his? i've asked this several times now, and you've provided no proof

snape says he saves lives when he can. he doesn't say it's because he hates voldemort. i see no reason to disbelieve him
