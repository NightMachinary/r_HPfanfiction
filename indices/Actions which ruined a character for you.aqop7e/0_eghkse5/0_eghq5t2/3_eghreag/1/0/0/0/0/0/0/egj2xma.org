Why did he fight Voldemort then? If he doesn't do it because it's the right thing to do, that doesn't leave much else. "Because he's there" doesn't sound like Snape; he's not doing it for fame or such. But Voldemort killed the only woman Snape ever loved (or thought he loved). I'd say the idea that he didn't do it for revenge needs to be proved, not the other way around.
