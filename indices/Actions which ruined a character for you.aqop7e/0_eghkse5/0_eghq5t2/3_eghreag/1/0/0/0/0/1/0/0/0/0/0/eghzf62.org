Draco openly used the slur in book 2, cheering that the "mudbloods" would be next when Mrs Norris was found petrified. He did it in front of "hundreds" of witnesses. Snape knew what Draco was doing and didn't do anything. If he had wanted to save lives, he wouldn't have helped Draco murder Dumbledore either.
