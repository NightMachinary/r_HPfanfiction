Ngl, don't remember canon that well, but I certainly don't remember any sentiments of revenge. Perhaps your reaction to someone killing someone you love is revenge, but iirc Snape was just... overwhelmingly guilty. He felt he fucked up with the prophecy and like he condemned Lily to death, which tbh he pretty much did (much accidentally). He had a pretty twisted sense of morality and justice though, to be sure, which is why he responds to that guilt only with actions he deems right -- like saving her son's life time and time again.

How he acted towards Harry, on the other hand, smacks of revenge, hatred, and general pettiness. But that isn't apparent in his reasons for fighting Voldie. His feelings towards Voldemort doesn't come up at all, pretty much ever. It's just always Lily. You gotta give a guy credit sometimes for unrealistic obsession
