I'm not sure why you're downvoted so much, but you are right. Yes, Snape was a bully to his students and should have never become a teacher in the first place, but he tried to do the right thing in the war and atone for his past mistakes. This two things aren't mutually exclusive, because people (and good characters) aren't black and white and can have complex motivations. You can be a jerk and genuinely want to free your world from a genocidal maniac at the same time.

Seriously, reading all those threads how Marauders's bullying was completely justified and how Snape is an absolute worst person ever with no redeeming qualities is starting to turn me into a Snape apologist, and I've never expected THAT to happen.
