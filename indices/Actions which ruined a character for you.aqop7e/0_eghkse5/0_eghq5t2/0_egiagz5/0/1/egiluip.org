Um what? Look I'm a fan of Snape; a huge fan, but if I met someone like him in real life; I'd want to punch his lights out.

Snape was cruel to Harry, he was cruel to Neville (Hell; he was what Neville feared the most, that's not a good thing).

He was cruel to Hermione; saying that he noticed no difference after Malfoy's attack.

He was an adult, he was a spy; yes, but he was an adult who attacked children (Verbally; yes, but it still doesn't make it right).
