It's been a while since I've reread that scene, and wow the line, "Pansy Parkinson and the other Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles, pointing at Hermione from behind Snape's back," really sticks out to me now, because it's /so/ similar to how, in Snape's worst memory, the crowd was jeering and laughing at him.

(Also, while that line incites a very visceral rage in me, I think the real deal-breaker is the "After all this time?"/"Always" bit in DH, because it shows how Snape, to the end, only cared about Harry as an extension of Lily. It weirds me out how romantic fandom considers that line to be, because I think it's a pretty damning indictment of Snape's moral compass.)
