I've seen others express this sentiment - that that scene was Snape's lowest point - and I can't say I understand it. He has done a lot more terrible things than a petty insult about a student's appearance. Even if we focus on his work as a professor alone, Harry and Neville suffered more from him than Hermione ever did.
