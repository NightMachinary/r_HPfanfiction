I see it, actually.

She starts off as a Harry Potter fangirl, who has read about him in books. Follows him and Ron around, being bossy and annoying.

Then she's rescued, and becomes friends with Harry and Ron. Both, because you can't befriend just one of them.

Ron accepts her in a begruding way, but says awful things to her constantly. On the other hand, no Ron, no Harry, and Ron /did/ take down a troll for her. I see her being friends with the Harry-and-Ron gestalt. Given the choice (GoF) she chooses Harry. It was always about Harry.

Then Krum comes along, who is heroic and famous like Harry, but /better/. Actually intelligent and studious and interesting /and interested in her/. It turns out that Harry isn't jealous, but Ron is. So, of the Harry-and-Ron gestalt, at least Ron wants her, even if he shows it in an unhealthy way.

James and Sirius were best-friends-forever. Hermione doesn't like the idea that Sirius will make Harry be a substitute James, and condescends to him, copying Molly. But it does model for her the idea that close wizard friends stay friends basically forever.

And, Ron's a prat, but he's consistent in his not liking Hermione being with other people. From December 1994 to December 1996, that doesn't change. This half of the Harry-and-Ron gestalt likes her and does so reliably.

And, during the nightmare camping trip, he goes away, but he comes back, and in all that time, hasn't so much as looked at anyone else. He'll always come back to Harry, and if she stays with him, she'll always be close to Harry too.

So, she's like Harry's sister. Possibly her own feelings have been squashed down, perhaps she feels that way too. But, well, if she marries Ron, she knows what she's getting, and that it isn't going to change, and Ron /does/ mostly do what she tells him to, and doesn't attack her, even when she attacks him. He's a prat, but a safe one.

Pair this with all the shared experiences that no one else is going to ever understand, and you have the recipe for a dreadful but lasting relationship. I'm not saying that they had a nice marriage and the bickering '19 years later' is probably an entirely typical exchange and snapshot of their marriage. I'd find them exhausting to be around personally. But I /do/ see it.

Yes, she'd be better off with almost anyone else, but that doesn't keep her close to Harry Potter, and life around Harry Potter is bound to at least be interesting.
