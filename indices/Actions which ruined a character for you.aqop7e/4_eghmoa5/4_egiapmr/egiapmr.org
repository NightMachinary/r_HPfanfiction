I consider this to be the start of J.K. Rowling forcing the relationship between Hermione and Ron. I mean I know they're fully into their hormonal teenage years where they go through all sorts of changes, but nobody changes as drastically as Hermione did to force the relationship. Ron basically remained the same as he had been from book 1 (with the appropriate teenage angst thrown in), there was no major shift in personality or morals like we get with Hermione. I mean I'm not a strict Harmony shipper but Hermione would've literally been better with almost any other character than Ron. I mean come on she jinxed a sign up paper to disfigure anyone who betrayed the D.A. Harry and Ron included and yet she just forgives Ron for abandoning not Just Harry again but her as well with minimal issue? Pull the other one J.K.
