He wasn't, but what he knew about the Horcuxes, or about anything else; he could have told Harry about them ahead of time, instead of dealing with trying to get Slughorn's memory and all of that, that was going on. I think Harry knowing about the Horcruxes, or even having an idea of what or where they are, would have been better. (IMO).

Especially since Dumbledore knew that he didn't have much time left.
