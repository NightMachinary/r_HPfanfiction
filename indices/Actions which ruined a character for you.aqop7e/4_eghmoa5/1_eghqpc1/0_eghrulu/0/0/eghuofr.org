And Dumbledore's inactivity in the face of attempts on his life that endangered innocent students. And Ron (and everyone else with a brain) not suspecting Malfoy given that family's history and the recent arrest of Lucius. And the utterly stupid "lessons" spread over months that could have been done in a few hours, tops - just to draw things out. Dumbledore failing to tell Harry and co. anything, failing to get them the items and instructions they'd need, instead going through some stupid shell game with his inheritance in book 7... the list goes on and on.
