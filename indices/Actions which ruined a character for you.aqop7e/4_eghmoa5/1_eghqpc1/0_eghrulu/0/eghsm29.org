I dunno about /every/ character, but there were definitely things that irritated me.

Dumbledore's confession, as [[/u/Hellstrike]] pointed out, seriously soured me on him and I've been forced to make mental reaches to justify it because I really like Dumbledore.

Hermione's attack on Ron, plus everything [[/u/yoafhtned]] mentioned. And her refusal to trust Harry about Draco, as well as her attitude about the Half-Blood Prince book.

As well as Harry's obsession with Draco; it got old fast. And Tonks turning so depressed that she's not even aware of her surroundings all because of Lupin.
