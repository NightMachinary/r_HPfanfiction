  Fairly sure Hermione brought up the possibility of Snape being the person trying to kill Harry initially after the quidditch match where Quirrell curses the Nimbus 2000.

  Ron's the one that mentioned Malfoy being the Heir of Slytherin first, noteably by quoting Malfoy's comment on seeing the first blood message that Ginny left under Riddle's possession.

  Most of Sirius being a killer was from everyone else. He'd been seeing that Sirius was a criminal around on wanted posters and in the news, heck Shunpike mentioned Sirius being a murderer, when McGonagall, Hagrid and Fudge dropped the bomb of why he'd been thrown into Azkahban, namely he was suspected of being the Secret Keeper and murdering 13 people.
