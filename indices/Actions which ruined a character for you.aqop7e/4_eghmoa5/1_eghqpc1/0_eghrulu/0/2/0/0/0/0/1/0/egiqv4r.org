When writing fanfic, I like to try to make people make sense enough to work out motivation, rather than starting with a tabula rasa and fitting their motivation to plot as JK Rowling does. A Doylist approach doesn't suit me, I'll always go Watsonian.

I mean, if that's always the answer, 'a plot needed it' then there's no argument to be had. There's no 'why' to even talk about. It shuts the entire conversation down right away, because, well, obviously you're right. He's not a person, he's a plot device from a set of children's books.
