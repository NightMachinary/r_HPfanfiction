Sorry if I've said this to you before, but I always see him as being so wedded to his Grand Plan that he doesn't care about anything else. He acts the part of being caring, but actual empathy is entirely lacking. He /thinks/ sorry, rather than /feeling/ sorry, because he wants to be a good person but the actual empathy isn't really there.

In canon, we see him lie and conceal his true feelings several times. We never see him do anything awful, so I don't put him down as /evil/, per se, merely entirely neglectful. Passive!evil rather than active!evil if you like.

(Or he's a plot device with no emotional motivation whatsoever, granted, but writing him sort of requires trying to make a him make sense as a person.)
