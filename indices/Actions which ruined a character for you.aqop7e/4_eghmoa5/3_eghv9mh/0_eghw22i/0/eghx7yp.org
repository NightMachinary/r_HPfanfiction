I think many readers tend to forget that the main characters are indeed teenagers. I don't know you, but I did some seriously stupid/cringy things when I was that age.

For most teens, those years are indeed about abandoning your "child self" behind, to become an individual. Being OOC comes with the whole deal. Add some almost non-existant adult supervision and it's a miracle Hogwarts is not a 24/7 debauchery fest.
