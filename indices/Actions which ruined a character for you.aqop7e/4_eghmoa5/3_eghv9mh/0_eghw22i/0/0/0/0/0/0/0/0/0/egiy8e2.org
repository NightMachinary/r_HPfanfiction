  As for Sirius, he and Harry weren't that close actually and he acted more like a friend than a father.

There's an actual scene in the books where Harry /explicitly/ sees Sirius as a father-figure. He has a question and goes through how people would react to it. In the end, he writes to Sirius, realising now he has an adult he can just ask things like a dad.

I can't remember what the question actually was or which exact book.

Yes, there's very little interaction for Harry to cling on to, but he actually, in-canon, does. Iirc this is revisited in the tearing-up-Dumbledore's-office scene. (I... will avoid the rant on how Dumbledore handled that.)

  As someone who is bipolar I can say confidently that Harry doesn't show signs of long term depression (i.e. depressive moods lasting weeks or more), and we can see his thoughts that should be evident if it was intended. I like your theory, I just don't think it pans out.

  Granted!

  Edit: I just noticed where you said he didn't show other signs of depression, so sorry for the mini-rant on that topic.

Not a problem, you weren't horrible about it. I didn't feel attacked or anything and it's nice to have another point of view.
