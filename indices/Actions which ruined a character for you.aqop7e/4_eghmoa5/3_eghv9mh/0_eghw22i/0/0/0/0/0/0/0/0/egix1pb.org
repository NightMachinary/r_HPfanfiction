  It's a very dangerous time, especially because this is the same period when parental figures are cast aside, and peers have nearly all the influence. The teen drops being 'X's child' and becomes 'adult friends of Y and Z' as their core identity, a necessary part of becoming independent.

Except that Harry was more closely linked to Dumbledore (the closest thing we Harry gets to a father figure) As for Sirius, he and Harry weren't that close actually and he acted more like a friend than a father.While Harry was grieving it was more for the relationship that they never got to have. As someone who is bipolar I can say confidently that Harry doesn't show signs of long term depression (i.e. depressive moods lasting weeks or more), and we can see his thoughts that should be evident if it was intended. I like your theory, I just don't think it pans out.

Edit: I just noticed where you said he didn't show other signs of depression, so sorry for the mini-rant on that topic.
