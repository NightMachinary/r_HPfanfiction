Except that 6 books is a bit late to rethink your character, while Harry wasn't very proactive in book one (I remember someone once arguing that you could replace Harry in book one with a Mr Potato Head and the only scene that wouldn't play out almost the same was the troll) but in after that he took a progressively more active roll in every entry until 6. If you told me he was cursed to forget about Voldie unless someone else brought it up or he saw Draco I could believe it.
