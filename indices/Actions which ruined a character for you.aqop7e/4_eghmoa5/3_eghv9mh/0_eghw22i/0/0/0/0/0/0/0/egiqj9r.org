  I'm unaware of a hormone that makes someone periodically forget that someone is trying to kill them, or that changes their outlook on that.

Ugh, I'm sort of on your side for this whole argument so far, but here's something pertinent. OK, in brain development, there's a period of idiocy, where the risk-reward balance skews nearly /all/ the way over towards 'reward' and 'risk' is all but irrelevant, when making a decision.

It's a very dangerous time, especially because this is the same period when parental figures are cast aside, and peers have nearly all the influence. The teen drops being 'X's child' and becomes 'adult friends of Y and Z' as their core identity, a necessary part of becoming independent.

So, you have someone who does't care about risk because their synapses are being pruned and their entire identity is being reformed. Like toddlers, teens are basically suicide-machines.

  Also this change would have to happen within a couple of months (the time between the end of book 5 and the beginning of book 6)

He lost his one single father-figure and was put in isolation with the Dursleys again and adults are going on and on about the war when he's out of isolation and all working visibly on trying to keep a happy face despite that. I think that does have to be taken into account. There's a depressive period of grief, especially if you can't let it all out, and Harry never does except as anger. Being reactionary rather than pro-active is /very/ characteristic of depression. And depressed people can be just going-through-the-motions, rather than visibly depressed. Though you can say he shows no other signs of that and, well, I couldn't argue!

I mean, on the whole, I think you're right, he becomes very frustrating to read about and is nerfed horribly. He approaches greatness and then takes a hard turn straight back to mediocrity and passivity.
