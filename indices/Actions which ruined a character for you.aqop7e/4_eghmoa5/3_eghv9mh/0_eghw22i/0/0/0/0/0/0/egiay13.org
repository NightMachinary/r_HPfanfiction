I'm unaware of a hormone that makes someone periodically forget that someone is trying to kill them, or that changes their outlook on that. Hormones could explain his actions in regards to Ginny, but not his actions in regards to trying to train himself and others. If anything the cocktail that swims in the blood of teen boys would have helped motivate him doing things like the DA. Again we are talking about a character going from fairly proactive to being purely reactionary. Also this change would have to happen within a couple of months (the time between the end of book 5 and the beginning of book 6)
