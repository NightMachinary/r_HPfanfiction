While I could agree to a certain point there are two issues I would like to raise: 1 Hermione's characterization was so far removed from the other books it felt like a totally different character not just minor inconsistency that would actually make her seem deeper emotionally, 2 Harry does a complete 180 in-between books 5 and 6. Book 5 was all about Harry realizing that HE had to stand up to Voldemort and be proactive in the fight against him, and in book 6 he just went back to waiting for Dumbledore to give him something to do. To me it felt like a total regression of the character.
