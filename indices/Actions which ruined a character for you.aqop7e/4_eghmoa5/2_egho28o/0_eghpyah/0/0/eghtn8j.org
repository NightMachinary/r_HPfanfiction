  It's the difference between a schoolyard brawl and a heavyweight champion beating the crap out of some teenager.

My whole point is that in both cases, it wasn't a “fight” at all --- it was an underhanded exploitation of someone who was not able/prepared to react or fight back.

Cormac is a wizard, but he didn't have his wand handy because he was participating in a sport tryout that doesn't involve wand use or spell work. Cormac is /capable/ of using magic in general, but he obviously wasn't prepared to defend himself from an unexpected and inappropriate assault while he was busy playing quidditch. Hermione knee that and exploited the situation and his vulnerability to use her wand against him to get what she wanted, without Cormac's knowledge (and to his detriment, seeing as he lost out on a coveted Keeper position that his skill probably would've earned him otherwise).

The Muggle driving test evaluator can't use magic at all, and doesn't even know magic exists, so of course he isn't able to help himself.

At the end of the day, it doesn't matter who the person is, it's still equally shitty to stab that person in the back when they are just walking around and going about their day. You're still sneak-attacking an unarmed person who is innocently going about his day according to the rules and expectations of that situation.
