  At least she just attacked a classmate instead of abusing her basically divine abilities on someone who cannot defend himself in any form.

I don't see the distinction.

Cormac is capable of using magic, sure, but he wasn't in a position to expect to have magic used against him - let alone defend himself against it - at the time Hermione confunded him. Indeed, Hermione exploited the situation to use magic against him without his knowledge, for the sole purpose of unfairly disadvantaging him /and/ circumventing the rules/fair play. And she did it because she wanted to see Ron be granted a privilege that he probably couldn't have earned by his own merit.

In both cases, magic was used against a person without his knowledge or consent, when that person was unable to defend himself, and it was done in order to break the rules so Ron/Hermione could make sure Ron got ahead. Whether the target of the charm is also capable of performing magic is irrelevant to the analysis here, given the circumstances.
