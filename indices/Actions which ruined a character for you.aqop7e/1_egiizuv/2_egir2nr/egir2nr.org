Honestly, Dumbledore's pretty awful right from book one, when he dumps Harry on the doorstep with a note to Petunia telling her that her sister's dead and she has to bring up her nephew with no added support.

He doesn't cackle or gloat, but he does /awful/ things and never seems to actually care about people as thinking, feeling people with emotions he might want to consider.
