  not telling Harry about how to destroy Horcruxes just to have Snape pass on the Sword
#+end_quote

This is what annoys me the most about HBP-DH. I mean how hard is it to say "I destroyed the ring using Sword of Gryffindor, so you better take it with you next year." The entire Ron leaving subplot can be avoided, and Harry doesn't have to jump in a lake in the middle of nowhere /without backup./
