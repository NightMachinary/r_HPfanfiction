Dumbledore saying that Malfoy's life matters more to him than the lives of all the students and staff of Hogwarts. Having the gall to scold Harry and lie to him when he confronts him about his inaction. He went as far as to taunt Malfoy for his "feeble attempts" on his life. I wonder how that conversation would've gone had either Katie or Ron actually died, knowing that an invisible Harry was an audience. Or how greatly his inaction could've backfired had Harry or Slughorn died to the poison.

The plot of DH makes more sense if Dumbledore's ultimate aim was to safeguard Snape's reputation and life rather than the war effort or Harry. Namely, his shitty plan that led to Battle of the Seven Potters that caused Moody's death and nearly killed Mundungus, Kingsley, George and Hermione; not telling Harry about how to destroy Horcruxes just to have Snape pass on the Sword; not telling Harry that he was a Horcrux and then having Snape tell him that he had to die by /Voldemort's/ hand for some inconceivable reason.

  “Enough,” said Dumbledore. He said it quite calmly, and yet Harry fell silent at once; he knew that he had finally crossed some invisible line. “Do you think that I have once left the school un­protected during my absences this year? I have not. Tonight, when I leave, there will again be additional protection in place. Please do not suggest that I do not take the safety of my students seriously, Harry.”

  “Oh yes, I do,” said Dumbledore mildly. “You almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley. You have been trying, with increasing desperation, to kill me all year. Forgive me, Draco, but they have been feeble attempts. ... So feeble, to be honest, that I wonder whether your heart has been really in it.”

  “I appreciate the difficulty of your position,” said Dumbledore. “Why else do you think I have not confronted you before now? Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Volde­mort realized that I suspected you.”

  “You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry's departure from his aunt and uncle's,” said Dumbledore. “Not to do so will raise suspicion, when Voldemort believes you so well informed. However, you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, ought to ensure Harry's safety.
