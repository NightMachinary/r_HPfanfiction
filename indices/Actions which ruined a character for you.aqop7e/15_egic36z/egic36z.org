Lupin abandoning Tonks once he realised his unborn son might have lycanthropy. Also Lupin and Tonks for abandoning their newborn kid to fight Voldemort. Just reckless, tbh. In hindsight Teddy might have been better without them if all their parents did was to either bury their head in the sand when faced with a problem or abandon their personal responsibilities for 'the greater good'.
