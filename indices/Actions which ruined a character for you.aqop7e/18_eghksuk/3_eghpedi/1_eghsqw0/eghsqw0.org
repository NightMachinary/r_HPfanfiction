You'd be fine with a teenage girl deciding to erase large parts of your memories? Different strokes, I guess...?

As for the assassin bit, I'd consider it (I have a temper) but probably not go through with it. But definitely disinherit the twit and get as far away from her as possible.

Have you ever interacted with someone who suffered from alzheimer's? My family has a history of it (we don't have great memories to begin with) and it's honestly my version of hell. I would think what she did was something like that, especially since so many of their memories and major decisions in the past 17 years would have revolved around her. She took away a huge chunk of their life. Honestly, her actions made me somewhat sympathetic to the witch-burning muggles. The Death Eaters weren't doing anything that muggle serial killers and terrorists don't already do, but Hermione felt free to traipse around people's minds and erase memories as if she had every right to decide their actions. Erasing a five minute event (accidentally witnessing magic, etc.) is one thing, but nearly two decades of life is something else.
