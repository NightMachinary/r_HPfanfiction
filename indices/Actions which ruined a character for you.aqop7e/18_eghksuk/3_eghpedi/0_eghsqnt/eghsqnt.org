I think it's an I'd be embarrassed to have raised a daughter that thinks it's perfectly ok to just go around and, effectively, taking their life away. Maybe not to the point of killing her off, but I'd be preeeeeetty upset about the whole nonconsensual mind-wiping thing.

Like sure, she didn't ask to be born and doesn't owe them anything, but there are probably life choices her parents made that they otherwise wouldn't have because of having her. Taking away memories of her would likely leave them wondering why the heck they made a choice they wouldn't otherwise have made.
