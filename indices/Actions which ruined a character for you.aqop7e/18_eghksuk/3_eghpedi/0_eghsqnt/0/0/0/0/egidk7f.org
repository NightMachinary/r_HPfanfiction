Right but presumably they planned for her / had plans for a baby. Assuming they conceived her with no issues whatsoever, they wouldn't remember having an infertility diagnosis. I would assume they'd want a reason as to why they never had a kid. Presumably, the first place to start would be at the ob (who would likely know she already had a kid and tell her but tests could be run too).

Also, iirc they're dentists who don't have much sugar (tho I'll be honest and admit I can't remember if that was canon or not). That would lead me to think she wouldn't have a bunch of weight gain so the only stretch mark she'd have is on her belly and maybe boobs.
