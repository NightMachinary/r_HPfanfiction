A couple of things on that note, assuming her mother is a normal middle-aged woman, she's unlikely to ever have an in-depth enough look at her uterus (through ultrasounds, tests, whatever) to see uterine scarring. But if she had a untraumatic pregnancy, ut√©rine scarring would be unlikely in the first place. Also, not everyone gets stretch marks, and even if she had gotten stretch marks, after nearly two decades they would be faded to the point of invisible. On top of that, stretch marks can come from gaining or losing weight or growth spurts, so there's a whole number of reasons someone might have stretch marks.

Not saying there's not a whole bunch of other potential issues with Hermione modifying her parent's memories, but I don't think physical evidence of pregnancy would be a huge factor 17 years after the fact.
