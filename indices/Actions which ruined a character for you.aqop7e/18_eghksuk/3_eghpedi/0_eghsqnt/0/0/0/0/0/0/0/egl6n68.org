I had an episiotomy and I wouldn't know the difference, my son is 19mo. It would just be dependent on a case by case basis. Logically if someone's had their memories altered, their mind isn't going to go ‘hmm feeling different this way definitely means I've had a kid and forgotten about it', they would just find some weird way to justify or dismiss it. So there might be hints but she'd find a reason to ignore the hints.

I just think it's something that would be explained away because the logical answer wouldn't be ‘I've had a kid and forgotten', and Hermione gave them a burning desire to move to Australia and leave everything, so that'd take precedence.
