Okay, I went RL with this and asked my obstetrician Father in Law a hypothetical question lol.

An ob MIGHT identify a woman has been pregnant, because the nipple colour generally changes in pregnancy and doesn't revert, however that's inconclusive and would rely on the on previously knowing the patient (in which case, the ob would be like /a kid? Yes lol I helped you give birth like 17 years ago, should I call the cops?/)

Nearly 18 years on, after only one child, it's unlikely that a normal birth would have left any significant mark on the cervix/uterus that would conclusively say they had a child and the nipple change could hypothetically be caused by a miscarriage or puberty in the first instance.

Stretch marks, again in particular with a single pregnancy, would probably not be visible after that long, and if they were FIL says /'the brain is really good at rationalising weird things'/ and it's another thing that could've happened with puberty. My stretch marks will never go away but I know people who were back to smooth washboard abs in like 3 weeks after giving birth.

And the infertility/potential ob visit/other questions could easily be explained by the fact Hermione supplanted an entirely separate life in their memory. They weren't Mr and Mrs (Drs) Granger, they were Wendell and Monica Wilkins. Maybe Wendall and Monica never wanted kids. Maybe they tried for years but were never able to. Assuming Hermione isn't a complete moron with constructing their story, there's little reason why a probably 40+ year old couple (they were both dentists with an only child, seems likely they at least waited until they'd finished school to have a kid) would one day go â€˜hmm, how bout that kid we never had, better check in with an ob'. Also Hermione made it their hearts desire to immediately move to Australia, so even if they did decide that, they'd be going to see an ob in Australia who wouldn't know she's had a kid and the only case for it would be circumstantial evidence that could be explained away because why wouldn't you tell your new ob that you'd had a kid before?

Tldr; physical evidence would be minimal and the human brain is whack w justifications, plus magic is also whack.
