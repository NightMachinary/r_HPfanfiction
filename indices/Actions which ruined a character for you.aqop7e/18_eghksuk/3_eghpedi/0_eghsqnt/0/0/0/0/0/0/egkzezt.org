Going by personal experience, my vagina would let me know something was up. I tore...a bit, enough that my vagina pretty much is not the same, and will never be the same, as pre-pregnancy. Even without a mirror, I can feel the difference (and haven't actually gathered up the courage to take a look yet lol).

Numbers suggest 75-90% of women tearing so it's likely she also tore and maybe needed stitching. For me, this wouldn't be something I'd be able to dismiss (and something I'd doubt hermione would know to take into consideration).

I think England also has a folder with your pregnancy notes, which I would assume she'd keep as sort of a memory thing. That sounds like a weird detail to bring up in regular conversations and even weirder to keep out on the coffee table. I guess it'd be possible hermione steals that file, but I'd imagine there'd be other little objects to hint she has a kid.

(Lol yes, I am very desperate trying to find reasons)
