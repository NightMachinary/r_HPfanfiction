Hermione erasing her parents' minds - if someone did that to me I would sue, complain, hire an assassin, whatever. Throwing an AK kills someone, but erasing their memories erases their life, makes everything they experienced up to that point, pointless. This is doubly so when you think about how much of who we are is due to the experiences we've gone through. I was a Hermione fan up until that point.
