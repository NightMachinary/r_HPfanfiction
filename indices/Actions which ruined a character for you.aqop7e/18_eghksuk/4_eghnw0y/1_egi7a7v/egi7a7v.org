It bothers me when people say Hermione is supposed to the "brightest witch of her age." Where is this is canon? Only, and I mean only Lupin said [Hermione] was the cleverest witch of her age. It's never referred to again. Harry says something similar when meeting Horace Slughorn, but even he says [Hermione] is the "best in our year."
