Totally agree, I've always found Hermione's character hit or miss for me because I feel like she doesn't really have a core personality, there are so many things she does that don't make sense for what her character should/could be. I feel like Ron and harry are much more fleshed out in having a solid base that they grow from or stay true to. Hermione often shifts with what the plot needs imo. She's like Occam's razor but in character form. But this choice of hers makes no sense, Hermione is supposed to be the brightest witch her age and she thinks the best way to deal with her parents is a memory wipe? It doesn't even guarantee their safety. With all the knowledge Hermione has been shown to possess...there should have been a better way to take them out of the picture and keep them safe.
