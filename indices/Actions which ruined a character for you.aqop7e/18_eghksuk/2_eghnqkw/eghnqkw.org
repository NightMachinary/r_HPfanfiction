Completely agree! Since she's proven herslef to be such a smart witch, I figured she could have been able to get them into hiding somewhere else without having to erase their identities without their permission.

There was no reason she needed to completely erase/alter their memories, especially since they had been unharmed and unkown all the way up until that point.

Weirdly, she didn't seem so upset by it and I did find it weird how we never even learned their names or got to know their personalities at all.
