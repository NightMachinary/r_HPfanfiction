I don't really like the development of Harry throughout the series. I mean, it makes sense, don't get me wrong, I just don't really like it all that much. The anger, the angst, etc. I think how easy he used Crucio during The Deathly Hallows highlights it, and is my main issue. He wasn't able to use that spell on Bellatrix after she killed Sirius, but yet he can now use Crucio on a Death Eater for spitting on McGonnagal? Like I said: it makes sense, but I don't like it
