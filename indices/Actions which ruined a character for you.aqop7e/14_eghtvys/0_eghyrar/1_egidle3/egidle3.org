I didn't realize anyone thought that Snape wasn't also at fault. I think it's more of a "oh my god character we like just did something awful smh cancelled" situation for Sirius than a "well there he goes being an asswhole yet again" situation for Snape. He /is/ at fault, but there's nothing noteworthy in that.

Anyway, pure speculation: I read a fic that claimed Snape wanted to kill Remus as a werewolf and get Sirius expelled; two birds in one stone, so to speak. However, this theory is both /very/ extreme and also relies on Snape's confidence that he can kill a werewolf (which is more characteristic than him actually wanting to kill Remus, truth be told).
