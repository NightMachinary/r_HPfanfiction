You know, as much flak as Sirius gets for the Willow Incident, objectively, Snape should get at least as much of the blame. In "The Prince's Tale," it is revealed the that the Willow Incident did indeed occur before Snape's Worst Memory, but also that Snape already suspected Remus was a werewolf before that. Even if he was trying to get proof to out Remus, who in their right mind would go down a dark hole where they had good reason to suspect there was a transformed werewolf? Getting almost bitten should have been the logical outcome.
