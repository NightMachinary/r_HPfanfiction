I dunno about souring since I still like them, but Sirius and James' sometimes thoughtless actions with regards to Remus.

Sirius may have meant to send Severus down the Willow to see Remus as a joke, but it was something that would have killed Severus AND Remus. If Severus died, Remus is a goner. And a dead goner, because he would have committed suicide out of pure shame and guilt. Dumbledore would have been sacked as well. Luckily James pulled Severus out!

I'm not sure when the Willow incident occurred, but if it was before the events of Snape's worst memory, then its thoughtless as well in the part of the marauders (and tbf, Remus was careless too.) If someone held a secret against my best friend that could ruin or kill him, I'm staying out of that person's way, or try to be nice. Because if someday that person blurts everything out, my friend is a goner.

While the Marauders were the damn bestest friends for Remus, sometimes its those little things that explode into big things if you're not careful.
