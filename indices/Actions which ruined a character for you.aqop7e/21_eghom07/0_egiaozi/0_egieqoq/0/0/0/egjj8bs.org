  To me, this is one of the moments in OotP when it's most okay for Harry to lose his cool

Okay which moment is this? I just read OotP 14 now, they're in Hogwarts in that chapter.

  Harry and James have virtually nothing in common in their lives.

Highly debatable. Harry has several of James' best qualities, including his loyalty to his friends, nobility, a willingness to fight for what he believes in.

Harry inspires extraordinary loyalty from his two best friends, and several other close friends...James, well Sirus was loyal to James' memory till the end (yes, screw Remus).
