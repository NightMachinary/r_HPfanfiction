Harry had written a letter to Sirius asking him a question. I don't remember what it was about. Sirius chose to answer by floo-calling into the Griffyndor common room every hour until it was just Harry, Hermione, and Ron--anyone could have seen him. He then proposed a meet-up between them and him. he would come to Hogsmeade on their next weekend. The Prophet had previously disclosed that the Ministry believed that Sirius was in London. Harry believes that Lucius Malfoy knows what Sirius' animagus form is. Harry is adamant that Sirius not expose himself to danger just for a meet & greet. Sirius tells him the quote above.
