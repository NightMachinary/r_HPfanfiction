To me, this is one of the moments in OotP when it's most okay for Harry to lose his cool.

I mean, aside from being magical and sorted to Griffyndor, Harry and James have virtually nothing in common in their lives.

James led a life of privileged fun. Harry fell from one massive pile of shit to another for 17 years.
