  And James would have deserved it.

So, according to you, anyone who gives someone a wedgie deserves death, eh? Once you take the magic out of it, that's what the situation is, essentially.

  Which he has the right to do in the name of self-defense. As I stated in another comment, I wouldn't blame him for killing them in that instant.

Yeah, that'll go over really well. "I sliced their throats because they gave me a wedgie, officer." Yup, very well indeed.

  How is that a rape attempt? They were jinxing, cursing, and hexing people, not raping them. And that was over five years after the fact.

It's Mulciber that Lily is seething at, and that is the same Mulciber who's later imprisoned for several counts of the Imperius curse. Lily mentions that it was Dark magic that was being used.

A teenage boy putting a teenage girl under a mind control spell, gee, I wonder what he'd try to do?

  “Well then, you'll know he's so arrogant that criticism simply bounces off him,” Snape said sleekly.

Snape's impudence here is astonishing. He is one of the direct causes for James' death, and he has the audacity to gloat about it in Sirius' face. Sirius and Remus both know who leaked the prophecy to Voldemort - a prophecy is revealed, and all of a sudden, the Potters and Longbottoms go into hiding while Snape makes appearances in Order meetings, with Dumbledore's reason of "he has reformed"? Does not take a genius to figure out what happened and who leaked the prophecy.

If you were to mock my deceased best friend's memory in front of me, I'd break your face. So would most people.

  “No one's denying what he's done!” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice rising, her fists trembling on the arms of her chair. “But he's still-” “He's not a child!” said Sirius impatiently. “He's not an adult either!” said Mrs. Weasley, the color rising in her cheeks. “He's not James, Sirius!”

At this point, Voldemort has marked Harry for death - Harry is 15. As Harry's legal guardian, not to mention his well-wisher, it is Sirius' responsibility to let him of the impending danger. Warning Harry of the threat against his life does not, in any way, even suggest to pressurising Harry to be like James.

It's only Molly who sees the worst in Sirius at this point, being the uncouth harridan that she is. And in hindsight, telling Harry of the prophecy was absolutely the right thing to do.
