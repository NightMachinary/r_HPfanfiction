  So, according to you, anyone who gives someone a wedgie deserves death, eh? Once you take the magic out of it, that's what the situation is, essentially.
#+end_quote

If you're sadistic enough to attack people for no reason, you deserve whatever comes your way. And they did more than "give him a wedgie". And, I reiterate, they did it for seven years. Bullies are a blight and I have no pity for any of their fates, though James, Sirius, and Remus went out too peacefully.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, that'll go over really well. "I sliced their throats because they gave me a wedgie, officer." Yup, very well indeed.
#+end_quote

"I was being attacked by multiple assailants that wouldn't relent and had to fear for my own safety."

  It's Mulciber that Lily is seething at, and that is the same Mulciber who's later imprisoned for over two dozen counts of the Imperius curse. Lily mentions that it was Dark magic that was being used.
#+end_quote

Except rape isn't a dark magic spell and if he had been doing unforgivable curses at Hogwarts, he would have been expelled and imprisoned.

  A teenage boy putting a teenage girl under a mind control spell, gee, I wonder what he'd try to do?
#+end_quote

That's sexist. And again, he wasn't putting them under the imperius. He was probably doing things on the level of Malfoy giving Hermione molerat teeth.

  Sirius and Remus both know who leaked the prophecy to Voldemort - a prophecy is revealed, and all of a sudden, the Potters and Longbottoms go into hiding while Snape makes appearances in Order meetings, with Dumbledore's reason of "he has reformed"?
#+end_quote

They don't know, in fact. Only Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Snape himself know. Especially since they're the only ones that even know about the prophecy. And it's not a matter of "being reformed", it's a mater of trust and personal bias. Snape doesn't trust Snape due to his own personal biases against him, whereas Remus trusts Dumbledore, and by extention, Snape.

  If you were to mock my deceased best friend's memory in front of me, I'd break your face. So would most people.
#+end_quote

Not when that best friend made that person's life a living hell for years. And you'd respond to words with violence? That's not very mature.

#+begin_quote
  At this point, Voldemort has marked Harry for death - Harry is 15. As Harry's legal guardian, not to mention his well-wisher, it is Sirius' responsibility to let him of the impending danger. Warning Harry of the threat against his life does not, in any way, even suggest to pressurising Harry to be like James.
#+end_quote

Sirius isn't his legal guardian, since he's still a wanted man, and they're talking about Harry joining the order, not letting him know about being in danger. Harry's always in danger.

#+begin_quote
  It's only Molly who sees the worst in Sirius at this point, being the uncouth harridan that she is. And in hindsight, telling Harry of the prophecy was absolutely the right thing to do.
#+end_quote

Again, he didn't know about the prophecy, nor did anyone else.
