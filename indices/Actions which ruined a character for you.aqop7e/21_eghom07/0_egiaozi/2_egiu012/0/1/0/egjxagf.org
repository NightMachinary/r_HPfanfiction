Ah, the perennial defender of Snape returns. Look, you and I have had this conversation multiple times in the past, and we've never agreed. Why bother commenting?

  that's a baseless assumption

There is enough grounds to assume what went on - Mulciber's father was a Death Eater, Mulciber himself is later revealed to have an impressive control over the Imperius curse, Lily is thoroughly repulsed by one incident - far, far more than everything the Marauders have ever done, and she declares it to be Dark magic. Teenagers are quite capable of casting the unforgivables, as we see a young TMR and DM demonstrate. Juveniles are just as capable of rape and murder as adults - there have been enough and more violent crimes IRL to prove that.

From all those, it is not a baseless assumption at all.
