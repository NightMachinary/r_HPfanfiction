  He does that just as Ron interrupts Sirius from passing on a spell that would make surviving a dragon possible.
#+end_quote

No, I mean the night his name came out of the goblet. He tried to be happy for Harry.

#+begin_quote
  where do you get the "trying to pressure Harry into being James" from all that?

  “No one's denying what he's done!” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice rising, her fists trembling on the arms of her chair. “But he's still-”\\
  “He's not a child!” said Sirius impatiently.\\
  “He's not an adult either!” said Mrs. Weasley, the color rising in her cheeks. “He's not James, Sirius!”

  Where do you get the acting like a child from all that? When does he ever start a fight?
#+end_quote

It's clear he's still stuck in the mind of the same 21 year old he was when he was imprisoned and he tries to pick a fight with Snape both during PoA and OotP.

  “If I hear you're using these Occlumency lessons to give Harry a hard time, you'll have me to answer to.”\\
  “How touching,” Snape sneered. “But surely you have noticed that Potter is very like his father?”\\
  “Yes, I have,” said Sirius proudly.\\
  “Well then, you'll know he's so arrogant that criticism simply bounces off him,” Snape said sleekly. Sirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode around the table toward Snape, pulling out his wand as he went; Snape whipped out his own. They were squaring up to each other, Sirius looking livid, Snape calculating, his eyes darting from Sirius's wand tip to his face.\\
  “Sirius!” said Harry loudly, but Sirius appeared not to hear him.\\
  “I've warned you, /Snivellus/,”said Sirius, his face barely a foot from Snape's, “I don't care if Dumbledore thinks you've reformed, I know better ---”\\
  “Oh, but why don't you tell him so?” whispered Snape. “Or are you afraid he might not take the advice of a man who has been hiding in-side his mother's house for six months very seriously?”\\
  “Tell me, how is Lucius Malfoy these days? I expect he's delighted his lapdog's working at Hogwarts, isn't he?”\\
  “Speaking of dogs,” said Snape softly, “did you know that Lucius Malfoy recognized you last time you risked a little jaunt outside? Clever idea, Black, getting yourself seen on a safe station platform . . . gave you a cast-iron excuse not to leave your hidey-hole in future, didn't it?” Sirius raised his wand.\\
  “NO!” Harry yelled, vaulting over the table and trying to get in be-tween them, “Sirius, don't ---”\\
  “Are you calling me a coward?” roared Sirius, trying to push Harry out of the way, but Harry would not budge.\\
  “Why, yes, I suppose I am,” said Snape.\\
  “Harry --- get --- out --- of --- it!” snarled Sirius, pushing him out of the way with his free hand.

  The "poor outcast" had no qualms on laughing off a possible rape attempt on a fellow student
#+end_quote

How is that a rape attempt? They were jinxing, cursing, and hexing people, not raping them. And that was over five years after the fact.

#+begin_quote
  and also has no qualms sending lethal curses at his supposed "attackers".
#+end_quote

Which he has the right to do in the name of self-defense. As I stated in another comment, I wouldn't blame him for killing them in that instant. You don't attack people unprovoked, and if you do, the consequences are on your head.

#+begin_quote
  The "poor outcast" belonged in a juvie rather than a school.
#+end_quote

For trying to defend himself for bullies? For studying dark magic? For guilt of association due to his housemates behavior?

#+begin_quote
  For all the "poor outcast" yaps about James and Sirius being capable of murder at 16, he's not too far off when he's 15. The curse, had it hit James on his throat or eyes, could have killed him. But then, Snape is a huge hypocrite.
#+end_quote

And James would have deserved it. The difference lies in the fact that Sirius tried to lead Snape to his death, not killed him trying to defend himself.

#+begin_quote
  Have you ever been around a teenager, seriously? Everyone swears in their teen years. Every teen gets into fights over the smallest things.
#+end_quote

Just saying, someone should have knocked her teeth in. I got into fights with my brothers all the time, and they didn't pull punches because I was a girl.
