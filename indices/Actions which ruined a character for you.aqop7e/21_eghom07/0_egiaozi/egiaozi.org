  Harry: During Goblet of Fire, when he has his fight with Ron. He's the one that forces that confrontation and won't even explain his side, just being irrationally angry when Ron doesn't believe him at face value.
#+end_quote

He does that just as Ron interrupts Sirius from passing on a spell that would make surviving a /dragon/ possible. Harry is also the guy who saved Ron and Ron's little sister's life a year back, and Ron decides to be jealous right at that moment - I don't know about you, but I would definitely be nasty to someone who (unknowingly) interrupts me at that time.

  Sirius: He's a grown man that acts like a child, tries to start fights, and tries to pressure Harry into being James.

You've been reading far too much shitty fanfiction. Sirius does nothing of the sort. Sirius hunts Peter because he thinks Harry is in danger in book 3, he returns to the country where there's a Kiss on Sight order on his head when Harry is entered into the tournament because he's worried about him in Book 4, and in Book 5, he constantly tells Harry to keep his head down and weather the storm --- where do you get the "trying to pressure Harry into being James" from all that? Where do you get the acting like a child from all that? When does he ever start a fight?

  James: Apparently he grew out of it, but he was basically Draco without the blood supremacy. Spoiled rich kid that gangs up on the poor outcast for spite
#+end_quote

The "poor outcast" had no qualms on laughing off a possible rape attempt on a fellow student, and also has no qualms sending lethal curses at his supposed "attackers". The "poor outcast" belonged in a juvie rather than a school.

For all the "poor outcast" yaps about James and Sirius being capable of murder at 16, he's not too far off when he's 15. The curse, had it hit James on his throat or eyes, could have killed him. But then, Snape is a huge hypocrite.

  Ginny: Has no problem throwing her weight around, hexing people, and shouting verbal abuse

Have you ever been around a teenager, seriously? Everyone swears in their teen years. Every teen gets into fights over the smallest things.
