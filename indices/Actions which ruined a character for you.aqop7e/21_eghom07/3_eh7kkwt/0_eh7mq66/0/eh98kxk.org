  Lupin said Snape was jealous of James' popularity, which was a barefaced lie, and Remus knew it.

You might as well read the books, Snape was jealous James' popularity whether you like it or not.

  “I didn't mean --- I just don't want to see you made a fool of --- He fancies you, James Potter fancies you!” The words seemed wrenched from him against his will. “And he's not . . . everyone thinks . . . big Quidditch hero ---” /Snape's bitterness and dislike/ were rendering him incoherent, and Lily's eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead.

Prince's Tale chapter 33 from DH

Just before that :

  “We are, Sev, but I don't like some of the people you're hanging round with! I'm sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he's creepy! D'you know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?”

    Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face.

    “That was nothing,” said Snape. “It was a laugh, that's all ---”

    “It was Dark Magic, and if you think that's funny ---”

    “What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?” demanded Snape. His color rose again as he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resentment.

    “What's Potter got to do with anything?” said Lily.

    “They sneak out at night. There's something weird about that Lupin. Where does he keep going?”

    “He's ill,” said Lily. “They say he's ill ---”

    “Every month at the full moon?” said Snape.

    “I know your theory,” said Lily, and she sounded cold. “Why are you so obsessed with them anyway? Why do you care what they're doing at night?”

  “I'm just trying to show you they're not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are.”

The guy was so obsessed about them that he brought them up at any opportunities, even his best friend couldn't fathom why he was so fixated on them.

  Snape never pretended he was a good person. He may have thought he was in the right when he clearly wasn't, but he never pretended to be something he wasn't.

The same guy who likes to spit on how Harry like his father is school-breaker wandering at night while he was doing the same to get them caught ?

The same guy who reproached Harry to be arrogant brat while favouring Draco Malfoy ?

The same guy who used to call others students "mudblood" and attempted backtricking when Lily called him out on that.

Nah Snape is as hypocritical as you can get.
