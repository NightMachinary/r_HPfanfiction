Bullshit. Lupin never lied to Harry about James and Sirius, you not liking his statement doesn't make it wrong.

  Snape: Bullying children. But at least he's honest about being an asshole, which I can respect.

Snape honest ? The guy is one of the the worst hypocrite of the series. He is more deluded than anything.
