  Snape had a fascination with the Dark Arts and friends who assaulted Lily's friend for fun.
#+end_quote

He's not responsible for other people's actions.

#+begin_quote
  He attacked Petunia with magic at some point.
#+end_quote

He did not, in fact. He did something that scared her away and he mocked her, but that's it.

#+begin_quote
  And he went straight for a dark cutting curse of his own design in his worst memory.
#+end_quote

Because he was getting jumped. I wouldn't blame him for killing them. If they didn't want to die, they shouldn't have been attacking people without provocation.

  It is not nearly as one-sided as you make it out to be.
#+end_quote

Considering they started bullying a child they had just met for seven years for no other reason than wanting to be in a different house than them, I think it very much is one-sided.

  To be fair, with the amount of shit thrown at Harry, it is incredible that he functions at all.
