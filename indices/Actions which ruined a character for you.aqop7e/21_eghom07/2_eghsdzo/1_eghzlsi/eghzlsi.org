Snape's actions do not justify James' behavior. The tree branch that fell on Petunia after she insulted Lily and Snape was accidental magic and not something that 9 or 10 year-old Snape could control. There is no evidence that the spell he used against James was Sectumsempra, especially as Harry did not recognize the spell in the next book and it did not have the same effect on James as it had on Draco.
