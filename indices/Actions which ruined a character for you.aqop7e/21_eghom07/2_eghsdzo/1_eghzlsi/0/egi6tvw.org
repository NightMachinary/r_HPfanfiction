  There is no evidence that the spell he used against James was Sectumsempra, especially as Harry did not recognize the spell in the next book and it did not have the same effect on James as it had on Draco.

Snape cast it nonverbally, and a spell is more powerful when cast with the incantation. It also only grazed James' cheek, whereas it cut straight across Draco's chest. And I don't think Snape would have used a severing charm in a duel. Just doesn't seem his style.
