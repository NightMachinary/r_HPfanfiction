I agree about Harry, actually, but I'd also kind of like to add Ron to the mix.

Hermione is by no means a perfect character either, but I always felt like she got the short end of the stick so many times. Neither is a very good friend to her. Forgetting the time in first year (kids can be kids and say mean things, I know), I can't forget all the stuff in the third book. Harry gets a new Firebolt, Hermione suggests they check it for curses - given that, you know, Sirius Black is roaming around, /and Harry's things have been tampered with in more than one Quidditch game./ They both stop speaking to her for days.

Hermione's cat may have eaten Scabbers. Ron stops talking to her, Harry doesn't bother to ever check that she's okay - for this one, more of my blame falls on Harry, because I understand being upset at someone for their pet potentially having been eaten. But why didn't Harry care? Hermione spends the entirety of the Goblet of Fire helping Harry when Ron doesn't, and then at the Yule Ball, he just leaves with Ron even when he knows she's upset?? I think the fact that Ron was Harry's prize in the lake rather than Hermione was kind of telling. I can't recall a single time when either have apologized to her for any of this.
