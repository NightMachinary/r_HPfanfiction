Oh okay, my bad about the apology thing. I couldn't remember that part very well. Didn't know he apologized. And yeah, Hermione also handled that the wrong way - I understand it wasn't her fault, but she could have been kinder about it for sure. It was a pet.

And yeah - I think that's what I was trying to say, she puts more effort into her friendship with them, and it just rubs me the wrong way sometimes. There's so much evidence about how much she cares, but when I see Harry awkwardly walk away or say nothing, it makes me sympathize with her. Hermione's presence is often seen as a nuisance. It just feels weird because for a kid who grew up with no friends, Harry sure was choosy about his friends and how much genuine affection he showed for them.
