Yea, this essay is really good in breaking down Harry's perspective towards Ron, the Weasleys and Hermione by showing you the exact words and passages that create such feelings. Like for example how happy Harry felt when he was with the Weasley. This essay still holds up 15 years later which is why I saved it and recommended it to you
