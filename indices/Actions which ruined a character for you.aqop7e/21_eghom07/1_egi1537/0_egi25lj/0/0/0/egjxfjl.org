Thanks for the link! It was really interesting; I actually read through the whole thing. It really did explain a lot of feelings I had about the trio's dynamic. I can see why Harry has a tougher time around Hermione now, and why their relationship (on his end, at least) seems a little lacking. On the other hand, it really highlighted some of Hermione's flaws that I hadn't thought about in a while. It's true that she invested /a lot/ into her friendships, but I kind of understand now why it was difficult for Ron and Harry (mostly Harry) to do the same in return.

I guess it's sometimes easier to sympathize with someone who appears overtly hurt although they clearly care, like Hermione, but reading this made me sympathize with Harry, too - he was dealing with a lot, and his main support group (Hermione and Ron) didn't really know how to handle his emotions.
