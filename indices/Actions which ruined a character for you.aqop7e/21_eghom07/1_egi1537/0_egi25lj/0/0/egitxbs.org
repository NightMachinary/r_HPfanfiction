Well [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2004/10/28/dyou-really-think-theyre-suited-why-hermione-is-not-the-right-girl-for-harry/][this article covering the first 5 books]] (Written before HBP came out) might provide more insight for you into the dynamics of the friendship between the trio. While it is primarily concerned in trying to show why Hermione wouldnt be a good romantic partner for Harry in future books, it does delve into how Harry sees both Ron and Hermione. There are a lot of annotations and examples to back up the claims too and I find it pretty revealing.

In many ways, Hermione's fatal flaw would be her lack of tact. Yes her smarts and knowledge would solve a lot of problems in the books it shows that being right doesn't mean being convincing. In many ways, Hermione's character could be a critique of the "socially-awkward" genius type that has been popping up recently because characters in story get irritated by her overbearing personality. So While Hermione and Harry are certainly best friends, Harry probably would be worn out by Hermione for extended periods in company. Of course it doesn't help that he has life-threatening problems every year in school and so he looks for whimsy and humor in trying to cope with the stress of school life and real life. So this is probably why Harry and Hermione wouldnt be too romantically compatible

The essay too breaks down the close friendships between Harry and Ron and yea, it really raised my esteem of Ron pretty highly. I encourage you to read the essay
