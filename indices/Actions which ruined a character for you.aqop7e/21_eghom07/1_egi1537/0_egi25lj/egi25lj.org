  Neither is a very good friend to her.
#+end_quote

I think Ron is a good friend to her, but the problem is that she puts more effort into her friendship with Ron and Harry than they do for her. Harry especially, considering all she does for him.

  But why didn't Harry care? Hermione spends the entirety of the Goblet of Fire helping Harry when Ron doesn't, and then at the Yule Ball, he just leaves with Ron even when he knows she's upset??
#+end_quote

Harry isn't good with emotions. When tensions flare between Ron and Hermione, he prefers to keep his head down and let them sort it out themselves. He also doesn't understand the difference in their banter, as they're both argumentative people, yet he thinks any arguments are going to come to a row. And just like with Cho, he doesn't understand a female perspective, so he doesn't try to comfort Hermione, as he can't empathize with how she's feeling.

  I think the fact that Ron was Harry's prize in the lake rather than Hermione was kind of telling.
#+end_quote

His first and best friend. Even in GoF, he laments that he wishes he and Ron were speaking as he much prefers his company to Hermione's, who does nothing but pester him about studying and homework.

#+begin_quote
  I can't recall a single time when either have apologized to her for any of this.
#+end_quote

Ron apologized for the rat incident and started treating Crookshanks better. He was initially upset because A. Scabbers is one of his only possessions and isn't easily replaceable due to his economic circumstances, and B. Hermione isn't even remorseful, even going as far as saying "That's what cats do."
