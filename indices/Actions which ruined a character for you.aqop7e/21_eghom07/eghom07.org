Harry: During Goblet of Fire, when he has his fight with Ron. He's the one that forces that confrontation and won't even explain his side, just being irrationally angry when Ron doesn't believe him at face value. He has his good friend moments, but it's just odd to see how his bad friend moments are never brought up. He doesn't treat either Ron or Hermione very well.

Draco: Pretty much anytime he speaks.

Lupin: Justifying James' and Sirius' bullying behavior and outright lying to Harry about it.

Sirius: He's a grown man that acts like a child, tries to start fights, and tries to pressure Harry into being James.

James: Apparently he grew out of it, but he was basically Draco without the blood supremacy. Spoiled rich kid that gangs up on the poor outcast for spite.

Snape: Bullying children. But at least he's honest about being an asshole, which I can respect.

Ginny: Has no problem throwing her weight around, hexing people, and shouting verbal abuse. She really deserved a comeuppance.
