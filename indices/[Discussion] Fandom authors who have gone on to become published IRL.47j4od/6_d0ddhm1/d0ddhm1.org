Joe (Wastelands/Heartlands of Time, Hero Trilogy) has published some amazing fiction.

JBern (Bungle in the Jungle/ TLIL) has published some not-so-amazing fiction.

Cassandra Clare (fics I'll never read) has published fiction I've never read.

There's a couple others I can think of who have taken down their work under the assumption of trying to get published, like RainingInk, though I don't know if anything has come of that
