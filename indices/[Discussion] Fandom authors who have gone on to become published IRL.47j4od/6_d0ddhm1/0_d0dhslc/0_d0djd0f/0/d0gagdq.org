That's not even mentioning how Clare also got away with scamming several of her close "friends" and fans out of around $10,000 total, by allegedly lying about some of she and her friends' laptops being stolen.

  On December 5th, 2004, Cassandra Claire announced on her LiveJournal that her apartment had been broken into and her laptop had been stolen, along with laptops belonging to Ruby, her roommate, and Josh, her boyfriend who had been visiting.

  A few hours after Cassie's post, Heidi8 posted a entry proposing a "whip-round" to gather money to buy new laptops for Cassie, Ruby, and Josh. Sam Starbuck (copperbadge) and Clio (jlh) offered drabbles to those who donated.

  Ten hours later, Heidi announced that they had raised over $2,000 with donations from approximately 300 individuals.

  The next day, she announced that they had met their fundraising goal but would continue taking donations for a toy drive at the hospital where Ruby worked, since a box of toys meant for the drive were among the things stolen from Cassie and Ruby's apartment.

  Cassie, Ruby, and Josh all posted thank you notes to their journals. Cassie later confirmed that she and Ruby had received their laptops, and Ruby confirmed that they also received the toys and money from the toy drive that went to the pediatrics ward.

  It is unclear precisely how much money was raised, or how much went towards the laptops or to the hospital. Fan History Wiki alleges that the total was quoted as being more than ten thousand dollars, but this remains unsubstantiated.

  Wank started in the comments to Cassie's announcement of the robbery, mostly variations of whether it was inappropriate to ask about how it might affect the posting of /Draco Veritas/. Reports of the robbery and Heidi's fundraiser were posted to fandom_wank; the first wank report was deleted, but a new one was created shortly thereafter.

  In a comment on a post on Heidi's LiveJournal, which announced that roughly 300 people had donated to replace the stolen laptops, sapphireisle expressed frustration that they were able to raise money so quickly while her family, who was in more serious need, did not get nearly the same amount of attention or support.

  Heidi's response to this comment was met with some criticism; one anonymouse called it "cold and outright snide in places," and the fandom_wank report states: "Heidi8 made a big deal about the charitable blood that flowed through her sainted veins like milk and honey and then refused to help the woman with rare cancer until fandom pressure demanded it."

  Heidi, however, contended that she was trying to be helpful, and that she would be happy to post a link to Christina's collection, but thought that it would be unwelcome.

  Both Heidi and Cassie did post links to Christina's fundraising website, 4Christina.org, shortly after sapphireisle's initial post. sapphireisle's post was also linked in the comments of LaptopGate report at fandom_wank, where readers proposed trying to raise the same amount of money for her as was raised for Cassie.

  It gained further visibility at fandom_wank when the possibility of pimping the cause (i.e. readers donating in order to get Clare to write or post updates to her Harry Potter fanfiction faster) was the subject of its own mini wank report.

  The wank was revived several months later, when Christina replied to one of Heidi's LiveJournal posts, which was signal-boosting Heidi's friend's breast cancer fundraiser.

  Christina asked Heidi to post a link for her own cancer fund, to which Heidi replied that she was too busy and suggested other resources. Christina posted on her own LiveJournal about Heidi's refusal, and things spiraled from there. [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/CharityWank][(Source)]]
