  Cassandra Clare (fics I'll never read) has published fiction I've never read.

Back in the day (circa 2004) she was known as Cassandra Cla*i*re, and she got burned in a massive plagiarism debacle. Since there is no court of law in the land of fanfiction, she essentially got off. But now she's gotten caught up in a plagiarism lawsuit recently for her published material. I like to think of this as karma coming back to bite her.
