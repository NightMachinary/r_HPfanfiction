"Perspicacity" here.

I believe BajaB and nonjon both have published short stories in various pay, semi-pro, and pro markets. Tenhawk has published novels.

Though I doubt it counts as "going legit," I've published 25 short stories and novellas in a variety of markets, including SFWA-qualifying pro markets. (I also have over 150 scientific articles and nonfiction book chapters, though they don't really count for this discussion.)

I had an offer on a novel from a mid-tier publisher a couple years back but turned it down when my lawyer and theirs couldn't settle on some contractual details. I've another offer from a publisher to novelize one of my short stories that I may take up (if I can convince my wife to let me spend the next vacation writing).
