I jokingly refer to it as the unofficial continuation of the series. It picks up following James Potter in his first year at Hogwarts. He primarily has to deal with the attention his father's fame brings him, as well as several new dark threats from abroad. The first book is probably a 7/10, as George openly admitted he tried writing too similarly to JK, and it affected his natural talent. Books 2-4 after that are significant improvements and the second is one of my favorites over several of the canon books.

James is the lead character, but he travels to Hogwarts, America, and more. There are enough glimpses of the adults to feed the nostalgia, but this is definitely a book about the kids adventures.
