I wouldn't say ironic, no. I'd say "aware of the pro fantasy market." Or perhaps, "played it safe with her publisher, who was taking a chance on a young, unknown writer."

Although the publishing climate is a lot more accepting than it used to be, you still don't see many m/m or f/f end-game relationships in pro fic. So Novik was presumably being savvy about her career and the likelihood of her publisher backing her if she chose to include a central gay romance. Makes perfect sense to me.
