Yeah, she's a bit of a dynamo. Not everyone "clicks" with her writing, and this sub is unlikely to care about her because her output is 95% slash and she concentrates on shipfic with specific narrative kinks. But she's prolific, focused, tireless, intelligent, better than competent, and knows how to network.

She has over 400 fics posted on AO3 under her fannish pseud right now. Unlike most fic writers who cross over into mainstream publishing, going pro doesn't mean she's dropping out of fandom.

I have mixed reactions to her work, but she's written one of my favorite fics for the TV show Person of Interest.
