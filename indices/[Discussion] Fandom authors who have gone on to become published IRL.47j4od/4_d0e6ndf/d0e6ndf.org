Naomi Novik is a huge BNF, has written hundreds of fics (including some in HP), and was the original motivating force behind Archive of Our Own.

Her Temeraire series has been optioned by Peter Jackson for a possible movie deal, and her latest novel /Uprooted/ may end up on the Hugo ballot this year (biggest fiction award in the scifi & fantasy genre).
