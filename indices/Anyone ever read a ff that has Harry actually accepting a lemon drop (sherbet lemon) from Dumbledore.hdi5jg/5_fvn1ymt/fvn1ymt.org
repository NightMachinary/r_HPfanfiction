I think he does a lot in linkffn(11364705)

He's learns an objects history by touching it, so he's mentally super old, which means he and Dumbledore are bffs. He spends a lot of time with him and eats his candy. No idea if it'll ever be finished though. Just recently started being updated again.

Yes children, down vote for giving a link to a fic where he eats the candy. Grow up.
