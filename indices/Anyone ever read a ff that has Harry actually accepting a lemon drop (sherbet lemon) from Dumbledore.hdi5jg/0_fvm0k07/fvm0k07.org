There was a fic (was it a one-shot or one scene in larger story? not sure), where Harry having his thoughts elsewhere mindlessly accepts one, and Dumbledore goes all crying that he is the first person to accept a sweet from him since like forever or something.

And in some time-travel-Harry-goes-to-Marauders-time story (was it linkffn(The Winds of Time by ausland)?) Harry suggests to Dumbledore lemon drops as better alternative to whatever confectionery he was eating at that time.
