I was leaning into that handwavium pretty hard but I see your point. I'm more interested in examining the characters that have been genderswapped. Just picking new first names for those characters that aren't too terrible is pretty hard. I don't want to think about rewriting history back 1700 years. As for the more recent demographic shift, I feel like it would still need to be three or four generations old to be significantly different from cannon.

The original story idea could be cool but one of my projects is already a novel. I'd love to read anyone else's original story based off this, however.
