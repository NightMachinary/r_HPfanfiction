I have considered this sort of concept, but I always end up hurting my brain with the timeline and last names and whatnot. With a change so far back in the past it'd be, for example, basically impossible to figure out what any non-muggle born's last name would be even if every witch in history somehow ended up with the same person they did in the OT. Sure, you can handwave this stuff (and for a haremfic, I guess my standards are being bit high here), but it feels less satisfying to me dammit.

I actually prefer the idea of having this be a very recent thing. With Harry's generation being among the first all/mostly female generation and the adults still being pretty balanced. That way you get a first hand look at how the society struggles to adapt to such a huge disturbance and I avoid hurting my brain over the timeline.

Either that, or just make this a completely original fic based off this premise.
