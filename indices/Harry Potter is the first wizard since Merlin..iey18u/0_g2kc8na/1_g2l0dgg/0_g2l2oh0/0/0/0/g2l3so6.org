I forgot to mention it in the post but I figured he'd be treated a little differently by the Dursley's too. Petunia would know that men can't be magical. They would treat Harry more nicely but with growing trepidation as accidental magic started happening. Maybe they would be in denial at first but that could lead into a feeling of betrayal when the letter arrives.
