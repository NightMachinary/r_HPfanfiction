I had this idea but with a little twist : Harry is not the second wizard ever but the third, Voldemort was the second one. Merlin is revered because Merlin and he deeply fashioned the magical world but the magical matriarchy is still fresh of Voldemort's atrocities so Harry's arrival is met with mixed reactions.
