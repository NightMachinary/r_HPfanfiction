+linkao3(Planet of Witches)+ /A world of Witches/ by zweltstein7 on AO3 sort of does this. However, men from magic families are squibs and still attend Hogwarts. They can do the theoretical stuff, runes, potions and even become animagi (Sirius Black is one), but can't do active magic. Not sure how many characters are genderswapped, but it's going the full harem route ala linkao3(Total Command).

Until Harry. Not that anyone other than the Sorting Hat knows it yet.

ETA: fixed title, but can't direct link. There hasn't been any sex that I remember, but it's stll rated E.
