I think it's a function of age of the protagonist, as much as anything.

For the first few years of magical education, the typical wizard or witch can only cast basic jinxes; they have to enunciate their spells, limiting their "rate of fire"; and they can't shield, so the only way to avoid being hit is to get out of the way. So, yes, they are going to be dodging a lot if they want to get anywhere.

Then comes the 5th year, and the student learns the Shiled Charm, which suddenly means that dodging is not as critical, and ability to cast spells well --- perhaps while maintaining the Charm --- gains in importance over physical ability, though dodging is still a viable strategy instead of shielding, depending on the circumstances.

Then comes the 6th year, and if the student elects to take NEWTs in DADA, they learn nonverbal casting, making their casting much more rapid and much less predictable, as they get better at it, and dodging against them therefore becomes much less effective.

Standing one's ground, shielding, and countering becomes the dominant strategy, and with experience, we end up with something like the duel between Molly and Bellatrix: rapid exchange of spells by opponents focused on each other that ends when one of the opponents is distracted.

Of course, if the person has a specialty, like Transfiguration, it might be incorporated in their dueling style, especially if they are as skilled as Dumbledore or McGonagall; but they are the exception rather than the rule, as are the greatest of Dark wizards, like Voldemort.
