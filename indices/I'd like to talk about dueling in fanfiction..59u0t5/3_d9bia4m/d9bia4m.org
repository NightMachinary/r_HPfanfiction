There are several things that should come into play in duelling scenes that often don't:

The fighting style employed; Duelling with wands is hard. You have to know what spells you are going to use-how they work, what effects they have, if they're area-of-effect or require accurate targeting, how quickly they act and how quickly they burn out-intimately. You need to know what movements are required, how the spell is invoked-does tone matter? Inflection? Does it require a particular enunciation? An accent even?-and what the effects are if the conditions are either met or not. This does not even factor in things such as spell-chains, that quirky little fanon idea that pops up sometimes.

So you have built up a little repertoire of spells to use. You know exactly how to cast them, how not to cast them and which situations they can apply to.

Problem is, someone with even moderate fighting abilities is still going to kick your ass if you don't actually train how to use them in a fight. Which is when you get to the section of stuff most authors skip-the actual training itself and its effects on the trainee's own combat abilities.

And what style they will end up favoring.

There would be fighting styles that emphasize the use of dodging in combat, just as there are styles that account for the fighter wearing body armor, being capable of concealing themselves or using enchanted weapons as part of their arsenal. This fighting style would be the domain of those that are either ridiculously athletic or come pre-equipped with shields to back them up though, because the first thing their opponent will do is try and box them in when they realise what the other party is doing. Well, that and carpet-bomb the area with area-of-effect spells that impede movement or outright immobilise the dodger as quickly as possible.

A dodger is generally going to come out on top against inexperienced duellists purely because they either don't have the repertoire or the experience to counter someone moving out of the way of their hexes and jinxes, but someone who employs any AOE explosive spells will hard counter a dodger within seconds. So when you have two firsty schoolboys going at it? Dodging is a valid fighting style in and of itself-and even then a bookworm with attitude could probably deal with you. When the opponents become more experienced though, dodging becomes little more than a kind of useful tactic as long as you don't mind tempting the other party to turn the battlefield into a hail of flying shrapnel.

So there's that.

The terrain: While duels are held on flat platforms where neither side has access to any cover whatsoever, they can also be held in graveyards. On a flat platform with nothing to trip on, dodging is an alright strategy. The opponent cannot really do anything to change the battlespace in his/her favor nor can they afford to cast the sort of spells that would basically blow up the dodger without risking hitting their audience as well. There are ways around that, so a duellist with even minimal experience or training could handle a dodger quite well.

In a graveyard however, the situation is very different. The soil is uneven, there are many hidden little pitfalls to stumble upon and there is plenty of cover to take advantage of. Dodging is suboptimal unless kissing the ground is part of your must-have duelling experiences while going from cover to cover and attacking from a semi-secure position is a far, far more viable option here. The temptation to use a crypt for cover and just shower the area with bombardas and confringos is great indeed, but with great cover comes greatly impeded lines of sight. Sneaking around and ganking the opponent from behind is another option those with access to camouflage spells or invisibility cloaks would definitely consider. Factor in the existence of peruvian instant darkness powder and fire spells and you have even more options handy...

And that's not considering what fighting in an urban environment may be like. Dodging in such areas is practically required as being blindsided is practically a guarantee, but it is not the overarching path to victory most depict it as. Again, a dodger is only as fine as his footing allows him to be. All it takes is one stumble and your opponent has you bang to rights.

The underlying intent: Is it murder? Part of a contest? An actual 'you-pissed-me-off-so-now-I-am-hankering-to-kick-your-ass' fight? That will dictate many things-the repertoire of spells the combatants are allowed/willing to use, the tempo of combat, the viciousness of the tactics employed and many other things. Consider it this way-if it had been Voldemort on stage with Lockhart, Lockhart would have been used to redecorate the room, regardless of the original purpose of the demonstration. However, depending on the intent of the duel, bits of Lockhart may have still been alive enough afterwards to be put back together.

So the intent matters here-and renders dodging more and/or less viable, depending on the situation.

There are a lot of factors that most authors don't account for. They see dodging as a viable tactic because they don't actually think about the consequences of said tactic-the way the enemy will adapt to the situation, the way a dodger will account for changes in the terrain or counteract any battlespace control measures the opponent will employ, what spells someone can use when dodging, how dodging is affected by the inevitable pileup of both fatigue and injuries sustained in battle etc.

It's not a style meant for prolonged conflict-dodging is a tiring and stressful activity to undertake, particularly in live fire situations like a duel. With the speed at which spells can hit and the level of attention that needs to be devoted to both successfully predicting an incoming spell as well as plotting out the safest and most efficient path a dodger can take to get out of danger/into position to retaliate, it starts off hard and rapidly approaches impossible. As an overarching strategy, it lacks finesse. Taking cover is often the smarter option, shielding long enough to weather the spells before retaliating offers up more options and outright being the first to attack every time has the same disadvantages to it with the benefit of actually having you dictate the flow of battle pretty easily. Hell, if it came down to it, maybe dodging is a viable tactic when paired with non-wand-based ranged weaponry, but the benefits of such a tactic are... controversial at best. Besides, even with things such as enchanted firearms being a factor, creating and taking cover are vastly preferrable to spending an entire duel basically on the run.
