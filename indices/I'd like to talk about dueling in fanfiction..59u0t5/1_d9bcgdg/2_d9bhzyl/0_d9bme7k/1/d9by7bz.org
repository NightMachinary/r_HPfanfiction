That all may be true, but Stupefy and Expelliarmas are also no lethal common spells which are light years more effective. Why hit someone with a "distraction" spell when there are others that end the fight? I get your point that you shouldn't leave yourself open to counter attack, but if you hit them with the first spell it should be the only one needed.
