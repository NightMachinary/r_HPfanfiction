Part of the problem is that said Tarantellegra and Rictumsempra actually /are/ dueling spells in canon. They shouldn't be, but they're what the Death Eaters were throwing around in OotP in the ministry. So if writers aren't familiar with actual fighting and are drawing on canon for how to write battles they've been badly primed for writing good duels.

I can see a use for them in group battles (regurgitating the usual defense for the ministry battle): they're ways to tie up other combatants in trying to help their hurt allies, especially if it's something they feel they can reasonably fix. A lethal curse isn't going to do that. They may also be useful for capture-but-not-kill fights.

When doing some basic hema stuff, my instructor's mantra was always 'you either win or lose a fight, there is no draw.' So I'd say spell selection should be those that are damaging if they hit but not leaving yourself vulnerable is more important until you can put them at a disadvantage where you can make a killing strike. So again, always shooting lethal stuff at them isn't always the best option (yes killing them quickly stops the fight, but if it also gives them an opening to attack back, it's not a great idea).

The best option is whatever keeps you safest.
