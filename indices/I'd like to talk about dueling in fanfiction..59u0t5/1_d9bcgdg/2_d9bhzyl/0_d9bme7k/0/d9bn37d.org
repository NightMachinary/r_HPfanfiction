  Part of the problem is that said Tarantellegra and Rictumsempra actually are dueling spells in canon. They shouldn't be, but they're what the Death Eaters were throwing around in OotP in the ministry

They are "dueling spells" and they should be. Not all duels/fights have the groups on both sides wanting to kill each other. When you want to subdue your opponent, they make good choices.

EDIT: Aaaaaand then I see the part of your comment where you basically say that.
