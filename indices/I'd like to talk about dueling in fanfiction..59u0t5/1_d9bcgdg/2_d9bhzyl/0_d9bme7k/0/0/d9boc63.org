Yeah, I had a change-in-thought while writing and forgot to clarify the earlier bit.

So I think they have their uses but they shouldn't be the primary choice if you're in a life or death situation which was the situation I was replying to was set up as. I would expect also that there are other spells that do similar things but are aimed at actual fighting instead, which would be the ones you chose.
