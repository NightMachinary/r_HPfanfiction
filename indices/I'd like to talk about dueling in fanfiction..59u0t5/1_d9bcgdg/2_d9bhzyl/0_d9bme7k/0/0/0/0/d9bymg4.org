Why would you feint with a non effective spell? If you see a spell coming at you you have to dodge/block/counter either way. So why use a useless spell as your feint? It would be far smarter to use say Stupefy as your feint in the off chance it connects. If it connects you didn't need to feint anyway and if it doesn't it's equally good as a distraction. There is not a single instance I can think of where making someone dance/laugh is preferable to stunning them.
