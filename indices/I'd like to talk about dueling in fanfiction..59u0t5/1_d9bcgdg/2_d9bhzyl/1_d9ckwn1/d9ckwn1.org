A bullet that kills takes one guy out of the fight. A bullet that wounds/incapacitates takes out the target and the guy that has to drag them away from the fight. Or something like that.

Though I generally agree with you, one has to keep in mind that spells like the Tickling Jinx or Jelly-Legs were introduced in the first few books which are much more whimsy-fairytale. Then once we get into the YA books, suddenly you have The Insta Win Unblockable Death Delivery Curse. DE using the silly spells was, I think, a way to show that it was wizards fighting, who according to JKR's author avatar aren't the most logical folks because magic. So things that seem logical and obvious to us muggles aren't always the optimal approach when magic is involved.

Tangentially, this allows a neat explanation for why the traps in PS were what they were and not just a bunch of traps rigged to rain down shrapnel and acid if you stepped on the wrong tile on the floor. Snape's trial was prepared by a wizard of some muggle background and beaten by a wizard and witch of muggle backgrounds.
