"And usually, a single opening is enough to end the duel."

I completely agree with this. One of my biggest pet peeves in FF dueling is when characters use stupid prank like spells in the the middle of a fight for their lives. Tarantellegra and Rictumsempra are two I see quite often. I find it completely unrealistic and frankly fucking stupid to use any spell that doesn't end the fight if it connects. Every spell that directly affects your enemy should be a finishing spell.
