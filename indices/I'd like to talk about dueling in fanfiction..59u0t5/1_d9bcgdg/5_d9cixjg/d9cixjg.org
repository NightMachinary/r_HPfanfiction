You haven't really solved your fundamental problem with the system here (spell tennis). All you've really done is scramble the order of events and made it kind of awkward to follow, as well as made it impossible to /not/ instantly get killed by anyone with a lethal enough spell.

I don't think you can have a simple system of magical fencing keeping strictly to canon. Spells have a wand motion component, and a verbal component. In order for magical fencing to exist, you'd need a number of spells which sound like other spells, and have similar motions, but do different things, mostly blocking other spells. For example, a spell which starts with /Expell-/ and starts with a twirly motion, but ends up as a different spell which deflects or interrupts motion-affecting spells.

Fencing, and really any sort of practical martial art, is dynamic. There's at least as many ways to strike as there are ways to parry, block, or feint, and it all comes together from reactions and predictions. Taking /what we know/ to exist in Harry Potter, if such a complex system existed, duels would look like two wizards spouting gibberish constantly while twirling about. It would be a battle of language and dance, two wizards trying to outmaneuver each other in the magical space between them, and while that would be interesting, it's not what exists in either the books or the movies.

Aim and dodging are the most likely practical skills in duelling because otherwise, duelling is either pointlessly lethal or more complex than can be reasonably extrapolated from what is depicted.

Alternatively, you could say that there's an incredibly easy spell which allows even young wizards to non-verbally deflect incoming spells, which is basically what the movies came up with, but I somehow suspect this would not make you happy.
