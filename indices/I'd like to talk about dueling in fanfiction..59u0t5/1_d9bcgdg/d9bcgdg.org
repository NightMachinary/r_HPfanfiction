I too hate seeing dodging being advocated as a valid or even superior tactic to use in duelling. This is for a number of reasons, but mostly because I imagine spells as moving too quickly to be dodged unless you are already moving out of the way before the spell has been cast (or are very far away).

We've never been given too detailed a description of the mechanics of duelling and blocking, especially as the linear nature of a narrative means you cannot present simultaneous action very well, but I think Snape's duel with Harry in HBP demonstrates that successful blocking of spells is about countering them /during/ the casting process, not after the casting process.

This in turn leads me to think that the picture of spells as projectiles is largely incorrect. I think the process of putting a curse or charm on something is largely the same: you're placing the spell directly on the target. When you complete the casting process, the spell will take effect on the target. As such the visual effect and spell travel occur /during/ the casting process, not after it. A duel is not "spell tennis". It's much more like fencing: you test each others defences, manoeuvre, and try to find an opening to strike. And usually, a single opening is enough to end the duel.

So I think 99% of the time, attempting to dodge in response to spells will not be a valid tactic. You cannot dodge in a controlled manner in response to already-cast spells. Rather to dodge you have to throw yourself around in an unpredictable manner to prevent yourself from being successfully targeted in the first place. So dodging can help you avoid spells for a time, but you're in no position to attack back.

However, on a related note, I think the idea of "aim" is generally overstated in the fandom. Certainly it's possible to miss. However, I don't think aim in magic has much to do with actual physical aim. This ties in with the idea that spells are not projectiles emerging from your wand and travelling in a straight line to the target like a bullet. Rather a spell is something you are putting "on" the target. I only really think a spell would miss if there's a sudden mismatch between the direction you intended to send the spell and the location of the target e.g. they have dived out of the way, or apparated, the moment they saw you raise your wand.
