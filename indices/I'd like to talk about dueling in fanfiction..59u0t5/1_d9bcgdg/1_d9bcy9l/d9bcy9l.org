Do you think there are ever two types whereby one does travel like a stunner which is often described as a beam of light and the other is as you described on the target such as a levitation charm? If we take the heavy intent option of magic then if you intent to hit someone then you should, otherwise we might see horrendous implementation of longer wands/staffs specially designed for long distance accuracy.
