We don't really have any explicit examples of shields being cast in response to spells that are already "in flight". Like I said, it's hard to pin anything down because the linear nature of the narrative means that it has to note things as happening in a particular order even if they happened simultaneously, so the fact that the shield charm is mentioned after the offensive spell isn't really conclusive, as that would be the case either way.

Of course nothing of what I have said denies that spells move through space to their target. I'm basically just talking about the timing of this phenomenon.
