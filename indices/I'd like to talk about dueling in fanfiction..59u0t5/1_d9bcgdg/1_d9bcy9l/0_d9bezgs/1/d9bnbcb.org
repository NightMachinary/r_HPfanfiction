I may be misinformed, but in canon, spells must have some sort of delay/travel time if people are able to use shield spells like protego to block it. If it's instantaneous, those kinds of spells would all be useless. We also have examples of when fawkes jumps in the way and physically swallows the killing curse, which seems to imply that curses do actually have to travel the distance to reach their target.
