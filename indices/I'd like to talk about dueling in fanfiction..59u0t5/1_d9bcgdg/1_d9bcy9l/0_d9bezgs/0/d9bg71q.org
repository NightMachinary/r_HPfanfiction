I'm going purely off memory here so I might well be wrong but didn't Harry and co dive underneath stunners in book four in the forest near the quidditch world cup. Your explanation seems to imply the light comes after the effect as opposed to the light carrying the effect, please correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't that then imply that if you cast failed to cast the spell on someone i.e missed you wouldn't get a light?
