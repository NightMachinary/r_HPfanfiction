I generally take the particular physical description with grain of literary licence salt. For example, the Killing Curse is sometimes described as a flash of light, other times it's described as visibly travelling. I think the stunning charm has similarly been described in two different ways, sometimes as a nimbus of light, other times as a more "beam" like entity.

In short, I think that the physical descriptions that we're given are meant to conjure a certain impression rather than being a clinical description of the spell's appearance, which I imagine as relatively distorted as well as too fast-moving to fully discern.
