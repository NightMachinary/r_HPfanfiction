Artistic license, yes. I also tend to separate spells into hitscan and projectiles in order to keep things internally consistent in my fics. So the Killing Curse would be a "projectile", but the Unlocking Charm would be "hitscan". Another way to describe it is to say that the KC is cast at the target while the Unlocking Charm is cast on the target.

It's not that canon compliant, but it inserts some order into the magic system that I find to be lacking in canon.
