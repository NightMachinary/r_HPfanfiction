No, I'm not saying the light comes after the effect. I'm saying that the light and spell travelling is occurring during the casting process (i.e. during the incantation) and that the effect occurs when the spell is complete.

So, with a stunning charm, the red light would be forming around your wand then travelling across space while you were saying "Stupefy!". If the spell is blocked before it is completed, then the light would splutter out. Otherwise when you finish saying the word "stupefy", the spell takes effect and the person is stunned (unless they are no longer there).
