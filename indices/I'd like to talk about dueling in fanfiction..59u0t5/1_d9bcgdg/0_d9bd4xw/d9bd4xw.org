I have to point out that usually, "dodging" is used incorrectly anyway - bullets are far too quick to be dodged. And yet we usually say "I dodged a bullet" when the bullet missed us - often, because we moved. Hitting a moving target is rather hard.

In other words: diving out of the way, running, apparating - that's all what many see as "dodging".
