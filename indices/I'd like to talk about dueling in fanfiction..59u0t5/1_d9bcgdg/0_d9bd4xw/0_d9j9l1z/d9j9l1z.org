I agree with you here. Whenever I see dodging used in fics though, I get the impression that spells are moving like as fast as a nerf gun fires or like an object thrown fast. And thus dodging spells that are already coming at you is more plausible.

It would be nice if writers could implicitly or explicitly carry across the speed of things. And do the same for their dodging, make it more descriptive like "running to the side to make it harder to aim, or "diving backwards when Harry saw the death eater start the final wand movement".
