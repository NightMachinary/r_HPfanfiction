  I imagine spells as moving too quickly to be dodged unless you are already moving out of the way before the spell has been cast (or are very far away).

If you don't have time to dodge, you don't have time to block.

Your other points are good. My headcanon differs, but you've put a decent amount of thought in that and come up with an interesting result.
