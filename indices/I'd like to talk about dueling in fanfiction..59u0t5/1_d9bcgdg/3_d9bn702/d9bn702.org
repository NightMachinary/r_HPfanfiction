  We've never been given too detailed a description of the mechanics of duelling and blocking, especially as the linear nature of a narrative means you cannot present simultaneous action very well, but I think Snape's duel with Harry in HBP demonstrates that successful blocking of spells is about countering them during the casting process, not after the casting process.

While I'm not disagreeing with you, I would like to point out that Snape essentially admits to legilimizing Harry during that incredibly lopsided fight with his "clear your mind" or whatever line during it.
