Right, which certainly enables him to block successfully with ease. But presumably knowing what spell your opponent is casting a few seconds earlier does not change the nature of what it is to block a spell, it just helps you do it better. You could conceivably do the same thing if you recognised the spell from its wand movements, visual effect, or the first syllables of its incantation.
