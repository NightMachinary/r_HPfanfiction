I usually consider a duel as a fight between two people, often with rules or even a code. It can happen on a battlefield, but as soon as ohers are involved, it's no duel anymore.

And in a fight involving multiple people, dodging and moving until you have hard cover means you will be much harder to hit by an enemy you didn't see in time - in the army, I was surprised how much harder it was to hit moving targets instead of stationary ones, and that was with an assault rifle and semi-automatic and even burst fire. If your opponents are using wands, you'll be even harder to hit. You don't look for footwork and telltales in such situations. Also, if you are so close to your allies that your dodging would hinder them, you are far too damn close. A formation which is that tight just invites Bombardas and other area-effect spells.

Dumbledore is the exception, not the rule, in my opinion, and I generally have him use transfiguration and conjuration a lot - creating walls and floating barriers in addition to using strong shields and creating animals to fight for him, to compensate for his slower movement.

In the same vein, Dumbledore's enemies will usually be forecd to move or dodge, since he'll be as likely to turn the earth beneath them to water (or acid), then to stone when they have sunk into it as he's to transfigure the debris behind them into a poisonous snake, or a swarm of spiders, or an animated stone net. Or fill an area with a burning or acid cloud, then hit their shields if they stay within it.

Those enemies who simply fire direct-damage spells at each other until a shield fails are usually the inexperienced and less dangerous ones in my stories.

I do agree though that in a proper duel, especially if it's a formal or sport one, watching footwork, and minimising your movement would play a far larger role. There you can afford to focus on one single opponent.
