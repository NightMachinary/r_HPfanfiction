I do not agree with that view. At all. Not only does HP Magic offer many tools that make tactics beyond "pair up and duel" not just valuable, but actually far superiour - area-effect spells, conjured or transfigured or enchanted creatures that act on their own, spells that change the battlefield and can contain the enemy, as well as spells that are harder to defend against and allow even a relatively unskilled enemy to defeat or kill you with a lucky shot (aka, the Unforgivables) - but your tactics do not work as you think they do.

Even if everyone had the luxury to be able to pick their target at leasure, and the enemy would let them do it, instead of everyone starting to fight as soon as possible and attacking the best targets they see, the fact that the Death Eaters are masked means you don't even know until it's too late if your chosen opponent is actually more or less skilled than you. Combat involving multiple people and at the range we see in canon is chaotic, and brutal. There won't be any pairing up of similarly skilled opponents until the numbers of the figthers have been pared down - and at that point, odds are one side is already fleeing.

Also, you do not seem to know much about the Military either, if you think that a single skilled combattant is less effective in the kind of skirmishes that are comparable, number-wise, to magic battles, than a skilled wizard in magical combat. Just check the Medal of Honor citations for many examples of one good soldier making a huge difference - and not just because morale and momentum plays a huge role in battles.

So, to sum it up: Your tactic requires knowledge about the enemy that is not available in canon - Death Eaters are masked - or an opportunity (to observe the enemy fighting before picking a target) that won''t be there.
