  I usually consider a duel as a fight between two people, often with rules or even a code. It can happen on a battlefield, but as soon as ohers are involved, it's no duel anymore.

That's fine for a fanfic if you want to establish a new language convention, but within canon duelling is very much a synonym for "fighting with magic".

In any case I don't think magic lends itself well to group fighting tactics of the sort used by Muggle armies. I think there's a good reason why magical battles tend to result in the battle devolving in a number of smaller, mostly independent fights. It's a function of the variation in magical skill between wizards, whereas Muggle combatants tend to be more standarised in capabilities. A single skilled wizard can cut through a relatively large number of average wizards with ease.

So when you're fighting a force with significant variation in skill, you need to commit your own most skilled fighters to engage with their most skilled fighters in order to contain them. Similarly if you over-commit too many fighters to engaging with a single wizard in an attempt to overwhelm them with numbers, then you leave yourself vulnerable to the enemy doing the same thing to your own fighters who are left over. So the nature of magical skill I think predisposes the nature of magical battles to people pairing off with those of equivalent skill, with relatively even numerical distribution.
