I'm a firm believer that there are two types of duel shown. Firstly we have the Dumbledore/Voldemort style where there is a mutual respect and it is more a test of knowledge and skill but there is also the brutal style in the thick of it where all manners and decency have long since fled and survival is all that remains.
