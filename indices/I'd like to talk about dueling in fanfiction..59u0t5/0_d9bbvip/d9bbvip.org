So the reason I think dodging is so prevalent in FF is because it's a known quantity that writers don't really have to develop.

I'll give you an example. One of the later chapters of "I'm Still Here" by Katherinb has a fight between Harry and a death eater. Harry is chasing the Death Eater across the school grounds. As the DE is fleeing to an apparition point, they fire at some school children that happen to be about.

Then /In the middle of a chase scene/ the writer goes off on this overlong tangent about the incredible shield charm Harry uses to protect the bystanders. We learn what it's called, what is looks like, what it can block, when harry learned it etc etc.

By the time we get back to the actually chase, all momentum is lost.

This is especially frustrating as Harry has been teaching another student how to fight for the last couple of chapters. It would have been the perfect opportunity to teach the reader something, then during a climactic moment, have the hero use the thing we learned.

I think it was [[/u/Taure]] who said that duels are like a chess game. It isn't about who's the strongest magically, its about who can out think their opponent. Case is point, Dumbledore mitigating the Killing Curse with the use of animated golden statues.

But this requires planing and at least some education of the reader, so that you the writer aren't just pulling stuff out of nowhere, but the episodic nature of FF hampers this kind of forethought.
