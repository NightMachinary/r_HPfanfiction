Dodging is indeed often taken to ridiculous levels, because it's an easy crutch for an author who can't think of more interesting descriptions, so they just have the character dodge between shooting bullet-like spells, like it's some gun-kata show.

However, I don't think the concept itself is inherently bad. It has its uses, but many fanfic authors don't account for the fact that different wizards may have different styles. Moving around, casting spells on the move makes sense for Harry, who's a Seeker and was catching small objects like nobody's business from the first time he rode a broom. Then you have Dumbledore, who's so awesome, so monolithic that all the movement he needs is either in his wrist or he just apparates.

The problem is, that's as far as most fanfics go. A little imagination goes a long way.
