She would be a very damaged girl. Between her childhood, the complete lack of a normal friend-type relationship outside of Hermione & Ron (again, debatable given how often they just manage to squeak over the survival line with the end-of-year showdown) and the massive trap Hogwarts turned out to be when she found out she was a destined hero, I do not think that she would be capable of anything approaching normality in terms of having a life after Voldemort.

I also don't think that she'd look anywhere near as good as people assume she would, given the chronic pain, strain and stress she is under most of the time. She'd be scarred, wary, paranoid, thin and a tad short by the age of 18. Whether or not she'd bother with such things as makeup and clothing is another factor. Why do so, after all, when everything you ever learned had more to do with trying as hard as possible to sneak past unnoticed and survive rather than boldly put yourself out there where everyone and their pet Death Eaters wants to /kedavra/ you and everyone you love? Those habits would be hard to break if she chose to do so and I'm not entirely convinced she would even try given what she went through to get them.

On the other hand, she would have one hell of a snarky sense of humor to her.

As for Ron? He'd be a surprisingly good fit in this. Canon book Ron, that is. Canon movie Ron would be rather amusing in his conflicts with the girls, but would otherwise fall flat. And bashbash!Ron? Probably wouldn't survive one of fem!Harry's bouts of paranoia-fuelled stalking/pre-emptive acquisition of targets.
