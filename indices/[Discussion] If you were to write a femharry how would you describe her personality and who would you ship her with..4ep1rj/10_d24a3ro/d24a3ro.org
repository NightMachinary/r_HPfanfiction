Please excuse the wall of text, but this obviosuly needed a release. No tl;dr I'm afraid. I'm just that ruthless.

As a matter of fact I am writing a fem!Harry fic, although I have no idea if I ever publish it.

I'm not sure if my input here helps since I deviate from any sort of canon quite early. In my fic Poppy Pomfrey and Minerva McGonagall save the life of fem!Harry as well as Lily at birth which was complicated by a curse that has hit Lily during pregnancy. That leads to the daughter be named Poppy Minerva Potter and Pomfrey becoming her godmother.

The only thing canon is the attack on Godrics Hollow a bit over a year later. Pomfrey heals Poppy up in the Infirmary but refuses Dumbledore since she knows she is named in the will as the guardian for Poppy.

Poppy Pomfrey then raises Poppy Potter together with McGonagall (because I always imagined those two being a cute couple) half the time at Hogwarts and half the time at McGonagalls cottage. They call each other Pop (Poppy Potter) and Pom (Poppy Pomfrey).

My characterization for Poppy was always a bit tomboyish at heart, but I made her look very girly in her first years due to Minervas and Pom's opinion on whats proper hairstyle, dresscode and whatnot for a girl is. Shes still not someone who learns magic for the sake of learning, but growing in a environment of a Healer and a Professor of Transfiguration did give her a healthy work ethic. She very much emulates her two parental figures by being stern and very no-nonsense when the situation calls for it, but I made her also get a lot of goof and sillyness from Grandpa Albus (who deals with the situation by growing into the role of grandfather for Poppy). What will become a problem for her later is that she resembles her grandmother Dorea Potter and by that, her Black side. Neville gets rather hostile against her simply because she looks like a miniature Bellatrix with green eyes. Poppy deals with that by rebelling - a lot. She takes aging-potion and makes fake ID to get tattoos and piercings, dyes her hair, wears muggle clothing as often as possible,... all in order to distance herself as far as possible away from her resemblance of Bellatrix Lestrange (I took [[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/6e/7c/2e/6e7c2e2a07c64f40bfde7b58aa94f8ce.jpg][Jinx]], [[https://40.media.tumblr.com/c99ec186ffa21f564a159b5e2415ff4a/tumblr_n0usgj4JMu1rvarxzo1_500.jpg][Vi]] and [[https://cdn1.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/000/292/673/large/tracer_presskit.jpg?1443931586][Tracer]] as inspirations for the way she'll look in fifth year). But she still resembles Bellatrix so much that when Voldemort eventually returns and frees the Death Eaters, Poppy can swindel her way out of a situation by fast-talking Bellatrix into believing that Poppy is her daughter that got stolen from her by Voldemort. Bellatrix then kidnaps her... but that is way too far into the story.

Also, since she /has/ a family, her greatest wish is one of great ambition. She wanted to fly to the moon using magical means since she saw a picture of earth from the surface of the moon. Its actually the way in which she and Hermione become friends since the muggleborn is smitten by the idea.

When it comes to pairing her with a boy, I'm not sure. For a first, I keep her character open. She has two bisexual parental figures and one homosexual grandfather - so "nurture over nature heterosexuality" is flat out. I already have a scene with her getting a bit lovesick about Cedric Diggory and awfully jealous of Hermione going with Viktor to the Yule Ball (or is she jealous of Viktor wink wink, nudge nudge). Anyway... possible candidates are also one of the Weasley twins. She does have a little thing with George after he helped her procure the aging potion to get tattoo equipment, but the thing is quickly over after she gets grounded for three eternities after Min and Pom find out that she had tattooed half of her body with skulls, dragons and griffins (because teenage and eeeedgyyyyyy) and a little souvenir on George's bum (a joker mask). Ron is flat out. I think he was a good friend for Harry, but I don't see him enjoy being around Poppy, who constantly mills over outlandish applications of magic. Dean and Seamus... meh. Nevilles also out because even though he eventually gets over her resemblance of Lestrange, he still couldn't date someone who looks like the torturer of his parents (just imagine what Freud would say about that). As for boys in other years, I don't really know.

So, after we have the boys, we can hold onto George, Cedric and Krum.

Since I made Poppy bisexual, the fairer sex isn't out of question. Lets just make one thing clear, I'm not gonna put her with Hermione - thats established itself pretty fast in the bit of dialogue and such that I already have between them. They're sisters and fellow pioneers into outlandish areas of magic. Her first experience in this area is going to be with Parvati. Is she the final thing? I don't think so. Poppy does get a bit lovestruck with Fleur, but realizes quickly that the aloof french girl isn't what she wants. Currently I'm writing about Poppy trying to woo Susan Bones because... well, because boobs...

/"You just want to go out with her because she 's developing chronic back aches. You keep staring, don't try to deny it." Hermione shot her the patented Granger Glare of dissaproval, melting every denial like ice cubes under the summer sun./

/Poppy stared at her friend. She blinked once, she blinked twice and then tilted her head slightly to the side. "I imagine my head between all that flesh-fluffy goodness just buried in there, my hands... ." She trailed off, a dreamy expression on her face while she gestured massaging roughly round shapes around her head./

/"You're the worst."/

/"You keep telling me that and yet you're still my best friend. What gives?"/

But I have a feeling about the buxom Hufflepuff and I keep my writing open to see what happens. I think that Poppy is going to find a bit more than flesh-fluffy goodness with Susan.

So yea, to come back to your question: George or Fred, Cedric and Krum for the boys - Fanon!Susan or a similar character for the girls.
