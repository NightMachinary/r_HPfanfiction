If canon Harry looks like James but is closer to Lily's personality, then femHarry looks like Lily but is closer to James' personality. Fun-loving, an incorrigible prankster, can be a bit of a bully, but ultimately grows out of that phase.

Also, let's be honest, if Harry was a girl, Ron/Harry would be the only option that makes sense. They're practically in a bromance in canon; a romance would be a foregone conclusion if one of them was a girl.
