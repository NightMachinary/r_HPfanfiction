  Whereas I see Ron as a moronic slob that doesn't know there's a difference between his food, chess and sleep life, and everybody else's life. And that I hate him for believing life owes him something just for existing. (I know my impression of Ron is heavily colored by fannon but still.)

Your impression of Ron is completely blinded by bad fanfictions and movies' character assassination. Canon Draco, on the other hand, was a worse person than Ron by several magnitudes.

I would very much enjoy a fem!Harry/Ron story.
