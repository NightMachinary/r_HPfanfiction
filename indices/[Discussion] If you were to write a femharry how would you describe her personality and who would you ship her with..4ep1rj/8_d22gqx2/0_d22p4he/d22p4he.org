I would love to read a fem!Harry/ Cedric romance during the tournament... Maybe turning into a fem!Harry / Draco later on the 6th book (I think I've read a one shot where this actually happened... I think it was called 'Spite' - sorry, I don't have the link).

I wouldn't like to change her personality at all; well, maybe just a little bit... maybe she would be a little bit more concerned with her appearance and would like to get rid of Duddle baggy clothes ASAP... I think she still would be friends with Ron and Hermione, but maybe she would see characters like Neville, Parvati, Dean etc in a different way??
