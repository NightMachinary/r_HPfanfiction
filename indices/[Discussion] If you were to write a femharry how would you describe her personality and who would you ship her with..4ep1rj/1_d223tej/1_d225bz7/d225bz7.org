I have mixed feelings about Ron personally. I mean he is an awesome friend, one that I would love to have my back in messy situations. At the same time I read him as immature at times, and I have never liked to hang out with immature people. So for me he's a great guy but I don't think I could do him justice because that immaturity colors me.

I like Ron as a side character, mainly because I can deal with his personality in small doses only.
