Eh, the biggest problem for Ron is his most memorable mistakes are him turning his back on his friends. His best trait is his loyalty, and he still turns his back on his friends.

Its easy to forget all the times that his loyalty held true. Its easy to forget he is a 17 year old that shouldn't be in the shit situation the HP kids are in. Its easy to ignore that despite fucking up he does recognize his mistakes and tries to correct them in the end.

It doesn't help that the Ron in the movies isn't nearly as redeemable as the Ron in the books, and that colors a lot of peoples vision of him very heavily.
