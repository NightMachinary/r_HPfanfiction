Admittedly, though, at least some of those are justified enough in the series. And, just like with Dumbledore, many people who bash Ron simply don't get his character at all.

  Jealousy

Here I ask, what is Ronald's most desperate desire, the thing he saw in the mirror of Erised? It is to raise high enough to get recognition not as just the sixth son who wasn't the best at anything but as someone who did something significant. Anything he could have achieved academically had already been achieved by one of his siblings, it wouldn't be /significant/, so for him it is worthless and the fact that he can muster enough effort to pass at all already means something; he is the child who never would get acknowledgement for anything pertaining to his studies, so he has no reason to apply himself to that. And yet here he is, always the second player to Harry who already has that recognition he wants so very badly, regardless of whether Harry wants it or not. The fact that he sticks to Harry throughout the years, separate incidents notwithstanding, is a sign of some serious loyalty the likes of which can only really be found in Bellatrix's loyalty towards Tom (and she was a fanatic).

We get back to the previous point. Nothing he ever does academically would cause his family to recognise him because everything he could have done had already been done. At that point he was a child, and children learn to do things they are encouraged to do and recognised for, so since nobody recognised his efforts in that area he just stopped caring.

A bad thing of him to do, sure, but once again we get back to his desire and to the fact that once again Harry got more recognition whereas he didn't get anything. Those were words said in anger, not truly meant, and though the fact that it happened at all shows his flaws and his bad side it also shows that no matter how big his flaws were he got back to Harry. And for many other people such a falling out could have spelled the end of their acquaintanceship.

In a very large part the horcrux's influence, exacerbating his negative emotions and his one desire that was the root of his flaws. And had it not been for the fact that he had an immediate run-in with the snatchers and had to escape he would have been back after mere minutes. Going out of the tent is his fault, if you presume that it's not the horcrux's fault that it affected him but rather his, but not returning to them (and thus “abandoning” them) very much isn't.

  Bullying Hermione (firebolt, SPEW, running around calling her mental.)
#+end_quote

And didn't she do things to deserve that? Both the issue with SPEW and the issue with the Firebolt boil down to Hermione deciding that she's automatically more knowledgeable than anyone else and knows better and has the right to decide for others, which is one of her major flaws by the way. With SPEW it should be obvious why it is so, and with the Firebolt she pretty much stole it from Harry to take it to McGonagall. Ronald was petty when he called her those words, but deserve them she did.

As for the MoM situation, it's still a choice he did make, and the same about the DA situation as he personally had no reason to go against Umbridge's teaching aside from his loyalty to Harry. His hygiene and eating habits are both valid points, yes, and regardless of that it's not like you aren't allowed to dislike him for whatever reason, but overall your perception of him is dyed with some bad paint.
