You are of course right in that Ron in the books did help harry a lot risking his life in the process several times.

But of Ron's many faults I can name several that irk me to no end.

- unwillingness to apply one self

- running of during the horcrux hunt

- accusing harry of putting his name in the goblet of fire

- Bullying Hermione (firebolt, SPEW, running around calling her mental.)

- Eating habits

- Hygiene

- Jealousy

And about the DA, if I'm not totally wrong Harry did not actually want to do it at the start the whole thing was Hermione's idea from the get go. Yes Ron was a part of it but both he and Harry went along with the plan not spearheading it. And the MoM as I remember it harry was ready to go alone but the others talked him into taking them with him adding to the danger and stress of the situation (this is at least fact in the movies as I don't have the books at hand for fact checking)

I will also admit to that most of my memory of the harry potter franchise is dominated by fanfiction most of the time, and bad fanfiction at times(reading fanfics for 8 - 10 years without re-reading the books does that to some people) but that's mostly me disagreeing with the route that J.K took the storyline after book 4.
