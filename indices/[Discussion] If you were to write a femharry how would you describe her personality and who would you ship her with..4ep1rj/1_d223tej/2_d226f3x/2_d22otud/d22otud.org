  unwillingness to apply one self

Like many other teens. If you're going to judge Ron for that, then something like 80 percent of teenagers are unworthy of friendship.

  running of during the horcrux hunt
#+end_quote

I think it's pretty much outright stated that Ron leaving was likely due to the fact that they'd all been wearing the horcrux, and that he felt terrible almost immediately after leaving and tried to come back, but wasn't able to find the tent again.

  accusing harry of putting his name in the goblet of fire
#+end_quote

Yes, this was immature. So far, it's the only real immature thing you've attributed to him that makes sense to call him out on.

  Bullying Hermione (firebolt, SPEW, running around calling her mental.)
#+end_quote

Hermione gives as good as she gets. Or are we going to forget the numerous times she implies or explicitly says Ron's an idiot, or calls him a pig, or that time she sends a flock of birds to attack him all because he /dating a different girl/? Hermione is just as shitty to Ron as he is to her, and anyone who thinks she isn't is either legally blind or too deep into fanon Hermione-wank (which, let's be honest, is mostly just Emma-wank transplanted onto Hermione) to see it.

  Eating habits
#+end_quote

What? Can't a man eat what he wants, when he wants, how he wants? Who are you to dictate what someone else can and can't eat, and how they eat it?

#+begin_quote
  Hygiene
#+end_quote

The only hygiene problems I remember are his eating habits. Sure, he snores, but that's not something you can control. Besides, eating the way Ron does is kind of uncouth, but hardly unhygienic. He's asking for second and third helpings, not refusing to wipe after he shits.

#+begin_quote
  Jealousy
#+end_quote

Yes, but that is quite clearly meant to be his biggest character flaw, in the way of Harry's temper and Hermione's lack of social grace. Ultimately, he is the lastborn son in a family of talented boys and feels like he's the least talented of them. Furthermore, he's often ignored in favour of Ginny, because she's the only girl of the family, leaving Ron with severe middle-child syndrome. I mean, if you felt ignored even in your own family, wouldn't you feel just the tiniest bit jealousy to your ultra-famous friend who is a natural with certain types of magic, a once in a lifetime talent at quidditch, and who has (for the most part) the adulation of everyone else you know?

So, yes, Ron is jealous of Harry and he was out of line during the Goblet of Fire incident. But they're hardly unforgivable, and neither of the two justify the widespread hate Ron receives throughout the fandom.
