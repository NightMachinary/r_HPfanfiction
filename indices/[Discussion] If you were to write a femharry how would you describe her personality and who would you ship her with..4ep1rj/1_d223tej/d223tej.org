  I know my impression of Ron is heavily colored by fannon but still

No, your impression of Ron is /wholly/ dependent on bad fanfiction tropes.

It's not like Ron risked his life going to the MoM with Harry to save Sirius, when everyone but Harry knew it was likely a trap. He also didn't stand (on a broken leg mind you) between Harry and Sirius Black when everyone but Sirius, Remus, and Peter thought Sirius wanted to kill Harry. Ron /totally/ didn't risk expulsion by participating and helping run the DA in 5th year. There was also something about risking his life by going out to hunt down horcruxes or something during what should have been his final year at Hogwarts. I think that might have been a minor plot point in the last book or something.

All that said, yes Ron had his issues. Sure he was insecure and it reared up from time to time, but he was an otherwise good friend to Harry and doesn't deserve this stupid "Hur, Ron is bad" bullshit that happens far far to often in fanfiction.

Edit: Don't forget going with Harry to save the stone in first year and to save his sister in second year. Ron is such an asshole for that.
