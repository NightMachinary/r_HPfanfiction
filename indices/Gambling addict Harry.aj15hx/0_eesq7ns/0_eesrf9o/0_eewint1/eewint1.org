Gambling really depends on the game and the usual game of choice is ' Poker'. When playing poker it less The Cards and Far more playing the Players. I can TOTALLY see Harry becoming addicted to reading people and the power that comes with that, less Legilimency and more 'He's a pusher, he pushes himself at work he bets big and wins, he doesn't seem to save much so he doesn't think long term. He is cold hearted and doesn't do things based around hope even when he bets big. He has the pair... But which pair'
