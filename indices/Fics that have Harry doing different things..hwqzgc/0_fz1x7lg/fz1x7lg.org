Crafting Magic - linkffn(13256217) - Harry is into pottery and that is his focus. It's a good story about bringing art to Hogwarts.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Summer - linkffn(5915140) - Harry Potter learns about curse breaking and follows that adventure for his summer.

Make a Wish - linkffn(2318355) - Harry just does Harry things while trying to enjoy his vacation.

Serpentine - linkffn(12459242) - Pretty much Harry learning to become a magizoologist.

And yeah, I think those are the best stories I know that have Harry just doing what he wants.
