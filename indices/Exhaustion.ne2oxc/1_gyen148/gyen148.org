it can be hard, bruh. Writing is hard af.

I always tell myself it's supposed to be fun and healing, so when it's making me cry or whatever, I know it's time for a break, or try something else for a little while. The creative process has its ups and downs, there will be times you hate your work and question why you thought it was worth doing it in every project, often several times.

For me it helps to go through my initial notes, and remember why I thought it was a good idea and wanted to put it into the world, and then I'll read some positive responses from my most enthusiastic readers who also thought my ideas were solid and liked that I made it, and it helps, but even then I still need a bit of breathing space to just let it be, and I'll come back to it when I actually /want/ to be doing the work
