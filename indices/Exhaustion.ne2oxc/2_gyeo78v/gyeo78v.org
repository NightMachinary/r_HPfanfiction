It can be hard. I decided on how I wanted to begin this latest chapter of my fic. I sat down, stared at the empty page, and just closed the program and played some Baldur's Gate.

I finally got it going some weeks after, when I had some time. I wrote alot, but now I'm at a point where I'm going to writing Voldemort quite a bit and I find it hard to keep going...

Hang in there!
