If you write to be appreciated, then I would strongly recommend reevaluating your plans: there are 629,000 HP fanfiction stories on FFnet alone (another hundreds of thousand on AO3 and elsewhere). Being discovered and appreciated is just matter of sheer luck and relying on that is a way to madness. If you want to be appreciated do something else, almost anything else is more secure way to it.
