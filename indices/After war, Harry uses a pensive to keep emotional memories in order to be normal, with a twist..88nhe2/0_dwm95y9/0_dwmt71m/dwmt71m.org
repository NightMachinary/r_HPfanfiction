Fixed* meant to say has to take the memories out and for possible use in a pensive.

I'm thinking, in some twisted logic, any new people in his life that make him have feelings of care, he takes out the memories that make him have strong emotions so he doesn't form new bonds for his enemies to exploit. I read a story where Harry's drinks to forget and feel numb. I was thinking of replacing drinking with taking out memories to file away.

Thanks for the one-shot idea!
