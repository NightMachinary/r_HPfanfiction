It's an interesting idea, though I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "take the memories out". Does this mean he literally removes any tramautic memories? If so, I don't think it'd make him emotionally unavailable, he'd just have strange gaps in his memory.

Though you could write an interesting one-shot with it starting with him missing those memories, going looking for them, finding out he removed them himself and left a note telling himself not to look at them. He, of course, looks at them, and spirals into a deep depression. End it with him removing the memories again and writing another note, all while knowing that it's cyclical and he'll just end up investigating the missing memories again later, and you've got a compelling, if sad, story.
