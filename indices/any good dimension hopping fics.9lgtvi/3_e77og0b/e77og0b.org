The series of stories starting with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil][To Play the Devil]], followed by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11842318/1/Traveller][Traveller]] and then by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12717563/1/The-Lord-in-the-Mist][The Lord in the Mist]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4263138/The-Wayland-Smith][The Wayland Smith]] becomes a dimension hopping series. The main characters are Harry and Voldemort (and Dumbledore in the third one). It might not quite be your thing. I don't think many people would say it's following the same cliches. The problem might be that it's a little too original (particularly in the second story).

The first one doesn't really hop dimensions, though it sets up the possibility. The primary conceit of the second one is that Voldemort and Harry find themselves in another dimension. The third one seems to be a follow up story of Voldemort returning to a dimension like his original one in the year 1996, he seems to have a plan in mind and at least nominally be on the good side against himself.
