May I present [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11341620/1/Harry-Potter-The-Boy-Who-Is-Missing][Harry Potter: The Boy Who Is Missing]]?

Harry ran away from the Dursleys and due to the odd interaction between electricity and magic, he accidentally removed every single tracking spell on himself by hiding near a 3-phase power transformer*.

Cut to the third year when an Owl finally finds Harry with a Hogwarts Letter and he decides that maybe he should see if it's real and if so, is there anything in it for him.

^{\}Magic at high enough power disrupts electrical items, so the reverse is very plausible too.)
