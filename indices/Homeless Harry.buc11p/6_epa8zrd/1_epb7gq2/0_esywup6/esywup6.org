Where did you get that? I got them being far to tired to deal with that shit/not even knowing what they were talking about and then tired resignation when severus learned it was about sex. Like, they seemed pretty tired and upset and very not awww ing. Also it was Hermione who said that, not Harry, and she was 15 or maybe 16 where 16 is age of consent in the UK.

Also pretty sure Tom was in disguise as someone of undetermined youth.

Besides that, if it was Harry it wouldn't be pegging, Harry is pretty definitively male.

Like, mildly squicky but not half as squicky as you make it sound, nothing to do with slash at all, and you got all the facts off.

Even worse was that this was after the squicky underage stuff.

Edit: Oh, and iirc the conversation was whispered so the only one who would have heard was Snape who showed himself to very not be with it.

Edit 2: Yeah, double checked and everything. Hell, the extent of Harry's sex life at that point was watching tom and Hermione and all of a single birthday blowjob from Hermione in secret while they were in voldemorts house alone.

Like, dafuq you talking about? Literally nothing you said happened and the only "slash" at that point was a kiss between Harry in Tom
