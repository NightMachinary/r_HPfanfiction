1. I feel like Ron is really part of what made the books so good. If you consider that Harry ends up being able to save the world because of the power of love, I think it would have been impossible without Ron. He's kinda the greatest friend ever, with all his flaws. And, no matter what house (except maybe Slytherin), if they do meet on the train, Ron could still make an effort and stand by Harry. So, yes, make him a friend. And if you're having trouble with his character, just write him as a distant friend? Or at least not as the half assed enemy?

2. Personally, I see Remus/Tonk as an absolute mess that is not at all interesting/cute or anything good. I'd pair Remus with no one, because from what I remember of the book, he was interested in no one but himself and his self pity. The only interest in having him have a kid is that he won't take care of it and somehow it always fall on Harry to become this new, responsible guardian.

3. If they go off on better terms than « no, I won't acknowledge you in front of our whole year on the very first day », they can be on relatively good terms, no matter the house. Because, if nothing else, the Malfoys are good at politics etc. But the minute LV returns and they'd change their stance anyway. And if you want to make them really good friends, Draco would need a whole personality makeover. Slytherin or not, I don't see Harry being ok with people belittling and insulting his mother's blood (especially since she's basically the one who saved him from LV).

4. JKR herself failed at his redemption. I don't see the point. His ethics are all kind of awful. If you don't take into account the whole following LV of his own free will and taking pleasure in killing and torturing people based on their blood/birth, he's still an awful person who spends his time terrorising generations of students. He constantly escapes justice. He does nothing much which could redeem him. He's really an ugly person. Even to Harry, for whom he's supposedly enduring being a teacher and a spy/traitor. (Even as a Slytherin, i don't see him being much nicer to Harry. From the moment he saw him, he started glaring at him when Harry is just a kid.) So, really, good luck if you try to redeem him. You really should bother only if it'll really bring something to the story.

I don't know how much it'll help, but here is my super interesting opinion haha.
