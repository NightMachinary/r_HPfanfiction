I think Draco would need considerable rewriting even in his earliest scenes to have a good or even neutral relationship with Harry. Harry was comparing Draco to Dudley from the moment he opened his mouth in the robe shop and Draco didn't know his identity then. Although Harry would certainly just shrug Malfoy off in first year if Ron would stop provoking him.
