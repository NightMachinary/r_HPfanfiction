  Should I keep Ron as a good friend/person ( I don't wanna make him bad but confused how to moderate his character)
#+end_quote

Sure, if he has a character arc.

  Should I pair Remus with Tonks? Should I pair him with someone else? Or should I keep him alone? If not alone, is a kid from him compulsory?
#+end_quote

Personally, I say pair Remus with Sirius. But, if you do pair him with tonks (or another female) a kid is not compulsory. In fact, unless it's important to the story don't bother.

  If Harry is not a Gryffindor, should I keep him on ok terms with Malfoy? Should I keep Malfoy's interactions with Non-Gryffindor Harry polite?
#+end_quote

No, Harry had snubbed Malfoy on the train well before they were sorted. Malfoy's beef with Harry was that snubbing, not house choice. If you want them on good terms you need to change their interaction on the train.

  Does Snape deserve a redemption arc or should I roast him alive?
#+end_quote

Yes, he was a nuanced character that was trapped in his own personal hell. If you spend any time on him it should be either a redemption arc or at least a nod to the fact that Dumbledore condones his behavior.

  How should I keep his rapport with Hagrid? Thanks in advance.
#+end_quote

Only if you can write Hagrid decently and need him to drop plot in Harry's lap. Even JKR wrote him out in later books.
