1) Do what you want, but I'd suggest keeping him as a minor friend

2) I think you should make different pairings for both Remus and Tonks. If you introduce an OC, make them a minor character.

3)Don't make Draco be tolerable until at least second year, unless you don't put Harry in Gryffindor or shun him on the train

4) Unless Harry doesn't shun Malfoy on the train, he should act the same in first year

5) Hagrid is tricky to write. Use the online Hagridizer for any of his dialogue.
