I think we need more information about your Harry to answer these question : is he the same character than canon, only a little smarter, or does these change make him a completely new character? Anyways, if we assume Harry stays the same:

1. Yes. A lot of people want to bash Ron "because he is a traitor", but honestly, Canon Ron is an amazing friend from Harry. It's easy to only remember his worst moments, but this is a character who sacrified himself in 1st year so Harry could continue. He broke several law to go to see Harry in Privet Drive because he thought they didn't let him answer his letters, he also followed him to an Acromantula nest while being deadly afraid of Spiders, and later in the Chamber of Secrets to confront a Basilisk. He stood between Harry and Sirius Black on a broken leg, and told the man he thought was Voldemort right hand man that he would have to kill him to touch Harry.\\
   I would also like to point that, in most Indi! Harry fic who bash Ron are "lucky" to begin in 4th year, because their is no way their Harry would have stayed friend with PoA Hermione if he was to judge her the same way he does with Ron.\\
2. I will stay neutral on that point. I will just point that, if you plan to pair Remus with anyone else, their is only 2 kind of character who could work with him. Either a "strong" character who almost force him in the relation (a bit like Tonk did), or a character, preferably a werewolf, who is just as depressive as him, so they can get together while wailing in self pity.
3. If your Harry is similar to the canon one : no. Harry dislike Malfoy because he is basically a magical Dudley : a spoiled kid who bully others. And Draco dislike Harry because he is a spoiled kid who could never get over the fact that Harry refused to shake his hand. I doubt Harry being in another House, with another friends, would stop Malfoy to insult them. The only exception may be in Slytherin, because while being in the same House would give Malfoy more opportunities to be an ass, it would also give Harry the chance to befriend "equals" to Malfoy, like Zabine or Nott, who could not be insulted the same way than mudbloods or blood traitors.
4. I alway considered Snape as a bad man who did the right thing. Are his sacrifices enough to redamn him? Depend of the author so do what you want. Though, if you want to roast him, just don't forget that he made sacrifices, even if they are not enough.
5. Depend of you Harry (I feel like I said at every answer). Harry is very fond of Hagrid because he is his first friend. If your your different Harry managed to get friends in the Muggle world, or if Hagrid is not the one to take him to Diagon Alley, Harry has no reason to become friend with him. This also apply to other characters like Ron and Hermione.\\
   Ron became his best friend because they were together on the train, and later were sorted in the same House. If they do not meet in the Hogwart's Express, they would not have become friend (or at least differently). And if Harry is not in Gryffindor, then they would have spent a lot less time together, making their relation different.\\
   In Hermione case, she became friend with them because they saved her from the troll. And she was in a situation to be saved because she overheard a conversation between Harry and Ron. If Harry is not Ron's best friend, would he have had this conversation with someone else /this/ exact day? And if Harry is not Gryffindor, would he even know Hermione was not at the feast that night? Or where she was? And would he even care? The troll scene is one of the most overused one because people want to have Hermione as Harry best friend and can't think in another way to make them friend.
