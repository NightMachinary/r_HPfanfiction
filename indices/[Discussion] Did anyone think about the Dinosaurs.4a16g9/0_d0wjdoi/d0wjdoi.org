With magic available, and a smart muggleborn around - i.e. Hermione - they should be able to easily overcome any beasts, magical or not, by using both magic and muggle knowledge. Unless you give those beasts sapience animals simply are no match for humans with decent tools - and a wand more than qualifies for that.
