It depends on the challenge you want. If big dinosaurs are around, then there's enough food for them, so one of the bigger challenges is already easier.

If direct damage spells do not work, transfiguration should work better. Poisonous bait, traps, conjured or transfigured expendable animals, lots of things work against stuff resistant to Cutting Curses. If you've got Hermione around, Science and Magic working together should solve a number of problems.

"Island of Fire" has a bunch of students strand on a mostly bare rock in the middle of the Atlantic. No dinosaurs, but the setting has dragons. [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/205025]]
