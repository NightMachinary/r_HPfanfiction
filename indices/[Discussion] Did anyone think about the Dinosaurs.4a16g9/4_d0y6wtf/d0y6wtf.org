First off, thank you for reading. And believe you me, I cut the base building out for good reason.

There are a few Jurrasic Park crossovers. I can't remember ever reading something that crosses HP with, say, 10.000BC.

The core problem with this is that the moment you stop being preachy about the Avada Kedavra a normal wizard roflstomps anything thats alive with ease. Its just that strong a spell. One hit, one death.

The only thing that could possibly be a danger to an adult wizard, and even then just in numbers and with sufficient tactical thinking, would be something immune to the Avada Kedavra. Depending on what kind of rule you introduce for that, you'd create animals that have a natural immunity against... death(?), having their soul destroyed, ripped from them,... .

As cool as the HP magic is, its just hopelessly overpowered.
