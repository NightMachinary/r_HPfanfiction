There are already plenty of magical dinosaurs in Harry Potter though, and a basilisk is not one of them, such as the phoenix, jobberknoll, fwooper, augery and diricawl. I'm not sure if the hippogriffs or griffins should be included, as these creatures are only half dinosaurs.

Now a basilisk is a bit confusing. For one thing it's clearly a snake but a basilisk hatches from a chicken egg, which makes it a dinosaur but it's a toad that has to brood on the chicken egg in order for the basilisk to hatch. Toads are amphibian... there is a voice in my head currently shouting: "IT'S MAGIC YOU IDIOT".

I don't think some magical creatures such as basilisks or manticores are "natural" but simply created by wizards and trying to apply evolution to these creatures is just too damn confusing. So I believe there never was a proto-Basilisk. What I'm also trying to say here is, is not to make the oh-so common mistake of thinking that snakes (or other lizards) are closely related to or are basically dinosaurs, they're not.
