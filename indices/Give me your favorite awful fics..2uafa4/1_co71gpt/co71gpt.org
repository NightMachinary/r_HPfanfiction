My go-to for fics like this is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/Knowledge-is-Power][Knowledge is Power]]

It's full of cliches, many of them are facepalmingly stupid, there are entire passages that are borderline unreadable, there's an uncomfortable vibe to the jokes about women, and it's abandoned.

That being said, it's entertaining as hell. This is a classic case of the difference between "entertaining" and "good." The best fics are both, but that doesn't mean that fics that have just one of those characteristics can't exist.
