You might want to look into stories where Diarymort (or some other splinter of Voldemort) regains a full body, as for /them/, the result is very much like a classical Lich Soul Jar --- their whole soul resides in the object, and they have the opportunity of retreating back into it if their body is damaged.

In that category, I know no finer story than linkffn(The Imposter Complex), but there are a lot of good-to-great stories with similar premises.
