Thanks! He's such a fun character to write, and it's especially fun to push the story through his filter before the reader has access to it.

I've been working on this story a lot recently, although I haven't updated for a little while. The plot is so huge, I have to make sure all the parts fit together before I post. I think Tom's ambition is rubbing off on me.
