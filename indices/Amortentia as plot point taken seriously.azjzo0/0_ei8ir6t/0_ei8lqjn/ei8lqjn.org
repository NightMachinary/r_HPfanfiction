One thing I love about this fic is how Tom's 'unreliable narrator' perspective affects the depiction of Merope or other characters. It's hard to tell how much Tom's experiences might have scarred him, because whenever he talks about his deceased "wife" he stoically tells people what he thinks they want to hear. It's alarming how good he is at lying to himself, but often endearing as well.
