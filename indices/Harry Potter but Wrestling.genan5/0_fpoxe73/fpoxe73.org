[Not a wrestling fan, but here goes.]

The strongest wrestler of recent history was widely agreed to be He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, the leader of the Death Eaters. They were a group of Heels that lead to the early retirement of many up and coming wrestlers.

Bell the Strange, for instance, was known for her particularly cruel and painful grapples, she defeated the Long Bottom duo so badly, they would never wrestle again.

He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was an assassin in the ring, he had the capability to take down the most resilient of opponents in one fell swoop with an advanced technique dubbed the "Avada Kedavra." Every match he played was not only a fight for victory but a fight for the right to remain a wrestler. He never lost. All his opponents either forfeited the match or were forced into retirement.

The only fight he ever lost was his fourth fight with the Potter Duo; Prongs, and The Lily. This match was never recorded, so experts can only guess what happened. It was unanimously agreed that Prongs was the first to fall, but what happened between The Lily and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is a complete mystery. The result was that Lily was forced to retire, that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named fled the ring never to be seen again, and that in the end stood a young boy, with a lightning bolt cut on his forehead.

Brian "The Door Breaker" Percival, an old wrestling prodigy famous for his victory over the Heel, "Grindlewald," theorises that somehow, that the boy survived He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's "Avada Kedavra." This lead to the young man to be dubbed "The Boy-Who-Lived."

It has been ten years since that day. The Death Eaters have disbanded and "The-Boy-Who-Lived" has finally reappeared in the ring, having grown up to the age to legally be a part of official matches. But whispers on the horizon hint at He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named returning as well.

The Boy-Who-Lived's triumphant return to the ring will begin next Saturday, 10:00 AM, where he will face his first opponent, apprentice of King Malfoy, the Dragon of Malfoy! Only on HWE (Hogwarts Wrestling Entertainment)!
