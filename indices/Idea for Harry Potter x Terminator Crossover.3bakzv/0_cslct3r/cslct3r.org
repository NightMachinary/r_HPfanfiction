Here are some other terminator prompts by category:

Serious/Dark: Apocalypse then

A wizard's attempt at embedding a soul into a machine goes horribly right. With a warning from the future, three weary and disillusioned souls struggle to stop the destructon to come and find themselves facing the one question they never asked: is it worth it?

Humor/crack: Time travel for tin cans

Good guy!Skynet AU, by the way. Magic and technology do not mix well-right up until they do. Question is, what is the student body supposed to do when a T-888 becomes the newest defence against the Dark Arts professor anyway, especially when his stated mission is to protect Harry Potter? And why would a killing machine from a future where they drove the human race to near extinction want to do so anyway?

Adventure:

On October 31st 1976, a naked man lands in a filthy alleyway in downtown London. He has twenty four hours to find his target-and kill her to stop humanity's greatest traitor from ever existing. He is from a desperate future, hunted by enemies greater than any other. And those enemies are already waiting for him. But what else is Harry Potter supposed to do?

Romance:

When Harry, Immortal Master of Death and part-time/casual Slayer of Dark Lords meets Cameron, Terminator Infiltrator Unit and dedicated Guardian of the Future Leader of Mankind, nobody in the Connor household expected sparks to fly quite like that. (Crack Omake: then again, nobody expected Cameron to fall pregnant either)

Horror:

A testament of twisted metal

When Tom Riddle found himself in the jungles of Indochina, little did he know just how it would affect who he eventually became. When Harry stumbled across Tom Riddle's will and a vial of Voldemort's memories, little did he know what he would discover. (Basically, the Terminators start killing off potential resistance fighters and/or their parents in the late '40's, leading to Voldemort becoming obsessed with them. Hunted by a relentless enemy in an alien jungle landscape, we get to see as the last vestiges of Tom Riddle finally die)

Mystery:

When Kingsley Shacklebolt is assassinated by what looks like a metal golem, the Auror corps sends their two best and brightest after the Dark Wizard responsible. Things, though, are not what they seem.
