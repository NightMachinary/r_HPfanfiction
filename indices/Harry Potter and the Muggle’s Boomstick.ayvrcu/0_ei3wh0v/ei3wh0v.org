"So that's what Dumbledore sends to his greatest supporter, a songbird and an old hat"

The voice was cruel and mocking, but Harry was desperately running to the Sorting Hat. Something was inside of it, and Voldemort hadn't noticed.

"Do you really think that some artifact will help you? That you can defeat ME with a hat?" Riddle snarled and addressed the King of Serpents. "Kill the fool!"

Meanwhile, Harry had pulled a tube out of Gryffindor's relict and it took him a precious second to recognise the object. It didn't look exactly like in the few movies he had seen, but it was close enough that the Gryffindor figured out that he was holding some kind of RPG.

"A piece of pipe? Is Dumbledore trying to mock you?"

The device was heavy, but in his desperation Harry managed to lift the twenty five pounds with a bit of accidental magic. The Basilisk lunged and Harry pulled the trigger whilst "aiming" at the dozens of foot-long fangs in the open jaw. Untrained as he was, the Vampir went high and hit the scaled snout instead. Perhaps with a lesser weapon, this would have mattered, but the last Soviet RPG was capable of punching through thirty inches of steel, five feet of bunker concrete and nearly four metres of dirt. The precursor pierced the Monster's skull before the main warhead detonated and drove a jet of molten metal through the soft tissue along its spine.

Without a sound the sixty feet long beast collapsed and shook the Chamber, although Harry couldn't be sure if it had truly been quiet or if the rocket propellant had just deafened him. The blast had thrown him down onto the ground and he found himself next to the Sorting Head once more.

From his new position he could see that the Basilisk had ploughed a ditch into the stone floor, his fangs spread along its path. One of them was nearly on top of Riddle's diary, which began to smoke as a clear liquid dropped onto its pages.
