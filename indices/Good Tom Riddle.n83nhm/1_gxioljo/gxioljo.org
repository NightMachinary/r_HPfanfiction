There's an anthology of stories called "There's nothing to fear" that has a Voldemort who is still, well, Voldemort but his goals are more noble. He is a former Gryffindor and he fights for the rights of Muggleborns, Squibs, Hags, Goblins and the outcasts of the magical world instead of Pureblood supremacy.
