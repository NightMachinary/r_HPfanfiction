When I saw the title I did wonder about a story with Harry as the chosen one suddenly being given a long list of Wizard and real problems to solve. Humans are destroying the planet what is the plan sort of thing. When Harry looks at them they all go well Voldermort had a plan, we might not have agreed with it however it would have worked.

I wonder if you could write a Wicked for Tom?
