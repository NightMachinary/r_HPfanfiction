And of course Rowling has things like this anyway:

“Like what kind of weapon?” said Harry. “Something worse than the Avada Kedavra --- ?”

"“But there can't be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra curse, can there?” said Ron."

"As far as I am aware, they do not know to this day how the Riddles died, for the Avada Kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage."

"“--- more Death Eaters arrived --- and then Snape --- and Snape did it. The Avada Kedavra.” Harry couldn't go on."

But ignoring spells that require so much intent, the point stands.
