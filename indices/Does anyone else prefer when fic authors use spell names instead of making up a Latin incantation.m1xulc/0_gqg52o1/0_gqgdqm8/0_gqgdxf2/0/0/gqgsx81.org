In my opinion...

While saying the incantation they would have to be trying to cast it, otherwise the teachers would be constantly casting the spells while teaching the students. I believe even in the first book they had the classes repeating the incantation before learning the wand movements, then putting it together and trying to cast it.

If you just had to say the words then you would have a class full of spells going off just teaching the incantation. So to me it makes sense they have to be channeling their magic, whether aware of it or not, and intend to cast the spell for it to work.

I believe a lot of fanfics say it's all about your intent and the spells themselves aren't good or evil. And I can see this applying to casting it as well. Especially when you get into wandless or silent casting. Cause that shows you don't need the wand movement or incantation but just want to cast it. It also helps explain accidental magic like Harry growing back his hair after Petunia cut it since there is no incantation or wand movement involved.
