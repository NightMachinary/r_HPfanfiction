Agreed. I have no problem with people speaking the incantations. However, I generally use the spell names in the narration, and I'm always careful to have characters speak the names of dark curses when they're not actually casting them.

(I've always thought it was weird that Hermione said the incantation and not the name of the Killing Curse in Book 4 when Fake!Moody asked her.)
