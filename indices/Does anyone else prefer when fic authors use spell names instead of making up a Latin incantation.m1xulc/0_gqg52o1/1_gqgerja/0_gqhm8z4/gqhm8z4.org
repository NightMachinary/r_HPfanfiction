When authors twist lore to make wands less necessary, they basically do it by making magic purely intent. That also makes the words unnecessary. Which is also canon for everyone at NEWT level anyway. If magic is purely intent based, it doesn't matter whether they refer to a spell by its name (e.g. Stunner or Stunning Spell) or its incantation (e.g. Stupefy) because neither will do anything without the intent and either will work with the intent. You could say or think "Banana" and if the intent is to stun, that's what it'll do.
