This. I've always wondered why authors write the incantation when referring in prose to a spell. Take a Stunner for instance. Though probably unlikely, is there not a chance, especially if an author is twisting the lore to make wands less necessary than canon, that saying "Stupefy" to refer to a Stunner could cause the person to cast it? That feels like a hazard, the likes of which would need to be addressed early in magical education the way, for example, firearms instruction says to keep the trigger finger off the trigger until ready to fire.
