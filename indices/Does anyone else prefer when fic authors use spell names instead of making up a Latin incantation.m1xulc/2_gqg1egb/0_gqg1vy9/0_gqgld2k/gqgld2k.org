I mostly agree, though I think the first time the Killing Curse is mentioned during Crouch!Moody's class on Unforgivables, the student refers to it as "the /Avada Kedavra/". That is, to my knowledge, the /only/ time a spell is referred to by incantation rather than name, unless it doesn't have a colloquial name at all (like /Sectumsempra/).
