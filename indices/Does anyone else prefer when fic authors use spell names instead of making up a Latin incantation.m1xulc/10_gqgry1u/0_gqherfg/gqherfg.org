My impression has always been that high level complex spells can have proper Latin incantations (e.g. the Patronus), although not all of them do, while the everyday spells typically have whatever incantations, with Latin-ish, English, or nonsense roots. Doesn't Tonks just say "Pack!" to pack a suitcase?
