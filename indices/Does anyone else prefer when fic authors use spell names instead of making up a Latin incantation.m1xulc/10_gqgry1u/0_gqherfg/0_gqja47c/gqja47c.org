One issue that is ignored is /why/ the spells are in Latin, namely that to English speakers, Latin is an exotic language associated with 'hidden knowledge'.

But the ancient Romans themselves rarely used their native Latin in their own spells. Too commonplace. They often preferred using Coptic or Armenian in their spells, two exotic (to them) languages linked to the ancient hidden magics of the Pharaonic and Zoroastrian priests (e.g. the cults of Isis and Mithra). Human nature doesn't change.
