Yes. For one thing, half the Latin in these stories is just run through Google translate. Like your example, "lavit dentes"? It translates to "he washed the teeth," when presumably you'd want an imperative, 1st person active, or 3rd person passive subjunctive. And that's just 2 words; the ones where someone does a ritual with full Latin sentences just turn into a mess of bad Latin.

For another thing, I don't think spells are hyper specific in the HP universe. So you wouldn't really have a spell just for brushing teeth. Maybe you have a general body-cleaning spell instead; something like "lavetur." Then you aim at what you want washed and it does it. It's not like you need to say "Wingardium leviosa chair" to make the chair float, after all.

Third, JKR didn't use straight Latin for most of her spells. A lot of them are bastardized Latin or something else. So why should fan-made spells all be clean Latin? Yes, I realize this contradicts with my first point, but it's 2 different things. The issue there is that people trying to use proper Latin don't; I'm saying don't even try to use real Latin. So let's go back to our Tooth Brushing Charm, which is now a generic Body Cleaning Charm. "Lavetur" is the 3rd person passive subjunctive of "lavo," translating out as "Let/may it be cleaned." Let's bastardized that into Laveto," which is a nonsense word that souds vaguely Latin-ish and shares a root with "lavo."

Finally, as you say in the original post, it's really best to use the name of the spell. We might talk about Voldy AK'ing something on reddit, but that's not how literally anyone in the series talks. They won't say "Bellatrix crucio'd Neville's parents until they went crazy." They say " Neville's parents were under the Cruciatus," "Bellatrix used the Cruciatus," etc. It just sounds weird and unnatural the other way.
