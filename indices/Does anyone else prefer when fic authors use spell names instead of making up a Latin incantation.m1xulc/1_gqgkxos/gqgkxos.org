For me it depends on context: Expelliarmus vs. disarming charm is pretty obvious for every reader, but if the author makes a habit of intoducing new spells I probably won't remember every incantation. And in this case 'lavit dentes' would tell me exactly nothing.

My favourite way of saying it would be "Harry cleaned his teeth with a quick spell", since it gives me all the information I need.
