I prefer seeing both, depending on the situation?

If you see Harry using the Disarming Charm, having him say, "Expelliarmus!" makes sense, if it fits the narrative to show him speaking. I also like seeing bullshit latin for spells, if they're interesting ones. (It's not like Rowling's 'Latin' makes a lick of sense most of the time.)

If, as mentioned, it's a casual charm, eh. "Harry cast a hygiene charm to clean his teeth." works for me.
