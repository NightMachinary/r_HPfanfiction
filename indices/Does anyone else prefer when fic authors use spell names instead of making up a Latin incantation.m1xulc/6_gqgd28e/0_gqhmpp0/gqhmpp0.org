If someone's actually CASTING the spell, I don't think anyone will complain if they see its incantation. It's when people TALK ABOUT the spells that it's stupid to refer to them by incantation.

"Then I used the Disarming Charm on him" makes a lot more sense for conversation than "Then I used Expelliarmus on him."
