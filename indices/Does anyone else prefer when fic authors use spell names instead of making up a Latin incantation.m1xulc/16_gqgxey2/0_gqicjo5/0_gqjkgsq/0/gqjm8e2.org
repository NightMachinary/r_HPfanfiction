Yeah no ur right for sure, its just can be a bit frustrating if u understand latin, it really doesnt change the story at all, or my opinion on it. Its just a tiny detail that sometimes is brough a bit too far: i ve read a story where the author just used latin for every spell, its was a bit overwelming.
