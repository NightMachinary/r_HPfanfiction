Put in time: its probably all just Google Translate, which for latin does NOT work. Its not like they searched up the word in a dictonary, then took the time to decline the word/conjugate the verb to the right case/tense. Its fun sometimes but really i doubt there would be anything specific like a teeth cleaning charm, just a refreshing charm/cleaning charm or anything like that.
