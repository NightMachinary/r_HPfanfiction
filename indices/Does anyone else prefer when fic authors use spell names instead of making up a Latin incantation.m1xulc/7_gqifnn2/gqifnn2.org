I usually structure it like this:

- Academic texts or dialogue = more detailed or clinical name, i.e.

#+begin_quote
  "The Torture Curse"

  "A Modified Cutting Charm".
#+end_quote

- Descriptive dialogue by inexperienced wizards = "a" + Incantation.

#+begin_quote
  "He used a crucio on her"

  "She cast a sectumsempra in retaliation".
#+end_quote

- Descriptive dialogue by experienced wizards = colloquial name if one exists, incantation or descriptive name if one doesn't.

#+begin_quote
  "He's showing signs of exposure to the Cruciatus"

  "They were all using Snape's modifed cutting curse, Sectumsempra."
#+end_quote

- Active dialogue by anyone = either a pause with narrator description or the incantation in cursive.

#+begin_quote
  /"And now... I will have my revenge."/ he hissed, and the tell-tale red of the Cruciatus curse left his wand, striking the enemy.

  "You'll pay for that!" he shouted. "Let's see you counter this one! /Sectumsempra!"/
#+end_quote

- Narration depends on the speaker, but I never choose the inexperienced wizards option. It sounds too unprofessional for narration.
