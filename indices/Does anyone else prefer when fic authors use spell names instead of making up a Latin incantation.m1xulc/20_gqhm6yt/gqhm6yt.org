For the flow of the story I prefer descriptive text versus spell names as well. That is mostly only though only a few ff writers have fun with spell names.

The majority of the time it is just words thrown through an online translator, which is sad.

I enjoy learning new languages as a hobby and learned Latin in middle school. Rowlings spells are fun but clearly bullshit which means ff writers are free to go batshit crazy with spell words.

Before Rowlings a good deal of magic stories had any worded spell use being extremely exact. She came along and was all 'hmm a spell to make a feather float... wing, levitate...uh wing..ar..dium? Levi..o..sa? Cracking good idea that!'
