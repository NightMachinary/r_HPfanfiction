Not related to the Harry Potter fandom, but I remember this one fanfic that I was reading a little less than a decade ago where the author used gibberish for a spell in the Merlin fandom. When somebody told her to research the language that was used for the spells in the Merlin show, she threw a fit, called everyone in the fandom haters, and deleted her fics.

I mean, sometimes making up spells works if you understand the canon material to do so, but at other times it doesn't. I am sure that fanfic authors make up their own language for spells and enchantments in the Harry Potter fandom as well.
