Just to throw my 2 cents into this conversation, when it comes to magical combat, I prefer sensory-based descriptions of the spells. As in, instead of using the incantation Incendio, or saying that such-and-such cast the Fire-Making Spell, I would describe it as (for example) fire eruped from Draco's wand, scorching the ground where Harry had but moments ago stood.
