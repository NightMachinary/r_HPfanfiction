Depends on the situation. If they are *using* the spell during dialogue or someone takes them by surprise during prose i prefer incantation("stupefy! someone shouted behind harry" is better than "someone suddenly threw a stunner behind harry" in my opinion)

. If they are talking *about* the spell during dialogue or doing something common with it during prose i prefer spell name or maybe neither but just a description of the spell effect. For example "Susan levitated the debris out of the way" is better than "Susan casted a Levitation Charm at the debris".
