In one story I wrote ages back, I used Latin as the root of a spell, massively condensing the sentence to end up with a single pseudo-word. I then had the caster (Flitwick) explain that the spell could be done with just the full sentence but the wand-movements allowed for spell contraction.

The only time I've done Latin sentences was for full rituals, such as the ones in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27669059/chapters/67710647][this one-shot]] for time-travel, Fidelius and draining magic of non-Purebloods respectively.
