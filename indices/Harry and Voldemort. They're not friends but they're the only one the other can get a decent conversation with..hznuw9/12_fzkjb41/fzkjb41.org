This would work perfectly onscreen, it's the kind of thing that's made for, like, a Robot Chicken skit or it's pretty much exactly the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAkbCGNbvw8][How It Should Have Ended Super Cafe]] vibe.

It's harder to pull off when writing is your medium, or at least, the humor becomes much more subjective, because without going a lot more obviously cracky, people will wonder about the background of how this came about or nitpick your details by comparing them to canon.

When I see Harry teasing Voldemort or not being scared of him it's normally Master of Death!Harry who has lived quite a few more years than the summer after 5th year. He might be, like, reliving his same life, to get this kind of vibe. Something like linkao3(Nose to the Wind by Batsutousai).
