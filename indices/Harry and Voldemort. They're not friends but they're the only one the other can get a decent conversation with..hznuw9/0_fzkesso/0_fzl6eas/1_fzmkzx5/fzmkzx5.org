This is definitely a thing in at least one fic that I've spent the last few minutes trying to search for to no avail. Harry and Voldemort keep getting reborn, with the memories of their past lives unlocking when they see each other as everything from random acquaintances to father and son (in both directions) to fellow students at an all-girl's boarding school to, eventually, the OG universe again. By this time they've long since stopped hating each other and decide the moment is ripe to simply fuck with everyone instead.

It's on AO3, I'm pretty sure, but fuck if I can remember what it's called.
