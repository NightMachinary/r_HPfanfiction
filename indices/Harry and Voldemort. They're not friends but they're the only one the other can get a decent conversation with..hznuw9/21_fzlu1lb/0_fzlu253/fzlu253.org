#+begin_quote
  Nearly every evening since just before Harry turned fifteen, he has gone to sleep and woken up basked in the glow of Voldemort's hearth. Dumbledore had theorized it was another element of their bond growing stronger; an unintended side effect of Voldemort taking Harry's blood in the graveyard. Harry theorizes that the piece of Voldemort's soul in his forehead likes to make Harry's life as difficult as possible. orHarry and Voldemort have reached a stalemate, but continue to argue anyway.
