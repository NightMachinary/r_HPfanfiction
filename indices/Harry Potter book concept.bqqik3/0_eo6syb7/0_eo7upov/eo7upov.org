While the "childhood" is easy, I am more concerned for the latter years.

For example with Justin Finch-Fletchley, his family is rich, and he was supposed to go to Eton. While the parents can say he went to another school, what would happen, later, when none of the kids who went to posh school know about him? And how to justify all of his disapearance (going to magical world)?

I wonder if the celebrity kid don't end up having "accidents" to just disapear from muggle world.
