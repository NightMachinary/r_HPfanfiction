Oddly enough I never started reading fanfiction until I read Cursed Child. My literal thoughts after finishing the story was 'God that was terrible, I bet fanfiction is better than this.' It just kept getting worse and worse, I read it in one sitting and wanted to give up after the encounter with the trolly witch, and only finished it purely because I wanted to see how bad it could get.

Honestly I regret reading it.
