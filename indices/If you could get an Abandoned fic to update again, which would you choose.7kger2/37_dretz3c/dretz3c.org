Waaaaayyy back before book 6, there was a story called [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewuser.php?uid=1425][Ginny's Journey]] by Oddish. In which Ginny Weasley is not allowed to return to school after the events of book two. So she has to go to school In America.

I was fairly compelled by the world building in this one. In it there are 6 wizarding schools spread out through North America. And a North American quidditch league between them. There was also a lot of wand lore, and something about California being a magical dead zone, so magic folk born there never realize that they are magic. They're just a bit odd. Which explains a lot about culture in some parts of California.

The author had completed the story and posted it all on one (now defunct) archive, they were in the process of posting it on other archives when they just stopped. So I remember the ending, but I can't go back and re-read it for fun.

Still, what's there is a good read. Especially to compare with what canonically is out now about wizarding North America.
