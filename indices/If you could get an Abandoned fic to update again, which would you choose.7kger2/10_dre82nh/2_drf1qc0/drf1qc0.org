This is one of my favourites too, but I can't help but feel it's reached something of a dead end. I won't spoil it but as far as I can tell the thing you want to happen all story has now basically happened. All that can really happen now is that it keeps happening or stops happening.. Either way it's going to be less about magic and more about mundane stuff. Personally I think when that happens a story stops being a proper Harry Potter story. But it's a good read nonetheless.
