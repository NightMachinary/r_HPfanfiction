I'm very surprised nobody mentioned Ectomancer, so I'm gonna do it myself.

Also, probably not up there with the bests, but I'd really like to see Contemplating Clouds update again and be completed.

Finally, some people mentioned Nightmares of Future Pasts, and I'd love to see it updated but according to the author's blog, it's still in progress, even his progression bar increased maybe 2 or 3 months ago, so I won't consider it abandoned. However, I'd be absolutely delighted if his other Potter fic, Blackwand Chronicles updated.

And probably a ton of other ones I forget.
