There's a lot of insanely good fics that got abandoned but in my opinion the one that needs a revival the most by far is linkffn(The Hundred Acre Woods).

If you've never read it, it's incredibly well written, but easily the most horrible, disturbing, saddening and heart wrenching fic ever created. The reason why it needs a revival is because just as things were looking up in the story, and things seemed to be getting better for Harry the author abandoned it.
