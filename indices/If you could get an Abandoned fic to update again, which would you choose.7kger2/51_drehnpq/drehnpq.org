The answer will be for me the best Harry fanfic that I have read : Harry Potter with the knowledge and assets of someone who deserve victory over the dark lord even if that knowledge is not his. linkffn(4003405). I will love to find others with an independent Harry in what he do and smart in mind without that know it all mudblood Granger. And of course linkffn(4877577) : A DIFFERENT ROAD SERIES
