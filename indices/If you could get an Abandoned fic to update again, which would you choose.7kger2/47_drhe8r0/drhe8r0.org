Two spring to mind right away. Not as much as an unfinished fic, but an unfinished arc. JBern's 'lie I've lived' and Ruskbytes 'order of the Phoenix/ well of shadows'.

Hopefully, lie will get a sequel one day, but I'm assuming that JBern is focussing on his writing that actually earns him the money!
