Did you already read the trial chapters? IMO it gets slow after that, I quit some ways into the second one.

I've heard here that the author still updates weekly, though, I think if I could get all the way through it, it would be kinda nice to have a dependable little update every week, so I'm really curious about whether the second and third one get better also. I really respect the author for writing as much as they have.
