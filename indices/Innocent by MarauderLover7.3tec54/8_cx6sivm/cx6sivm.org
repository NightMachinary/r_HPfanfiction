The series as a whole is really good; it has two sequels already so far.

I think a lot of the first 'book', in respect of that, is setting up and worldbuilding. Stick with it, just so you know the characters. Or you could pop ahead into the first sequel and nip back to Innocent as needed if you need to work out who a character is.

I can't remember off the top of my head what the divisions are like, but Harry goes to Hogwarts and a lot of canon characters make an appearance at a later date. This series also has one of my fave depictions of Lupin and Sirius - non-slash, which is rare for me to give praise to, given Wolfstar is probably my OTP.
