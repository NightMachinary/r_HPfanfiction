I also stumbled ober this series about a week ago and continued to read all three parts (or as much of it as is released right now) in 3-4 days.

The character building is in my opinion one of the best I have seen in any fanfiction so far. The plot is slow, but that doesn't mean nothing is happening: interesting interactions, character building and foreshadowing are everywhere.

The foreshadowing in particular is excellent. Seemingly unimportant things are introduced and only used dozens of chapters later (sometimes even it even spans the sequels).

The end of innocent was also great in my opinion.

I can only recommend reading on, but at the same time I DO like slow stories, where the build-up might take forever, but I get a huge payoff in return.
