  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  The blood protection inside of Harry blocked His killing curse and burned His host body to ashes, yet failed to stop His soul from entering his body? Oh wait, it didn't! Harry's blood protection fights against Voldemort's soul and something new is created...a new soul and companion. Harry thinks it is unfair that she doesn't have a body of her own...well he is going to change that!
