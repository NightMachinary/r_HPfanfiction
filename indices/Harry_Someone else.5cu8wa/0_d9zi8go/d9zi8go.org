My favorite non-canon pairing is however Harry/Hermione/Ron:

AO3 has [[http://archiveofourown.org/collections/triofic/works][an archive]] of 96 Harry/Hermione/Ron fics. Unfortunately, they are either incomplete, one-shots, or just terrible fics.

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167), is probably the best Trio fic out there, but it never dived explicitly into romantic aspects of their relationships, merely stating [[/spoiler][they slept together.]]

*Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water*, linkffn(12076771), is still WIP. It's the first fic I found that specifically paired Harry/Hermione/Ron together, is of novel length, and has a decent plot. However, It's also a crossover with Kantai fleet girls and requires a certain level of interest in WW2 naval history from readers.

*What it Comes Down to*, linkffn(6858689), is well written, but contains too much torture, angst, and is down right grim-dark. I only made it through a third before giving up.

*Ruthless*, linkffn(10493620), is high quality and has a great plot. However, Theo Nott replaced Ron and the story is relatively short.

*Just The Three of Them*, linkffn(6807742), is a cute canon rehash with a romantic Trio. One-shot only.
