It's really two stories. The first is pretty standard "guilty pleasure" material up to the boss fight with Voldemort. Then it jumps the shark with the second story and turns weird.

#+begin_quote
  What is Harry's goal? To kill muggles and muggleborns or what?
#+end_quote

His goals vary through the the story. The first half are (largely) to survive Dumbledore's and Voldemort's machinations.

#+begin_quote
  Is Harry portrayed as the bad guy (or at least dubiously) or is the muggle genocide thing he does (I've heard) shown to be a good thing?
#+end_quote

He comes off as a self-righteous sociopath, particularly in the latter half of the story.

#+begin_quote
  Secondly, how severely is Hermione bashed here? Is she merely the one fighting against Harry's agenda or is her character also bashed in the kind of way that usually happens with Ron?
#+end_quote

The story has her drift toward the negative in the first half of the story. An event happens not long after the war with Voldemort that jumps the shark with her character.

#+begin_quote
  This fic does have a good number of reviews and stuff but it's fairly long so I was wondering if I should read it. Any general comments on the writing itself are, of course, welcome. For instance, in the prologue, I noticed that there was a lot of stereotypical smirking and sneering on Harry's part --- that struck me as fairly OOC. Anyway, Thanks!

As has been said, just read it. And be prepared to abandon it when it gets intolerable.
