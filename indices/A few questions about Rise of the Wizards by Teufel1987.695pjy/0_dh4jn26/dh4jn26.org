Explaining too much will ruin the story and [[/u/Kadmeia]] was right, just read it.

However, for the sake of answering your questions - Harry's actions lead towards an open magic world and as a result conflict with the binding oaths that each Minister swears to the president/prime minister etc.

Hermione is similar to canon in that she relies too much on authority and as a result gets manipulated, furthermore she believes in her own superiority. Near the end she insults 'Harry Potter' about being a fat and lazy dictator ruling over a dark-ages society through tyranny, when she defeats him she flaunts her skill (having received training from Dumbledore's painting).

Some of the story only makes sense in hindsight but it's worth it to read all of it to the end and not to make too many assumptions.
