Hey! I always appreciate another... cracker? Whatever, point is I've got you a handful and a half of recommendations! They're arranged by how much I like them, coupled with some unbiased critique... for some of them. Enjoy!

â€‹

linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon) 10/10. This is my favorite fanfiction of all time. Why? Read it, and you'll see for yourself.

linkffn(Larceny, Lechery, And Luna Lovegood by Rorschach's Blot) 10/10. This piece features a ton of references which may be difficult to comprehend. Hell, I probably only got half of them, and still managed to enjoy this almost as much as ABC! This fic features multiple perspectives, and times those shifts well.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor by cloneserpents) 9/10. Features /an actual plot/ so cracky you wouldn't believe it.

linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes) 8/10. I abandoned this fic about 30% through. Not because I didn't enjoy it, but because... I don't really know. My rating is based off of reviews, recommendations and the third of the fic I've read. Everyone holds this fic in such high standards because of its understandable, approachable humor. Everyone can laugh at it, and that's almost always good!

linkffn(The Python Defense by canoncansodoff) 8/10. I read this a while back (a year). This is basically Hogwarts-ified Monty Python. As great as it sounds, assuming you understand the references. Give it a read if you do, and if not, you should definitely consider checking out Monty Python if you're in any way interested in crack :)

linkffn(Where in the World is Harry Potter? by nonjon) Honestly, I can't remember what this fic is like, only that I've favorited it because I liked it. You can't go too wrong with nonjon.

linkffn(Harry Potter Becomes A Communist by HardcoreCommie) 6/10. Bad grammar, no plot, overly sexual, and lastly: the humor isn't for everyone. I only rated this fic so highly because of the side characters. They all follow Communist!Harry blindly for the dumbest of reasons and that's the real hilarity of this fic.
