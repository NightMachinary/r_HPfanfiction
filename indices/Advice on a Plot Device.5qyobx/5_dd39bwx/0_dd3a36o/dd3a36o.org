That's true enough. Part of the problem is that I want the circumstances to be concentrated (pardon the pun). I am sort of thinking of Dementors as black holes you see. Darkness and despair makes them grow larger, but the absence of it slowly drains away their power. Canonically, they were labeled as breeding during the books and we can extrapolate that to the misery under Voldemort and the terrorist like attacks allowing it. But the Dementors need to be maintained or else they shrivel away. The Black Plague is not visceral to us. Yes it was bad, but it happened a long time ago, its effects have all but disappeared, and when you mention it, it is thought of as a history book issue. Yes, the Black Plague would very likely have created Dementors, but Dementors from the Trail of Tears would be more likely alive than the Black Plague Dementors. I am trying to drive at a very particular concept here. The idea that people suffering leaves it's mark somehow. The Holocaust hits all the markers, because it was a genuine, industrialized and mechanized attempt to systematically destroy an ethnicity. People were worked to death, and executed, and thousands processed in one little place. Dementors are Despair, and Patronus are Hope, similar to how Boggarts are Fear and Ridiculous is Humor. Polar opposites. But in order to beat a Boggart, you have to make it funny. And that is why Azkaban is so much more serious than fanfics portray. Because to defend against a Dementor, you must be able to have hope in the face of the level of despair which spawned it. Azkaban is literally populated by the condensed despair and horrors of history. Holocaust is just the easy target in a way, given how well it fits and how many people know about it. If I said they were spawned from the Rwandan Genocide, then there would be readers scratching their heads, but the Holocaust gets my point across more effectively than anything I can think of. Thanks for the comment and the recommendations, I will be sure to check out the alternatives you suggested.
