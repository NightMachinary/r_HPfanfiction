#+begin_quote
  would it be at all appropriate to write it into a fic?
#+end_quote

Seems preachy and amateurish. Not thought out as much as it should be.

#+begin_quote
  but I couldn't think of many places like that specifically
#+end_quote

You're doing creative writing. You don't need a real place. You've been given a ton of leeway and agency in what you can do to explain away Dementers. You don't need to throw in the holocaust; and you shouldn't, because it sounds cheap like you're trying to mold the horrific to suit your story. Readers will see through it.

#+begin_quote
  I mean, sure it could be interchanged for less sensitive things like the Battle of the Somme,
#+end_quote

You need to approach the topic more naturally instead of forcing Dementer-sized perplexities into /muggle/ tragedies. You can do better. You need to go back to the drawing board.

  Dementers are born from rot and decay
#+end_quote

Okay, that's great. This doesn't mean shower-curtain mold. Because I can, I'm going to extend this description to include the decay of morals; the rot of hope. Shit like that. The catalyst is that something magical MUST happen to cause such an experience to develop into something /more/ than that.

We know it's Canon that Obscurials and Obscurus' exist; Obscurials are children who repress their magic, the magic turns inward and becomes parasitic like an untreated wound, eventually developing into an Obscurus.

Could this sort of thing be involved, or at least /paralelled/ with the creation of Dementers? You bet your ass it can.

Think for a moment about how old magical civilisation /is/. It's got to be multiple-thousand years at least. In that time there will have been Dementers, in that time there have been unimaginable tragedies that involved Wizards and Witches. How did old societies deal with Dementers? Did they have a use, were they once wild, eventually tamed? Maybe one day a Witch or Wizard had a spell get out of control, causing problems with magic itself, leading to the spawning of Dementers.

Or maybe not. Maybe Dementers are just this strange perplexity of unimaginable uselessness. However, like a horrifically terrifying black hole, it has it's uses. Maybe Dementers are like lightning - Magic itself letting lose a negative charge that it might remain neutral. Maybe Dementers have an opposite?

There's just a ton of digging you can do into this stuff when you wrestle with it a little bit.
