I'd have to ask why the Dementors would be sent to Azkaban in this instance. Dumbledore hates them, and I really don't see him letting anyone using them to torture prisoners right after he defeated Grindelwald and saved Magical Europe. And I don't see anyone willing to oppose him in this situation either. "Hey... that Monster was just beaten... let's duplicate his evil acts by staffing a prison with the Monsters his evil created!" doesn'0t Sound like a good idea.

So, if you want to tie Dementors to KZs, you'll need a very compelling explanation for Dumbledore letting the Dementors be sent to Azkaban. And you'll need an explanation for how Azkaban was run before that, and why they would want to switch.

(It's not entirely without precedent, though - Dachau was used after the war to lock up Nazis. But I doubt that would fit Dumbledore.)
