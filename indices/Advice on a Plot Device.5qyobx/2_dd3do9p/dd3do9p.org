The concentration camps would certainly fit the theme of overwhelming despair and suffering. What you always need to be careful with when dealing with these themes is to stay respectful to the victims and the subject in general. It sounds simple, but when you post something online and readers from various cultures (who all learned different history) read it, someone taking offense anyway is almost ensured to happen.

To the idea itself, I wouldn't limit yourself to the concentration camps. The trenches of the two World Wars, the Gulags, the genocide of the Armenians,... the 20th century alone isn't short of unspeakable tragedy, and I haven't even looked beyond Europe.
