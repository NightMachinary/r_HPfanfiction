That is an interesting point. I was envisioning the camps as having a separate section for magicals. The problem is that we don't know enough about Grindelwald. Was he bent on subjugation? Was he bent on extermination? The death camps were meant for killing off an entire ethnicity, and unless Grindelwald had intended wholesale genocide of literally every single wizard, I can't really see him using seperate camps with the small population of the Wizarding World. We know Nurmenguard was built as a prison for political prisoners, but that is the only mention of it. Still, I will continue thinking about your comment.
