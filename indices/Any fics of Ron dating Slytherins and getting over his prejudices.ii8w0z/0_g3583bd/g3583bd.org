Ron (more) biased against Slytherins is a fanon misconception. In the books, Harry dislikes them a lot more. As a side note, Ron's grandmother is Cedrella Black, very likely a Slytherin herself.

That being said, the Ron/Pansy romance in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542), is very well done. This Pansy still starts out as the canon bully, but gets lots of character development later on, [[/spoiler][especially so after Dumbledore personally assassinated Narcissa and Draco Malfoy]]. The Voldemort in this fic has his good look back and is utterly terrifying
