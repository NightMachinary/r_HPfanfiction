Very interesting short story about Ron and Daphne Greengrass going to the yule ball together, and the consequences of that date: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13122145/1/Bet-for-a-Dance]]

Also Ron/Daphne but also an incredibly long, regularly updated seer(ish)!Ron story. It even has its own discord. Imo it's starts slow but once you power through the first few chapters, it's fantastic: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13170637/1/Fate]]
