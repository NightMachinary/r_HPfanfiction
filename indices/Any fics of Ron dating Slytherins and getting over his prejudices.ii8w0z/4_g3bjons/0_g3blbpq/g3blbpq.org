I've heard of this one, but I also heard the main pairing is Draco/Hermione and I don't know if I can read 300 chapters of it lol I can enjoy it fine enough as a side pairing, but I don't think I've ever enjoyed a fic that actually focuses on it.

Thanks for the rec though! Maybe I'll bring myself to check it out.
