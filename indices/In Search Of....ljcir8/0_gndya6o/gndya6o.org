Currently in progress on AO3 “From the Viewpoint of a Wolf and a Star” by firstfloorgenerator.

Remus & Sirius POV throughout GoF and OOtP, and woven so closely around canon it's a real labour of love.

Can't help you with the DA perspective, but I like the idea (of a minor character crushing on Harry in a cardigan...)
