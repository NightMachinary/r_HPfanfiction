I read the first chapter. You have a lot of spelling errors in your story. I know finding a beta is harder than it sounds, but your story seems to be rather popular, which might increase your chances.

Also, the entire first chapter felt extremely rushed. You condensed a timeframe that takes up over a hundred pages in the books into a chapter of less than 1500 words.

Also, please distinguish between the name of a spell and its incantation. Don't write "He was his by a Crucio." but write "He was hit by a Cruciatus Curse."

I also found fourteen year old Harry cutting a man's throat quite out of character.
