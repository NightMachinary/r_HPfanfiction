I read about the soul bound with Fleur and then Gabrielle and I thought to myself "this is gonna be good".

First chapter, first paragraph:

#+begin_quote
  Made by the Love of the Dursleys but no more than their hate
#+end_quote

This does not make any sense whatsoever.

#+begin_quote
  he would not need to come back his personal hell
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  would be at his home Hogwarts
#+end_quote

lol this is so bad it's funny. Almost as good as My immortal. Did you change Harry's name to Harriet Ebony Dementia Black?

#+begin_quote
  For tomorrow though he would go see his best friends
#+end_quote

Are you not a native English speaker?

So first paragraph proved to pe quite funny, even though I don't think you intended for that to happen. But I can't read a whole chapter written like this, no matter how much mirth it brings. So I'm skipping ahead to...

Chapter 17! Starts with a smiley face. Aww, that's nice.

First paragraph. At a glance it looks like all the sentences start with Harry's name. Intriguing.

#+begin_quote
  Harry a woke to the sun

  Harry tried to turn over

  Harry immediately stopped moving

  To his dismay he heard a soft groan and slight movement
#+end_quote

I stand corrected, not every sentence begins with Harry's name. My bad. So this is the paragraph where Harry a wakes, turns over and then stops moving. It's riveting. The suspense is killing me now. What will Harry do next? Is Harry going to turn on his belly? Is Harry going to fall off the bed?

Let's go to the next paragraph and find out!

#+begin_quote
  Harry recalled

  Harry smiled

  Harry worried
#+end_quote

Oh, Harry's life is so interesting. Oh, please, next give us a description of how he ties his shoelaces!

Apparently he is in bed with some girls, btw. You could say he's tired after a long night wild monkey sex using much less words than you did.

#+begin_quote
  He remembered that they did nothing but sleep in the same bed. He did not want to go farther than that until he was older at least until he was two or three more years.
#+end_quote

That does not make sense, again. But what I assume you mean is he wants to wait two or three years before they bang. So you don't agree with people having sex until they are legally adults, I take it.

At that age he's not horny all the time? Is one of the girls dosing him with an impotence potion? Plus, wouldn't Fleur be around 21 by that time? Why is Harry such a selfish bastard, not considering her needs?

And I can imagine how this came to be: "guys, I know how to make an incest, threesome fic without the incest and the threesome!!!!" by making them happen in the future, off screen. For no particular reason. That is such a good idea. Such good plot and characterization. And it makes so much sense. It doesn't sound at all like a 12yo with sexual hangups is writing this.

Let's go to the next paragraph and see what else that rascal Harry is up to!

#+begin_quote
  To Harry's surprise he then heard a yawn
#+end_quote

I want to remind you that just a couple paragraphs ago this happened:

#+begin_quote
  To his dismay he heard a soft groan
#+end_quote

All these horrible noises dismay and surprise him. Poor Harry, going through this whirlwind of emotions over a groan and a yawn. His life must truly be a tragedy.

What can I say? Brilliant plot. Exquisite writing. I'll have to stop reading now through, because such good writing can only be enjoyed in small doses.

Extra:

#+begin_quote
  To Harry's credit he no longer turned red when Fleur or Gabrielle gave him small pecks but when they both did at the same time he still had a slight blush on his face or when he displayed such affection. He returned the gesture with a small bit of redness.
#+end_quote

The incest is definitely more enjoyable now that there's blushing involved.
