You're a nicer person than I am. I think some things are beyond hope. Plus. Maybe the repetitions and the grammar are beyond what he can correct right now, but his profile says he's from US so, keeping that in mind, are you telling me that a native speaker thinks stuff like what I quoted makes sense? If he cared at least a tiny bit about publishing a good story he would revise his own writing and correct the awkward turns of phrase and take out the endless, pointless description of every tiny little thing Harry does, and stop starting every sentence with Harry's name. But in the case he does care, what I did was provide examples. He could read what I wrote and go "oh, that really doesn't make sense there" and "that plot line really doesn't hold up" and "I should fix all this".

Edit: and you do know, as it stands right now, there's nothing good about this story. There's not one good thing to be said about it. The author doesn't give enough of a shit about his own creation to reread it once before he presses publish.

So I don't know what's rudder, publishing the drivel or offering an in depth analysis of a couple paragraphs that, if taken to heart, will help him improve his writing many times over? I don't know if you yourself are a writer, but when someone is editing your work that's how it generally goes, they take a few paragraphs and deconstruct those. Now, if all you see is mockery then what can I say? I don't have high hopes for OP either.
