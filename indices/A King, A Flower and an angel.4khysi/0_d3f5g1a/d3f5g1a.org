I hate to say it, but this comes across as a rather rushed and lazy offering. You didn't even stop to check if you'd spelled the protagonists' names correctly, did you? WEASLEY. WITH AN E. Also, 'Diggory' has two G's, who knew? You could have checked these in about five seconds, you know.

You apparently still have the working title 'Harry's Veela' at the top of each chapter, by the way, which is a little offputting.

Now, I honestly couldn't read this. My eyes just... skim over the page. There's little in the way of description, and the scenes are not properly set, so I almost had to make something up in my head as to where any of the characters were, or what they were doing. Otherwise they're just... blankly interacting a big, white, empty space, mentally speaking. The dialogue is quite bland, and falls prey to Talking Head Syndrome, especially in the early chapters. Harry is apparently completely unaffected by cutting a man's throat (a sight that is notoriously horrific, I might add), and while I appreciate that fight scenes are hard to write, the one in Chapter 1 was completely lacking in tension. Seriously, Harry couldn't bring himself to try to kill /Voldemort/, so why does RandomDeathEater#556 get special treatment? It's really OOC, unless he did it accidentally in the heat of the moment, in which case I would expect at least some psychological impact. Not that Rowling was ever any good at writing that herself, to be fair.

If you want my advice, the simplest thing you could do would be to /re-read and edit your work, dammit/. Seriously, there are so many spelling mistakes and just... sentences that make no sense, especially in the early chapters, that I don't blame people for thinking that English is a second language for you. You need to learn to [[http://emmadarwin.typepad.com/thisitchofwriting/showing-and-telling-the-basics.html][show]] more, rather than telling all the time, a problem that persists even into your latest chapter. Harry just telepathically knows how people around him are feeling, completely bypassing their expressions and body language, and I hate to say it but that's bad writing. Unless he literally is a telepath, in which case the way you've written it is just incredibly bland and lacking in description, I guess. Most jarring of all are the tense shifts, where you suddenly start using present tense in the middle of a sentence.

That should have been 'proceeded', for example, because the rest of your story is in the past tense. See, I looked at your later chapters, and I can see that you have the capacity to improve, but as a new reader, I'm never going to see those if I'm immediately repulsed by the unedited mess that is your first chapter. You need to go back and knock those into shape. In all honesty, I personally still wouldn't voluntarily read it (mostly into femslash these days, and H/F is often just het 'older girl' fetish with little substance), but your story would be a lot more pleasant on the eyes if you fixed up the early chapters to your current writing standard.

Writing a good story is difficult, and requires a lot of effort on your part. If you're not bothered by that, and just want to write for fun, then fair enough... just don't ask me to call it 'good writing'. Fanfiction.net is famous for its legions of 'yes men', who will tell absolutely anyone that their story is 'amzing' and 'best fing I ever red'. If you want to improve as a writer, /don't believe them/. They say that to /everyone/, because they're 13 and have no taste. The ego boost is nice, but never let it make you complacent. You can do /better/ than 'best thing a 13 year old ever read'. Good luck.
