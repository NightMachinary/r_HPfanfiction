It's not done in the language that is my native language, that I do know; it is sometimes abbreviated to the first letter and a dot, but that I believe to be different (because it's actually allowed on official documents when they have a lot of dates and are wordy) from ... this. I will take your word that it is fairly common in English, but I am not used to it and it does come across as laziness to me (two letters!) in the situations where there is no actual need to do it, the same kind of laziness that leads to people not checking their summaries and ending up with typos in them.
