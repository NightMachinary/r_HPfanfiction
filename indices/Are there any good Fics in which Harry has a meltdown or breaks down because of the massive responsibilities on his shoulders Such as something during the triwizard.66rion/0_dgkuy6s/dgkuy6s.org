Linkffn(the queen who fell to earth) sort of does this as an intro to a crossover with 'Dragon Riders of Pern'. Harry heads out to the first task with every intention of letting the dragon eat him, then something amazing happens. It's an excellently written trilogy, unfortunately the third part is unfinished as one of the authors (of a husband and wife team) passed away from cancer not too long ago. Even still, they are well worth the read.
