Not quite a pairing, but I remember once reading a story where Aerith Gainsborough basically adopted Harry as his big sister and thinking that someone like her is exactly what canon Harry needed.

As far as actual pairings, I once read a Ron/Thor drabble that didn't go much into the relationship, but the more I thought about the pairing, the more I liked either that or Ron/Loki. Ron would love Asgardian feasts, and he and Loki would bond over feeling overshadowed by older siblings. Plus I imagine Ron impressing Odin by managing to keep up with him at chess, lol. (And Frigga and Molly Weasley as conspiring in-laws is a delight!)
