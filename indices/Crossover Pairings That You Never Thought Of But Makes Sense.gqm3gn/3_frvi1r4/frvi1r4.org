There's a really well-done Harry Potter / Faith Lehane on AO3 ("Harry Potter and the Gaining of Faith"). Two jaded, traumatized teens forced to grow up way faster than they should have, Faith helps build Harry's confidence and self-worth, while Harry provides a stabilizing influence and gives Faith someone that genuinely cares about her without reservation.
