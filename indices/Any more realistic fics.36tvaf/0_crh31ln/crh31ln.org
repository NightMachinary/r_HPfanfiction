That effect would last all of twenty minutes. Then you find out it takes a full hour to learn the most basic of spells, and you have homework, and bullying is a time-honored tradition, and there isn't so much as a television within twenty miles.

Boredom encroaches, along with a grinding moroseness resulting in part from culture shock and in part from the lack of entertainment.

Eventually, that bushy-haired teacher's pet starts nagging you to do your homework, and you /do/ it because it's /something/, but it only takes you a couple hours a week, so you decide to explore the castle, and you find oh fuck there's a giant dog with three heads and did I mention it's the size of a bus and if it even touches you you'll probably need tetanus shots. So that's out, but there's this thing called Quidditch that you can play. And it's a children's game really, chase after the shiny thing, but it's better than sitting around in the common room. And that takes up a few hours a week, which is nice, I suppose, but there are still giant gaping holes in your schedule.

And now you've had time to grow accustomed to Hogwarts a little and started talking to purebloods, and they tell you how they kept amused when growing up. Most of them went into the Muggle world for that. The people from families that make a big deal of being a wizard and living in the wizarding world, like that Neville kid, imply that the fun thing to do is read.

At this point, in your mind, reading == Granger. So you ask her for books to read, and it's like you gave her ten Christmasses all in a row. Now you're buried in books -- literally, but Neville's getting you out, solid chap him -- and while they're mostly school related, at least it's /something/, but you're having trouble understanding some of them, so you ask Granger, and now you've effectively got another fifteen hours a week of schoolwork. Except with Granger, you can actually understand how she explains things to you. She's a smart cookie, and she pays attention to her students -- not that, say, McGonagall doesn't, but the primary function of teachers at Hogwarts is to keep discipline more than to instruct, it seems, so you're grateful.

After a few weeks of that, you tentatively suggest that you stop going to class and just learn from Granger, but at her immediate horror, you backpedal, say you were just joking. You're not sure what you would do with twenty fewer hours of classwork anyway.

By winter break, you realize that Granger's brought you up well past most of your classes. You're still way behind her. You're not sure how she does it. Seems like even when she's teaching you, she's studying her own work. Doesn't really seem fair. So you branch out. History seems like a nice possibility. You find that Neville has an ancestor who was involved in pretty much any notable event, and that Weasley bloke isn't half bad at acting. You start turning history books into impromptu plays. It turns things from boring to kind of fun. Even Granger stops reading to watch, sometimes. You even got her to laugh.

Her roommates tell you she cries at night sometimes. You can tell she misses the Muggle world a lot. And her parents, but you can't exactly ship them up to Hogwarts, even if they live in Northumberland. So you get the acting crew together in secret and train for /hours/ (or at least /minutes/, but that's something, right?) and turns out Romilda Vane plays the oboe, and before you can say Quidditch you've got a band together to play [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4OS17lqHiE][a song she might appreciate]]. It doesn't quite work; she's swearing a lot more than you expect a kid her age to know how to; but next day she seems a fair bit more content. She's also humming that blasted song. Maybe it was a mistake. Then she looks at you and smiles, and you know that you made the right choice.

Over the summer, she mails you a book on linear algebra. Maths weren't really your thing, before, but you know that, if you apply yourself and get a little help from your friends, you can learn anything.

(By the end of summer, you realize that trigonometry is literally the worst math ever invented and everything after it is actually comprehensible. You feel vaguely cheated.)
