Couldn't a lot of early video games be adapted to something like McG's animated chess set from PS?

I mean, think about the third floor corridor. Now assume that the architect is aiming for /fun/ not /death./ Tell me a wizarding obstacle course wouldn't be amazing. It'd be like a real life puzzle/platformmer.

If chess can benefit from animated pieces that yell advice and move themselves... imagine what the wizarding world would make of something like Warhammer.
