I don't want to get bogged down in a debate --- the story makes sense, otherwise, and it was a small nitpick, in that the topic probably needed to be adjusted down, but, to elaborate, the notion that "a kid" --- again, learning in a few months, from a book alone, without being a prodigy or a savant --- would understand it more easily is debatable in the first place.

And, to be even remotely plausible, said kid would have had to master /and integrate/ myriad other concepts in the first place, starting with basic algebra in one and two variables, operations on fractions, powers, factoring, negative numbers, coordinate geometry, and all the other things that are so basic by the time you start on linear algebra that you don't even think about them.

Now, assuming that Harry was following England's maths curriculum before coming to Hogwarts, and assuming that it hasn't changed much since, he hasn't actually been taught to "solve for x" at least as far as I can tell from the UK government's site.

P.S. In case you're wondering, yes, fanfic characters in general and special-snowflake!Harry in particular insta-learning stuff that takes other people months or years are a pet peeve --- unless the author actually makes "/X/ is a genius" a part of his or her premise. Hermione, at least, has the latter excuse, to some extent.
