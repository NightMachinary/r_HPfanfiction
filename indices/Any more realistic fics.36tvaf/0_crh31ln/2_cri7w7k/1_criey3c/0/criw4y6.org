  Linear algebra was much easier for me to wrap my head around than trigonometry, and I was doing trigonometry around that age.

If you don't mind my asking, at what age did you study which area? Most curricula teach linear algebra long after trigonometry, which could explain why it seems easier.

Ultimately, it's not so much about what's easier in a vacuum, but rather how Harry could have the prerequisites for linear algebra; prerequisites which he would have almost certainly not covered in a British primary school before going to Hogwarts, and which he probably did not study during his time at Hogwarts, what with all the learning magic and adventures and the band and all.

  even if learning difficult material solely from books is a standard trope in Harry Potter fandom.

For fandom, perhaps, but in canon, only for Hermione. Harry generally gets taught or tutored when he learns something. I could be forgetting an earlier instance, but I think that the first time he learns magic from a book is HBP.
