The One True Ship.

I actually anti-ship Harry/Hermione most of the time. Harry becomes dictator of Magical Britain and Hermione has to take him down. Harry and Hermione grow up together and would never, ever think of each other that way. Hermione went back in time, but not with Harry, and the effective age gap is insurmountable. I have one on the back burner where Hermione becomes a Jedi before coming to Hogwarts, and that's not exactly conducive to dating, but she needs to work with Harry. (It's not that I like Harry, really. It's just, well, he's there and not objectionable.)

As for shipping in that drabblet...the participants are eleven years old. Yuck.
