It's not Harry who has this reaction to learning magic, but rather Xander in Tenhawk's [[http://fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com/viewstory.php?sid=35][Alexander Harris and the Shadow Company]]. The story's a sprawling multi-cross (350k+ words, HP/Addam's Family/Buffy) but for the most part remains in the HP world, just with Xander and Wednesday added to the Hogwarts mix + events. If you don't mind a central character (Xander) who is a Gary Stu and slow updates (it went years between the penultimate and last update, which was a few weeks ago), it's a fair guilty pleasure fic.
