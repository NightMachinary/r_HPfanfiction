Not bad. Not bad at all. As you said yourself it's a little early for feedback but here's some general stuff.

--------------

When someone says a spell I don't know about other people but I prefer to read them as saying the spell. For example you wrote "a muttered /flagrate/". Because the person is actually saying the spell I have always preferred the spell to be placed inside speech marks, although that's just a pet peeve of mine.

--------------

Said. Said. Said. Asked.

I felt like those are the only ways any dialogue was exchanged. I understand that there are only so many ways to say something but don't be afraid to use different words other than said. Overuse of said becomes very stale quickly so every so often use something a little different.

The way in which you say things also impact the meaning quite a lot. For example - Harry said, "Watch out!" is different to - Harry whispered, "Watch out!". Very basic sentence with no description, but by changing the way in which the thing is said you get a different impression. Whispering is more secretive and/or urgent than saying something. Simple things like this can really elevate your writing.

--------------

Anyways apart from those rather small things I didn't find much bad. You have actually started off a promising original fic, not another rehash of a popular trope so I am excited to see where you take this.

I will give you more substantial feedback later on, when there is more material to read.
