Thank you, I'm glad you found it interesting. On the topic of "said" and "asked," I actually did that intentionally. There's a trope called Said Bookism which refers to the fear of using "said" because it's believed to be boring, but ever since it was pointed out to me that the brain can work out the tone of the dialogue just by reading it, I have tried to stick to just "said." Not to compare my writing to J.K, but if you look at a page of dialogue in DH you will hardly see any other word being used. Rest assured though, if I ever need a word like "whispered" to make it clear that a character is whispering, I will do so.
