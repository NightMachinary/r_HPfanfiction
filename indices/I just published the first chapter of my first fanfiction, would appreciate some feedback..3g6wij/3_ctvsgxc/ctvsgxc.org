It's very good, and I'll be interested in reading more when it updates.

Advice-wise, you don't have to both describe a spell and mention the spell name if it's cast repeatedly. I noticed this when the characters used /Lumos/, and it was a little distracting. Kinda like the Redundant Department of Redundancy. Other than that, I couldn't find anything to complain about :P
