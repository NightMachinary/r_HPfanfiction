You're absolutely right about the description, I came up with it at 2AM. I genuinely don't see how I could improve it that much, though. The whole point of the story is just that: they find a passage which was made by the Unspeakables, and it takes them to a different world. As the person who came up with this story, I feel like I have a pretty good judgement of what is and isn't important, but you might be right.

I appreciate your concern about this being a crossover, but if it was, I would have posted it as a crossover. Give me a little credit in that respect.

The first sentence is a bit odd now that I think about it. You bring up some good points that I'm not sure how to fix.

Edit: I replaced the first sentence with something new. It should be a little better now.
