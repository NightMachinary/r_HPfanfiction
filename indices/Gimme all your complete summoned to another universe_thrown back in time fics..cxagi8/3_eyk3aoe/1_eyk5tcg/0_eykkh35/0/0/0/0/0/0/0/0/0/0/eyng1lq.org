Good luck with the hurricane, that I mean sincerely. It's a category 4, and I sadly know what it's like to lose everything to one of those. Otherwise, yes the OP did ask for completed stories, but here's a question, what does it hurt to ask if he'd mind decent incomplete stories? It doesn't. I've asked for Harry summoned by the GOF stories, but if someone asked me for a story that starts from GOF with a different Harry to canon in someway, I honestly wouldn't mind if it's interesting enough. I don't look at titles as iron clad rules, but more as guidelines. As in as long as it's in the ball park, and is interesting enough, it doesn't hurt anyone to ask.
