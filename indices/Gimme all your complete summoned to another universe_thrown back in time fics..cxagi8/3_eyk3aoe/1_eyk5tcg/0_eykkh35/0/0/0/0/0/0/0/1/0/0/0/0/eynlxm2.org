It's as OP said, he didn't want certain stories to be montioned. For others, they could be as strict as you, or maybe like me, they wouldn't mind stories outside the parameters they requested if they're interesting enough. It's why there's no problem asking questions, everyone is different, and it's best to see such requests as such. Just remember to understand that other people may think differently from you, so I guess maybe lighten up a bit on these threads, and allow a bit of freedom. You never know what you might find that way.
