But OP said that to you in what I assume was a dm, not in this thread where anyone could read it. Before you told me about it, I had no idea that's what OP wanted so I had to go with what they posted publicly and that was completed stories. Yes I could have dm'ed them as you did but I didn't feel the need to ask a question that I already knew the answer to. "Are incomplete stores okay with you?" This answer was apparently yes but with the information I had available to me, the answer was no.

I mean honestly why ask for complete stories if you don't want complete series? If OP didn't care then don't mention completion status at all. That is what the vast majority of people do on this subreddit when they are requesting stories. They post either what they're looking for, what they're not looking for, or both and we do our best to recommend stories that meets that criteria. If they have four or five different things they want and I've got a story that meets three out of four of them I'd probably say something like "this doesn't mean all of your criteria but it does meet most of it...".

OP wanted two things. They wanted completed stories and summoned to another universe/time travel. If you give him just one of the two then you only did 50% of the request and in any test you take, 50% right is an automatic fail.
