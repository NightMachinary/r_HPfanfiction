And what is the problem with that. If the OP said as such then you'd have a point, but he didn't. You didn't bother asking the OP if it was fine, no, you went straight to just reading everyone the riot act instead of doing the simple thing, and asking the OP if it was fine. You are not the OP, and the OP is not an invalid. So stop writing as if he was. Your still arguing the point when it's already been sorted. Also I keep replying, because you seem like the type that must get the last word in, and frankly, I like denying such things to people like you. People who believe they must speak up in defence of someone else as if they're too stupid to do it themselves.
