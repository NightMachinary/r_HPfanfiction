I guess I can see what you mean, but i've always been more flexible myself. Others are as well. Like I said, don't believe that the way you see things are the same for others. It's fine if you, and even a great deal of others i'll admit, see things like that, but not everyone is that way. This isn't a test, so 50% doesn't mean fail, it means this meets half your criteria, would you be willing to give it a shot. Lastly, i'll ask again, does it hurt to ask.
