Yes, and again I ask what is the problem asking if they wouldn't mind an incomplete story. Your being quite stubborn on this, and while it's clear you wamt exactly what you ask for, others can be flexible. Asking if they are as such doesn't hurt you, or them. If they don't want such, no harm done. If they do, again no harm done.
