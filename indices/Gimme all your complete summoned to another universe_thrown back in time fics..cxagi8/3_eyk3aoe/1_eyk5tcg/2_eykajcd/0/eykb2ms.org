But it's not what OP requested. They specifically requested complete stories. Not incomplete stories, not work in progress stories, not abandoned stories, they asked for complete stories. Somebody makes a request and you give them something that they specifically requested that they don't want, that's not filling the request.

If I request Harry/Luna and somebody gives me a story that has Harry/Ginny that's not filling the request either.
