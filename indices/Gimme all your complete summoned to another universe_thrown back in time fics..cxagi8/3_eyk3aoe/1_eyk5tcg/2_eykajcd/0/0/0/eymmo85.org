But the OP posted their restrictions. They wanted complete stories. It's up to them to tell us what they're looking for or not looking for, as the case may be. If someone asked for slash fics are you gonna recommend het fics? If someone wanted a crossover with Iron Man are you gonna recommend a crossover with Batman? If they ask for stories over 100k words are you gonna recommend a 10k one shot? If they request comedy or fluff stories are you gonna post grimdark stories? No because that's not what was requested. It doesn't matter how good the story is. */IF THE STORY DOESNT MEET THE CONDITIONS THEN IT SHOULDNT BE POSTED/*

I don't understand why you can't comprehend such a simple concept. If someone asks you for an orange, do you give them an apple? If someone asks you about the weather do you answer by talking about your last movie you saw?
