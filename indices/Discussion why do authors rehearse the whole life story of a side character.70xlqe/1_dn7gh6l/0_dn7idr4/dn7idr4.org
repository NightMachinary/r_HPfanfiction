Agreed. A difference in perspective is always nice--provided the writer is able to actually give the impression the point of view is different. That Character B sees the world in a different way than Character A.

NoFP is a good example--several of Harry's friends get attention to their point of view, and even some of the grown-ups, including Molly Weasley.
