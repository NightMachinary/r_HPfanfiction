[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12672741/1/renascentia][renascentia]] co-written by tonberrys-and-kuchikopi is a type of fic that really needs more attention. The fic's writing style is written in a way that I reminds me of a high level fictional read. Like the language is written by a extremely well verse writer, or in this case writers. A rare but delightful find in the fanfiction world.

It's essentially a Regulus alive fic and what would he do if he was alive. The authors understood each character extremely well, especially on the background of the Black brothers. Anyways, Regulus doesn't join the Order till the end and it later goes into a sequel.

The authors have written several stories in that universe that centered around the brothers' past which are also insightful reads as well. Those are not really needed to be read to understand the main story, but I do recommend reading those background stories as well which are all under their account on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/9795334/tonberrys-and-kuchikopi][FFN]].
