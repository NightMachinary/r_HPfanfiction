The Son of Grindelwald linkffn(13398928)

It's not done but it gets updates at a decent rate. There his no real bashing but, for obvious reasons, Dumbledore is one of many antagonist in that Story.\\
There is also no slash, it looks more like a Harry/Fleur fic.

As mentioned in the title and description this is a story were Harry is the son of Grindelwald, so he is related to him.
