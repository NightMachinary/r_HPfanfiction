I have a modified quidditch game that eschews brooms for magically modified mountainboards and the pitch has a constantly shifting design so you can't just race across, you need to account for sudden hills, whoops, and so on. Broom racing is a fun thing to modify. I introduced Battlemages(Battleship variant) in Darkness Ascendant.
