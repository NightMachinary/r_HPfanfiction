  Another take on WHAT-IF Harry got rid of Voldemort in fifth year? Oh yeah and WHAT-IF he just so happened to fall in love with certain twins? In disguise. Under a wrong name, that is. Shenanigans ahead.Also a take on self-discovery and gender fluidity.(Or the one in which Harry gives the headmaster the finger and decides to go exploring the Wizarding World on his own.)
