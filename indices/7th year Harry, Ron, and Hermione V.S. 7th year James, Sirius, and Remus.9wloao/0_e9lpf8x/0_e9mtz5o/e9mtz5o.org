I love the Marauders but it's always seemed fairly clear to me that until /after/ Hogwarts they were particularly immature and untested. Hermione wasn't as interested in obscure spells and stuff like they were, yeah. However, when Marauders stayed late at the library or snuck into the restricted section, they were doing it to learn how to be animagi or prank the slytherins. When Hermione did she was learning how to make an unbreakable jar to hide a reporter in or researching spells she knew she would need in the inevitable battles she would have with Voldemort and his death eaters.

​

We're not comparing /peak/ Marauders vs /peak/ Harry and Co. We're comparing 7th year Marauders to 7th year Harry and Co. Marauders were gifted wizards, there is no denying it, and they /were/ a remarkable thorn in Voldemort's side but that was /after/ Hogwarts. Harry, Hermione, and Ron had faced Voldemort repeatedly by 7th year, their 6th years at Hogwarts were put together with constant reminders of the war to come and constant battles that grew increasingly difficult.

​

In sum, Harry and Co would beat Marauders in a 7th year vs 7th year fight.
