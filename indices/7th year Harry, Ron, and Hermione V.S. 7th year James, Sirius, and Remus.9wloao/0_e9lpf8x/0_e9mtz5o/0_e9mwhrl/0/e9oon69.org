Oh yeah, I've always thought they were brilliant. Becoming animagi, the map, both of these are concrete proof of minds that were allowed to wander and because of that did wonderful things. That said, I don't know if creative brilliance would transfer into a fight and I've always imagined that Harry and Co had more fight experience in Hogwarts.

I (obviously) thoroughly enjoyed the books. That said, their skill level is something left to the imagination. Are they particularly gifted witches and wizards or just lucky? (Or unlucky, depending on how you look at it.) Harry is shown as exceptional for his age, but not so much exceptional for wizards in general. Why is he able to defeat Voldemort then? "Because prophecy". -_-

I think that luck is something you can only take advantage of if you have the skill, ability, etc. So to me it is a mix of both. Harry and Co. got lucky a lot. There's no denying it but that luck would have meant nothing without a certain level of skill and 'saving people' attitude.
