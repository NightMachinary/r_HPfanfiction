See, my view is that the Marauders were fucking about until the end of their seventh year, much like you said, but even in their fucking around they were remarkably powerful and arguably did more brilliant things than the trio (the map/becoming animagi is more impressive than anything Hermione comes up with imo).

That was always one of my small issues, though. I feel like JK should have shown the trio doing something more advanced because it ended up seeming like most of their escapes from LV was sheer luck and some skill.
