You've got a point, it really boils down to what the Marauders were experiencing in Hogwarts. If it was more carefree, like I have always imagined, then absolutely I think the Marauders would be toast. That said, if it was tense and dangerous then they stand a much higher chance.

Hermione was brilliant but not a fighter, you're right there, that's why she doesn't become an Auror. That said, I think she could confidently work as defense and allow Harry and Ron to attack. She was on the run with them too, and she fared well, and anyone who was anything but a decent fighter wouldn't have survived. You're also right that Ron is inconsistent but I've always believed that when it comes down to it he can be counted on.

Unrelated but I love that the Marauders are technically 4 and Harry and Co is 3 but no one is even counting Peter, xD.
