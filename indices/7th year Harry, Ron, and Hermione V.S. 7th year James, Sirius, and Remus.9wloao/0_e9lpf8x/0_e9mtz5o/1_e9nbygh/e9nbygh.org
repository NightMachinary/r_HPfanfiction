I mean, it's hard to make a hard judgement either way because we just don't know enough about the Marauders. But I was under the impression that Hogwarts was a pretty tense place when they were at school. We know for a fact that Snape was throwing some pretty heavy dark magic at them, at least two other death eaters were in their year, James was outspoken against Voldemort and dated a muggleborn, and Sirius was openly rebelling against any kind of pure blood rhetoric.\\
So I don't imagine them as just having a laugh and doing silly pranks. I imagine some fairly heavy dueling and high stakes skirmishes.

Also, I don't want to downplay Hermione's brilliance - because she was brilliant. But she wasn't really good in a fight. She was good at being prepared before hand, and knowing a lot of things. But Harry was really the only one who could reliably act under pressure. IMO the Marauders would win because they have 2-3 'Harrys' (I'm on the fence with Remus ), while the trio only has one good fighter, one good researcher, and Ron - who was good, but not great, and a bit inconsistent.
