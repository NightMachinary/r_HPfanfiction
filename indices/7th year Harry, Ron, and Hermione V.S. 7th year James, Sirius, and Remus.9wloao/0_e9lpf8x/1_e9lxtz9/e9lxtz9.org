It really depends how dire the situation is. Hermione implies that she knows Fiendfyre, so she could Apparate to wherever the Marauders are, unleash it and pop out (or have someone side along her). And if she knows that spell, who knows what else she's got up her sleeve. That being said, she would definitely not use that kind of magic lightly, only as the absolutely last resort.
