R1: Harry+friends. Harry is a Defense prodigy, Hermione has exceptional book knowledge. Ron gets shafted here -- he is a fine and stubborn dueller (moreso than Hermione I'd say), but he isn't as magically knowledgeable. When it comes to James+friends, the one I'd say with the best magical knowledge is Remus. The other 2 are good duellers, but doesn't have the same magical knowledge, besides exceptional Transfiguration skills (they did become Animagi). Pretty similar to Ron. Also, the cases we see in the books of the young Marauders (mostly from Severus' POV), they tend to use Severus' spells against him. Whether this is just another bullying tactic, or the fact that they simply don't know better spells themselves I don't know, but I'd say it's a bit of both, and using your enemy's spells against him/her doesn't really seem like a good idea from a strategical PoV -- thus I'd judge lack of magical knowledge.

R2: James+friends. The way I interpret the canon, they already play well with each other team-wise from early school years, and it's only natural to see this develop further into their 7th year. I don't think Harry and Ron are worse duellers on their own (I do think Hermione is), but they don't have the teamwork experience in a simple duel that the Marauders have.
