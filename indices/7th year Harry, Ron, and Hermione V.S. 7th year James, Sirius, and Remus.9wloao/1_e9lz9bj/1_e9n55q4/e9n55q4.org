I don't think this is correct. The trio were going up against far more dangerous things in every year of their schooling than any of the Marauders did, even after they joined the war (until the Potters came up against Voldemort, obviously). So in terms of actual fighting, in their seventh years it's obvious the trio would be better. They'd show they could match Death Eaters by that point, and it was clear the Order were mostly getting slaughtered by the Death Eaters before Lily saved everyone.
