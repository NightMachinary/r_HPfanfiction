I always had the impression that the Marauders were more powerful and arguably smarter, too. Hermione is very smart, and Ron is cunning even if he's not book smart, but none of the characters (with the exception of Hermione in some cases) really show anything approaching what you would expect from the trio that helps take down Voldemort.

They go toe to toe with Voldemort in duels multiple times and survive, the Marauder's Map is even more genius than Hermione's coins, they become animangus when they were really young, even Peter, whom Sirius is bitter about and calls the weakest, manages to brew a potion to bring Voldemort back to life and such a potion is likely complex and dark. Bellatrix is probably the fiercest fighter after Dumbledore and Voldemort, and Sirius manages to hold his own even though his health has probably been damaged by being in Azkaban for so long---he only loses because he gets distracted, not because he's outpowered.
