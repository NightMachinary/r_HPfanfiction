The trio gets wiped out twice!

Seriously, Hermione's cursed parchment and DA-Coin has nothing on the Marauder's Map and the communications mirrors (note: We don't know if they made them, but there's a good chance that they did!)

As for the fights? Harry is slacker who doesn't use his talents well (Unforgiveables don't realy compensate for lack of knowledge and training), while James was a prodigy in transfiguration, Ron isn't all that great (Sirius can take him easily) and Remus out Hermiones even Hermione herself :)
