The Marauders Map is an excellent example of exceptional magical knowledge, and one I somehow managed to forget in my own comment, but do we know who did what on it? My headcanon for it is that James, Sirius and especially Peter (with his rat animagus form) investigated all the secrets of the castle, but that Remus did the actual charmwork.

Also, didn't they become Animagi in 5th year?
