My headcanon for it is that James, Sirius and especially Peter (with his rat animagus form) investigated all the secrets of the castle, but that Remus did the actual charmwork.

For what it's worth, on Pottermore, James is listed as exceptional in transfiguration and Sirius in charms. Peter is unfortunately given a fairly uncomplimentary write up so it's hard to say how much he did or did not contribute. But if we take that info at face value, James might have worked with the map and Sirius, the tracking.
