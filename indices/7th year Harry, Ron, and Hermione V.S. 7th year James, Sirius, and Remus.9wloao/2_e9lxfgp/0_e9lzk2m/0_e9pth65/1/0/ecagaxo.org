I mean, he did charm his motorbike to fly. Charms on Muggle technology are really advanced and difficult (see: the Weasleys flying car, and how that was an exceptional magical object). The Pottermore article is probably meant to imply he was the main "architect" of the map, to an extent, given that it's charm based. That area would also cover minor hexes, jinxes -- tools for causing trouble at school, which we know he did. Also, even if you don't personally take Pottermore as canon, there's certainly nothing to /disprove/ this particular point of skill.

Sirius was also an animagus at 15 and, as you mentioned, praised by McGonagall, so he probably kicked ass at transfiguration too. Given that SB/JP were "top of their class" it's sort of like talking about Hermione's - well-rounded, good at everything, but some disciplines are a little more natural than others.
