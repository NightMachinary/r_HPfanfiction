Do you need to be super powerful to become one? Wouldn't knowledge of the process and the desire to try it be enough? (Sure: Fanfiction makes it about brewing complicated potions and/or knowing occlumency and meditation and/or having a form in the first place, but I think everybody kind of does - only dead things don't have a "spirit-animal" (so Voldemort might be unable to after making his horcruxes, but I doubt that - if he wanted to he'd be an animagus and he would probably be a snake of some kind...or maybe one of those thingst they make invisibility cloaks from, because he kind of is an afraid little boy!)) Sure it would take a while, but if the trio wanted, they could IMHO have done it (frankly: I think it is quite the plothole that Rowling didn't give Harry the desire to try it, as it would be something that connnects him to both Sirius and James - and to Remus, too!)
