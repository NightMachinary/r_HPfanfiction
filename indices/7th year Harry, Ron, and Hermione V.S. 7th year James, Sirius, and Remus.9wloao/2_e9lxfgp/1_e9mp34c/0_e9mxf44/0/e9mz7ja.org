Uh, Hogwarts was a shit storm all six years of their schooling. Under the assumption that the trio wouldn't complete animagus in their first or second years, because, well- they're like 11/12 no way would they have the mental nor magical strength to do so.

​

Third year, a known murderer is after Harry. Hermione is screwing with time. Ron is...doing Ron stuff.

Fourth year, Twizard Tournment. Harry and Hermione trying to get him to survive that lil problem. Told he's gonna die this year cuz of the Grim, usual problems of boy wonder. After Ron get's his head outta his ass, time is spent helping that.

Fifth year, Umbitch is there and Harry is busy running an underground defense class. Voldemort's resurrected, no one believes him and his mentors are kinda being weird, no one's really telling him anything, Cedric's dead.

Six year, Harry is trying his Occlumency shields. Mentor is lowkey dying, Snape is DADA professor, watching Malfoy because suspicious behavior and young Death Eaters. Oh and he saw his Godfather die right in front of him by Bellatrix, like the previous year.

​

So, they were semi operational throughout the years. Third year would be the year that the Trio could potentially pull of animagus training and that's a bit of a stretch.
