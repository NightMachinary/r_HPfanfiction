#+begin_quote
  But Harry hasn't seen anyone die in front of him besides Lily
#+end_quote

Quirrell, Voldemort, Tom Riddle, Lily Potter, the troll(did he die? I can't really recall), the basilisk, Cedric.

#+begin_quote
  but he only saw the Thresals after Cedric's death
#+end_quote

Plothole. JKR is known for them.

#+begin_quote
  the idea of war hasn't really hit him yet. It has with Cedric's death.
#+end_quote

Fair enough.

#+begin_quote
  I think the Triwizard Tournament is more time consuming than one would think.
#+end_quote

Logically yes. But from what we have seen canonically he did fuck all until all the time to prepare had almost run out. So...I'll have to disagree with that one.

#+begin_quote
  In addition, it takes a great mental strength that Harry can't handle after 4/5 year.
#+end_quote

I'd argue that because of the hardships he suffered he should have turned to something like animagus to distract him. Perfect time, I would say.

#+begin_quote
  plus you got snake man rummaging in his head.
#+end_quote

The fifth year, I assume? Voldemort did not go rummaging through his head. He only implanted false visions of Sirius dying. That happened towards the end of the year and was only done a few times.

#+begin_quote
  Plus running the DA must have been nerve wracking
#+end_quote

Not really. He only needed to teach them. Hermione came up with most of the spells.

#+begin_quote
  and the political shift
#+end_quote

Harry never cared about politics.

#+begin_quote
  I just think there just isn't any time for anyone to successfully complete animagus.
#+end_quote

3rd and 4th year. Or 3rd and 5th.

#+begin_quote
  I don't think the Trio could do it.
#+end_quote

Likely only Harry would be able to. Although Harry was dumbed down to be pathetically average after the third book, he is the only one of the three I can see succeeding. Hermione is too much of book-orientated person. It'd be hard for her to advance as fast(I don't know if it makes sense, if It doesn't let me know) and while I think Ron is certainly magically able to accomplish it, he lacks motivation.

#+begin_quote
  I also proceeded to drag my roommates into this discussion too and we are having a blast- so thanks for the good arguments your giving us!
#+end_quote

No problem, glad I could help
