Ah, yeah no I got the Grim dog one wrong. I mixed up my books- oops. I also forgot with Ron, idk how to really place him- my memory isn't good with what he was doing during these times.

But Harry hasn't seen anyone die in front of him besides Lily, but he only saw the Thresals after Cedric's death. So agruably, no, he hasn't seen death. And it doesn't really matter if he's only talked to him like 3 or 4 times, the idea of war hasn't really hit him yet. It has with Cedric's death.

I think the Triwizard Tournament is more time consuming than one would think. In addition, it takes a great mental strength that Harry can't handle after 4/5 year. Not until the threat of Voldemort is gone, plus you got snake man rummaging in his head. Plus running the DA must have been nerve wracking with everything and the political shift, Harry's mental strength is kinda pushing it at this point.

James & Co supposedly begin their training in 3rd year but only completed it in their 5th year. I just think there just isn't any time for anyone to successfully complete animagus. Not only that but with the strain of everything happening, I don't think the Trio could do it.

I also proceeded to drag my roommates into this discussion too and we are having a blast- so thanks for the good arguments your giving us!
