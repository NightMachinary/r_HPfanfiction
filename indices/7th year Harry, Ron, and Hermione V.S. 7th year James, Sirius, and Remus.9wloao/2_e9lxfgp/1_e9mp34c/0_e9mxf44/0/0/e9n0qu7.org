#+begin_quote
  Third year, a known murderer is after Harry. Hermione is screwing with time.
#+end_quote

Perfect time to learn something useful to defend yourself/defend your friend, no? Besides, It'd be useful if Harry was ever attacked in Muggle word, be it by Dudley or random Muggles(Muggers, Murderers, etc)

#+begin_quote
  Fourth year, Twizard Tournament. Harry and Hermione trying to get him to survive that lil problem
#+end_quote

The same thing applies. Would have been useful to have during all of the tasks, depending on the form. Any obscure magic like that would have been useful

#+begin_quote
  Told he's gonna die this year cuz of the Grim, usual problems of the boy wonder.
#+end_quote

Not that it matters but wasn't that Year 3?

#+begin_quote
  After Ron get's his head outta his ass, time is spent helping that.
#+end_quote

Whole five minutes after task one?

#+begin_quote
  Fifth year, Umbitch is there and Harry is busy running an underground defense class.
#+end_quote

Would have been useful if they ever needed to do something stealthy, or attack her without leading back to them. Useful thing to teach to the students or for gaining respect.

#+begin_quote
  no one believes him
#+end_quote

Plenty of people he cared about believed him.

#+begin_quote
  his mentors are kinda being weird
#+end_quote

He had only one and I'd hardly call Dumbledor a Mentor.

#+begin_quote
  Cedric's dead.
#+end_quote

And he only talked to him 3-4 times? Harry should not have acted like he lost the love of his live. Then again, a person died infront of him...wait, not the first time is it?

#+begin_quote
  Third year would be the year that the Trio could potentially pull of animagus training and that's a bit of a stretch.
#+end_quote

They could have pulled it off any year except 1,2,6.
