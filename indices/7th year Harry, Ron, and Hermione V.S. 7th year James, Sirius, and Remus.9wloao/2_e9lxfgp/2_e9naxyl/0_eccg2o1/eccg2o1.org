  I think you're really underestimating the importance of experience in combat and how quick reflexes would effect wizard fights.

I find it weird that you use this argument against the marauders when James's exceptional reflexes were actually emphasized contrary to Ron's (or Hermione).

  In the training the Trio got from Dumbledore's Army, they practiced dueling and defence spells a lot by an apparent DADA prodigy, whereas the Marauders seem to be transfiguration and charms prodigies, not to mention both Harry and Ron being quidditch stars means they must have quick reflexes

The thing is, except for Harry, most of them were average. His training allowed some to be good enough to be able to defend themselve however none of them got O (at least not Ron or Hermione) while James, Sirius were confident they would get an O and and showed to know the spells Harry had taught to the DA (bar the patronus maybe).

Ron wasn't a Quidditch star. James was, he was the Quidditch hero whose great reflexes had been emphasized.

  The Marauders may have been talented and powerful, but they had been essentially firing cheap shots at Snape and the other mini-DE's at school whenever they can get away with it,
#+end_quote

I don't know what are your sources but defintely not the books. Before even drawing his wand James warned Snape by calling him allowing the Slytherin to draw his wand. James just happened to be quicker than him.

The rest about him cheap shotting mini DE isn't canon.

  and even the closest we see to them dueling in Snape's memory show how bad James is at it, since he is so cocky he takes his eyes off his opponent and let's Snape get a hit in.

Is that a serious argument ? Was it really the best you could come up with ? Few..
