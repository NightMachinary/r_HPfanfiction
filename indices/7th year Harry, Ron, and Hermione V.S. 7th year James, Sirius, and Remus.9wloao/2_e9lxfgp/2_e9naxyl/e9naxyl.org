I think you're really underestimating the importance of experience in combat and how quick reflexes would effect wizard fights. In the training the Trio got from Dumbledore's Army, they practiced dueling and defence spells a lot by an apparent DADA prodigy, whereas the Marauders seem to be transfiguration and charms prodigies, not to mention both Harry and Ron being quidditch stars means they must have quick reflexes. The Marauders may have been talented and powerful, but they had been essentially firing cheap shots at Snape and the other mini-DE's at school whenever they can get away with it, and even the closest we see to them dueling in Snape's memory show how bad James is at it, since he is so cocky he takes his eyes off his opponent and let's Snape get a hit in. As much as Harry gets shit for always using Expelliarmus, it ends the duel immediately, and the Trio's reflexes and battle instincts would be way higher than the Marauders after fifth year; they wouldn't hesitate, they wouldn't need to think about what spells they use, they'd take their opponents down without pausing.
