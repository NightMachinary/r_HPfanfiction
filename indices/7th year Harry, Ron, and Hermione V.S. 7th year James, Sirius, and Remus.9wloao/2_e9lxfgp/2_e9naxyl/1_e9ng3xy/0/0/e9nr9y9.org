James was trying to humiliate Snape and impress Lily and the only reason OWL examiners were impressed with Harry was because he performed a Patronus Charm, which is not a combative spell. Also silent casting is said to be taught in sixth year and Harry and Co never properly learned so 7th year James and Co would be using silent spells. Harry and Co would get destroyed in 1 v 1 's.
