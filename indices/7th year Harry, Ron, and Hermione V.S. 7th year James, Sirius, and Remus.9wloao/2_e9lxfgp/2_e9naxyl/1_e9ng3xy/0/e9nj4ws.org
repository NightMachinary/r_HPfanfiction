Harry was definitely a Defence prodigy, multiple characters point out how amazing he is at DADA including Lupin himself. Even Harry's OWLs examiners are impressed with him, and he was canonically better at it than Hermione "Brightest Witch of Her Age" Granger. And even though James was a star Quidditch player himself, the canonical evidence we see of his dueling with Snape in OOTP is really poor. He is easily distracted by Lily, he uses flashy spells rather than ones that would end a duel like hoisting someone upside down or the cleaning spell, something an opponent could easily retaliate to, and he is very quick to anger and provoked easily.

Could 7th Year Marauders beat the Trio in an ambush? Absolutely. Could they beat them in a one-on-one fight? If it's for some reason drawn out then probably, but again, the Trio would know to finish them as quickly as possible.
