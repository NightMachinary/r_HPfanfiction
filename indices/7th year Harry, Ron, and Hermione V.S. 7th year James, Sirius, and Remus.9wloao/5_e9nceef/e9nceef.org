Let's look at some of the highlights of what the Trio accomplished, and think about whether the Marauders could have accomplished the same things.

- Investigate the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone and make it to the final room with the mirror. Doubtful whether the Marauders could do it. The key here isn't magical skill or investigative ability (though I have no doubt the Trio certainly outclass the Marauders in the latter), but Harry's ability to befriend someone like Hagrid, who ended up provided almost every key piece of information. The Marauders would try to do too much on their own, draw too much attention to themselves, and fail.
- Brew Polyjuice Potion as second years. No question the Marauders could have done this.
- Find the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. We'll disqualify this one, since it's not the Marauders' fault that none of them is a Parselmouth.
- Learn to cast a patronus as a third year. The Marauders were probably up to this one, too.
- Be willing to die for their friends as third years. I honestly don't know here. It's possible.
- Be chosen as School Champion as a fourth year. No way any of the Marauders could have done it. Meanwhile, if there wasn't an age restriction in place, I easily imagine the Goblet choosing Harry as the legitimate Hogwarts Champion.
- Survive the Triwizard Tournament. Not a fair comparison, since Harry had Crouch Jr. guiding him along.
- Find dates to the Yule Ball. Here's the first one where the Marauders totally outclass the Trio. Though Hermione did go with an internationally famous Quidditch player, so we'll call this one a draw.
- Effectively subvert the likes of Dolores Umbridge. This is where the Trio really shines. The Marauders would have Fred-and-George'd it. Bold and elaborate gestures against the regime, which ends with them expelled from Hogwarts.
- Fight it out with a bunch of Death Eaters at the Department of Mysteries and survive the encounter. Should I say it? OK, I'll say it. Even /adult/ Sirius was incapable of this one.
- Become Dumbledore's favorite and be trusted with the secrets of Voldemort's past. This is another one that's unfair, but the Marauders were admitted to the Order of the Phoenix at a very young age, so it's not a clear win for the Trio.
- Win a Quidditch Cup. I'm not sure if we ever learn if James' squad won the Cup, but I'd be shocked if they didn't. Tie.
- Defeat the greatest dark wizard of all time. Again, there are a dozen reasons this one is unfair, but the Trio takes it.

Meanwhile, what did the Marauders do, and were those things achievable for the Trio?

- Become Animagi. If the Trio had learned Neville was a werewolf, is it completely crazy to think they could have learned how to become Animagi to keep him company? It's a little far-fetched to think they'd /want/ to, but if they decided they /had/ to? Yeah, I think they could.
- Create the Marauder's Map. Yeah, no, even Hermione wasn't up to this task. Clear win for Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.

I'm giving the overall edge to the Trio, mainly on the strength of what they were able to do against Dolores Umbridge. Their ability to skillfully use subterfuge and build a network of allies was a skill the Marauders never developed. It's a (dare I say it) Snape-like ability. The Marauders may have had a little more oomph and panache, but they were never as well-rounded as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. In any given encounter the Marauders might come out on top, but over the long run the trends favor the Trio. It's no coincidence that all of the Marauders ended up dying prematurely whereas the Trio all settled down to raise happy families.
