Being book smart at abstract bullshit like "making a map" does not translate to combat skills. And neither does "turning into a deer" mean you can out-duel a prodigy at defence.

Fred and George do stuff like that all the time but when it came to defence Harry was the one teaching them despite being two years younger.

Harry is both extremely knowledgeable at defence and a true prodigy at it. He also has all the real world experience and attitude to back it up. (compared to the student Marauders, not the version that actually experienced the war themselves later in life)

In this simulated fight-scene, James & Sirius would start goofing off and using "joke-spells" like they did with Snape. Whereas harry would open with real combat spells to the face. That attitude alone would wipe the floor with the marauders immediately.

17-year-old James was still a kid playing pranks in school. 17-year-old Harry was leading a successful guerrilla campaign against a tyrannical government lead by the worst dark lord in history!

But yeah sure, in between fighting off dementors, killing a basilisk and winning the triwizard tournament he didn't have the time to make a map of his school or turn into a dog, those are clearly superior skills...
