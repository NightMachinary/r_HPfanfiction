The marauders were stronger I think. I mean they created something as complex as the Marauders' Map and they were animagi, that shows that they were very talented, probably geniuses.

Ron and Harry were good but pretty average in talent overall and Hermione was a genius, but she relied mostly on book knowledge while the marauders were more experimental. Also, don't forget that the marauders were able to fight Snape who was kind of a genius in his own right. I think the marauders would win in a fair fight against the trio.
