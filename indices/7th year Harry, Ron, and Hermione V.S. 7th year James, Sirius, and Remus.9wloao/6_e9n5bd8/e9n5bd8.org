No contest, the trio wins. Unlike the Marauders, they had actual focused training and experience against powerful dark entities and wizards throughout their schooling, Harry especially. There's just no reason to suppose the Marauders would win at that point, talent at magic is not the same as talent in fighting with magic. Harry and Hermione were incapacitating Death Eaters by fourth and fifth year, while the Order was said to have been in bad shape in the war against them. Pretty convincing trio win indeed.
