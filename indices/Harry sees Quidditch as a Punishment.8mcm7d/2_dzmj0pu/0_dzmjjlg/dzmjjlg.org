Daft Morons was way too slow paced for my liking. It was at the end of first year, he asks McGonagall if his punishment is over, or something like that. 63 Chapters - about 4-500k words from the First Task to the Third. That and the whole "Hermione is gorgeous and Harry is whipped" cliche.

Fic I'm after, it was at the end of first year, Harry asks if the Punishment has finished, and if he can stop playing Quidditch.
