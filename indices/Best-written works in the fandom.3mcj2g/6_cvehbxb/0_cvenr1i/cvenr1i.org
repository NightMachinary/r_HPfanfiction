You see, this is very stupid. I'm not a fan of Robst, but his flaws are in the story, not in the telling of the story. Robst is a good technical writer, if his stories didn't feature 11 year olds in love and soul bonds they would probably be decent fics, since he has a lot of good ideas to back up his writing ability. However I think Robst must have been struck in the head because hes fixed on one idea and keeps writing new stories that are all just shells around the repeating core story of his.
