Style isn't merely a matter of technical competence, though. Badfic notwithstanding, I'd say technical competence is a low bar to clear. Heck, /I/ would be one of the best writers in fandom if that were the only criterion.

In my corner of fandom, there are a lot of older writers, and most of us take good SPaG for granted. Beyond that, preferences in style are marked by personal taste. I can't count the number of debates I've witnessed over transparent vs. purple prose. I like a lot of styles, so I'm more likely to say, "I love this writer," rather than "this style is objectively better than that one."
