I've always admired [[http://fp.fanficauthors.net][Full Pensieve's]] dialogue and storytelling, particularly in Last Horcrux, though he drinks from the super-powerful-protagonist well more than I'd expect while reading original fiction.

linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks) has some weird stylistic tendencies (the author says English is not their first language, and you can tell) but the core of the story and the ideas within it are a cut above most fanfic.

linkffn(A Local's Guide to Life in London by Significant Owl), which I linked a couple of days ago, feels like really polished chick-lit-adjacent fiction to me, though I don't read any non-fanfic romance to compare it against. Good use of stylistic devices, tone, dialogue, etc.

There are a lot of really competent writers in fanfiction---obviously they're drowned out by the incompetent ones, but they're out there. Much rarer, I think, is people who can combine that with a sense of structure and economy. (Hence FP never finishing Years of Rebellion and getting swallowed up a little in the middle of Last Horcrux.)

If you're writing for a publisher, the incentive is simple: You aren't getting paid by the word, and unless you're an established writer of high fantasy they don't want to see something much over 100k anyway. If you're writing fanfic, people review and follow after every chapter, so the longer the better. (And readers tend to read fanfic faster and more indiscriminately than original fiction, so most of /them/ want long works, too.)
