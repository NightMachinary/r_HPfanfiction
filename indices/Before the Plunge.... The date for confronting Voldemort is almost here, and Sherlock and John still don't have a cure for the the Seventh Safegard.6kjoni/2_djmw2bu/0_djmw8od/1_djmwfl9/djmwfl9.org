You're very welcome.

With this title it's a bit hard to notice that the chapter is part of the Seventh Safeguard story until the end. This title sounds more like a normal English sentence than a chapter header. But in general, I don't know what you can do to attract more attention. Put it down to bad taste by readers, or people getting distracted by weird recommendation threads, I guess. There's probably room for a middle ground between clickbait and purely descriptive titling, although I don't have any good advice on how you should go about finding it.
