Definitely. It was necessary in the initial stages to establish exactly what Sherlock knows - both in view of it as a Sherlock Holmes case, and due to the fact that I wasn't expecting all readers to be up enough on HP lore to follow Sherlock if things weren't stated in the text. (Oh, yes, I'm the author.)

But certainly, things become much more action oriented. Chapter 1 - The worlds clash Chapter 2 - The characters agree to discuss the issue Chapter 3 - The basic case is established (yeah, a lot of rehash) Chapter 4 - Sherlock gives his thoughts on the Snape issue (kind of an odd place to put it maybe, but it's a major plot point later so it had to be established early) Chapter 5 - It's from this point that the action which diverts the course of the future really begins, and the united characters embark on the horcrux hunt.

I know it was a kind of slow start, but it really seemed necessary for the subject matter. And there is intermittent re-statement of facts, which comes up inevitably whenever Sherlock has to explain a deduction. (That can't really be helped.) But yes, the plot diverges very strongly from the original, includes a good deal of action, and winds up in a different place.
