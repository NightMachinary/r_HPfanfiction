Aqua Erecto was in GoF game, which JK approved, as a spell taught to 4th years by Moody. The game came out around the same time the HBP came out. HBP was the first time the spell name was given. Aguamenti is less powerful than Aqua Erecto from the spell descriptions as well. In the book GoF Fleur used a non-verbal water spell, this was the attempt to name it as far as I can tell.

Canon aguamenti is either used as a stream or wave of water. Canon Aqua Erecto is described as 'thin fountain to an immense, powerful and destructive jet.'

Aguamenti is used to fill cups or fight fires. Aqua Erecto does that and knocks down walls.

Haven't read HPatBWL, link please I have no idea what that means lol.
