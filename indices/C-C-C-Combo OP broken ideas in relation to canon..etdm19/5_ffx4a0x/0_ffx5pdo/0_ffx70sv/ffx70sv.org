Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived)

Fair warning that it's abandoned, most of it is only available on DLP, and I the last time I tried to read it on that site, I got some error message about my account not having proper clearance, or some such. As for the aqua eructo/aguamenti thing, fair enough, then. Personally, the only thing I really think of as canon is the original series of novels, so I tend to forget that there even are other sources to draw from. (That, and I actually only played the first three games.)
