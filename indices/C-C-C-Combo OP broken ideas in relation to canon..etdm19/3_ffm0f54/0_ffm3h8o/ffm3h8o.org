Legit, add in some shrinking charms and you could have an obscene amount of liquid in that jar. Shrink a tub full of ANFO into an unbreakable vial and have fun.

Maybe get really stupid with it and make some magically stabilized C2N14! by the swimming pool size batch at a time!

On another note a thin riot shield of unbreakable glass would be fairly wicked.

That unbreakable glass could be so heavily abused. Excellent idea, thank for sharing!
