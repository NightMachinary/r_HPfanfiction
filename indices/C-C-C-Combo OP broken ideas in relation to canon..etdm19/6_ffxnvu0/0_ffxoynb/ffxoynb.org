Yeah Felix is by and far broken beyond belief. A vial with about 2oz is enough to give you a perfect day. Not 8hrs or anything, a perfect day. The size of the container is crazy amounts of it. Sure overuse causes recklessness but who cares. Use felix to make a recipe that don't have that side effect. Each batch is brewed faster and easier with more common ingredients. It's a self sustaining loop of broken. Within months at the most, weeks more likely, you're a living god of luck.
