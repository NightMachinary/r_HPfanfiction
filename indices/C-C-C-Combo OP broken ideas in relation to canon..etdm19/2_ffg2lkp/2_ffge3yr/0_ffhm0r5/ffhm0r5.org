  I'm not sure if canon transfiguration is really stated to be permanent one way or the other. My headcanon is it depends on skill - 'good' transfigurations will last longer than 'bad' ones. Basically, the more flawless a transfiguration, the longer it'll last.

Hagrid's highly flawed, failed transfiguration on Dudley (pig's tail) had to be surgically removed because it didn't go away.

The Ministry of Magic (who presumably know whether transfiguration is permanent or not) also sent wizards to attempt to Untransfigure Quintapeds, a magical species said to have been transfigured from humans centuries ago, so the Ministry at least appears to believe that transfiguration is permanent.
