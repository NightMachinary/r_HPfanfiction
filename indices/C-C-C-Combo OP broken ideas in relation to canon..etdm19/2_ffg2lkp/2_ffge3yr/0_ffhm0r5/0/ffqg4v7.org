We know that some failed transfigurations can be semi-permanent, sure. Or long enough that it'd be a problem to leave Dudley in that state - obviously Hagrid's attempt didn't work out well, so it's not exactly an indication of how well transfiguration lasts in universe.

As for the Quintapeds, the story of their creation is a legend, and so it's not exactly clear what it can tell us about transfiguration in general. If we take it to be competent and knowledgeable about magic (and its capabilities), then a bunch of other worldbuilding questions pop up about transfiguration and the impact of it on the wider wizarding world.
