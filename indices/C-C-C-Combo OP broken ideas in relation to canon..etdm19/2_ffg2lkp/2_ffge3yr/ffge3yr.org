I'm not sure if canon transfiguration is really stated to be permanent one way or the other. My headcanon is it depends on skill - 'good' transfigurations will last longer than 'bad' ones. Basically, the more flawless a transfiguration, the longer it'll last.

There's some aspects to that in canon that might support it - for instance, conjuration (a subset of transfiguration) is explicitly not permanent, and bad transfigurations seem to revert on their own. But it's the type of thing where it's not stated outright either way, and people will read into it what they will. I personally think that if it's /easy/ to make transfiguration permanent (or last months/years), wizarding society seems like it'd be very different than it is.
