Yep, there is no excuse for the state of the Weasley's except for JK Rowling needed them poor for some reason.

Transfiguration and expansion charms means their house could have just as easily been a mansion.

Clothes, quills, parchment (would be solid money that's a real common spell), and most non book materials are covered with Transfiguration.

Food, hold it under preservation charms. Copy it, allowed under canon, and you only need to purchase food once a decade at most.

Transfiguration again covers housing extremely easily. Expansion charms make it even more amazing for cheap.

For an adult wizard there is little that they actually need to ever actually purchase outside a wand, potions/potion ingredients, and books. Almost everything else is a luxury good for them.

A poor magical family just makes no sense at all. Even if they are magically weak or something like that they can still do the same just in steps and slower.

They turn wood into steel within the first week of class. Poor wizards make no sense.
