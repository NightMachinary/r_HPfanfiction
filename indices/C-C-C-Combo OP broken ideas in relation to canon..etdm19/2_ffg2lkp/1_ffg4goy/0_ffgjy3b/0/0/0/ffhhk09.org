I like how it's handled in Blood Crest by Cauchy. There's thousands of existing spells, and they're all kinda fiddly and difficult to varying extents. If you don't practice them, you'll forget them - at least enough to make it hard to cast on the fly. So in actuality, most wizards only have a couple of dozen spells they use regularly
