I agree and disagree. Wizards and witches live in a post scarcity society, or at least they should, and have for a very VERY long time. The only reason I can think of for why the Weasleys would be poor by wizard standards is that they either can't or won't do certain things.

Their clothes are considered “cheap hand me downs” precisely because they have been transfigured and magically repaired so many times that they show signs of being transfigured/repaired.

Duplicating books (and other class materials), while possible, could be considered stealing, as well as (I assume) magical duplicates are A: not perfect, and B: can be detected and dispelled. Though quills, parchment, and ink aren't even on the Hogwarts equipment required list, so maybe they're an exception.

Not to mention that items that are inherently magical or are enchanted to be magical cannot be duplicated by a simple spell (or at least, you can make a physical duplicate with none of the magical properties). Otherwise, the economy would be unsustainable. I buy a top of the line racing broom, duplicate it 30 times and sell the duplicates for a fraction of the cost.

So, while the Weasleys aren't a poor family by Muggle standards - they never have to worry about basic needs like food or shelter - they can't afford to buy the latest and greatest magical nick nacks and assorted artifacts that people like the Malfoys can afford.
