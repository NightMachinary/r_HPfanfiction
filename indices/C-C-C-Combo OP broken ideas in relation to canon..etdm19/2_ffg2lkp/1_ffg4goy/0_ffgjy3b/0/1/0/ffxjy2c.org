Sadly enchanting and several mechanics were never explained at all. I agree the magicals are a post-scarcity society. Luxuries such new racing brooms, acromantula silk robes (to steal a trope), potions/ potion ingredients, knowledge (books), and specialized consumables would be the staples. It's also somewhat addressed by having a bloated inefficient government weirdly enough. It keeps many people busy and at least some form of work is provided.

The Weasely family are poor because she needed a poor family and because they were horrible with money.

They are described as having '1 galleon and 58 sickles in their vault.' Yet after winning a cool 1,000 galleons they go on vacation right away. That strikes me entirely as poor long term planning, poor judgement, and horrible financial understanding.
