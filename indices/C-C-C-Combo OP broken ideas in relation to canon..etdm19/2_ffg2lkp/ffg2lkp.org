Really? All that lecturing, preaching and general moaning about in Methods of Rationality was for nothing?

Well, Felix Felicis is the more obvious choice. Though it's extremely difficult to make and poisonous in large quantities. But what happens if two people drink it and then play a game of luck like (russian) roulette or dice or poker against each other? Who is more/ less lucky? (Yes, I know poker isn't only about "luck", I just gave it as an example.) Or for that matter will they be good at something they previously weren't? Like playing an instrument or participating in a sport like quidditch.

Just how powerful is Veritaserum? Say, you give it to someone and ask them something they can't possibly know like "What is the exact population of India?" or "What is "whirlwind" in Chinese?" or "Who will win the Quidditch league?". Would the person answer truthfully, remain silent or answer approximately or according to their own beliefs/ viewpoint?
