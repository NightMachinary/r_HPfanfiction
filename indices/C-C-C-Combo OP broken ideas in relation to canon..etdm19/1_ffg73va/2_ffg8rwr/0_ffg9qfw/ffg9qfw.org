A lot of the complicated spells have a well-defined effect that can't be used for other things that easily. That rocket spell launches an object into the air but I doubt you could adapt it into a usable precise spaceship engine.

It's the less complicated spells that still break at least one law of physics (like water out of nothing) that really have the most potential for exploits. Water out of nothing can be used for everything from supplying drinking water to providing an engine with reaction mass.
