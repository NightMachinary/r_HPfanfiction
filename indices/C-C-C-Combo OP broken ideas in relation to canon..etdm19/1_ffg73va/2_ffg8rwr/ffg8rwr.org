Read your steampunk thread and have been making a few notes. That's why the water spell was on my mind for this thread lol. Steampunk made easy, with tons of steam.

What's real interesting is the feather-light charm. It reduces weight not mass, it a goddamn gravity control spell! Also they have asecndo and descendo spells to make things raise or lower. Badass magical air ships without all the hassle of providing real lift or ballast as per physics.

Oh and can't forget the cry worthy ROCKET CHARM that and quote "rockets an object high into the air." Just canon spells as written are so broken. Wizards should have been living in space while muggles weren't out of the dark ages yet.
