Sorry if that's worded weird, I mean until someone had been at a location first they couldn't build a portkey to go there. Thus leaving room for conventional rockets still as you need to travel there first.

Travel to location Z, portkey home to location A. Make a bunch of portkeys to Z so others can follow to build portkeys there and back as well.
