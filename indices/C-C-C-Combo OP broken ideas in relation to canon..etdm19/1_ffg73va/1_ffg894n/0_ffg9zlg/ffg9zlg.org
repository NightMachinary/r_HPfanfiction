I kinda doubt portkeys would work that well. In canon it takes a short time (seconds) of spinning around to get from one end of the country to another. Hundreds of miles per second is fast, but you can go way faster if you just accelerate for a day. Constant acceleration is preferable to high but constant speed whenever you want to go really far. For 100 miles per second, one g of acceleration is preferable at about the distance to the moon which takes about half a day either way, but I'd prefer a comfortable spaceship to spinning around like crazy for multiple hours.
