For me unless it's a total AU I go with rai not raw. It keeps things from spiralling out of control as fast. Also why I support the magic makes wizards lazy theory.

Why learn the laws of aerodynamics when you can make a broom fly?

What's the point in learning how atoms heat or cool things when you can cast heating and cooling charms?

Wow, you learned material sciences to mine better and build more stable stuff. Yeah we just transfigured a stick into a perfectly decorated marble column. Which we enlarged and used magical support to ensure it won't collapse.

Cool life sciences studies you got going on there. We have crop charms to make it grow faster, healthier and easier wherever we want. Oh, we can also duplicate it as much as we want for free while keeping it edible and nutritious.

Everything muggles needed science to learn about magic users just waved a wand and made it all better. Why explore the secrets of the universe when magic makes everything you want a flick of your wand away?

Those rare few that don't fall into the laziness trap likely become unspeakables and spell researchers.
