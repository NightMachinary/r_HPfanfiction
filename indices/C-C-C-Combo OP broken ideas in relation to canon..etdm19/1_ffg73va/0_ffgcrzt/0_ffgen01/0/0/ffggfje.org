In the Septimus Heap series, which is REAL kiddy shit, it kinda implies that the use of magic predisposes a user towards laziness and madness. I like to use this as a headcanon towards wizards and witches in HP.

Some subtle psychological effect that becomes more pronounced the more you use your wand and takes an incredible sense of self and logical mind to resist.
