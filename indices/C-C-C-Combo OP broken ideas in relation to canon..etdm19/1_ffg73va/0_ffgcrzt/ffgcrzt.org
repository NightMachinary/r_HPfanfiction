I think it's funny how different authors handle the combos that OP mentioned. Some add rules to give consistency and remove broken mechanics, while others act like their characters are the first muggle raised ones to ever realize that the system could be gamed.

I'd like to see someone to try to callout Malfoy or some pureblood by saying that muggles are better because they've gone to the moon and have that completely shut down because John Anywizard enchanted a hydrogen powered rocket broom in the fifties and beat America to the moon. Not just that magic is better and apparation is capable of doing that, but that someone else already figured out how to take advantage of magic combos.
