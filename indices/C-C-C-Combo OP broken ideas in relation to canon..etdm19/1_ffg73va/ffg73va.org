That water spell. Let's say you have a bottle of water that's always full, and see just how crazy you can go from there.

Take a pump, pump water out of the bottle as fast as possible, run it through a heater and let the steam come out of a nozzle, and you have a rocket engine that doesn't need fuel.

If you know a bit about rocketry, this is a complete game changer.

Attach it to the ISS, equip it for a long duration mission, and you can fly to Mars in a few months.

If you have lots of always-full bottles with multiple tons of water per second creation rate, you can use them to power lots of large spaceships. With constant acceleration, you can get quite far. Moon in 12 hours. Mars in 3 days. Asteroid belt in 4. Jupiter in a week. you can go anywhere in the universe in about 30 years of experienced time. You could easily visit another galaxy in your lifetime.

And that's just with magic water bottles, because they break conservation of mass.
