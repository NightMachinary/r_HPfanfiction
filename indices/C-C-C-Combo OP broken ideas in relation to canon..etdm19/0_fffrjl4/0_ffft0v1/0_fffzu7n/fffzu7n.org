[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8532802/1/][Hero Harry]], the sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093738/1/Brutal-Harry][Brutal Harry]], has a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAU-13][GAU-13 30mm gatling gun]] enchanted for similar use. Cooling charms, charms to enhance durability and reduce recoil, etc. I think it even had enchanted, depleted uranium bullets? Crammed in an enchanted bag with a gunner that Harry wore on his front, to just /pour/ bullets into any enemies unfortunate to be in front of him, while he dealt with the actual casting.
