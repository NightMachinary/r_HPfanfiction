Yeah, the refilling charm as it stands makes the whole 'you can't conjure food' thing really irrelevant for someone using a dram of foresight. Buy one bag of beef jerky; feed an army. Even if it's limited to liquids, you could refill a thermos of protein shake ad infinitum. Same thing using the duplicating charm/curse Geminio.
