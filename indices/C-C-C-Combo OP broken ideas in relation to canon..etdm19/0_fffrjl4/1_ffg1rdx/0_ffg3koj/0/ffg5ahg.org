It is a toss up as Gamp's law says you can't conjure what it labels 'good food'. Sauces, wine and similar are allowed. To me that means they are conjuring food like things. It is lacking the appropriate nutrients and calories so it's not 'good food'.

So when you conjure food it's edible, and delicious, just not nutritious. At least that's my take on it.
