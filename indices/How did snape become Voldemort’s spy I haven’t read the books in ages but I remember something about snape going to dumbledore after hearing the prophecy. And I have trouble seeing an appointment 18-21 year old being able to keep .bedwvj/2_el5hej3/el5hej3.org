My assumption is that Severus was already naturally attuned to Occlumency and learned to master it before he turned in first place. My impression of his childhood is that it contained a lot of abuse and that he, over time, learned to school his emotions. We know for a fact that he lost control in anger at least once (Snape's Worst Memory), and probably other times as well. SWM in particular costed him a very dear friendship, and I can see him approach Occlumency as a means of preventing similar occurences in the future.

Then there is the matter of Severus' feelings for Lily -- a muggleborn -- at the point where he chooses to join Voldemort. I really can't see Voldemort /not/ Legilimizing recruits, and would he really let such an extensive friendship -- and likely yearning after the fallout -- just slide? My conclusion is that he had already mastered Occlumency to a point and that he decided to hide this part of him -- possibly subconsciously.

This is why I never really considered his turning without considering the matter of Occlumency, odd. And he isn't stupid, he would never return to Voldemort in first place if he wasn't confident that he could hide his turning from him.
