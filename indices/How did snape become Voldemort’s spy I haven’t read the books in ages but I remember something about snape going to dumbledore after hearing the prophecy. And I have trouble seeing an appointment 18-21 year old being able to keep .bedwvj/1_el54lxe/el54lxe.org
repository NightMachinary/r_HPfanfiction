Voldemort was good at legilimency, but Snape was better at occlumency. I don't find it hard to believe; age isn't the end all. It's like, you've got your twenty year old talented, famous superstar piano player prodigy, versus your 80 year old guitarest - or someone who doesn't play the piano at all. Just because they're older and can play a different instrument doesn't mean they won't be horrible compared to the super talented younger person!
