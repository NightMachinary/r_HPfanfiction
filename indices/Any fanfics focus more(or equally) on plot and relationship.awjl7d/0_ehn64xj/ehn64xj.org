Both the plot and Petunia/Sirius relationship are well written in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]] and its three sequels, linkffn(6919395;12569750;12713008;13143812), have a really good job in balancing plot and romance.

If you can venture into non magical sci-fi AUs, [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] has an outstanding plot and a much better Ron/Hermione romance than canon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), has a superb plot and Trio relationship, but no romance.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks]], linkffn(6092362), has an interesting plot and good Harry/Hermione romance.
