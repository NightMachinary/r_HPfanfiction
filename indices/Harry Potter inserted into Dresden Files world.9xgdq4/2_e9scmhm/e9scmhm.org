I'm a pretty avid Dresden Files fan (4 re-reads) currently on a big crossover fanfic binge, so I'm sorry to say I haven't found much, at least in the word counts I consider for reading.

I did have a lot of fun with a piece from 2013 callen /magician/ linkffn(6989216)

It has a Harry in Chicago kicking ass, becoming a mob enforcer, trading snark with Dresden, trying not to be a /total/ asshole along the way. I remember the story stopped updating just after it explained the future overarching story. sort of a shame, but it's fun right up until the big vision thing with the Gatekeeper.
