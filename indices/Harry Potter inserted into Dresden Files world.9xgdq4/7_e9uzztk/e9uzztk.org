Ice Age by Ryuugi has Harry stranded in Dresden-verse during the formation of the Nevernever. It's short, abandoned, but really interesting. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ice-age-dresden-files-harry-potter-ryuugi.351540/]]

 

There's also When He Finds Out By Uncle Stojil where Harry ends up possessing Dresden's body. linkffn(6618861)

 

Another Harry is stranded in Dresden-verse is Beyond Grave Peril by Random Shinobi. linkffn(4149894)
