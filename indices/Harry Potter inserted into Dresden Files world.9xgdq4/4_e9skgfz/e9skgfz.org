Linkffn(The Master of Death by rgm0005)

- People in Dresden-verse think that old man Harry is some sort of powerful Outsider. An Eldritch Abomination from Beyond the Outer Gates. While the first part is /technically/ true, obviously they're also very wrong. It's a pretty funny misunderstanding.

Linkffn(Magician by WiseTomato)
