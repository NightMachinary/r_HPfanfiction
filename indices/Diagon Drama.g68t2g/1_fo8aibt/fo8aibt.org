The best Diagon Valley story I know about is [[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/index/][Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. by Aaran St Vines]], except it happens in the fourth century B.C. There is some romance there, but the story is bascially PG-13, if I remember correctly. It is really lovely story (slightly too long, but that's too common problem of most fanfiction stories).
