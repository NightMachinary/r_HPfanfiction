I think self-published books (including whole fanfiction universe) are worse. My mum (now long retired) was an editor in the publishing house, so I was always interested in that, and I know that a lot of editors' was to make authors cut their works to reasonable size (e.g., [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Jules_Hetzel][Pierre-Jules Hetzel]] was known to be almost co-author of Jules Verne). Main impetus used to be cost of paper and printing, true, but side-effect was that published works from serious publishing house tend to be much better and not only because of better selection of authors.
