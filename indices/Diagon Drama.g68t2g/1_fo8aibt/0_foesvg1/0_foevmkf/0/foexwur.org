Heh. You're probably right. It makes me sad how few people appreciate good editors and editing. If you listen to the big names, it's a significant part of what makes all these books we love so much the masterpieces they are. Gaiman and Pratchett have said some really interestingly appreciative things about their editors.

But yeah, you're right, it's not just about cost - or even reading time - it's pacing and tone, character and plot (and the development and growth of both), stuff outstaying its welcome or not sticking around long enough for the needed detail, etc. Word count is way more important than most people give it credit for and I can totally wax lyrical about editing for ages if I'm allowed to (which probably explains most of this 'telling you what you probably already know as the child of an actual editor' thing I'm doing now, huh? :D) so I'll stop there and simply say that (as you might've guessed) I agree completely. :)
