Indeed. A problem with a great many published books as well, IMO. There's a very good reason most novels are 80,000-100,000words and not several million. :D

It looks good. The premise is certainly interesting, and the amusingly promotional, yet self-deprecating comment on the front page bodes well for an author not getting too full of themselves. Thanks for the rec!
