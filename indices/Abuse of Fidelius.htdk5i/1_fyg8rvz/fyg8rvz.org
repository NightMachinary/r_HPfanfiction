Premise: The Fidelius Charm can conceal a secret inside the soul of a living person, preventing anyone else from being able to learn or utilize the information unless it is shared by the Secret Keeper. Whilst the Fidelius functions, the secret cannot be discovered via independent investigation; any physical evidence of the secret becomes impossible to observe.\\
 \\
Derivative: Via magic, ideas and concepts can be corporealised, converting them from intangible, infinitely-replicable information to (at minimum) a discrete intangible/spiritual object located in a measurable point in space.\\
Proposition: 'Replicating' a concept, allowing it to exist simultaneously in both a discrete and an information form, is potentially possible.\\
Premise: Ghosts, poltergeists, dementors, and the like, are all manifested spiritual creatures; though intangible, they can nevertheless manipulate the world in various ways, via ectoplasm, telekinesis, memory-snatching, etc.\\
 \\
Premise: Numerous mythologies all around the world feature anthropomorphic personifications, representing various concepts and natural occurrences.\\
 \\
Proposition: It's not so far-fetched for the three Peverell brothers to have encountered Death.
