Plenty:

- Magicks of the Arcane linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane): how do they deal with the horcrux? Three words: Chinese Dark Lord.
- The Phoenix and the Serpent linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent): Andross Gallowbraid (although he is less of Voldemorts equal and more of a /really/ proficient magical assassin/hitman/dark wizard), has a cool back story with Moody and interesting abilities.
- The Mind Arts linkffn(The Mind Arts): not actually a dark lord/lady, but recently a new witch with both shapeshifting and metal manipulation abilities was introduced (Grindelwald straight up states she might be able to beat him in his current incarcerated state).
- The Skitterleap linkffn(The Skitterleap): Chernenko. Even a multi-team attack on him, including by Tom Riddle, can't stop him.
- The Ring of Gold linkffn(The Ring of Gold): this one's complicated and its part of the mystery of the story.
- Harry Potter and the Zodiac Charms linkffn(Harry Potter and the Zodiac Charms): several, including a pair of twins named the Stryfe brothers (Rixlis and Eris). In fact, they make Voldemort stronger here and help him.
