Linkffn(The many Harry Potters of Little Hangleton) has a Moody raised Harry. It's a series of oneshots where different Harrys end up at the Resurrection Ritual. I think Moody Harry is somewhere between Umbridge Harry and Slytherin Harry. It's also really funny and increasingly fourth wall breaking.
