I'm currently writing a 1981 based Sirius fic - it's wolfstar, though I don't know how you feel about that. Though I think arguably Remus is the love interest - Sirius is the hero. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/31035902/chapters/76667537][AO3 Dark Things are to be Loved in Secret]]

It's a WIP but it's already novel length - it'll keep you going.
