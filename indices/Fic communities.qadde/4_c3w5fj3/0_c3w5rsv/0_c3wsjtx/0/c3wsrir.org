Aha! Unfortunately not. HP's always been kind of weird for me, because it is the only fandom where I -don't- look for specific ships. I wasn't even very involved until I started writing it -- on a pure whim too.

Asking for non-ship based is probably too much, now that I'm thinking about it. Are there by any chance good ljs for Post-Hogwarts or Next-Gen, even if it is directed toward a specific ship (what's the most popular on lj)? Excluding those with primarily the trio (it seems like the glut of comms are Harry-ships).
