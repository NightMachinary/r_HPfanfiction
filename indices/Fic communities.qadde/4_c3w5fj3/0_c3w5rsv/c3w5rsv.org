I love livejournal and actually I've been REALLY wanting to find a good lj comm, but I haven't been able to find a good HP one. I lurk for other fandoms, and those tend to be primarily ship based, but I hit a problem for HP because I'm looking for non-ship based. Do you have any specific suggestions?
