I like livejournal as a writer (though I've never written only read on that site) because of the closeness of everyone. At least with the stories I've read, once you get a steady flow of readers it's like a nice system to have discussions about chapters and talk to the readers. Problem is, it's of course not completely dedicated to Harry Potter but there are a lot of groups dedicated - and you can even find a more specific group to join.
