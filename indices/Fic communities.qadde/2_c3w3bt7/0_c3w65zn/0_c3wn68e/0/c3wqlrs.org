Huh, maybe I just got used to it. HPFF, I use a different skin (the blue one. It's a lot more minimal than the default, so I like it), so that promo actually doesn't show up for me. Looks like someone edited the wrong php file :P

What I don't like about fictionalley is how they divide up the fic sections into novel, romance, humor, etc... do fics appear in multiple sections? Because they seem to be different sites. What if I want to read a novel-romance-humor story?
