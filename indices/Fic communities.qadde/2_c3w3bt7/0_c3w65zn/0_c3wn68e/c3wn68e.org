HPFF is just too confusing to me. I'd spend more time on HPFF, but for how tough it is to navigate between pages, do a search, update one's own account, etc. I visited last night and found some sort of ad for a free Kindle book. The ad appeared on /every single solitary page/. What's worse, the Kindle promotion expired days ago.
