A fan continuation of HPMOR. Finished a while back. Wwizarding society make peace with goblins, and give them back their wands. A lot of people don't like HPMOR, and while this is quite different, I can't say if its different in the ways that would make it palatable for you. IMHO it is worth it to read for chapter 14.
