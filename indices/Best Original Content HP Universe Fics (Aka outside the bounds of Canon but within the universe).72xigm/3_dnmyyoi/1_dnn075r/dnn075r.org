I tried to read this series ages back, but I remember being frustrated by it and being turned away fairly quickly from it. If I remember correctly it was mainly due to how much the story was treated with kid gloves, and how silly the writing and character personalities were. I may eventually try it again and it does technically fit the guidelines of my request though ;)
