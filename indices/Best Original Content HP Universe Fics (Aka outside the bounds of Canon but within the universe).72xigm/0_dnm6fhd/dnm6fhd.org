Damn, that last paragraph almost described the Anguis series word-for-word.

For a moment I considered giving you a synopsis but it might be better if you dive in blind. All you need to know is that the story features four OC Slytherins a year older than Harry.

Also, the author is so good, she made me read the only next-gen story I've ever read (Scorpius/Rose) Which I also recommend.
