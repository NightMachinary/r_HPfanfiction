For me, a couple of my favorites are linkffn(4068153) and linkffn(2889350).

There is a bit of romance in both of them, they take place all over the world outside of Hogwarts, and don't follow canon.

Wastelands of time is like a time loop fic like Groundhog Day, but Harry has been going back so long that he's thousands of years old and pretty crazy. Doesn't behave at all like canon Harry. Has some interesting OC worldbuilding and stuff. Takes a bit to get to the romance, it's really a side plot though. The sequel is unfinished, the author became a real writer and sort of stopped writing fanfics; he says he will finish it one day but it's been several years since an update.

Bungle in the Jungle is decent, Harry gets tired of Dumbledore and co. messing with him so he leaves Britain. Has a bunch of OC characters, some of them are pretty good IMO.
