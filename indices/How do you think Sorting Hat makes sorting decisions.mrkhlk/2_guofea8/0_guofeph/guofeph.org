*/Example one./* Salazar Slytherin hand-picked students who were resourceful, determined, had a certain disregard for the rules, who were cunning, who had true and genuine ambition, and who were pure of blood descent. By those criteria, the most Slytherin students in the castle are... the Weasley Twins. Fred and George are the */consummate/* Slytherins, the true Slytherin */ideal./* The twins absolutely embody every single trait Salazar wanted to see in his students. We see no one in the castle who was more resourceful than they were. They were more determined than almost anyone else. They were aggressive and ambitions in their determination. They knew what they wanted, and didn't let anyone stand in their way, not the faculty or the other students, not even their own mother. The showed true cunning, doing the things they did in ways it couldn't be tied back to them, tweaking the noses of the very teachers and getting away with it. They played their ambitions even father, becoming wealthy and successful businessmen, the most successful members of their family in fact. And finally, the Weasleys are absolutely an old and truly pure-blooded family. Nobody can dispute that. The twins are pure of blood on both sides of the family, back as many generations as you care to go. The twins check every single box Salazar cared about in his students, they only thing they are missing is being Parselmouths, but Salazar can't possibly have had the whole house speak his language, the gift was too rare. So if the Sorting Hat puts people in the house *most suited to their innate talents and proclivities,* the twins are 100% in the wrong house.

*/Example two./* What if the hat isn't putting people where they belong, but where it thinks they would flourish the most? Maybe it put the twins in Gryffindor to encourage their bravery and better moral nature? Well, sorry, but that doesn't work either, because Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ronald Weasley were all put in Gryffindor. If the hat was putting people in the house where they would have the best experience and live the fullest life and time at Hogwarts, Harry would have gone to Hufflepuff, Hermione would have gone to Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw, and Ron would have gone to Ravenclaw or Slytherin. The reasoning for this is simple: Harry has never struggled with bravery or honor, or needed either in his life. He gains nothing from being sorted into Gryffindor. But what /does/ Harry want? What does 11 year old Harry truly need? People he can trust, who support him unconditionally. Harry wants, more than anything else, a family. The mirror showed that. Of all the houses, only Hufflepuff would have given Harry Potter the thing he /needed/ the most as a person.

The same is true of Hermione and Ron. Hermione was picked on and belittled, she had no true friends. Like Harry, she was alone and needed support. Hermione did not need more bravery, or better habits of study. She needed people who would accept her. Hufflepuff would have given her a family; Ravenclaw would have given her peers. Likewise, Ron is defined by his /ambitions/*/./* He dreams of being everything his brothers were, as cool as Bill, as loved as Charlie, as funny as the twins, as successful as Percy. The mirror showed him his hearts desire, and it was being everything his brothers had been and more. Ron was defined by his ambitions from the very beginning. Also, Ron showed a proclivity towards complex intellectual exercises and logic from an early age: he was a skilled chess player, and this was called out repeatedly. So at least in the beginning, Ron was not quite as stupid as he seemed. Slytherin would have served to help him further his own ambitions for success, giving him the tools to rise above his brothers and be noticed for his own merits, and Ravenclaw would have nurtured that burgeoning cleverness before it fell fallow.

So if the Sorting Hat puts people in the house *that is best for their own needs and personal development and maturity*, then Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all in the wrong house.

*/Example three./* Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter. And here is where I make my argument that the Sorting Hat's choices are truly arbitrary and based on nothing more than whimsy. Because canonically, Draco embodies /none/ of the traits sought out by /any/ of the Founders. He is not cunning, and never has been: his attacks and bullying are blatant and in the open. He is not intelligent: to the best of our knowledge, he is an average student in all respects. He is visibly inferior in practical magic. His best subject is potions, but that seems entirely due to favoritism, not intelligence or talent: Hermione was doing more complex potioneering in her second year in an out-of-order toilet than Draco could manage in his 6th year. Draco is not particularly loyal, disdains hard work, and family means little to him. His only redeeming qualities are his willingness to rush face-first into things he sees as a problem, and his own blood purity. But without other qualities that Godric and Salazar both wanted, those aren't virtues.

*So why was Draco Malfoy put in Slytherin, the house that, by all accounts, seems to ask the most of the people who attend it, that has the highest standards of all, at least on paper?*

The answer, to me, seems pretty simple. The hat knew good and well that if Draco Malfoy wasn't sorted into Slytherin, he would throw a massive tantrum about it and demand that his father, who was on the Board of Governors for the school, come down and "fix" his sorting. And then the hat would have to sit on a shelf in Dumbledore's office and listen to Lucius bitch and Draco tantrum about having him re-sorted or re-assigned. And maybe Dumbledore would eventually give them what they want, or maybe Dumbledore wouldn't, but one thing the hat knew for sure is that he didn't want to have to sit there and listen to that two and a half hour long argument.

So without even /looking/ at Draco's mind, without even /considering/ him, the hat /immediately and instantaneously sorted him into Slytherin./ The reason: to shut him and his father the fuck up. It doesn't matter where he goes, just send him where he wants to be. It's less drama.

And funnily enough... that's exactly why Harry got sorted into Gryffindor. An 11 year old, who is most certainly /not/ prepared to make a decision about who his friends and family should be for the next decade of his life, /asked/ the hat to not put him in Slytherin... and the hat gave him what he wanted, too, just like he gave Draco what he wanted. The hat deferred the decision to the child, who couldn't possibly have known where he ought to be any better than a dice roll would have.

*/And this is why I know, with absolute certainty, that the hat's sorting methods are completely arbitrary, and don't hinge on anything at all besides the whims of the hat. The twins, Harry, Ron, and Hermione all prove that people aren't being sorted to the place that suits their talents OR the house that would nurture them the best. But Draco and Harry together prove what the hat is 'really' doing. Namely, whatever the hell it feels like. It's a sentient magical artifact made by four willful and opiniated geniuses smashing their minds together. And it hates the system it exists to perpetuate, and thinks the houses as a whole are a mistake that is dividing the magical community outside the walls of the school. So why the hell would it be making any other kinds of decisions, save arbitrary ones? I'd imagine it wouldn't sort anybody at all, if it had any real choice in the matter./*
