I think it's decisions are entirely, 100% arbitrary. And I will list five reasons why I believe that to be true.

1.) The system doesn't need to exist anymore, it's a legacy for the sake of tradition. The hat knows this, and even loudly advocates for the divisive traditions to be abandoned in favor of "inter-house unity." The hat is actively preaching against the very system it exists to enforce. Why would it do this if the houses actually mattered?

2.) 11 is too young to determine a child's personality, talents, life goals, or ambitions. An 11 year old Harry put into Hufflepuff would have more friends and emotional support, an 11 year old Harry put into Ravenclaw would study more. The houses are a self-fulfilling prophecy of stereotypes, and the hat would know this.

3.) The Founders themselves weren't choosing people that young. They were "sorting" apprentices who were, at the very least, already teenagers or young adults. We have indirect proof that this is true: the Founders were interested in traits that children only start to display after they begin turning into young adults. Dumbledore has said several times throughout the series: they sort students */too early./* The hat would know this as well.

4.) The Founders also were largely arbitrary in their selections, preferring students that would be easy to teach, who were already inclined to think in similar ways to themselves. The only person who truly sorted his group aggressively was Slytherin, and even then, his great point of contention was that he didn't trust muggleborns because he believed they would betray and destroy Hogwarts. His most important criteria was political, not academic.

5.) If people were actually sorted by their innate traits, or where they would do the best and flourish the most, almost everyone we know is in the wrong house. Which means the Sorting Hat can't possibly be sorting people to where they will actually "fit in the best." Consider the following three examples. They're going to be long, but stick with me here, there's a reason I'm going into depth about it. I'm actually going to post it as a reply to myself, because it's too long to fit in one post.
