In my opinion, the Sorting Hat looks into 3 things:

- In what House the student would would fit the most
- In what House the student would grow the most
- In what House the student wants to go the most

As for ranking, I don't think the Hat has a clear one, but he rather functions on a case by case basis.

Harry was sent in Gryffindor because, as seen in CoS, that's the perfect House for him, and he is pretty much a poster boy for the House. Yet, the Hat still proposed to send him to Slytherin, because "it would help him on the way to greatness", the Hat thought he should go in Slytherin (either to learn something about ambition/cunning or because of the Scarcrux influence), but he in the end he abided by Harry's choice.

In comparaison, Neville (or rather early Neville) is a terrible Gryffindor. He doesn't have any talent, he is shy as well as cowardly, he is pretty much a poster boy for the Hufflepuff (and not the hardworking ones, the "leftovers ones"). But, by the end of PS, Neville show some hint of courage, which grow up to the point of even taking out Gryffindor's sword by DH. Gryffindor may not have been the most confortable House for Neville, but it's the one that brought out the best out of him.

And sometimes, the Hat send people where they want to go, even if it would not really benefit them. Outside of being bully and bigot, I don't see any of Slytherin qualities in Crabbe and Goyle, and yet they still went in that House. Probably because they had been brainwashed into thinking it was the best House ever and they had no other choice but to go there.\\
In a lesser measure, I think the same thing happened to Zacharias Smith. I can't seem him as loyal, or hardworking, but he went to Hufflepuff because "he is related to Hufflepuff herself and it must be the family House" (either that or there is some truth into Hufflepuff taking the leftovers).

So, in my opinion, while there is no clear ranking between a student "confort" and "needs", a student desire is the most important factor. I think a student can go anywhere, as long as he wishes it hard enough (some extreme case like Riddle would not to basically hypnotise themselve to not go in their initial House, but it would be technically possible).
