To be honest I don't see the point of sorting 11 year old children. You can't possibly define a child's personality and traits at that age. Who you are is based on your life experience so you can't expect an 11 year old to stay the way they are their whole life. Im sure if they re-sorted the students at the end of their Hogwarts years a lot of them would end up in different house.

So I don't really understand what the sorting hat relies on to sort them, plus it always kind of ends up separating them in even numbers ? It also sometimes takes choices into consideration, and somehow manages to not put muggleborns in Slytherin. And let's not even discuss how people can be brave AND ambitious AND seek knowledge AND be hard working at the same time.

Im trying to keep my comment brief to not seem biased against the whole "let's sort students and separate them but then seem disappointed when they end up making pointless rivalries and being prejudiced against each other" , but to me there just isn't some logic way the sorting hat works, well I guess magic isn't that logical when you come to think of it so let's just say it uses magic and leave it at that ðŸ˜‚.
