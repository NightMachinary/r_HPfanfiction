Malfoy finds out about the fake fourth school that Barty added when he confused the goblet. Malfoy has an older student put in his name as champion of the fourth school. The goblet decides that Malfoy is a worthier champion than Harry. Now Barty tries to cover his fuck up by giving Draco polyjuce potion to look like Harry before he enters the maze. Voldemort thinking that Draco is Harry, uses his blood to regenerate but since Draco is not an enemy, Voldemort comes out of the cauldron in the body of a ferret. Also Harry distributes "Malfoy stinks" badges.
