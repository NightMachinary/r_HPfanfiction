Blacks are insane, due to inbreeding. Gaunts are freaks, due to inbreeding. Weasleys are soulless gingers, due to inbreeding. Potters have untameable hair, due to inbreeding. Filch is a squib, due to inbreeding. Albus is gay, due to inbreeding. Draco is a hairless ferret, due to inbreeding. Joane kelly is a croaky voiced goddess, due to inbreeding. Tonks is clumsy, due to inbreeding.

You could take every little element in series and explain it away due to pureblood marriage practices.

If genetics didn't work, no one would be born for a zygote wouldn't be formed by two haploid gametes fusing. Magic MIGHT have some way of countering some issues but genetics still take place, otherwise they'd all look like freakangels most likely instead of harry looking lile his parents and ron being soulless.
