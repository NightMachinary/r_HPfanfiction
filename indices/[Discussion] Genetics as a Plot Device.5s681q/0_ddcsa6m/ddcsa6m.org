My head canon has always said inheritance has magical aspects. Ever wonder why Draco and Harry look like clones of their fathers? In my mind magic responds to the subconscious wishes of the parents. Perhaps squibs or ugliness is a reflection on the relationship between the parents more than anything. Prominent family traits dominate in the wizarding world, people can work out which family you're from just by your appearance, I'm no genetics expert but I'd have thought there would be more variation.
