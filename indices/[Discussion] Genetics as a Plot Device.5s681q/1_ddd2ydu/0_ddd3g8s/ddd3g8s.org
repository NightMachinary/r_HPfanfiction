It makes sense from a certain standpoint. Let's look at Hagrid. While woefully uneducated, he is perfectly capable of doing magic. Maybe not to the extent as others, but he is decent enough given his education. He also is massive, strong enough to wrestle giants, and is spell resistant close to on par with other giants. Maybe what happens is that the more mangled the DNA is from inbreeding, the more magic is required to correct for it. Magically, the pure bloods are all stronger than Muggleborns, but are limited by the damage to their bodies from interbreeding. So when half-bloods like Riddle pop up, they are ridiculously powerful, because their magic was developed to superhuman levels, but their magic didn't have to correct for nearly as much. Though, maybe it isn't 100% of optimal traits passed along. Maybe more like 75%, making the pure blood obsession make sense, but continual breeding with muggleborns will dilute the magical traits.
