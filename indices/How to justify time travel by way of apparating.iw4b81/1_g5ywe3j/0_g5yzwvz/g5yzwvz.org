You make a good point but we don't really know the effect of the dark mark in the death eater scenario. It could be acting like a magical homing beacon, or even just provides a mental image to them of where Voldemort is for them to find him. For your second point about using their knowledge of where they are going by using maps has the problem that if you don't know the place intimately you could end up inhabiting a space already occupied by an obstacle ie a tree, wall hell even a hill. I could imagine such an incident would be like hitting a solid wall at very high speed except if they apparted to the interior of an object it would be like spontaneously exploding from the inside as space they are currently in is already occupied by other matter. I personally don't think a name of a place and it's general location is enough mainly because when ever you think of a destination you don't just picture that place by its name but by what you expect to see. Think about your home, the first thing at probably comes to mind is your house or apartment and it's surroundings not nots it's name. Still thank you for your input it is very much appreciated
