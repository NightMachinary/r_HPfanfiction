Technically the method is to "focus on the destination". Given that we have seen people apparate to places they have not visited before (e.g. Death Eaters to Little Hangleton Graveyard), personally I doubt that "focus" means "visualise". Rather I think it's enough to focus on the name of the place, or your knowledge of where it is (e.g. its position on a map), or indeed any given symbol of that location.
