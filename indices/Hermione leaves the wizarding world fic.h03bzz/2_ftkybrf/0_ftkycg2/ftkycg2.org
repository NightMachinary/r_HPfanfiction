  Today 22nd of March 2015 at ten am broomstick flyer, who was a wonderful woman who was loved by so many people, passed away peacefully surrounded by her family. As a sign of the respect I had for her writing talent I intend to open a new folder in which I will post the several stories she was working on. Anyone who wishes to take up her ideas is welcome to do so, just ackowledge
