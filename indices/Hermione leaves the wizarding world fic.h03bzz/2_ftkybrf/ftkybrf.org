There's also a drabble/short in a collection by broomstick flyer that has hermione being magical but choosing not to go to Hogwarts. A different story has Hermione's cousin pretending to be her so when Mcgonagall checks "she" has no magic. They then talk about how it must be some con job which is why she doesn't obliviate them. The collection is called Broomsticks Last Works, Uncompleted.
