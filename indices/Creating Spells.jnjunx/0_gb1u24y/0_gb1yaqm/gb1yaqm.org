I thought about such a spell, but I felt it was too sciencey for wizards. I figure they just make a spell that turned sand to glass instantly. I felt that fit with the pin cushion into a hedgehog spell more then heating up the glass then shaping it.

Do you know any good online latin to english dictionary? Or just googling it be good enough?
