Ive been reading it since i was 15 or 16(23 now). I was so excited when i discovered fanfiction even existed lol. I use to print a bunch of it off at school to read at home cuz my dad was a huge control freak and wasnt allowed to get on our computer at home. I usually just read on my phone now or my computer. Yay! for being an adult and having my own computer/ phone to look at whatever i want. :) that just so happens to be fanfiction lol. kinda nerdy but im cool with it.
