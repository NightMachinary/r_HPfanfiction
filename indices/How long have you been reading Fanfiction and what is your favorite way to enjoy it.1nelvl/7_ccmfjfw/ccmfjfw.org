I've been reading HP fanfiction for 7 years now, which seems crazy. I was writing fanfiction before I knew what it was called.

Before I had a laptop, I would cut and paste them onto a word doc and print them out 16 sheets to a page. I still have a binder full of them somewhere in my parent's house. Good times.

Now my favorite way to enjoy a good fanfic is when I'm supposed to be doing something else. I've been known to tear through 250k words in one sitting.
