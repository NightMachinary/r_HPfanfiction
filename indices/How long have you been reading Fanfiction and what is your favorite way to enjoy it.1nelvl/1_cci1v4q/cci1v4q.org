I've been reading since I was 13 or 14 (21 now). My mom use to get mad at me because we didn't have DSL and I'd tie up the phone line reading fic all day in the summer and on weekends haha. Now, my favorite way to enjoy it is to make myself comfy on rainy days and read to my little heart's content. I read it on my phone when I can't fall asleep too.
