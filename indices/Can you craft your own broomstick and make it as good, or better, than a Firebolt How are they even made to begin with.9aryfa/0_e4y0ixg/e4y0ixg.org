My headcanon is that with precise enchantments like those on a broomstick, you really need to specialise to eke out the best quality you can. I think Dumbledore could make a halfway decent broom if he wanted, but it would take him quite some time and many failed attempts to work out how to make something like a Firebolt.

Here is my take on broom construction:

There are a number of charms and enchantments used on a broom. We know some of these from canon (cushioning, Horton-Keitch braking charm, etc). Layering multiple enchantments within a single object is a tricky business, and is half the battle of broom construction. If you take Arithmancy to be used in spell creation, then it could be important for both spell improvement and for making the layers of spellwork stable when used together. These aspects are still very important even if you don't think arithmancy is related. Another tricky aspect is quality control. You must know the spellwork inside and out to be able to get such consistent results. The materials also have to be consistent.

How they are made. I suspect the process includes some or all of the following, and maybe other things:

- Individual spellwork on each tail twig
- Soaking the materials in potions
- Seeking out and correctly preparing high quality wood
- Casting a number of charms in a specific way so that they work together and stay stable
- If you're into runes, they probably have those and all
