  Can a wizard as talented as Dumbledore make a broomstick that's even better than a Firebolt?
#+end_quote

I would say no. Dumbledore was (probably) the greatest Wizard alive /overall/. But he's not the greatest in every aspect. Snape is better with potions. I think it's said that Voldemort is better at legilimency. Seeing as seers exist and he's not one, he's not the best at divination. Etc.

Maybe he could make a better broom if he spent several years learning, practicing, then experimenting and pushing the boundaries of broomstick crafting.

  I've seen lots of them use Arithmancy, what are the most creative ways you've seen characters make their own flying broom?
#+end_quote

There was one fic where, after the war, Hermione made a broom for Harry. It was supposed to be some grand gesture I think, I can't really remember the details. Anyway, it was actually a broom/wand hybrid. She used wand-making techniques - primarily by including a wand core. Seeing as the broom was for Harry, it was made from holly and had a phoenix feather within it.
