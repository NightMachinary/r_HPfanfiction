That certainly is good to know. I confess that I did go and look at the final line (and I normally /never/ skip ahead) because I was so intrigued. I agree that it is a bit, I guess... immature? Unnecessary? Clearly the author /hated/ the epilogue and wanted to "fix it," which is fine. I like Harry/Ginny and I liked the epilogue, but I can certainly understand why many do not and I've read plenty of fanfics by authors who want different endings. I just don't think the anger that I believe motivated this author is really necessary.

But anyway, I have a bit of a guilty fondness for powerful!Harry so I will definitely give this one a shot, especially since as you said romance is not a big factor.
