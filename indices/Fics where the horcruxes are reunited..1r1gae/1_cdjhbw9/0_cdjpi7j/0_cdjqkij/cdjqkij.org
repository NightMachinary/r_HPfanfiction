Actually, there really wasn't that much dating/romance (and absolutely no slash) in it at all. I think the author just put it up as a cautionary and forgot about removing it when it didn't pan out that way. Nothing major involving harry in a relationship but that fabled last sentence of the epilogue, summing up his future and tossing in marrying someone for apparently no reason (Since him and the person barely spoke to each other during the whole fic)
