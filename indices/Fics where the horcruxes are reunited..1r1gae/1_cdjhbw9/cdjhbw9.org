[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2772010/]["The Power" by Darth Bill]] I'd say /sort/ of counts, though the method leaves that up for debate.

Fairly good fic too, though the ...I suppose satire of it? comes off a little strong at times and the epilogue was vastly disappointing, especially the last sentence before "The End." Still I'd say it's well worth the read overall.
