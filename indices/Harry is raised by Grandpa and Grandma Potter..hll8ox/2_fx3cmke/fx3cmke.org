This could make an interesting twist to a WBWL fic. Harry gets sent off to live with his grandparents for some reason while the twin gets brought up by the parents. There would still be some resentment for being abandoned, but since his grandparents are presumably nice and decent caretakers, it wouldn't be as extreme.
