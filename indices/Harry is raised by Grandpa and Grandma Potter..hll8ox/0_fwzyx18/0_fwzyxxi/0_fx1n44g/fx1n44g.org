Thank you I will give it a read. I was thinking more Dumbledore leaving Harry with Lily's parents, not keeping track of them, and Harry ending up with the Dursleys. Maybe after Lily got married she helped her parents move out of Cokeworth and into the house at Number 4 Privet Drive. And shortly after the Potters either died or went into hiding the Dursley's moved in and took over.
