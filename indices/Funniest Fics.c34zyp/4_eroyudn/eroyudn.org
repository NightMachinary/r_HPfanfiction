I think I got the most laughs out of the Make a Wish series starting with linkffn(2318355), with more by that author and other connected works starring the same main character like linkffn(11965672), in which Harry Potter decides to live before he dies and goes on vacation, and why are all these bad guys dying around him by coincidence and why does everyone think it's him? He amasses more and more power and skills, items and knowledge often by coincidence and happenstance until the name Mr Black is known and feared by criminals far and wide.

That and linkffn(8551180) In the Mind Of A Scientist, a Sg1/Harry Potter series played for laughs wherein Harry Potter is a mad scientist.
