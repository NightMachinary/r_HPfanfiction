I rather liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3022004/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Freak-Parade][Harry Potter and the Freak Parade]] - linkffn(3022004)

It's quite cracky, admittedly, but I remember being quite amused by most of the stuff happening and it has a quite nice feeling to it. Besides, it's not overly long, so nice for reading in between. :)
