if you are a DnD fan, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) has a bunch of good laughs.

linkffn(Harry Potter Lord of the Swamp) was too short but also really funny.

linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff) is often recommended as well. It's a lazy!Harry

linkffn(far too many time travelers) is also pretty hilarious.
