linkffn(Weeb by Andrius) is my most recent favorite. It has a Seventh Horcrux vibe, light and silly. The anime part is only limited to a few dozen references, if you dont like that sort of thing (I don't). I wouldn't say I laughed out loud constantly, but I always read it with a smile on my face, plus there are a few hilarious scenes. And the ending is very satisfying.
