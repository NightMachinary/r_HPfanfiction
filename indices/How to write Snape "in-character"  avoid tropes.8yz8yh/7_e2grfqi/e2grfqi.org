Snape is not a silky smooth mystery man like the movies portray him, unless you're going for movie version but let's assume you mean books. Many seem to ignore the fact that he has sallow skin and greasy hair. He also has a large hooked nose and resembles an overgrown bat. Severus Snape is stubborn, aggressive, and very sarcastic. Avoid describing his voice as silky or smooth or whatever. His voice is oily if anything. Like he really is depicted in the books as a horrible character only redeemed by DH. TBH if you're going to write him into any romance that doesn't involve some seriously problematic things, it's best to go for movie Snape who is a much more sympathetic character.
