Also a few other tips.

- He hates everyone but his own house

- He despises Sirius Black with a burning passion and was barely willing to let him live, even if he was innocent

- He holds on to the past much too tightly

- He yells. A lot. Especially at Harry and the Gryffindors (Usually when Hermione asks too many questions and when Harry and Neville exist in close proximity to him for any amount of time)

- He is biased for his own house like nothing else. He will cheat, lie and bully to try to ensure his own house ends up ahead, including letting Slytherins attack Gryffindor quidditch players in the halls.
