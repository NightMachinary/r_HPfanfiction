What a great question! Kudos for attempting to write Snape as IC as possible. He's not difficult to write, but very difficult to write /well./ If you write a snarky, vindictive character, he will quickly feel like Snape, but all his nuances are a lot harder to get right. It's easy to make him either too good or too evil, depending on how much of a fan you are of him.

I think an important thing to keep in mind when writing Snape is that he comes from a working class background. I often see him written like Lucius, using long words and impeccable manners, but in reality he's more like Filch. Depending on the story you have in mind, you probably could write him as someone who wants to break free of his past by adopting higher class behaviour, but even then he would make mistakes and revert to his working class ways when he's emotional, for example.

A second thing is that he's socially awkward, and very much so. Fandom seems to have made him into someone with a keen insight into other people's motivations and a great understanding of emotions, but that's not really who he is. I've never seen anyone else mention this before, but I personally think of Snape as autistic and would love to see him written like that more often. I think he's not only mean and paranoid because of his past, but also because he genuinely doesn't understand other people's behaviour and has become suspicious of everyone as a result. A Snape like that is not very attractive, but then again, he never was.

Last, Snape in the book has a sense of mystery, because we're never quite sure what side he's on and what his motivations are until the end. I love it when fics retain that mystery and a lot of my favourite ones do, though it's not at all easy.

I've personally made all these mistakes when I was writing Snape, so I'm happy to share what I've learned. Hope it helps!
