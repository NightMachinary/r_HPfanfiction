I don't know, I think there's some room for interpretation here. I mean, we know he's extra shitty to Harry and his friends, ergo he has to be /less/ shitty to everybody else.

I feel like sometimes people overcompensate, especially when it comes to Snape's teaching. He may be a huge asshole, but there's not a lot to suggest he's not generally an effective teacher.
