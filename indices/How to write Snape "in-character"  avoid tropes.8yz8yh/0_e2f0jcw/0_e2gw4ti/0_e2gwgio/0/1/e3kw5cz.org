That's like a lot of professors at my university. They are all very smart and clearly know what they are doing in their field but many of them are not good teachers. I'm fairly sure they are only at the university to do research and teach because its required in their contract. They put a premade slideshow on the board and read it to us word for word and are horrible at answering questions. They often seem incapable of understanding why we don't just "get it". Not all my processors are like that, some are very good teachers and clearly enjoy teaching but the rest are just bad.
