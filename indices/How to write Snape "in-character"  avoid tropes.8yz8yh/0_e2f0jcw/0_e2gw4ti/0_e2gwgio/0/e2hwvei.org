After several years of college, Snape strikes me as a fantasy version of the tenured PhD professor who's an absolute /genius/ in his field and is basically impossible to oust from his position for what he brings to the institution (research money in the real world, spy in HP) but /awful/ at actually teaching his subject to others because he understands everything so intuitively and thoroughly that he can't really comprehend someone needing more than what he provides in lecture and homework.

With an extra dash of asshole because this is still a fantasy story and he's still an antagonist until basically the very end.
