Generally he's an alright teacher, but we saw marked improvement with Slughorn's style. Notably, we never see anyone improve at potions - those that are good are good and those that are bad remain bad.

The way he erased Harry's potions in the fifth book but left Crabbe and Goyle's also speaks of poor teaching as a teacher. It has been my opinion for years that Snape would have been better as, say, Madame Pomfrey's personal potioneer and someone else teaches the class because Snape's good at his subject but a poor teacher.

Sort of like Hagrid (except Hagrid's problem comes down to people being too soft to critique him and those that do act like asses so no one listens).
