Just remember, despite wanting to protect Harry because, ya know, he's an absolute asshole to everyone, but especially towards Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville.

While it's tempting to just write him as a stern teacher - partially because that's how he's portrayed more as in the movies - Snape is actually a bully and a garbage person. He's very brave - close to fearless really - and extremely smart, but he's garbage.
