I haven't written a lot of Snape (he doesn't exist in the AU fanfic I'm writing... his female counterpart does, but she supposedly died before the story started) but one thing I think might be a good thing to keep in mind with Snape is that his biggest emotion, the one that controls or at least influences all his actions, is BITTERNESS.

While Alan Rickman's Snape isn't exactly the same character as the Snape in the books... too calm and collected... there is one scene in the last movie that REALLY sums up Snape as a character for me: The scene where he finds Lily's dead body and grieves over her. If you look at that scene, you might notice how he's cradling Lily while Baby Harry is crying in the background... and Snape completely ignores the crying baby, because he can only focus on Lily.

And THAT'S Snape. He doesn't see what's THERE, he just sees what ISN'T there. He can't let go of the past, and he can't ever truly appreciate what he has because he's too focused on what he DOESN'T have... what he lost, what he never had in the first place. And so he's a man consumed by his bitterness, a man who finds it easier to just loathe the world in general than to give it a chance. He's immature and petty, and probably takes some twisted joy in spreading his own misery to a world that in his eyes doesn't deserve any better -- a world that in his eyes took everything away from him.

Except of course the world DIDN'T take away everything. He still had quite a bit, except once again he never could appreciate what he had because he was too focused on what he DIDN'T have. In my eyes, Snape's the most tragic and pitiful character in the franchise. He had an awful life, and he let it destroy him.
