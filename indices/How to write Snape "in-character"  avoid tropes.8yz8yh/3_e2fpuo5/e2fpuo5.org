Please no Snape in velvet robes playing piano by the fireplace, or MotherGoose!Snape. Don't overdo it in the other direction and have Snape publicly whipping students and copulating with corpses either. And remember that he's pretty young in all of this. Still in high school when he joins the Death Eaters, in his early 20's by the time the main events have happened, and only 31 when the books start. Dead before 40. McGonagall has a good 30 years on him and they're not going to sit there like two old crones, she would look at him and see a little boy probably. Pretty much most of the staff are older than him, too.

Positives: Remember that he is bright and inventive. Probably constantly inventing new spells or working on weird dark magic in his spare time, not just hunching over cauldrons. He is very intelligent, knowledgeable, perceptive and eloquent. There is very likely an entire academic/creative side to him that we don't see, and a frustrating career that's punching below his weight, kind of like Walter White stuck teaching Chemistry to teenage morons when he could have been a billionaire. He is unflinching under tremendous pressure and even spilling his sarcastic personality in the presence of Voldemort. He's not afraid to stand up to both of his bosses. He also has a quick wit and a sense of humour, so he'd constantly have biting remarks and witty comebacks in every conversation, but they'd be very dark, rude and morbid. He also somehow manages to do lesson prep, teach, do homework and administrative duties, sort out teenage drama, and at the same time attend Death Eater meetings, possibly endure torture, possibly socialise with Death Eaters, report with the Order, and spare some time for banter. And it looks like it's all on a couple hours of sleep each day because he's stalking the halls all night too. So, very busy.

Negatives: He is a horrible teacher. Mr. Garrison from South Park-level horrible. He plays favourites and doesn't hide it. He's not physically sadistic to the students, but he does enjoy bullying them and having them do disgusting detentions. Less Filch and Umbridge and more guts and pus. He will probably have every bad habit from every poor people of reddit thread ever, and his hygiene and sense of style are lacking. He would not have silk ribbons for his luscious hair or silver cuff links with emeralds on them. He is very immature, almost like an overgrown teenager, takes everything very personally and would bully a teenage girl over her teeth. I also think that because of his rough background and this being the 90's, he'd not be reporting and coddling abused students and having the entire body of staff baby them. I think there is nothing parental in him, he is very closed off, almost too traumatised to function like a normal person. He treats teenagers like his peers instead of being a mature adult. If there's any situation like that he would likely be very private, discreet, very direct and pretty distant. He also has a fascination with the morbid, that is not necessarily sadistic in nature, but he's probably reading about deathy creepy things in his spare time. I also think he's bordering on incel/forever alone, but perhaps only in his head and not outwardly. He seems very polite to Narcissa. If you include relationships they would have to be even more dysfunctional than his professional life, maybe with occasional emotional outbursts just like his dad.

Speech: Snape has a pretty broad vocabulary, but he comes from a very rough, lower-class background. I imagine, growing up in Slytherin, he would have tried to emulate his wealthier classmates, but he still constantly makes slips in his accent, word choice and manners, especially when he's angry. He calls people "smelly" all the time. Look at snippets from the documentary "7 up" to see the very distinct difference in how children speak when they're the same age, but of different backgrounds. The wealthiest children talk like ponces even when they're seven. Well, Gordon Ramsay is also a northern Englishman and extremely aggressive. Imagine if he was also clinically depressed and somehow even more dickish and you get Snape.
