Well, in the fanfictions I have read so far, I see a lot of the time Snape is always using big words and talking without using contractions, BUT I am reading through the books again and Snape is like always using contractions and also not too many big words. So yes please don't make Snape not use contractions and do not try to make him use lots of big words. He does prefer snappy simple words when he is being mean to people.
