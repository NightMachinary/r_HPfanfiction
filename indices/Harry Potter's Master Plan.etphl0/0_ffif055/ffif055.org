  Invite Hermione to the Slug Club Christmas Party to get Ron & Ginny jealous
#+end_quote

Problem:

Ginny was already a slug club member and didn't need Harry's invitation.

Similarly, Hermione was one too and didn't need his invitation.

--------------

In canon, Ginny invited Dean Thomas and was happy when Harry brought Luna along.

On the other hand, *Hermione purposely invited the git Cormac McClaggen just to make Ron jealous!*
