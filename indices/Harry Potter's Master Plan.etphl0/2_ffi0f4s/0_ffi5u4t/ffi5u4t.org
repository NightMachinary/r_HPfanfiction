I do like the idea of them assuming Ron will be jealous, but him turning out to be incredibly supportive of their relationship - covering for them when they need him to, making jokes about finding them a broom closet, etc - and them just being wholly nonplussed by it in that 'what the heck do we do now? move to plan B, move to plan B!!!' sort of way.
