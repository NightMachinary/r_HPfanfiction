And I don't know why you're being so aggressive, It's not like I asked for a Ron-bashing fic (god knows there's enough of them), I imagined it as being like a romantic comedy.

It can totally be like Avalon1632 suggested it with Ron actually being super supportive of their fake relationship and Harry and Hermione not knowing what to do about it because they had planned for him to get jealous.
