At the start of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water by Starfox5), the three are in a reverse-harem of sorts. Basically, there was a period during the war against Voldemort when it was the three against the world, and it just happened. IIRC, there are some flashbacks showing the relationship developing, but it's not the focus of the fic, except to the extent that the three living together is considered scandalous.
