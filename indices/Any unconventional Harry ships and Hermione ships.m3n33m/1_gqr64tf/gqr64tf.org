I've always been surprised by the lack of Harry/Parvati fics, given that they went to the Yule Ball together. This one is really sweet:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7613224][*we were in screaming colour*]] *by aceofdiamonds:* Lavender and Ron's relationship has a knock-on effect. “Lavender feels I haven't been spending enough time with her,” and then she tilts her head over to their best friends look as though they're struggling to breathe. Parvati's kissed a couple of people, she's not sure it's supposed to be quite like that, at least not at half eight in the morning. But she's not judging; she's being a good friend. Harry laughs. Parvati gets a sharp kick to the shin at that. Lavender's always been good at multi-tasking. “I hope you feel ashamed.”
