The stories focus more on the action and plot, rather than the character development. I think the series has aged quite well as compared to many of its peers from that era. I haven't read much truly evil/demon/douchebag Harry, so I do appreciate the change of character considerably more than others might. I'm used to reading stories where Harry either improves his attitude, is good from the start, or adequately justifies himself and his actions.
