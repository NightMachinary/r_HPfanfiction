I agree, I guess it's because I've read so many stories of Harry improving or his coming of age stories that it's just what I prefer. I like a feel good, better at the end of the day story, so I guess the Denarian trilogy is just a twist in and of itself. Not really my thing though but I would have pushed through and skipped around if there was significant character development.

I just feel bad for Amanda because at this rate it seems like there will never be a romantic plot or something.
