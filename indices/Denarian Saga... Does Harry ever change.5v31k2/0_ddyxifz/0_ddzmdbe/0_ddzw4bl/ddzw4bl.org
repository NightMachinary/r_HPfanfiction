True, I'll certainly concede that. Overall, however, he still is somewhat immature and something of a jerk, but it never really detracted from the story for me. I'll trade obnoxiousness for Shezza badassery most any day.

It is in no way my intention to imply that the Denarian Series, especially the first one, are not an excellent pieces of work. I'd still give it a 4 and some out of 5, and gave it a 5/5 when it first came out.

OP, the Amanda storyline starts to pick up after the first book, and was certainly intended as a romance subplot of some sort, but I can't recall for the life of me if anything ever came of it. I have this thing about skipping parts of romance in fanfiction.
