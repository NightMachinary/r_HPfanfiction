Except BOTH Harry's and Ron's laziness is a pure fanon. Yes, they were more lazy than Hermione, but everybody was. Looking at their OWL's (remember, number of OWL's achieved counts number of exams you PASSED, even A would be good), they were quite successful and dedicated students. Yes, perhaps they were nagged to it by Hermione, but nowhere in canon it says they were unsuccessful or average students comparing to the rest of Hogwarts, not only to Hermione.
