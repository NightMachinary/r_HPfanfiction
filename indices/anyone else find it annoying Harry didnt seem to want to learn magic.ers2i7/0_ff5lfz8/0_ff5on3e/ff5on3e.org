Yes, but I think most people would learn a lot of extracurricular spells, even if it was just household stuff. Because at the end of the day, waving your wand around is still much faster and easy than using a duster or a broom. Or the spell to fold clothing. Or animating stuff to automate your kitchen tools.

And that's not even mentioning spells you learn for fun.
