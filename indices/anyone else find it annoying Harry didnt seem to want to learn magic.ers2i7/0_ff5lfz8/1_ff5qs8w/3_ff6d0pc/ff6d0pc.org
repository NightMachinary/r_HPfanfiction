That's what they said - Harry was excited at first but then realized it took hard work to learn such stuff and it would get boring after a while anyway.

You could pretty much say the same thing about any skill - wouldn't learning a new language, learning how to ride a horse, being able to do a split, lift twice your own body weight, run a marathon,... be awesome? But do all people do those things? No, because while doing them is pretty neat, most don't want to put in the hard work it takes to get there.
