I would have read all my books and I would be very excited, like Harry was. I would dream of being the greatest wizard ever, of changing the world. Then I would discover it was hard work and I wouldn't be able to do anything exciting for years. Then I would get used to being around magic and like anyone else I'd start to grumble about other things like homework, getting up in the morning etc. There is a big difference between expectation and reality and reality has a way of disappointing. I don't care how excited about magic I was over the summer holiday come a cold wet Monday morning in January when it's dark outside and everything is miserable, all I would want to do is curl up in my nice warm bed.

Having a bit of a grumble and losing interest is basically universal. You take what you have for granted and complain about everything else. I don't think it would take long for me to take magic for granted when everyone else has it around me. I'd like to say that I would be happy every day just to have magic but I don't think every day how lucky I am to have a warm roof over my head and food in the fridge at home. Maybe I should but I don't, I do however sometimes grumble that I can't be arsed to cook or that the weather outside looks shit even when I don't have to go out in it. Maybe that makes be a bad, overly privileged person but in my experience and talking with other people it's normal. It's why self-discipline is so important. Life has a way of making special seem normal.
