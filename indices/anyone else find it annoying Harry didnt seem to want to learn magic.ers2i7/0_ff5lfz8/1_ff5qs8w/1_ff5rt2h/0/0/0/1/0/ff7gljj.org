So what? my bed is 2 meters long and 1.5 in length; woooo, mathematics?

Can I wave a fraction around and reshape my bed to be even wider? can I apply the square root so it makes for a pretty color composition on my paper? Can I take out my calculator and do a logarithmic equation to write a story for me?

(note, the answer to all these questions is no)
