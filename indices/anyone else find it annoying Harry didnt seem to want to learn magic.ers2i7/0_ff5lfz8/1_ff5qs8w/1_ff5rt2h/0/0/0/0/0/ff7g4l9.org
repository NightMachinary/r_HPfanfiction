cars are not "essentially teleportation". That's like saying walking up the mount everest is like being flown across the country in an F22

The problem with your comparison is that all these things are

1. Mortally expensive

2. Completely unuseable on a small scale

3. one big patchjob

For instance, let's go back to the teleportation example. Apparition strikes me as the most useful skill known to wizards, by far.

Comparing it to cars or motorcycles or whatever is a lost cause, because it is better than those in all aspects - no need to buy a car that costs 10+ grand, no need to control said death implement as it barrels down the concrete strips, no accidents or horrific injuries as the metal components of said implement are driven through your body, and most of all, no travel time. We don't even know if it requires a wand or not.

You just turn in place, and then you're there. That's literally the best method of travel in existence. Saying that driving a 1 ton steel coffin down a narrow strip of concrete, stuck behind people who drive the same coffin but slower, is so indescribably different I can't put it into words.

The perspective shift you're attempting doesn't work, because magic isn't like technology. You can't compare things with similar function when they're accomplished so radically different. Magic comes from within, limited only by your imagination, but technology is big, cumbersome and beyond the means of most. The radical technology you're thinking of is unuseable by me - I can't buy a car for 200k, I can't take a plane from my home to my uni, but I could totally apparate there or fly a broom to solve both problems.

Magic is just... better, and there's no discussion about it. If I knew I had the power to directly alter the world using nothing but my imagination and a stick (notice how I said /directly/, technology or science is not) I would do my damndest to learn everything I could about it.
