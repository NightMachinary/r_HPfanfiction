What I mean is - I can't use mathematics to directly create something, for instance. I'm an artist, and I'd honestly kill for the ability to transfigure a lump of clay into exactly what I hold in my head and then burn it, or a quill that writes as I speak.

Levitation and just having things come to me (keys, glasses, whatever) would be other abilities I'd very much appreciate. Harry didn't even know what the Accio charm was until his fourth year. I think that would honestly be the first thing I'd look for.

Or potions! Fucking hell, I think I'd know the cure to the cold like the back of my hand with how often I get sick. Raspy throat? Down a potion, gone. headache? gone. nose? clear.
