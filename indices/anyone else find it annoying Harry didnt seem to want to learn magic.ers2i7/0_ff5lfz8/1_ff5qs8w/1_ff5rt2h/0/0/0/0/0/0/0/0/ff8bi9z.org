I feel bad that you are unable to, or just refuse to see that magic is real, and all around us right now. You /are/ Harry Potter, for whom magic is accepted, but not adequately explored.

Also, do you know about Arthur C. Clarke's three laws for science fiction writing? It might not be super appropriate for the HP universe, but it's certainly an interesting way to think about both our world and fictional ones:

1. When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.

2. The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.

3. Any sufficiently advanced [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology][technology]] is indistinguishable from [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural)][magic]].
