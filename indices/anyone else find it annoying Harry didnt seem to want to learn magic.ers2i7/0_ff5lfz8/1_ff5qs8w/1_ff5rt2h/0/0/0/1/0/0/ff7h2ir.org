People who were good at mathematics and applied it are why you can now use a computer to make a pretty colour composition on your paper, and draw a picture for you with a variety of effects. And maths is good for achieving certain compositional effects, and has been used that way by artists for centuries. You can use mathematics rather than just moving things around by trial and error and hoping they look good this time.
