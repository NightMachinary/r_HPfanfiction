Ok, you're gonna have to open your mind. We have so much magic that we treat it as mundane or boring because we're used to it. Why dont people absolutely marvel in the wonders of our technologies? It's astoundingly amazing and essentially magic in the same vein as the HP universe: it has rules, we have to learn it, it takes a very long time to get good at it, and it's built off the shoulders of giants!

We can fly, but still it's not enough! We can move around in cars and motorcycles, either gas or electric, essentially teleportation! But it's not good enough! We have preserving charms for our food, nutritional and flavor charms, too. We can predict the weather, and sometimes control it! We have almost all the knowledge of the world in our pocket, and we can converse with almost anyone, almost anywhere in the world in real time!

And it's still not good enough.

It all about changing your perspective. We all know that if we studied super hard, we could focus on one specific topic and move mountains, but instead, most of us just want to dick around reading silly stories and playing games. Just like the boys at Hogwarts!
