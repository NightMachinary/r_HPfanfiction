All those are gimmicks, and make the compositions way too inhumane and unpersonal for me. For example, I recently got into a craze of using differently colored highlight markers as the reflection of a multicolored light upon an entire image - emanating from a lantern, with the light reflecting off objects as a series of lines hugging the contours being lighted.

Mathematics didn't help me, couldn't have helped me. It doesn't help me take things from my mind and put them to paper, I have to guide the brush myself.

I don't know what you're smoking, but personally, I don't use mathematical levels of thought or precision in my art.
