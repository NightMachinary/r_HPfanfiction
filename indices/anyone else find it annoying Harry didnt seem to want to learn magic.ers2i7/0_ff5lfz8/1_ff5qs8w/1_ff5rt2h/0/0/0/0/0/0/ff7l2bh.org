I think you need to reread the series, and like, all the fanfiction, too!

Magic in the HP universe is treated very similarly to technology: it has rules, it starts of with simple spells (like simple machines) built up to larger and larger constructions.

The original question was "why aren't all the kids super excited to do magic?" Well, the answer is the same reason kids in real life aren't super excited to learn math. Math is the basic building block that allows humanity to accomplish everything humanity has accomplished! Yet some children aren't at all excited about it.

The magic in the Harry Potter universe is shown to be a little boring to learn (lift a feather? How banal!), difficult to perform well, predicated by ridiculous amounts of wealth (pretty much all the kids at a prestigious boarding school are loaded and if they are poor, they perform magic worse), and sometimes painful, sickening and potentially injurious (portkeys and apparition are described in awful detail, and apparition can result in splinching). And in canon, magic can only be performed with a wand (a tool).

I can levitate myself by building and sitting in a chair, I can apparate myself by taking a bus, I can create electricity by mixing a metal and a liquid. The only difference between Harry Potter's magic and the real world is the factor of time. And if it takes years to become proficient at a time-saving piece of magic, how much time will you end up saving in the long run?
