I think you've got it slightly wrong. At the start of the first book Harry was very keen. He read his books and couldn't wait to get started. He then learnt that Hogwarts was a school and schools can be boring.

Magic seems amazing but what can you actually do with it? Harry Potter witches and wizards aren't Gandalf, they're normal people doing normal things but with magic making things easier. We can all dream of how fantastic magic would be but what would you do with it? The first week you'd be doing lots of cool shit to amuse yourself but after that it just becomes part of your life and you end up living a normal life but with magic optimizing bits.

The majority of adult witches and wizards aren't roaming godlike mages pursing personal projects, they're civil servants. Harry Potter children are just school children and spend more of their time with magic messing about not studying because studying is boring.
