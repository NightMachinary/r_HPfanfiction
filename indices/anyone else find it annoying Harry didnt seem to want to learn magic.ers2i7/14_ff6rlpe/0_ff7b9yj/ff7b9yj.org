I think it absolutely serves the plot and possibly he does more things outside of what JKR could fit in. It is an adventure story for children, after all.

I also think a core issue is that he doesn't really understand the textbooks he's got. Although the classes teach the children equally, it doesn't appear that the books are actually written for children with very little exposure to the magical words. The books they initially get should be explaining what terms were, but actually they're just minor edits of books that were already secondhand when his father was in school.

Most people lose interest in reading books if the books are stuffy and poorly written - outdated English, lack of glossaries.

I liked school, enjoyed all my subjects but literally nothing has carried over into adulthood like your love of art. It's great that you have it, but it doesn't mean everyone does.

Also, excusing the fact that a smarter Harry would have decimated the plot (I think JKR even wrote once that she had to drag out what Harry new about the magical world and his parents for plot) - I'm not convinced Harry's prescription on his glasses is correct. It might be that he can barely read or gets eye strain when reading too long.
