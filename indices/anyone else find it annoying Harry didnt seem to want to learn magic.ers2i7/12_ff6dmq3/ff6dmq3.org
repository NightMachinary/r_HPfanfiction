You could ask the same question to every human being who goes to school. Wouldn't it be cool to be good at sports? Wouldn't it be awesome to know more than just one language? Wouldn't it make your life a lot easier to be good at cooking and maths and so on? Most students start out pretty excited when they start a new class because being good at something is really cool. But almost no one wants to put in all the work to get there.
