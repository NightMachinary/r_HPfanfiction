Agreed. Though I dunno about badass, but they'd at least be a little bit more "Wooooooooow." and enthusiastic about learning to do things. You'd probably end up with a lot of Doc Brown-types in the Muggleborn immigration pool who just go "What if I do this!" and set things on fire a lot while trying to do something else.

It's why that 'bullied by the Dursleys into underperforming Dudley' thing became so accepted in fanon, I think. We just needed some explanation for that complete lack of interest beyond "Ron infected him."
