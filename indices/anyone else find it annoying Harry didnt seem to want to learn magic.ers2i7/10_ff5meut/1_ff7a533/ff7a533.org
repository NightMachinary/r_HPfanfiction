My guess is that he's so used to doing chores the muggle way, he thinks he'll be just fine. I mean, household magic is cool but for him its not essential. He's also got a boatload of money to buy a house and a house elf (Dobby) who would happily do it all for him for a few galleons a week.

My personal suspicion, though, is that he never really thinks ahead to his adult life (as many young people don't, not in terms of all practicalities) particularly because I don't think he truly believes he will survive/defeat Voldemort. Why plan for a life when its painful to think the chances are you will never get to live it?
