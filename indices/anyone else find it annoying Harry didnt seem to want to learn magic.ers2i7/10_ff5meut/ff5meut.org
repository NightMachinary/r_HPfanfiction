Yeah I never understood why he wasn't learning things to make life easier for himself.

Hermione performs the unlocking spell in front of him and the boy who has canonically locked in his cupboard and then bedroom just decide never to learn it?

He learns about expanded tents and trunks with rooms in them in his forth year and... Does nothing with this knowledge.

He can't have imagined that the Dursleys would have kept him when a day after he turned 18 before he knew he was a Wizard, so why didn't he put some effort into learning how to survive daily life?
