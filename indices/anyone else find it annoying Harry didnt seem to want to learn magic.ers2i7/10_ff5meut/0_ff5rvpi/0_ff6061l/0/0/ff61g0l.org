I think the whole Trace is broken. Dobby (not Harry) uses magic and letter comes. So ministry monitors a house? Harry uses patronus on the street (outside of house) and letter comes. So ministry monitors the whole town? Or a house AND a wand? Harry uses accidental magic and letter doesn't come. (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

So usually writers bend the trace system as they want.
