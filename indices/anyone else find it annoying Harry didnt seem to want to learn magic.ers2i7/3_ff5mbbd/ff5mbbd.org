Disjointed rant warning!

I think it's easy to explain why a normal kid wouldn't be all that excited beyond the first few weeks. Let's take this class by class.

Astronomy - “How is this magic?”

Charms - “Can we stop the theory and get to spells already?”

Defence - Spotty teachers.

Herbology - It's just gardening.

History - Binns.

Potions - Snape.

Transfiguration - Like charms, but also very difficult.

Arithmancy - Poorly advertised.

Creatures - /Sometimes/ cool.

Divination - You need to be a seer to get anything out of it.

Muggles - Useless if Muggleborn.

Runes - Same as Arithmancy.

Your promised to be learning magic, but you never really have any good magic classes. The only ones that teach spells are Charms, Defence and Transfiguration, but they all have problems that make it less appealing to an eleven year old kid.

And after you've been hitting the books for most your lessons, would the average kid really want to go through even more to find a spell that might be interesting?

Even then, you're discouraged from doing so unless you have someone to correct your mistakes, otherwise you end up blowing something up. (See Seamus and the water to rum.)

And when asking someone to help you out, you can't ask peers since they wouldn't know either, (unless it's Hermione,) you can't ask the upperclassmen since they wouldn't care, and you can't the teachers since they're all busy with the other 239 students they have to teach.

Harry, has been conditioned to “not ask questions” all his life. While he'll ask a question when it's just him and his teacher, he won't if he's in a classroom, not will he actively search out answers from a teacher unless he /needs/ to.

TL;DR School makes things less exciting, and Harry isn't used to being independent and asking for help.
