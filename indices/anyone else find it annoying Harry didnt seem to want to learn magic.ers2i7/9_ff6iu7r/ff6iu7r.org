Forget learning about magic, Harry is an orphan who showed very little interest about learning about his own family. Unless it was relevant to the plot of course.

He never mentioned his desire to visit his parents' graves (until DH), to learn about their time in school, the war, their friends. He never bothered to learn his family's history on his father's side; as purebloods, there would certainly be some information even if it's genealogy only. An orphan would at least express the desire to find out about family, but /nooo/ it's not relevant to the plot.

He learned about his father's best friend after /eavesdropping/ in PoA, for Merlin's sake.
