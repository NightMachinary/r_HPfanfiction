Yep the entire series is based on what forwards the plot, no matter if it completely butchers already established things like, to cast a /Crucio/ you have to really mean it, really want to cause pain. Harry's hatred for Bellatrix was not enough. But Malfoy's fear was enough. Really.

Or my favorite one- You can't cast a spell by just knowing theory, you have to practice it. That was the point of DA. Next year Harry cast /septumsceptra/ without knowing any theory, wand movement or exact prononciation. But why bother we have to raise sympathy for Draco so let's do it.
