Realistically - and this is essentially what happened in canon - Harry probably wouldn't have been that jazzed about writing essays (because they're very structured and who actually likes writing them), but would have been strong at practical work. Reading is up in the air, but speaking as someone who does like reading, I definitely don't do it as much as I want so I can't imagine an eleven year old being much better about it.
