JKR should have made Harry the Practical version of Hermione... kind of like he was before the 3rd task in GOF. "MUST LEARN EVERY SPELL POSSIBLE. FUCK THEORY IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP. SPELLS DAMN IT!" and have Harry know all of the spells up til NEWT level by the end of Book 4 and learns to Silent Cast... casting his first spell Silently in the Graveyard, and learning how to do it during 5th year, and trying to teach the DA how to silent cast, but when asked the Theory, he has no fucking clue, and only learns the Theory for OWL/NEWT.

That's how any real kid would be if we suddenly regressed to 11 and went to a School of Magic. We'd be like "Fuck the Theory, Lets learn some Magic!" and learn literally every spell possible, even if it's a spell to cut your dinner up for you and seems lazy as fuck, it's like "Yeah, Magic!" rather than "Oh, Monotony"

Hermione should have also been less of an obsessed nutbag at times (Book 3 makes her seem like a learning obsessed psycho. A Muggleborn taking Muggle studies. A skeptic taking Divination) she should have taken certain subjects OWLs early. Muggle studies she could have taken the OWL/NEWT in 3rd year. History of Magic she could have self studied and graduated earlier, same for Astronomy. (Canon Runes is boring as shit. It's just learning a language, and not doing anything cool like carving an Ansuz onto something and watching it burn. It's why I like Fanfiction Runes that end up writing it similar to how Runes work in the Nasuverse)
