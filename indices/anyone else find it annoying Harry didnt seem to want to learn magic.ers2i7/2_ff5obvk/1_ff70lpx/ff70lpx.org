I think I'd absolutely be like Harry. A few weeks ago, I took up Duolingo - wouldn't it be magical, I thought, to learn Gaelic since I live in Scotland (albeit in the lowlands where Scots was spoken). Except, it was all taught the same way and repetitive. Well, let me tell you, that wore off in about 2 weeks.

Same with sewing, revising for exams, etc, etc. When push comes to shove, my brain just switches off.
