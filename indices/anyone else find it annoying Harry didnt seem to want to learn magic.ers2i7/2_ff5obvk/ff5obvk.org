I don't agree with the assumption that "if most people found out they were a wizard/witch, theyd be all over that shit trying to become a complete badass". I think that most people would, in fact, react far more like Harry than they would like Hermione. In fact, I suspect that most people who /think/ that they would react more like Hermione are in fact wrong: they are overestimating their ambitiousness, perseverance, and curiosity and underestimating their distractability and ability to get bored.

Harry's reaction is normal: what was extraordinary quickly becomes mundane; learning magic turns out to be a lot of hard work, including repetitive practice, reading books, and writing essays; and while magic offers more opportunities, it also offers more distractions. Many lessons feel pointless in immediate terms (like "matchsticks into needles").

Hermione's the weirdo who reads nonfiction books for fun and learns spells even if she doesn't anticipate having an immediate use for them (and we love her for it). Harry and Ron are the normal people. In fact, other Muggleborns aren't shown being any more magically ambitious than Harry and Ron.
