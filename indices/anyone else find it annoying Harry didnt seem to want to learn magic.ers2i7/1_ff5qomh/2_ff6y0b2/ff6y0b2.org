Don't you mean "all that vanished abruptly once he met Ron and Snape."

Books 1-4. He was all about reading the books during the summer and free time. Ron steps in and it dries up. Book 4, Ron makes an arse of himself and steps away and Harry is back to studying again. Ron steps back, and it stops. Hermione is doing the work again. Books were never heard of again in Harry's presence until HBP.
