Honestly I think this is the real issue. The only times in the series that we are shown or told about Harry learning something about magic through his own initiative after meeting Hermione are the Patronus Charm and the Half Blood Princes book.

JK decided that from a literary standpoint she preferred to have Hermione come out of the blue with the solution/idea/new information about magic. Eg Nicholas Flamel, Jinxes, bluebell flames, alohamora, polyjuice, basilisk, etc. And that's just some of what she brings as exposition and plot drive to the first two books. Maybe it was her self insert idealization of Hermione that made her write that way, maybe she hated writing scenes where Harry read a book and learned something relevant to the plot, maybe she was just really bad at writing exposition of that type and had to rely on Hermione and Dumbledore as crutches.

No matter what the reason for the decision was, in my opinion it was a literary decision to give Hermione that role not a characterization decision, and the affect it had on the characterization of Harry is real and a valid thing to find irritating.
