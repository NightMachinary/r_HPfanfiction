You could make an educated guess that it was indirectly Ron's fault, but only inasmuch as Harry putting too much stock into his example. Harry had no friends, ever, so he's going to (subconsciously or not) do everything to be "worth keeping" to the ones he has. For Ron this was emulating his academic style, but I'm not sure what that was for Hermione.

In that sense, once Ron was removed, this aim switched to Hermione (and he likely realized what he was doing), and he began emulating her instead.
