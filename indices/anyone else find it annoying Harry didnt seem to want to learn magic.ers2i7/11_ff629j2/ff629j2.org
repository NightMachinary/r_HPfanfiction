Given how worshiped superpowers and superhumans of any kind are throughout literature/movies/cartoons/video games it is absolutely incomprehensible to me how any Muggleborn wouldnt become obsessively fascinated by Magic and study it from the moment they wake up. Especially at such a tender and impressionable age. I can only take suspension of disbelief so far before it snaps, guys.

​

Look at us here for a perfect proof, this is all fantasy and we already are so invested and knowledgeable about it. Are we to believe that a Muggleborn studying actual, real Magic would just treat it like regular school? Nah, bro. It's crazy enough as it is, but when you consider Harry, with all the crap he has to deal with in his life, it's downright infuriating.

​

As for Ron, the kid grew up with his older brother being a sort of action hero Indiana Jones working for Goblins, his other brother a *DRAGON* tamer, two more twins being magical geniuses and a household that uses Magic for essentially everything. It's no freaking wonder he gets bored learning how to levitate a feather.
