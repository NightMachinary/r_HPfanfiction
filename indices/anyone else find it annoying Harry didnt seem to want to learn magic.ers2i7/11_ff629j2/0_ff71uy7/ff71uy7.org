I think it's different chatting theory about it, to being in a school where most of the books are ancient and almost illegible. Or at the very least have not been written by someone with teaching qualifications, not least because not even the teachers need to know how to teach. (I know this parallels independent schools, but at least they get the best in.)

I see it as being quite similar to how excited I was about going to secondary school. So many fantastic clubs, opportunities to care for the school animals (being in London meant that farm animals were hard to come by) and best of all D&T and Chemistry. See, when I'd been to school open days/school transition the science experiments and bunsen burners were absolutely fascinating. In D&T we built a floating wooden boat.

Then when I got to school, it turned out that using a bunsen burner happened once a term, if that, with a smattering of non-burning tasks thrown in. Worse, the longer I was in school, the fewer actual praticals we did (even if those practicals were better). Everything involved planning, paperwork and 95% of it was dull.
