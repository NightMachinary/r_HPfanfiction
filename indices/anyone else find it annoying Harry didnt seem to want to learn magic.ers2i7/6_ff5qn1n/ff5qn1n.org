Not really. In terms of real life and what we see in canon, you have an 11 year old boy where at that age, most aren't super academically inclined. You're not going to find many nerds or geeks who are willing to put in the work because like [[/u/turbinicarpus]] and [[/u/FavChanger]] most of them will eventually see it as a school and it's not as easy as you're predicting (IMO).

Canonically we know for instance that many wizards can not cast a reliable shield charm and that Felix Felicis is a tough potion to brew. Even polyjuice takes a month. The point is, most children and adults won't have the motivation to do that.
