I think that it's part of Harry's personality.

For example, Harry is a Gryffindor, and he is motivated and interested in -doing things- and taking action. In the books he is very motivated when he sees purpose to what he is learning, especially to further his current goals. Unlike possibly a typical Ravenclaw, he might not be so interested in learning for learning's sake and gaining general knowledge. School can be boring and some of the teachers just weren't so great. Instead of catching up with books and experiments, Harry was up to other things, including mischief.
