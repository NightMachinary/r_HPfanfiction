I think a lot of people forgot that Hogwarts is still a school and magic is /hard/. These kids are assigned a lot of theory and essay writing (way more than when I was 11), and it takes hours of repetitive work to learn a spell.

Add onto that that there's like 3 actual magic classes: Charms (great), Transfiguration (super hard, and McGonagall is strict), and DADA (either really good or really bad).

These kids have pretty crazy workloads, and Harry has Oliver Wood's nightmare practice schedules to deal with too. Is it any wonder he wants to spend his free time playing chess, instead of researching and practicing new spells?

(As an analogy, how many people say they'll learn an instrument or a new language, and then never do?)
