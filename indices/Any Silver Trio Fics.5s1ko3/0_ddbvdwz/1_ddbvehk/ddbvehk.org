  An AU spin-off of "Breaking Point." Jack's offer is a chance to get close enough to do some damage, and, in this world, PM decides to take it. Now she faces a series of difficult decisions about how far she is willing to go to bring down the man who destroyed her life and now threatens the existence of most of the universe --- decisions that are complicated by her own traumatic mental illness and by the unwelcome suspicion that his interest in her may not be entirely professional.
