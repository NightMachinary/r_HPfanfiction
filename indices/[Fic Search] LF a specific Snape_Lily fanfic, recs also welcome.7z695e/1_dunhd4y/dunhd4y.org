Ananke and A Dream Carved in Stone are both great! Have you checked out linkffn(puzzle by we-built-the-shadows-here) yet? It's a new, really good and realistic Snape/Lily fic that updates pretty often. Also I'd recommend linkffn(obscura nox animae) as it has a pretty unique premise. Old standbys are linkffn(the moment it began by sindie) and linkffn(come once again and love me).
