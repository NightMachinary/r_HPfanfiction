Likely being a victim of bullying herself due to her bucked teeth and the (admittedly) know-it-all aura she gives off, Hermione wouldn't judge a book by its cover, so to speak. I can see her being wary around him, but I don't think she'd participate in the bullying. If anything, she'd notice that Dudley's the one doing the bullying and avoid /him/.
