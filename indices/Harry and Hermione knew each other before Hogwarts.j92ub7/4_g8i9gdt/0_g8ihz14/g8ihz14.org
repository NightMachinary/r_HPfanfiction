IDK, I think you might be overestimating the innate empathy and kindness of a child under 10, especially one like Hermoine, who perhaps wasn't as emotionally intelligent as she was intellectually.

I'm not saying she definitely would, but it's also unfair to say she definitely wouldn't. She was likely a vulnerable and lonely little girl, who would probably be able to say, what's to her, a few mean things to fit in. (to harry it would obviously be a bit more significant).

Plus, it totally fits in with the themes of the core 7 books, to have Hermoine initially be the type to go along with the crowd and seek security (a ministry of magic type) and then learn over the course of the fic, "Fuck It, I'll do what's right, instead of easy".
