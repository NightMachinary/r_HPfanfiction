The same as before probably. Despite being his tormentor for most his life, Harry did not hesitate to save Dudley from the Dementors. Hell, he didn't hesitate to save Draco from the Room of Requirements despite being his nemesis. So why would he not save Hermione from the Troll? It's stated in canon that he didn't like her much before that anyways.
