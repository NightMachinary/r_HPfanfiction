IIRC this fic is the prime example of lazy crossovers - it's basically just the MCU but Harry is also there. The stations of canon don't change, and some of the scenes are literally just a description of movie scenes. I don't think I finished it, though I don't remember where I stopped - somewhere after the Winter Soldier arc
