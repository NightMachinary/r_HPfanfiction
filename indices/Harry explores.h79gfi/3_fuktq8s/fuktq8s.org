It's not exactly like you asked. But In this story when Harry finds out about the prophecy he instantly understands that he's meant to die and decides he wants to live a little first and travels the world. In The process he unknowingly becoming a sort of hero. (He has an alias he travels under and like a glamour so no one can recognise him)

(“Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.”)
