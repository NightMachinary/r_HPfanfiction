Well Potter had a different plan to defeat Voldemort in linkffn(The House of Potter Rebuilt by DisobedienceWriter). It definitely had the adventurer's mindset that you're looking for. Don't let the title give you preconceived ideas. There are no Lord Potter/Peverell/Slytherin/Gryffindor shenanigans within it.

There's another that ymmv that's a crossover, it seems like a crossover, with the Forgotten realms linkffn(The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries by Mr.Omega573). It produces an OP!Harry with the enemies scaled up with the OP-ness with adventure written across it.

You can also try linkffn(The Difference One Man Can Make by joen1801) but its been dormant for three years now. Same premise with different world building.
