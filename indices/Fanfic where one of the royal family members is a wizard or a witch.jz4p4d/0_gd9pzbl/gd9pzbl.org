"Honor to Serve" [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8089778/1/Honor-To-Serve]]. About half the Royal family are magical. Prince Harry might be going to Hogwarts, the previous Royal Wizard was Princess Margaret, the current is Prince Edward, and the Queen Mother is a witch, although the Queen is not. Prince Charles is Cannons fan, BTW.
