There is actually one specific fanfic that has this come up. (I dont remember the name sadly)

Dumbledore is asked to an intervention, because his performance used to be very progressive but has become quite conservative in the present. He eventually resigns. That is all I remember of the fic though.. It might have been bashing. I am not sure.
