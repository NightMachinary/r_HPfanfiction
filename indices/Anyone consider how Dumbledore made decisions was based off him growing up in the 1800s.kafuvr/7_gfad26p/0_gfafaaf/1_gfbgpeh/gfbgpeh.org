Where did Rowling say that? I don't recall a definitive answer to his age coming out until his bio on Pottermore was released.

1881 is different to 1996, yes. But 1850 would have been even drastically more so. In all honesty, social attitudes in 1881 were pretty much the same as social attitudes in the first half of the 20th century. It was only after the Second World War that British society began to be more open, less deferrent, and so on. A poor family in the 1920s had a similar life to a poor family in the 1880s.

Between the 1850s and 1880s though, there was huge amounts of social change - including extending the voting franchise to most men, making child labour illegal, making school compulsory and so on.

1881 was radically different from 1850, but 1939 - when Tom Riddle was at Hogwarts and Dumbledore was teaching - was not radically different from 1881. The 1990s were different, but by then Dumbledore was over 100 and set in his ways. But whether he was nearly 150 or only 115 when he died would actually be really important to this argument because attitudes specifically to children and schooling underwent a massive overahaul between the 1850s and 1880s, so his formative years would be very different depending which decade he was born in.

It also explains why McGonagall, who was quite a bit younger than him (she was 11 in 1927-8 at the earliest as this is the point when Albus started teaching Transfiguration and he mentored her in the subject, so she's a minimum of 35 years younger) has very similar social attitudes to him. But if he had been a product of the 1850s, not the 1880s, they would have clashed not complemented.
