  Question: How old is old in the wizarding world, and how old are Professors Dumbledore and McGonagall?

  J.K. Rowling responds: Dumbledore is a hundred and fifty, and Professor McGonagall is a sprightly seventy. Wizards have a much longer life expectancy than Muggles. (Harry hasn't found out about that yet.)

From 2000, after GOF came out.
