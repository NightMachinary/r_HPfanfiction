Wizarding Britain was probably worse than Muggle Britain.

Even by the 1990s, Wizarding Britain has minimal democracy, a very relaxed attitude towards danger for children- and ok they can fix broken bones in a second but they're way behind on emotional and social welfare, can imprison people for decades without trial purely on the say so of a cop, has what basically amounts to the death penalty (which hasn't been used in Muggle Britain since the 1960s), enslaves sentient beings, has a terrible attitude to animal welfare, and is seriously institutionally bigoted in a way that would have been illegal in Muggle Britain by the time the books are set.
