Dumbledore knew from the start that the Dursley were bad, as he explained to Harry during their talk in OotP. The reason why he still chose to put Harry there was because, at the time, it was still the "least worst" choice. The Dursley may have been bad guardians, but they still took Harry in, letting him enter Hogwarts healthy, pretty well adjusted and . . . alive, something that was far from assured had Harry been raised in the magical world (between the people worshipping the "Boy-Who-Lived" and the Death Eaters wanting revenge or a new Dark Lord to follow).

I also want to point that, even by the 1990's standards, the Dursley are not really that bad. I mean, they would never win the "Parents of the Year" award (neither for Dudley, nor for Harry), but judging by what we see in Canon, the only true Red Flag is sleeping in a cupboard. It's not like they were beating Harry daily, or treating him as a House Elve : The few chores done by Harry in Canon are either a special circunstance (Dudley birthday or trying to bribe Vernon to sign a paper), or a punishment (CoS).

As for Snape, I don't think Dumbledore could have done anything else. Snape was, before anything else, a spy, and Dumbledore needed to keep him in a position where he could "justify" the informations he gathered. Without his positon at Hogwarts, I doubt Snape would have survived his 1st meeting with Voldemort in GoF, so Dumbledore had to keep him there, no matter how bad he was. Though I'm also convinced that Snape was especially bad to Harry (and Harry's year in general). Not that he would ever be a good teacher, just be a bit more harsh/ bullying whenever Harry was near).
