I think it was more the fact that the Dursleys had two other bedrooms available in the house (Dudley's other room and Marge's guest room). It would've been more acceptable if the Dursleys were poor, didn't have another room, had many other children, etc. Since none of those applied to them, the cupboard is a "red flag".
