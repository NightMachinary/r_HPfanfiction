I'm not sure that sleeping in the cupboard is even a “red flag”. (Not in terms of how a kid should be treated, of course, especially when there's a spare bedroom, but in an absolute sense.)

I had a friend with a lot of siblings whose parents were poor. She slept on a small mattress that rolled out from underneath her sibling's bed, in a small room with 4 other people. I'm sure there were times when she would have loved a small spot of her own-and a cupboard under the stairs, provided it had room enough to spread out and sleep in, might have been an improvement on her actual situation.

I think “cupboard under the stairs” sounds more horrific than it actually is---which, if it's warm, dry, and has appropriate bedding---is hardly worse than what a number of poor children (who are not victims of abuse except insofar as poverty can be considered abuse) have to deal with on a daily basis.
