Idk, he makes friends with Ron and Hagrid pretty fast. He shuts down Malfoy in the robe shop in a confident yet non-confrontational way. He's socialised enough to appropriately approach Molly to ask how to get on the platform - and indeed she comments on how well mannered he is. He adapts to Quidditch - a team game - almost instantly. He understands social cues in a way that, for example, /Hermione/ (of all people) absolutely doesn't.

I think canon Harry is really well adjusted actually. He's friendly, he's polite, he can adapt to different social situations (for example he understands that you speak to your peers differently to your teachers). Also, the fact that the books narration (which is from his perspective) comments on things like Snape's poor hygiene and rude manner and Ron's lack of mealtime etiquette means that he notices these things and recognises them for the social faux pas they are.

The only real thing that could point to him being a "social cripple" is that for the first three books he only ready has two close friends (three if you count Hagrid) and even that is debatable - he's on good terms with most of Gryffindor and actively "matey" with the Quidditch team. And most people only have a few "best friends" but are "surface friendly" with other people.
