The thing is, I'm not sure anything the Dursleys do would be illegal even /now./ There would be an investigation into why he was kept in a cupboard, and the home would probably be judged as an unsuitable environment for him (and probably Dudley) but in terms of actual illegality - they don't hit him often (so mild chastisement), he's not locked in, he is (despite what fanon says) allowed to use the loo, eat (just not the good food) and access education.

The point where they cross a line according to UK law is when they lock him into the bedroom and don't feed him/let him out for the bathroom in CoS. Up to that point, and indeed after it, their behaviour is highly immoral yet not illegal. Which is utterly mind boggling when you really think about it.
