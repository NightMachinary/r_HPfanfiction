i mean, Butters from South Park is an example on how grounding affects a child, he essentially charges all negative emotions he has against his friends and parents into professor chaos.

Theres also the fact that Petunia threw a frying pan after him and he didnt react like it was something crazy, implying that having heavy objects thrown at himself isnt out of the ordinary and actually quite normal.

Dursleys as pepole that raises Harry is horrible, it didnt age well at all, when we have the other responsible "good" pepole in the story send him back without ensuring a healthy source of food or ability to do his summer homework.
