Dumbledore was actually pretty progressive for his age (which was 115 not 150 at his death). Violence free education is a thing from the late 20. century and he banished corporal punishment from Hogwarts.

To the rest: I don't think it's that Dumbledores age is the reason Hogwarts seems pretty backwards in his pedagogy but JK Rowling. She grew up in England of the 60/70ies. In Great Britain the last privat schools outlawed corporal punishment in 2004 - public schools outlawed it not earlier than 86. Corporal punishment in families isn't outlawed till this day only "immoderate chastisement". The Child Act which protects minors was only racified in 1989 (two years before Harry went to Hogwarts) So as awful anything the Dursleys did - in the 80ies it wasn't even illegal.
