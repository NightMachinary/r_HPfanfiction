I think he was heavily progressive because of his upbringing. It's noted in the books often how Argus filch keeps referring to the good old days of corporal punishment, which was ousted whilst Dumbledore was headmaster. He slams umbridge for daring to try and manhandle Marrietta. Chances are when he was a student things were a bit more sinister and he aimed to influence change. He purged the library of dark arts books to try and prevent students under his care falling under the way side also.

But then he goes and locks a Cerberus in a corridor for 9 months so who knows!
