I'm still here linkffn(9704180): Time travel fic where post canon bitter and ruthless Harry travels to alternate GOF world with femHarry! With some unexpected help, Harry enters Hogwarts under a famous pseudonym. Due to certain events Dumbledore thinks Harry could be Voldemort's son and is following in his father's footsteps. Full of typical HP fic tropes, but there is a good spin on the "Harry is a Lord" and "Harry has a special power" tropes. I find the side characters are the strongest part of the story. Story also needs an editor as it often repeats expository information, but the author notes mention that the story is cowritten and there was a co-author change.

The author mentioned that they weren't sure which way they were going for the romantic subplot so the multiple developing plots are very one-sided. There is some one-sided Daphne/Harry in the story so far, and I don't know how stringent you are about the mentioned pairing condition.
