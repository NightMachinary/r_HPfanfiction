Thanks! Maybe this will motivate me to finally finish it!

Edit: I'm 47 chapters in now and I've noticed that I'm getting that feeling of wanting to know what she's going to pull off next and it's motiving me to finish, thank you for recommending it to me.

I have a feeling this fic and its sequels will keep me busy for a while. :D
