Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path /Temporal Knight

RuneMaster /Tigerman

Both can be found in ff.net

I have really enjoyed the second, it's a light read with humour. It's one of they few fics I've read twice :)

The first... erm... well, it's not my cup of tea. I never managed to read it until the end. You might like it better than me...

Edit: I just noticed the blood magic part. I honestly don't remember. Although I remember reading a fic in which they carved runes onto their bodies. If it rings a bell to anybody - let me know? :D
