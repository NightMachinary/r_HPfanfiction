There is a small window where you could justify a Bellatrix pairing. After she gets out of Azkaban, if she deserts Voldemort before the DoM battle. Because more than a decade in Azkaban should be enough by any standard of punishment and you can justify a change of heart by that. It would not make her a good person, but certainly a viable anti hero.
