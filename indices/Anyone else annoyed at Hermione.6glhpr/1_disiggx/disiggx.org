Depends ot the author, sometimes it really feels like some of them outsource Harry's brain to her and his conscience/work ethic etc. too (as in he'd cease to be more than a trained monkey who only knows how to eat, fight with Draco and maybe play quidditch without her!) so of course she has to read all the books Harry has access to, so she can teach him how to use the knowledge in those books :(

Indeed many make her into a total book fanatic - I get it, she's an academic, she's pretty smart (though not a prodigy like Dumbledore, Riddle or Merlin!), but she'd not throw away friendship for some damned books :(

Sadly canon portraits her this way, just not as extreme! I mean she is bossy (Sorry, Hermione, you aren't Harry's mother or his wife, so leave him alone damned!), socially inept (going behind peoples backs, like with the Firebolt incident...damned, she didn't even talk to Harry before going to McGonagall! He was right to not speak to her for a while!), she can't leave people alone and has got to know everything going on in their heads (again: Sorry, but Harry has the right to keep things from you, it's called a right to privacy Granger!), she worships a guy who put a child (Harry!) in an abusive environment (Yes, trying to hit children with frying pans is ABUSE, not "just" neglect!) without checking on said child and probably without having propper authorization to do this!

Still, it's easier to fix than many authors think (even without bashing!):

Make your Harry assert himself and set some boundries (and stick to them - defend them like an American gun owner does his home!)
