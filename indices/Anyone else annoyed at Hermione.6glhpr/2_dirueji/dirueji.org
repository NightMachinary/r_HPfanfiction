Most fanfics are crap anyway. My advice is to identify authors you like and stick with them, also look for their favorites because chances are you will like them too.

When it comes to Hermione centric authors, I like [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/636397/][lorien829]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Starfox5]].
