snape and draco here, although ron is often a choice.

Hermione on the other hand is a difficult subject, she was bossy in the first books but nothing out of character, once the character grew it mostly went away, at least the annoying parts. The are plenty fics out there with a well written Hermione, the problem is that many people like to put her together with Ron and Dumbledore, making her quite a bich.

I tend to spoil myself most fics by skimming through comments to get some clues as to the personalities of some characters, its the best way to find some decents reads.
