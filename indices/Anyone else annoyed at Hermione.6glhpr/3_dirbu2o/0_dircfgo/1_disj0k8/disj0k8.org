Isn't that more or less canon? I mean she only has one real weakness in canon: Her lack of good social skills (and she's insecure at the start, but that gets fixed rather quick!), otherwise she's little miss perfect, the teacher's pet who can do no wrong! I mean people take her side with that cursed parchment (I am kind of torn about this, on the one hand Marrieta deserved what she got, on the other hand: It's a tad cruel!), with the Firebolt incident (going behind a friends back!), when she intrudes on Harry's privacy (tries to weedle out secrets from him). Hell, many support her decision to obliviate her parents, which I don't (I'd rather die than have somebody erase my memories, as without them I cease to be me, so I might as well be DEAD! I mean death of personality is a punishment in Babylon 5 for example because it's like you are killing that person without actually pulling the trigger!)...hell, I'd love to hear her parents tear into her for doing it!
