You could be describing me, it just didn't apply to all school subjects (I wasn't interested in maths for example - but biology? history? economics? etc. Bring it on!), but then again:

I didn't try to beat that knowledge into other peoples heads and neither did I always try to show off (sure I participated in class, more than most others, but I didn't try to make others look stupid!)

I also was not bossy, not really - I liked taking the lead, but I wasn't affraid to surrender the reigns from time to time!

As for authority? I was bullied in school by students and sometimes by the teachers, too so I trust no authority figure! I distrust even the police and fire-department (the former because I fear them abusing their authority and use excessive force/violence and the later because I don't trust them to save a building when they are putting a fire out...I've seen them totally destroy a building in our neighborhood which IMHO could have been saved (some of them admitted that to me in private, too), but no they had to show off their equipment and used a high-pressure hose and destroyed what the fire left...that building had to be torn down later because it was a safety hazard!)

So while I have some sympathy for Hermione, I think she should know some boundries (I don't think she'd react well if people tried to pry into her life, so why is it ok for her to do so with others?)
