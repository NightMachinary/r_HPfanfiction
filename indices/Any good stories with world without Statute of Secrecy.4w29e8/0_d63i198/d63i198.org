Purely HP verse? Linkffn(Emperor;Rise of the Wizards). Iirc, Emperor revealed it relatively early while Rise is sort of mid-late in the story. Next we have Mass Effect crossovers which are, sadly, either dead or have spordaic updates linkffn(The effects of magic by ElectroVenik;To Break Thy Chains and Cycles by WiseSilver) Those 4 are off the top of my head.
