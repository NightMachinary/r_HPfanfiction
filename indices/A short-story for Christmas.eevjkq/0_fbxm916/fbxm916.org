Well I mean the original Harry dialogue was one step short of:

"Engage greeting protocol", buzzed PotterBot. Gyros whirred and a hand extended itself. "Your presence charges my positronic matrix, Weasley (Bill)".

Bill shook PotterBot's hand, receiving a mild shock in the process. "Wow, Harry! I always get a charge out of seeing you", he laughed.

"Charge. Shock. Referencing thesaurus. Thrill. Excitement. Humor recognition protocol suggests attempt at a joke. Ha. Ha. Ha."

And we all know that [[/u/Te7]] can do much better. And he did. He's exaggerating though. The rest of chapter one was great. As is the rest of the story. Except chapter four should be called Danse Macabre. Once you've all read it you can come back here and tell him he's wrong.

The final result is a heart-warming story that I've thoroughly enjoyed reading.

Being the beta reader was an honour. I was happy to do the favour and it added colour to my December. It's cold in Scotland, being so close to the Arctic.

Next it's back to the interesting job of trying to beta a story where you have the first couple of chapters and then the (end-4)th chapter but none of the middle. Just as well I like his writing...
