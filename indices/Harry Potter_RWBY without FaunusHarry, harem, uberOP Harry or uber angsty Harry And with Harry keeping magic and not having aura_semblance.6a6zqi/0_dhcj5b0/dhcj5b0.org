linkffn(12292532) Return of Magic is a decent crossover, though I would say he qualifies as at least a little overpowered in it (Mind you, my scale of power has been warped by reading so many trash fics)

General premise is Harry Potter ends up in Remnant, meets Winter on a secret mission, and they team up. It's set during Volume 4, so if you want to avoid spoilers from before that, I would give it a skip
