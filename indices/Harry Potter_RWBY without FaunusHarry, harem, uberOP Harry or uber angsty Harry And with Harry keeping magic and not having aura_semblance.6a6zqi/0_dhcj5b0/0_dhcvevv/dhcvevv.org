This is my fic! First time any of my work has ever been recommended on this sub by someone before! :D

Oh and like the person said, it's Harry/Winter (but I wouldn't call it romance centric), no harems, no genderbending, etc...

He does keep his magic and I'll admit is a bit OP. He also does eventually get aura but it won't have that big affect on the story and there are no plans for a semblance at this time.

I'm actually just working on finishing up the next chapter now so I should be updating soon I hope.
