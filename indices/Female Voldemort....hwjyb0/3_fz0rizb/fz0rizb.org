You've likely read it, but linkffn(11752324) has maybe the most fleshed-out one.

Besides that, linkffn(13507192) also makes use of femVoldemort. She's had rather sparing appearances so far, but the author seems to be setting her up as quite a strong character and I'm very much looking forward to seeing where it goes.
