Wow! That's a great selection of stories. Also, if I had read this just 10 mintues ago, I would probably turn you deaf with my shouting (or is it blind since this is text). I'm a huge fan of esama (Whispers in the Corners is a great story), but I thought they had left fanfiction so all I had was a collection of stories that I had downloaded. To see more stories and an active profile on AO3 (something I didn't know about - how I'm not sure about but still) has me jumping off the walls. I'm soooo excited.

I've read a couple of your recommendations such as the Hannibal and Jurassic Park cross overs and have to agree with your choices. They are brilliant! Thanks for sharing :)
