I'm a big fan of horror crossovers. I like the juxtaposition of the high fantasy of Harry Potter and something much more gritty and bloody.

One of my favorites is *Jurassic Park* crossovers, the best of which I think is The Point of No Return linkffn(9727741) which has a sadly very slow update rate.

*Hannibal* crossovers haven't quiet gotten the level of horror right yet, especially things like Hadrian Lecter: Becoming linkffn(10280220) which just isn't bloody enough. Gaining Innocence linkffn(10116207) is a bit better in the gore regard, but has a few overused tropes at the start to get through. There are some Hermione/Hannibal fics out there too, but I'm not a fan of Hermione, so I can't tell you have good they are.

I had high hopes for *Resident Evil* crossovers, but they always sort of become OP Harry fics... Resident Evil: Potter Style linkffn(7344753) has OP Harry, but is a good read none the less. A Different Life linkffn(8708283) is very dark, and has slash-incest, so may not be everyone's cup of tea.

A favorite of mine is Weapons of Light and Dark linkffn(7849109), a surprisingly dark *X Men* crossover, maybe because it is more a crossover with the weapons X program (warning endgame is Harry/Logan, but there isn't anything except primal Logan lusting after Harry until much much later in the story).

On the non horror side, *Grimm* crossovers are surprisingly fun. Not as Grimm as it Seems linkffn(8772657) is cute, don't be put off by the short chapters, there is plot development as well. I also want to recommend pretty much any crossover by esama, their three most popular *Sherlock* crossovers, Business linkao3(1113588), Whispers in Corners (slash) linkao3(1134255), and Magnificent (some minor slash) linkao3(1113600) are truly brilliant. Esama also has a set of Tumbling HP Crossovers drabbles linkao3(1647644) which are generally good. The Island of Fire series (starts with The Island of Fire linkao3(3236603)) is a wonderful *Temeraire* by Naomi Novik crossover which has been copied a number of times now.
