Ohhhhh! I'm a HUGE fan of stargate (all of them) and Harry Potter cross-overs. I've actually written my own crossover for them (which I shall not share because it needs a lot of work). I have read a lot of stargate/HP stories and love them all.

I love Oma's choice, although I was surprised at the sudden ending of it. The Guardian is a great premise and a nice story. I just LOVE the Isis Bane series. All of them are brilliant :D

One of my favourite HP/SG1 story and, indeed, one of my all time favourites on ffnet is Fighting The Gods linkffn(2994996). I also went to add another story about Harry ascending, killing Voldemort and therefore being banished to Abydos... only I can't find it anymore! It was a story that got better and better before the last chapter made this huge revelation etc. it was awesome and now I have to consider that it may be taken down! This is horrible!

Sorry, I got a little side tracked now. Lots of great stories. Thanks for sharing :)
