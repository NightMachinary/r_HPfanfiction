This is the most horrible thing I've ever seen... why? because I haven't read this before... and it's written by esama... who is actively updating stories... I'm a huge fan of esama's work and I thought I had a copy of all of it before they left... I didn't know they were back and on ao3. How did I not know this?!?!?!?!?!?!?

Thank you sooooo very much for linking this, not only a great story, but so I've now found one of my favourite authors is still active. Oh no... there goes my week to catching up on esama's work. lol Thank you so very much :D
