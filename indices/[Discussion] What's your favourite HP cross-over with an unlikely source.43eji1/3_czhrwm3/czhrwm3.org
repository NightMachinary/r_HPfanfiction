I'm a big fan of HP/Stargate x-overs.

linkffn(Oma's Choice by jacobds) is a great one. Long and complete.

linkffn(Harry Potter and The Alteran Gift by robertbryan) is another. I faintly remember this one. Don't think it was complete when read through it, though it is now.

linkffn(Isis's Bane by althor42) is one of the first HP/SG1 cross-overs that I ran into. It's great. The author couldn't decide which way to go with the story, and wrote a second sequel that takes the story in a different direction.

linkffn(Guardian by Blueowl) is another good one.
