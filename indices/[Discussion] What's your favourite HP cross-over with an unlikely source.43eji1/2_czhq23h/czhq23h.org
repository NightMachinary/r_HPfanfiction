Of course there are the 'obvious' crossovers; like the ones you mention, or Marvel, or the Lord of the Rings, or even Buffy. But everyone's seen those, right? Most are just plain crappy anyway.

But what about a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10568823/1/Average][HP/NCIS crossover]]? That's pretty strange, right? And pretty well done too.

Things like Star Wars or Star Trek may be strangely uncommon, but they're hardly /weird/.

But what about a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10968606/1/Why-Luna-Lovegood-Should-Never-be-in-Charge-of-Anything][HP/Frozen crossover]]? That's gotta be worth something even if it could be much better.

Then there's stuff that /should/ have way more crossovers, I mean HP/Highlander or HP/Cthulhu basically writes itself, right?

But what about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10161445/1/Another-Day-s-Work][HP/Pacific Rim]]?
