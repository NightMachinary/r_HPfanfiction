These are great! I hadn't thought to check out the Frozen or Pacific Rim categories before (exactly my point in making this thread :) ).

Although, I was thinking of categories that ffnet has less than 20 or so stories in, but I have to agree, NCIS is a great cross over genre and this is a good story. I've not actually ever really seen NCIS (maybe half an episode here and there), but a lot of my knowledge of NCIS comes from HP crossovers with it (and Alex Rider crossovers with NCIS).

Thanks for sharing!
