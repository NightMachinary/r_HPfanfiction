I don't know if it's unlikely or not, but I absolutely love Jeconais' HP/Addams Family series /Perfect Slytherins/. It's funny, clever, well-written and entertaining. I don't normally read crossovers and only clicked on this because I didn't immediately realise who Wednesday was in the pairing. Very glad I did though.
