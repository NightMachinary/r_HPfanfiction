Culture novels are /incredible/. This fanfic is actually what introduced me to them! I absolutely love the way Ian M. Banks writes, and as a huge fan of transhumanism and post-production societies, the Culture novels are quite /literally/ worth their weight in gold for me.

Don't even get me started on the Minds...

That said, I've been trying to slow my reading pace. It would suck to finish all the novels and have nothing left to read :(
