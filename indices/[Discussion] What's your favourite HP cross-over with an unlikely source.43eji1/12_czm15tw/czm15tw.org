Here's a list with a few of the most unusual crossovers, in the sense that there are very few stories that merge Harry Potter with these particular fandoms.

linkffn(7725354) /Gods Among Us/ by /arturus/, where Harry and Hermione take an unplanned trip to the Battlestar Galactica verse.

linkffn(8575201) /Harry Potter and the Escape to New York/ by /Writing Warriors/, where Harry leaves the Dursleys behind in a feat of accidental magic and grows up in a New York of the late 1980's Beauty and the Beast TV series.

linkffn(9136440) /Dodgers, Dresses, Teddy Bears and Spot/ by /Clell65619/, where Harry grows up with the Munsters. A funny/cracky alternate to all those HP/Addams Family x-overs I've seen lately.

linkffn(5714450) /The Crow: Phoenix Rising/ by /Belcris/. What if, instead of Eric Draven, Harry Potter had been resurrected by a crow? This is that story.

linkffn(3168612) /Harry Potter and the Boondock Saints/ by /Kalistar/. I have to admit that I don't remember reading this one, but it jumped out at me when I looked for rare crossovers. Should probably read it myself again at some point!

linkffn(8400788) linkffn(8707895) linkffn(10499319) /Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens/ and its sequels /Inquisitor Carrow and the Bureaucracy of Failure/ and /Inquisitor Carrow and the Tournament of Tribulations/ by /littlewhitecat/ is a funny series to the length of almost 350k words about a Harry Potter at Hogwarts that's just a bit too strange for everyone's tastes. Warhammer 40k crossover. I don't think I read everything back when I put it on my list, so it probably annoyed me at some point.

linkffn(10652736) /Lone Traveler: Harry Potter in Arcadia/ by /dunuelos/. Not my favorite by a long stretch, but it's the only Harry Potter crossover with /Joan of Arcadia/ on record.

linkffn(10767188) /Poppa John/ by /MSgt SilverDollar/, in which Harry's father figure is none other than John Rambo. I haven't read this story either, but it's been on my to-read list for months. Sadly it will forever remain incomplete, since the author died this summer.
