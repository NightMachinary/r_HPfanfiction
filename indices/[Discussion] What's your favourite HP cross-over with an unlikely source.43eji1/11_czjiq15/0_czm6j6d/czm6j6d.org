Wow that's a nice diversity. LOL yes I have read their work before. That portal story was great fun! Portal is one of my favourite games. Although it makes me squirm at the thought of Harry growing up there, it is an amusing thought, though, on how he would interact with the wizarding world. Thanks for sharing!
