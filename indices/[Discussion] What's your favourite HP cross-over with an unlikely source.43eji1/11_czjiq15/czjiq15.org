If you want unusual crossovers, I have the perfect author for you: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6716408/Quatermass][Quatermass]]. I stumbled on him when I was looking for H/Fleur fics (he has an ongoing one that is pretty decent), but the sheer variety of the crossovers he's made is impressive. He makes mainly HP/Final Fantasy crossovers, but he's also made crossovers with Portal, with Puella Magi Madoka Magica, with Metal Gear, with Evangelion...I highly reccomend him if you're looking for crossovers that go beyond the usual ones.
