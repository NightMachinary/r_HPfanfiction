I /adore/ crossovers with Fate/stay night.

linkffn(5871255) it's too bad this one was never continued. Caster Medea summons Harry instead of Kojirou as her Servant.

There's also another amazing fic where Harry summons Archer EMIYA who ends up existing as a second personality inside his head, but I forgot what the title of that one was...
