A sword art online and harry potter crossover that I found pretty good.

The Dursley's threw out a dive unit or whatever the things called, Harry salvages it and ends up trapped in the game at something like 8 years old, gets out right after Hogwarts starts up and thinks he's trapped in yet another game with nothing but npcs.
