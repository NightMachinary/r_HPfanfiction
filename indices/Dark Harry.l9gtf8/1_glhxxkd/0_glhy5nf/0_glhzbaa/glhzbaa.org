Ah, fair. Yeah, the 'Dark' Personality thing was always how I saw it - I could also be wrong, though. :D

In terms of lacking character development - that's just the nature of fandom, I'm afraid. We're enthusiastic amateurs, one and all. There's some gems in the rough, but most of us are still rough, I'm afraid. We'll get better and work some stuff out, but there's a reason professional writers rely so heavily on editing. It really helps a work get from good to great. And since we aren't professional writers and don't have professional editors, there's only so far we can get and it's just a thing across lots of categories. Indy!Harry fics do the same with mystical powers and purchased artifacts, romance fics do the same with the less romance-y elements, etc. It's quite difficult to keep a tight, useful plot weave going without a lot of experience or assistance.

If you want stuff that tends to meet higher standards, I'd recommend signing up to the Dark Lord Potter forums. Everything there is cultivated and rated and reviewed (very bluntly) and if it doesn't satisfy, it doesn't make the cut.
