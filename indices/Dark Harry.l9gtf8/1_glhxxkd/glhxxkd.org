That's... the genre though? Dark!Harry means that Harry is a Bad Guy, doesn't it? As in, the name refers to his 'Dark' personality, rather than what magic he uses.

Also, there's considerable debate in the fandom (or at least considerably-different held positions) on whether Dark Magic makes people evil or just attracts those prone to evil things. Was Bella a monster before she started using Unforgiveables, or did her using them turn her Dark? As far as I'm aware, we don't really know, canonically speaking.

And then there's the crowd that says Dark Magic is just a legal distinction and it really isn't all that bad or evil, just misunderstood. I believe their works tend to be categorised under the 'Indy!Harry' and 'Pureblood Culture' labels most often, so I'd suggest that if those are what you're looking for, you should try search those things instead.
