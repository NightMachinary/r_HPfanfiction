Yeah. Moral shades can be so fun, but it's a very difficult balance to strike. Go too far and you end up with Genocidal Dictators who love to Garden, and don't go far enough and you end up with Anakin Skywalker "From my perspective, the Jedi are evil!" types. I do feel like a lot of the people writing those kinds of things do need to read and experience more outside the HP World, because there are some really great examples in other media to draw from.

I'd say a personal favourite example, if you haven't read it, is 'An Unfound Door' by Joe. The Harry in that is probably the closest I've seen in the fandom to that kind of 'dark but not evil' type.

I haven't seen that one. That'd be interesting to play around with though - everyone at all ages seems to use jinx and hexes, so it'd be fun if those did have an ever-so-slight subtle mental effect. Sort of a minor version of the old 'you reducto one person, it becomes easier to reducto a second' thing.

And a lot of people would agree with you. But others would disagree. Like everything else in this fandom, it's a spectrum. :)

I'm of the 'no bad ideas, just ideas in need of more work' opinion, myself. Just gotta find a plot that would help the 'everyone is culturally against a certain section of magic' thing work well. :)
