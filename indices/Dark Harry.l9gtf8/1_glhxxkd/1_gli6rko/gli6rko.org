In theory, potentially, but not too much in practice. It's usually "dark but not evil" and that equates to self-righteous ranting and raving. Everyone just accepts that he does and studies Dark magic because those who don't are bigots. Don't get me wrong, I prefer Dark but not evil, it's just never been written in a way I like.

Word of God tells us all jinxes, hexes and curses are Dark magic, which implies that Dark magic doesn't make you evil, it's just a lot of evil people do it.

  then there's the crowd that says Dark Magic is just a legal distinction and it really isn't all that bad or evil, just misunderstood

I think this is the worst take on it
