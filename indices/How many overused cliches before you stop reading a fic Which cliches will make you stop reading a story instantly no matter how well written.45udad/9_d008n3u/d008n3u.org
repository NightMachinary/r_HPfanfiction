The only one I can think of that actually makes me stop reading, even if I've been enjoying it so far, is sex gods/goddesses. I don't read smut, so I don't run into this a lot, but as soon as I do, I'm gone. I don't care which character it is or how well it's written, I don't want to read about how whoever was /suh amaaaayzing/ in bed. It distracts from the actual relationship, and if it's their first time together, I don't care how experienced they are, there are going to be a few hiccups at first.

I can't think of any other clich√©s that have, on their own, made me nope out. If it's well written enough, I can accept a lot.
