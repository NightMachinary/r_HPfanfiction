Harry crying and needing hugs every five minutes. This happens a lot in harem fics. Harry gets all emotional because he now has people who love him so he breaks down and cries every five minutes. Nope the fuck out. Same with fics with high levels of Angst. Will they, won't they, he accidentally hurts her feelings and then she accidentally hurts his feelings, then they get together and something else keeps them apart and they are so in love and the whole world is gonna end if they can't be together.....Nope the fuck out.
