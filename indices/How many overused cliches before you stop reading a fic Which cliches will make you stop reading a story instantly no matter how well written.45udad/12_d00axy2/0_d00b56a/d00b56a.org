I have a story where Harry is working with the goblins and I basically fret about this constantly. The goblins aren't Harry's bffs but they see the gold potential of working with Harry closely and the goblin king of kings considers him Only Vaguely Annoying. An OVA wizard is essentially a business partner and is either making goblins gold or isn't costing them gold at the least.
