So long as only, like, one or two goblins actually /like/ Harry as a person and the rest just consider him a business asset, I feel you could get away with it. Not sure about the goblin King though. That seems like going up a little too high on the food chain. Unless it's vital to your story, maybe only go as high as Bank Manager (unless the bank manager IS the king of goblins, but my headcanon is that goblins are a bit more widespread than that).
