Found the exact reference: (they're discussing a dictionary/thesaurus program with books on each subject and the letter to flitwick from s+r also referenced a book about goblins by goblins published by wizards)

Professor Flitwick watched his class file out then called out, "Mister Potter, a moment?"

Harry nodded and waved his friends off, telling them he'd meet them at the table.

"I got a letter from Sirius and Remus. It was very intriguing. I've forwarded the correspondence on to a number of dueling masters, charms masters, and the hakan here in Europe."

"Cool. What's the hakan?"

"The king of Europe's goblins. Anything like this requires permission from him. And thankfully, he's my great-uncle so I can ignore a lot of protocol and contact him directly.

Edit: eventually harry and hakan meet and harry suggests spme business ideas as well and that's how he and the hakan end up becoming friendly, a collusion to defraud death eaters in a ,massive project designed to fail before they swoop in and redo the project so it succeeds.
