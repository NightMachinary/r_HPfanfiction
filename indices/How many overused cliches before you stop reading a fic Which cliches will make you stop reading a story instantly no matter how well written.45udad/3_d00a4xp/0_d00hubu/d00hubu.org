  Lord/Lady titles for Purebloods, magical nobility in general
#+end_quote

This is actually pretty logical, it's just terribly executed by all fanfic writers. Britain has a system of titles and honours which still exists in the present day. It would make sense for a magical family here and there to have inherited one, or held on to one since before the Statute of Secrecy.

In fact we know of at least one family this is true for. The Malfoys *are* genuinely nobility. We know the Malfoy family came over to England with William the Conqueror and were given land by him as a reward, and then continued to move in royal circles for centuries. That means that Lucius is going to be (at least) a Baron. Probably higher than a Baron since one of the Malfoys was said to have attempted to woo Queen Elizabeth.

So where does fanfic go wrong?

Firstly, it forgets that the titles are /Muggle/ titles. We never see any Malfoy show off their title, and you imagine they're probably deeply ashamed of it because it reveals a Muggle connection in their past.

Secondly, it makes the mistake of giving holders of titles actual political (or even magical) power. Magical Britain is largely analogous to modern Britain. Grindelwald occurred simultaneously with WW2 (and maybe WW1 also), Voldemort was simultaneous with the Troubles. Trends in the magical and Muggle worlds mirror each other even where there is no direct causal link. So the power of any magical nobility that may have once existed should, like the Muggle world, be now ceremonial only.
