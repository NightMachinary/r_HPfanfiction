Yes, it certainly makes sense that some wizards and witches, especially in older families, would have noble blood, possibly even extant titles, though these may have been "erased" when the ISoS came into effect. You've correctly pointed out the root of my issue though - these are Muggle titles. As you say, they're probably either considered an embarrassment or simply irrelevant in magical society, where the opinions of Muggle monarchs likely held little weight even before the ISoS. It's pretty clear that what matters to Purebloods is the /magical purity/ of their blood, not any relation it might have to Muggle blue-blood.
