I don't have a hard rule as far as a number, but I'm a curmudgeon of a reader and there are so many cliches that will kill my interest in a story.

It's like I have 100 hit points going into a story, and every cliche will do a few dice of damage, depending on how bad it is, until my interest is slain.

I agree, a comprehensive list is impossible. However, here are some of the most egregious and common offenders that come to mind:

- AAA+ magical cores (often bound/stunted intentionally or by accident), power ranks, etc.
- Gringotts inheritance blood test, Heir of multiple founders, surnames with multiple hyphens, etc.
- Lord/Lady titles for Purebloods, magical nobility in general
- First Years falling in love at first sight, especially when a "soul bond" forms that equals instant pre-pubescent marriage
- Harry defeating Voldemort primarily due to his preternatural dodging skills and Quidditch-honed reflexes

A story really has to be well-written to contain more than one of these and still hold my interest.
