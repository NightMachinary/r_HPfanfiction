I don't think it's strange at all. I was never into anime or manga so I can't speak to that aspect from personal experience, but I certainly don't mind power ranks or levels in video or tabletop RPG games. They serve an important purpose there, and are an established element in that genre.

I think part of what attracts people to JKR's magical world is that it seems totally whimsical and haphazard, totally counterintuitive - from a Muggle perspective. Muggles live in a very mechanized, quantitative, and rational world, because they need to in order to survive and thrive. Wizards have magic so they've never had to develop things like logic, common sense, and scientific reasoning; not the way Muggles conceive of such notions, anyway. It might even get in the way sometimes! Many of the most talented wizards we see are slightly (or more) crazy.

I think a lot of the cliches that bother me actually stem from fanfic authors ignoring this, and just introducing Muggle elements into Wizarding society, with a few minor modifications, but still following a Muggle sense of logic. Admittedly, it's hard to step outside of a Muggle worldview, since we're all Muggles.

JKR was quite good at it though, and that gives the world she created much of the luster that keeps us writing and reading fanfics in it. It's easy to ruin this atmosphere when introducing original elements to the canon world.
