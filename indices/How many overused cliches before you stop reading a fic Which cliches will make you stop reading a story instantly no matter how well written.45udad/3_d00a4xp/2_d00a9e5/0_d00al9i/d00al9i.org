If I was a wordsmith, I'd write a story where magical cores exist, but not as DBZ power levels. Rather, they are the ability to do magic, and everyone's is different. This would be why the wand chooses the wizard. Some of it is based on their nature, and the rest on their choices. They would also not just be descriptors of size, color or element but rather things more strange. For instance, in my head, Aberforth Dumbledore's magic tastes of Goat Cheese.
