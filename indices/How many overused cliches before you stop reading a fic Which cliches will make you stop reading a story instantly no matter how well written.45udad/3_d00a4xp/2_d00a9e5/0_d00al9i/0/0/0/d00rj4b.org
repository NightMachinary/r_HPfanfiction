I can see that; a little bit too... eastern philosophy for me, but I could dig it if written well. I think my own views are viewed because I am a lifelong athlete, in particular a distance running athlete (track and field, cross country). In distance running in particular, if you practice, you will get better by training your heart and respiratory systems, but you are still somewhat limited by genetic makeup; some people will just never be great athletes because the potential is not there. I find this very analogous to the use of magic as presented in the book. We have the magical prodigies (Tom Riddle, Voldemort, probably Grindelwald), who by all accounts were simply talented from the outset. Next we have the talented wizards: probably Harry's parents, Bill Weasley, maybe Harry himself; people we know to be powerful, but not really powerful enough to be called prodigious. The next category would be those with talent, but have to work for it. I would place Ron and Neville in this category; by the end of the series they are both competent, not powerful. Then, we have several other levels of degrading magical power, ending in muggles, who don't have any magical ability (but do have the ability to have magical children). I think that each of these people have varying degrees of the magical core system; the "magic muscle;" one thing that we see is that even people who are prodigious in their magical talent had to work quite hard to get to the magical level they find themselves at; much like any athlete will tell you: hard work defeats talent on the highest levels. Basically, the magical core is definitely something that can be physically trained
