I view it as less of a muscle to be worked out and more of a meditative thing. You don't strengthen your magic, you just become more and more connected with it. Better understanding on how it fits in with who you are, how magic works, why someone can cast spells as well as they can. To master magic (in my perfect, if I could actually write, fic) would be to master one's self as well.
