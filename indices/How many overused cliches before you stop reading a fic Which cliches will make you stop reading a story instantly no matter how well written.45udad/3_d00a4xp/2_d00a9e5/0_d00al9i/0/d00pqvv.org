Yes, this. Even in canon, there is clearly a difference between muggles and wizards; one can do magic and the other can't, so what is that difference. And each wizard's magic is clearly different; some people are good at charms, others transfiguration, divination is clearly an inherent talent. This indicates that there is something different, not only between muggles and wizards, but also between different wizards.

I prefer to think of the magical core as an extra bodily system (something akin to the respiratory or nervous systems) that you can train. This can come across as anime-like depending on the way that it is introduced and written. I fully admit that I am influenced by the idea of chakras as introduced in The Last Airbender. However, in canon HP, they make a big deal out of the ability or lack of ability to practice magic. Dumbledore's Army is a group that formed out of this necessity; they felt they weren't getting enough practical experience behind the wand actually doing magic; these people clearly believe that simple theory is not enough to fully be able to do magic. In PoA, we see Harry struggle for months with the Patronus Charm before being able to cast it successfully on any scale. Clearly training it helped. That's why I view the magical core as something that can be trained and strengthened.
