Magical cores...a lot of fantasy series (Like the Grimnoir Chronicles, which is where I got my name) have an allotment of magic a wizard can use. Is this what they mean?

I don't read much of the cliche-ridden fanfics. /Nightmares of Future Past/ and /The Butterfly Effect/ are the only ones I visit often.
