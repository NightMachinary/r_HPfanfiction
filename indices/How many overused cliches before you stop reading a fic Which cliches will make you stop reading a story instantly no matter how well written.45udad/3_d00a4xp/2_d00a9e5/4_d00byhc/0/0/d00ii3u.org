What about people with Down's Syndrome? They have a /much/ larger difference to 'normal' people. Would you consider them to not be human as well, and just able to 'breed' with them? (I don't think that you actually believe this, I'm just trying to point out via analogy where your view might be flawed)

Genetics is complicated, and saying "if you add another component to someone's body they're not human any more" is incorrect.

That said, I agree that magical cores (whether physical or not) are generally a sign of a really bad story.
