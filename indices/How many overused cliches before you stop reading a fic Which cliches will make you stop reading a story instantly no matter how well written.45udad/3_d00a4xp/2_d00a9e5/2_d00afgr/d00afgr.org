I guess the Quidditch reflexes one bugs me because I think the "power he knows not" piece of the prophecy, in a sense the Big Mystery of the series, had an unsatisfying and totally predictable resolution in canon, and I like fanfic that explores other possibilities. The idea that it's just "athleticism" is far too mundane and boring, the irony of it notwithstanding.

I've also probably seen a lot more of these than most as I was really into post-Hogwarts fanfic back before the series was completed. Many authors felt they had to provide some details about Harry defeating Voldemort before they got on with their post-Hogwarts story, and it often defaulted to "boom, reflexes." Hasn't been as much of a cliche since the canon was established.
