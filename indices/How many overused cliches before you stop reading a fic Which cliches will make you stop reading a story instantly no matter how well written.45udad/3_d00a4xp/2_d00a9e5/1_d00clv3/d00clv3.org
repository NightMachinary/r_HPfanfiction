  Heir/lord stories almost always have harry becoming superpolitician just by accepting his role. Hate them.

What always bugs me is when "Harry looks through the Wizengamot records and sees that Supreme Mugwump* Dumbledore has assigned a lackey as Harry's proxy. Harry doesn't like the way the lackey voted and somehow, 'magically' switches those votes and the legislation retroactively is defeated."

*Supreme Mugwump if the ICW. Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. They're not interchangeable. It bugs me when people mix the two up.
