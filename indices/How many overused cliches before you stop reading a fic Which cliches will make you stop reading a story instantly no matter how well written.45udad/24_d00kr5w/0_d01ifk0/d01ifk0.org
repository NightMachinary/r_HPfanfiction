I don't know that that's so much a cliche as a writer trying to describe people in a vivid way. Hermione is a brilliant witch. Draco is a pale boy. I think it's okay to use descriptions like that as long as they aren't overused.

Edit: I'm probably only saying that because I describe Draco as 'pale' 70% of the time.
