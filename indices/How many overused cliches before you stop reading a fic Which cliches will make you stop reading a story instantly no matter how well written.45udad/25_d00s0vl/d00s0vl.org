I don't really have cliches as such that I hate; I just hate bad writing. A lot of cliches can be absolutely horrible if written badly: Weasley/Dumbledore bashing comes to mind (they usually go hand in hand for whatever reason). Anything else that I dislike, I can put down to simply disliking. For example, Harry/Hermione shipping. I personally cannot stand it most of the time, but it has nothing to do with it being cliche (even though it is).
