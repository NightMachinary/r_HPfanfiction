It's worth noting that Marvolo (or was it Morfin?) calls Merope a slut for being attracted to Riddle Sr. They also seem to have her do all the cooking and housework. They're as traditional wizarding values as it comes. Ron also displays casual misogyny throughout the series. It could also just be something like JKR just didn't think through all of the political implications of the dynamics of the world.
