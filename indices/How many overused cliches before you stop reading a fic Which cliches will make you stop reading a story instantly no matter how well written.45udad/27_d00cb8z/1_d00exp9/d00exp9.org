Having the power to defend yourself does not mean you can conceive of doing so, especially if you were raised in such a culture.

For example, in many cults women are treated terribly and made to only fit in 'womens' roles, like tending the home and having children. Many of these women were raised in a modern, liberated society. These cults also tend to have a lot of weapons around. And yet, the women don't rise up and kill everyone, they don't even /leave/ when they can.

It's similar (but not totally the same) in an abusive relationship, a women could easily take up the kitchen knife and stab the bastard who is hitting her. /But she doesn't/, because she can't see herself doing so.

Patriarchal societies existed for thousands of year before women's liberation, and you can not tell me that women in Afghanistan are fundamentally different (less intelligent, less stubborn, less able to be independent), to women in America, and yet despite the fact that 87 per cent of Afghanistan women experience domestic violence, it continues to happen.
