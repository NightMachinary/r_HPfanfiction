"Democratically elected" doesn't really mean the same thing for everyone. It says nothing about who was allowed to vote, for example - in many states not everyone could vote, for example. No matter what the law said.

I'd also not call the wizarding society "more progressive". The fact that they allow slavery is enough to disprove that claim. They might be more progressive in some areas, but given how despicably barbaric many of their laws are, they certainly do not come close to western Democracies.
