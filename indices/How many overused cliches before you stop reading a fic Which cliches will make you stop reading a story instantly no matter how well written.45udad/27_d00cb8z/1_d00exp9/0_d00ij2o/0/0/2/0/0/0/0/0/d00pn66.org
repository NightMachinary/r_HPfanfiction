First, we don't know if it is a popular election, or always was a popular election. It's rather likely that the Wizengamot elected the minister, and we don't know how the Wizengamot members were elected - if they even were elected. The British House of Lords certainly wasn't a democratically elected parliament back then as we understand the term today.

Second, it is the same: Just because the leader is a woman sometimes doesn't mean the society is not patriarchal.
