  First, we don't know if it is a popular election, or always was a popular election.

"The Minister for Magic is democratically elected[...] Generally speaking, and despite many a moan and grumble, their community is behind them in a way that is rarely seen in the Muggle world."

In other words, yes, they are (usually) democratically elected by public vote. The source is that very same Pottermore article.

  Second, it is the same: Just because the leader is a woman sometimes doesn't mean the society is not patriarchal.

Oh, I'm not contesting that. That's not what this is about, though.

It's that many countries still bar women from positions of significant power, and the Wizarding world, at least in Britain, seemed to elect women to such positions much earlier than their Muggle counterparts.

Therefore, the original statement of them being more progressive than many are today is still true.

EDIT for clarity.
