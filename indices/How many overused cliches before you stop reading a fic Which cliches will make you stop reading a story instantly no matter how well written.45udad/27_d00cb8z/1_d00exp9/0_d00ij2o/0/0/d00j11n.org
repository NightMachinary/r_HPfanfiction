There's a hanging question over the extent to which 1692 was when secrecy started vs the date at which a long-existing secrecy was legally recognised. Quidditch Through the Ages, at least, seems to imply that secrecy was the de facto norm well before the statute, and the Muggle and magical worlds were historically separate.

For example, on page 11 of QttA, it refers to the Wizards' Council of the 1200s trying to prevent "Muggle broomstick sightings". Further, chapter five of the book is entirely about "Anti-Muggle Precautions" and we read about the various ways wizards tried to stay hidden from the Muggles hundreds of years before the Statute. The book makes it clear that the Statute not so much created secrecy so much as it created punishments for Ministries that failed to enforce it perfectly: "the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy of 1692 made every Ministry of Magic directly responsible for the consequences of magical sport played within their territories".

So there's a strong implication that magical and Muggle worlds have been separate for a very long time indeed, and certainly far longer than the Statute of Secrecy. As far as it concerns women, a look at the chocolate frog cards indicates no shortage of powerful historical witches not under the control of any patriarchal society, going back all the way to the ancient world.
