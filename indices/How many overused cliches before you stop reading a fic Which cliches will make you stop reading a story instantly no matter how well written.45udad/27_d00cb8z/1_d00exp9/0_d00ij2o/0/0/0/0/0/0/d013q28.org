Yes, exactly. Although it's not an excuse, it's a reason (a hypothetical one, since I'm just guessing). I'd only call it an excuse if I assumed she knew better and just didn't bother doing it, but I'm fairly sure it never crossed her mind to look at her unconscious biases - just as it didn't occur to her that her maths were wrong or that there were plotholes/coincidences/infodumps she might want to revise. Blind spots, maybe (although by DH I get the feeling she was also really tired and willing to rush things into print).
