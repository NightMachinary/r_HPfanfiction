  sexless spinsters like McGonagall
#+end_quote

Ahem. Excuse me, but Minerva McGonagall is way sexier to me than someone like Molly Weasley. I have no problem at all imagining McGonagall having an interesting private life that's simply irrelevant to Harry's story. She has no children, but that doesn't mean no sex. I fully expect she and the other witches on staff unwind on a regular basis with a few drinks, discussions of books and magical theory (they're academics, after all), and who's sleeping with whom.

I do think the books come across as implicitly patriarchal because JKR reproduced what she herself had been raised with. She was a young writer who set a fantasy in a magical boarding school; it didn't occur to her to examine her own assumptions or notice the disparity she'd created. I suspect if she were writing the books now, the distribution of active roles in the series would look a little different.
