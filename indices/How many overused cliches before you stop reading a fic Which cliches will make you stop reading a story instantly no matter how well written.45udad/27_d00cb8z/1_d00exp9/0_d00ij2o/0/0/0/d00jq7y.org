I think this comes back to tight and loose canon, in the /books by themselves/, the society appears to be very patriarchal.

Molly stays at home, despite the fact they need money and she could work. Narcissa is also a 'stay at home mum', as were Lily and Alice from what we know.

The only married magical women who worked at all appeared to be Luna's mum, and she 'worked' from home, but may not have been paid.

The women who /do/ have jobs are almost sexless spinsters like McGonagall and never been married (or will be) like Bones and Umbridge. Apart from Bones, /all/ the positions of power mentioned are men.

In the national sport, there is a team set aside of /just/ women, even though the sport is clearly not affected by physical strength and therefore all the teams should be integrated and there be no need for a women only team.

Tonks is the only female auror we know of, and she was a rare metamorphmagus apprenticed to Moody himself.

In other words, the few women who are not in very traditional 'women roles' seem to be rare exceptions, not the norm. In the wider canon powerful women are mentioned more, sure. But for just the books, it could be thought to be very male dominated.
