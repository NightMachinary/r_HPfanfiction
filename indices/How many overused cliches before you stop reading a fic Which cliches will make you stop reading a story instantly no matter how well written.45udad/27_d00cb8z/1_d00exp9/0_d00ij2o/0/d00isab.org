I beg to differ. The magical and the muggle world didn't separate until 1691 or so. Until then it was one world. And that world was mostly patriarchal. It's not really inconceivable that witches were raised to think they had to obey men, and believed it (a big part of them at least), because that's what happens today in many patriarchal societies still.

The witches would probably have taken a while to overcome the bias after the SoS as well.
