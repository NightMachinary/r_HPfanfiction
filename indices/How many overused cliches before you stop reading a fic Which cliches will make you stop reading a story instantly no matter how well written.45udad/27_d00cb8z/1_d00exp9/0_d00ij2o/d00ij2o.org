The difference between Afghanistan and America isn't the women, it's the men. As far as I know there's no country where women have seized their rights by force. Rather, male bodies have become convinced of the correctness of women's rights and passed laws recognising them.

This is the magical disanalogy. In the magical world women would be able to seize their rights by force, though actually even that doesn't make sense. Because men have no monopoly on magical violence as they do/did in the Muggle world, there's no reason to think a patriarchal society would arise in the first place.
