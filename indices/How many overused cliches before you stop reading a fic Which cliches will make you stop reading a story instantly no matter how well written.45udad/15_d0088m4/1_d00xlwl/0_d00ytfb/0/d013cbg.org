Yes, but once you put something so unusual in a story - and make it seem rare even in the wizarding world - the readers' expectations will be raised that you put it there for a reason. Take metamorphing away from Tonks, and it doesn't change her character arc or her actions at all. Which makes the talent itself feel like a red herring (to me).

I've never read a fic that makes Harry a metamorphmagus (not challenging their existence, just that I tend to bounce off fics that load Harry down with extra powers), but I could easily imagine it being an interesting part of his time at Hogwarts - how he uses it, how it changes other students' reactions to him, how it enables him to sneak around the castle, how he fools some of the teachers, what might happen if he loses control of it, e.g. doesn't realize his annoyance has just transformed his face into ugly!Draco, how he might take risks by trying to pass himself off as someone important in order to get information - the sort of stuff Harry would do, but with a different spin on it because he has this non-canon ability he can't resist using.

I don't think it /has/ to be a clich√©, but of course that entirely depends upon the individual writer's talent.
