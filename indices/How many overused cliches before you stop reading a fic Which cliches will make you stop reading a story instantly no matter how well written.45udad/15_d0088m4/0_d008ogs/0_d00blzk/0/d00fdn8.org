Imagine 5 year olds playing in the snow, and one of them announces they are the Ice Queen, and the others never let her forget that, no matter how much she wants them to.

Like, a Harry/Daphne story where she is kind, warm, bubbly, whatever. Wonderful in almost every way. But horribly, horribly, horribly blood purist. Not Death Eater violent blood purist, but still not a fan of the mudbloods.
