I don't particularly care about clichés as long as they're well written, but I suppose there would be a limit to how many I can deal with. I tend to not read stories set at a magic school, which usually gets rid of a lot of clichés. Whenever one does come up, though, it's usually not a big deal.

I even read through goblin inheritance fics (even though they're almost all hot garbage) because I want to give the author a chance.
