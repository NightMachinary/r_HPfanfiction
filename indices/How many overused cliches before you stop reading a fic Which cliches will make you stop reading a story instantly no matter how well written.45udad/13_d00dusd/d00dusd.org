God damn mother f-ing Mary /freaken/ Sues/Stus. I'm all for powerful characters, but if there isn't a logical progression from regular ole, cannon Harry to Mega-Badass-Unicorn-God-Potter then I just quit. I can't do it. I want to see the struggles and joys a person goes through when trying to better oneself not just... "Oh opps I can turn into a basilisk and rule the Forbidden Forest now. Fear me Dumbledork".
