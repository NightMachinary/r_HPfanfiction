The stories I just stop reading are those that use cliches to set up for more cliches. Like a never ending chain of uninspired writing. And there are more of those out there than you'd believe possible.

I think I have the double dozen full of stories that just rewrite entirew dialogues.

Also fics that start in first year, have major canon-changes, and /still/ insist on Hermione getting caught in a toilet by a troll. I mean, come on. As if Ron delivering the straw that breaks the camels back for Hermione is some sort of multi-dimensional fixture.

Instant Death Condition:

- Harry Potter shopping spree that takes longer than 3 paragraphs

- Dumbledore having an internal monologue with the words "don't they see..." and "greater good" somewhere in them.

- Something indicating an Over 9000 Magic Core Powerlevel
