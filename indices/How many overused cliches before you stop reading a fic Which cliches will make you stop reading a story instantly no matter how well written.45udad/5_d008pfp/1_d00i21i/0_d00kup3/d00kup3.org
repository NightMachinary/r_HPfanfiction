Using a muggle trauma to point out the problems in the magical world is not a bad idea, but I have a couple of questions about this idea specifically:

1. why does it have to be female Harry? A male Harry is in the same place mentally as a female Harry. Bad fanfiction (*this is not what I think*) make Harry female and then abuse her because they believe that females are weaker, more vulnerable, more emotional, or females are more traumatized by events then males, there making a 'better' story. Males are humans too.

2. why does it have to be rape? Why not physical assault? A bombing? A simple car crash? Rape removes power from the victim, but the situations that Harry gets into are not about him being completely powerless. Even in the graveyard he is given back self agency by having his wand back. So it seems odd that you want to equate what he goes through in the magical world to the muggle rape.

3. Why Dudley? Sure it is more 'angsty' and a 'bigger betrayal' to have family attack fem Harry, but Dudley is a stupid kid who used his fists to get his way, and eventually grew up to say to Harry he "was never a waste of space". Dudley, for all his faults, never seemed to be about controlling others, about taking power away from others. So why make him the rapist?
