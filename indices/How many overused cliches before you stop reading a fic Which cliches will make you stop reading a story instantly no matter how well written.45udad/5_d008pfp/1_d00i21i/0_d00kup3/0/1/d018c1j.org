That's an interesting train of revelatory thought; I like it.

However, the same situation could work if Dudley tries to strangle Harry/severely beat her instead of trying to rape her. Domestic violence and muggings are also one of those 'everyone knows to call the police' cultural touchstones and frankly, huge handprints on Harry's neck makes it more obvious to everyone that something is WRONG, whereas attempted rape itself doesn't leave as many visible bruises unless beating occurs.

Dudley never uses sexual humiliation against canon Harry- he once refers to Cedric as Harry's boyfriend but never otherwise calls Harry a poofer, canon!Dudley never implies that Dudley thinks sexual prowess is important (by saying that girls love him, etc.). He just beats Harry and other kids up for lunch money and calls Harry a freak. And yes, boys frequently use sexual humiliation against other boys to bully them- calling them gay, saying they have a small dick, calling them a big pussy, etc. But Dudley never does because his mind doesn't work that way.

So I think it's fair to say that not only is attempted rape or sexual humiliation not something that is limited to girls, but Dudley's complete lack of sexual taunts towards male!Harry means that it'd be OOC of him to try to rape a female Harry.

Also, speaking as a woman, it'd be nice to read about violence towards us that isn't likely to get an online sexual predator's rocks off too. Tbh, why normalize rape when you don't have to?
