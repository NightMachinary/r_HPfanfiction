1. Dudley, as far as I know, is heterosexual and would not rape a male Harry. He might attack him, but that's not really anything different than what male harry usually puts up with anyway. An author could make Dudley gay if they wanted to for a Male/Male rape, but that's their prerogative. I agree that bad fanfiction does female rape for all the wrong reasons, but this choice is more in relation to Dudley than Harry.

2. It has to be rape because, in this instance, Dudley is severely drunk and was earlier turned down for a date (which is the reason he's drunk). It also makes the attack more personal and immediately threatening than Dudley simply taking a swing at her which he does anyway. Admittedly, this might be a bad reason, but to be honest I've never really seen any /good/ reasons to put rape into a story, so that's likely something I'll have to look into. A bombing is also a good idea, but it lacks the personal intent-to-harm nature of his previous encounters (Quirrel trying to murder him, Diary Riddle directing the basilisk, the graveyard. Can't really count 3rd year cuz' the dementors will kill anything).

3. See #2. However, I do admit I have a poor grasp of Dudley's character, which is something I will have to fix. In this case it is caused by Dudley's frustration with himself and everything else in general. Dudley very well might not normally be receptive to the idea of rape, but being drunk can give someone the capacity to make very bad decisions they might not normally make.

The point I'm trying to make with the scene isn't the scene itself, it's fem!Harry's /response/ to the scene. What would you normally do in a rape situation? You run away. You call the police. Harry doesn't run away because she's used to not being /able/ to run away, so it doesn't cross her mind. The only reason she runs in the graveyard is because the Priori Incantatem ghosts told her it was even possible, and that the portkey would take her back. So when Dudley tries to rape her, she does what she always ends up doing in dangerous situations: She deals with it herself as best she can.

After the scene, Harry reflects on what happened and what she should have done. She realizes she should have called the police, because that's what you do when someone tries to rape you: /You call the police/ once you're able to do so. Why? So people who are /trained/ to deal with this and /capable/ of dealing with this hunt down the rapist and put him in jail. This is what the average civilian does in a dangerous situation. Yet at Hogwarts Harry has had to deal with deadly beasts and people trying to kill her. And she deals with it herself, because she thinks "This is Hogwarts. This is magic. This is the bad that comes with the good." But that isn't the case in the muggle world; rape isn't the flipside of getting a eating ice cream or getting a good job, because rape is a /crime/ and it's not her responsibility to deal with the rapist. Yet in the magical world she has to deal with things that could easily kill her, when there are other people who are /trained and capable/ who should be dealing with this instead.

With this in mind, her revelation is that the magical world /is not the exception/ and it is not her job to deal with all the dangerous things that she has dealt with.

Gah that was long. Hope that answered some questions.
