Well, it kinda goes against my notion that the Dursleys were never physically abusive to Harry, but that's a personal preference. It makes sense for something like that to be the starting point for a lot of conflict. I think it would be difficult to connect Dudley's behaviour with events at Hogwarts. It /could/ come across as quite the logical leap.
