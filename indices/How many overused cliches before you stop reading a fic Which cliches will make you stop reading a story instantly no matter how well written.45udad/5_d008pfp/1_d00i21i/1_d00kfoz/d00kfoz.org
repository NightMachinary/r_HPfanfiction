Unless you're changing the story a lot, the Ministry didn't deal with Quirrell and the basilisk because they were never informed of them. Also if Harry sees something like Voldemort trying to grab the Philosopher's stone and thinks s/he can stop him, it would be his/her problem because who is the #1 target once Voldemort gets his body back? Harry. It would be stupid to do nothing because you'd get killed later because of it.
