Replace "Ministry" with "Teachers" and it'll still work the same. They are competent adults who should have dealt with it instead. And really, the Trio gave a seriously weak effort at getting an adult to deal with it. They went to find McGonagall and when she snubbed them, instead of thinking "Hey there are at least two other Heads of Houses we can go warn", they think "Welp nobody's going to do anything, better do it ourselves."

As for Voldemort, most people don't try to fight off an armed robber in their own home, they just barricade themselves in a room and call the police. And then go into witness protection if it turns out that robber has a hardon for their death.

BUT MAGIC.
