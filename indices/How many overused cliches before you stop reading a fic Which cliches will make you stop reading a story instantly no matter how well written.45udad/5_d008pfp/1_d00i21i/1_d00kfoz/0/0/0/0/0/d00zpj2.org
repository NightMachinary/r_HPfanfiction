Perhaps so, but I still think they gave up too easily in regards to getting help. I suppose it doesn't help that JKR gave Harry /such/ a screwed up sense of personal capability. He just got into school, he knows /maybe/ two spells, and he decides to go after Snape, a fully grown wizard who has completed his schooling and now teaches at that same school, undoubtedly learning even more in the process.

I know kids don't think things through, but most at least know they have limits...
