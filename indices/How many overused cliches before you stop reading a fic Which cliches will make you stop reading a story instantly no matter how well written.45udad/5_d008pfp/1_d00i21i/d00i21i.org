I'm actually planning a story with attempted rape by Dudley on Fem!Harry as a catalyst for her to realize that what she's been dealing with at Hogwarts (Quirrell, Basilisk, dementors, etc) is really /not okay/, and that if the Ministry won't deal with it, it's not her job either.

I'm hoping that I can treat it with the proper gravity, but what do you think of it?
