I don't have a set limit on cliches within stories. If you see one example of bad writing, chances are good that the story is going to include all of the other horrid cliches in the fandom (bashing, Mary-Sues, blatant author tract, etc) as well. For some reason, all of the really awful bits in fanon tend to clump together. Of course, some of my favourite crack-fics employ all of these and more, but they get a pass because they're invariably hilarious.

If a story has noncon or dubcon, though, I'll stop reading immediately. Using rape as a plot device instantly removes any interest I might have developed.
