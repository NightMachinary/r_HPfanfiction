Any kind of extensive magical training before the age of 11. I don't mean little stuff like the stinging hex or tripping jinx, but full on Dark Arts or NEWT/OWL level spells.

Students don't start Hogwarts till 11, I'm not sure exactly why but I highly doubt it was just an arbitrary number pulled out of a hat. So when Harry shows up for his first year at Hogwarts knowing more about the Dark Arts than Severus Snape I'm out.
