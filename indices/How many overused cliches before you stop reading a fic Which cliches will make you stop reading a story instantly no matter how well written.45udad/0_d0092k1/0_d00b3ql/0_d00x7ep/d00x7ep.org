Yea, I can agree with the distinction between knowledge in theory and training in casting. It is one of the things I don't understand about magical students not receiving a formal education before 11. You would think that it would be detrimental to the statue of secrecy to have magical children running around with freaked out parents trying to figure out how their child just summoned a cookie.

Personally, I would love a story where Harry was raised by an insane magical theorist and consequently has all these wild, and even occasionally correct, ideas about how magic works.
