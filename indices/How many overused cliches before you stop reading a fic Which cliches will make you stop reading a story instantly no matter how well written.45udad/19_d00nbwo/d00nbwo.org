I have a hard time when one character is suddenly so far out of character that they become someone else. Like the author wanted to make their own character but just used established ones instead. This isn't as bad but, I read one that started out good, then towards the end Hermione is suddenly calling Umbridge "Umbitch" and fucking Ron on a desk at Hogwarts. And up until that point everyone had been relatively in character and nothing was totally out there.
