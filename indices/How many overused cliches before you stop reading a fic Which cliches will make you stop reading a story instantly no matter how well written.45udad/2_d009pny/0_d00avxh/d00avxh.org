Pretty much all my squicks can be summed up under the heading of: Screwing around with human reproductive biology. It started as just Omegaverse (I read a lot of Johnlock a couple of years ago and holy shit is that ship filled with Omegaverse) and then it became Institutionalized sexual power dynamics, and then I kept broadening it until it reached its current incarnation.

I have no problem at all with people screwing around with human sexuality, it's just when either a) governments get involved or b) human biology is messed with (e.g. mpreg) that I'll nope out of there in an instant. There's a Johnlock fic where absolutely everyone is either sexually submissive or dominant, which is an interesting premise and I might have really enjoyed it, except that everyone had to register their preference and it was on all their IDs and that was just too much for me.

So this was basically a really long way of saying: I agree.
