You've hit my "back-button" triggers! Especially any sort of bashing or Harry "realising" the so-called "truth" about other characters. It involves characters being manipulative and/or emphasising their flaws without thinking about their strengths. It /infuriates/ me, because that sort of thinking pretends these were two- or even one-dimensional characters, when they're obviously not. I mean, /really/...it almost feels lazy to write that sort of story. There's so much canon material out there nowadays to use in order to understand/ build character motivations etc. If someone really wants to write a "fix-it" type fic about certain characters' attitudes, there are ways of making those fics be about character growth and development (rather than irreversible flaws)... I like that sort of thing. No character in the HP books (except perhaps Voldemort) is completely "black" or "white". It took me a while to understand that properly (urgh, the mental gymnastics I'd do because of James Potter and Severus Snape and Lily and the Marauders...gah!!).
