The Weasleys are gold diggers! Pfft. Yeah. Okay. Worst gold diggers in existence, I guess.

Harry is the sweetest thing since cotton candy and must be defended against the mean, mean world. Ugh! This is often paired with Harry being exceptionally delicate-looking.

Harry the long-suffering martyr. He's depression, guilt, and self-involvement given human form. EVERYTHING is his fault.

Harry does a 180 and decides everyone is against him. It's labeled as independence but comes off like extreme paranoia. Related: Harry gets a long list of innate skills (often from goblins.) Usually paired with Harry buying half the books and tools from Diagon and Knockturn Alley.

Harry is beat/chained/almost-killed by the Dursleys regularly, and he is terrified of them. The Dursleys are all kinds of messed up but not only is habitual beatings not canon but Harry is not a wilting flower around them. At some point before he turned 11, he decided they were fools and often lets them know it.

Draco is a smooth operator and the Prince of Slytherin. In fact, all Slytherin's are ultra-cool and detached. Please. The only one who has maintained that image has been Blaise Zabini.

Snape is secretly nice... Yup. That's where I stop. Sometimes paired with James being an irredeemable jerk who probably gave Lily a love potion.

Dumbledore is a masterful manipulator who acts like a dim child when he's caught. "Why would anyone not agree with my totally-evil plan? I don't get why they're mad." That's the great manipulator?
