While I found the whole "/Harry is the heir of half a dozen magical families/" amusing in the beginning - these kinds of stories could be great fun to read if done right - it quickly became incredibly popular and authors actually took the whole thing seriously, which is the worst mistake ever. The same is true for those who write a Dumbledore/Weasley bashing fic and be serious about it. Make a parody of it, have fun with overdone characterizations and I love to read it.

The whole idea of Gringotts providing more than storage and security services (which is what vaults are used for, after all) is actually quite smart. It's difficult to get a good idea on canon!goblins, but it's clear that they are rather distrustful of wizards. From there it is not too large a leap to "/lets subtly cheat the dumb wizards out of everything we can get our hands on/". Although I like that kind of thing (if done right), the problem most authors have is its inclusion in their stories when there is no need to do that. Goblins aren't important for wizards, since they only view them as beasts who keep the wizards' money safe, which is exactly why it has become a bit bothersome to read about these amazing goblins every bloody time. I'd much rater see it done right a dozen times than wrong by hundreds of authors.

On another note, I have a real difficulty of getting into stories that feature Slytherins as main characters, whether told from their point of view or not. I don't think many of them are nearly as bad as they're made out to be in canon, just growing up in such an environment is reason enough why they aren't shining examples of humanity. It's not easy to write about an antagonist without throwing the whole canon on its head. The vast majority of post-Hogwards Draco/Hermione stories for example, or the Severus/Hermione AU stories for that matter, totally break my suspension of disbelief. All of them spent years growing up as each others enemies and even fought a war over their difference in their outlook and conviction. I don't think them finding romance with each other works so quickly after the end of hostilities. Maybe put such a story 20-30 years into the future and after each side of such a pairing has gotten enough life experience and I may start to believe that it could eventually be possible. Haven't seen anything like that yet, but I admit to not having looked too hard for it either.
