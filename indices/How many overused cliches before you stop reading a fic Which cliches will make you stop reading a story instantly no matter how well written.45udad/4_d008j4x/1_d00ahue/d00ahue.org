The only time, IMO, that giving Dumbledore some stupid, shitty name is when it is a Death Eater child (cough cough Draco Malfoy cough cough) trying /just a little/ too hard to be the whole 'yay Death Eaters! Boo blood traitors!' thing. Though the only time I actually recall that is a point during [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile, where Draco remembers making comic strips about Minna McGoggleall and Dumbass O'Dore]], so I'm not sure if my caveat actually exists or not.
