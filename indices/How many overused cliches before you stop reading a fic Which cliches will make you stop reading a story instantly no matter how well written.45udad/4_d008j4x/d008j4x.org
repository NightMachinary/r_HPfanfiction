Anytime that somebody uses a childish nickname for Dumbledore like Dumblebum, I quit right away. It happens in a lot of AU stories where Harry finds out he's being manipulated, but if he's savvy and mature enough to do that, he's not going to resort to calling him silly names like a seven year old. It immediately ruins the story for me.
