I appreciate this, but it bothers me when people say "affect" is a verb and "effect" is a noun. I know this one says "most of the time," and people who mix them up probably aren't throwing around the noun form of "affect" or the verb form of "effect," but still, they're useful words, and it makes them sad when people don't acknowledge them!
