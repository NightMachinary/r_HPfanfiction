Speaking of which, I remembered this post from DLP a while back (one poster making fun of another's spelling mistake):

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    /Dumbledore is very weary of him because of his name./
  #+end_quote

  /Dumbledore sighed and sank back in his chair, discarding the year's enrollment list. From the corner his Phoenix, Fawkes, trilled softly. "Another fucking Black, Fawkes. It's always the Blacks."/
