I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt here and assume you didn't think about what I said. The seven confrontations with Voldemort are:

1. Harry survives the AK as a baby, Voldemort loses his body.
2. Harry char-broils Quirrel during the showdown in PS.
3. Harry lucks out by magic wand BS and a strange form of necromancy, escapes when outnumbered, outgunned, tired and injured.
4. Voldemort drops the ball in OotP and misses his chance to kill him when Dumbledore arrives.
5. The Battle of the Seven Potters = magic wand BS part II: revenge of the phoenix.
6. Harry commits suicide by sociopath in the Forbidden Forest = Harry's Magic Blood Part II: the Jesus Maneuver.
7. The Elder Wand refuses to kill Harry, and apparently this translates to the killing curse bouncing back for some reason off of the disarming spell (or charm).

CoS doesn't count, because the Horcrux is not Voldemort, its a separate entity, an anchor, not Voldemort part 2. Evidence? Dumbledore says during the Prophecy explanation that Harry has now survived /four/ times from Voldemort (as a baby, during PoS, in the graveyard, and in the Ministry). So Diarymort doesn't count.

Also, Godric's Hollow and Malfoy Manor do not count, since Harry never actually confronted Voldemort (it was stupidly close though).
