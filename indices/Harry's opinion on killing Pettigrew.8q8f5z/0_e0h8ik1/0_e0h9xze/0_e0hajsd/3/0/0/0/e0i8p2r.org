The horcruxes are fragments of Voldemort's self, but they are not him. The diary was not aware of anything that had occurred since its creation, and had to learn about it through Ginny.

Based on Rowling's description that Harry's scar pain is caused by the soul fragment wanting to return to him, the individual horcruxes most likely innately wish to return to the “master soul” i.e. Voldemort. This is likely what would have happened in CoS had the diary succeeded (remember it doesn't know about the prophecy so it would think the basilisk could kill him).

The horcruxes each have defenses based on the nature of the object: locket and ring if you wear them, diary if you write in it, etc. They are more like sentient cursed artifacts, and getting rid of them is a way of delaying the conflict with Voldemort in the story (look up the term McGuffin for a better explanation than from me, I'm just a moron).
