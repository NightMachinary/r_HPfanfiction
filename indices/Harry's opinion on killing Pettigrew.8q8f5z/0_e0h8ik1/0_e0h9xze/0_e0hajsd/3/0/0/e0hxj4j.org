Oh....you have a point. And Pardon me, if i do count CoS as an Encounter. The Horcrux isnt Voldemort, but a "seperate Entity"...yes, BUT he is from Voldemort (ok, considering this, the Locket would also have been an encounter, but it only could defend itself and not actively interact). Although i wonder if Voldemort can listen to the Conversation his younger self has with Harry. So the Horcruxes are a dark magic way to create an evil clone, never saw it that way. I assumed, if Riddle came to life, the "ghostly" Voldemort would vanish or drawn into his new Body.
