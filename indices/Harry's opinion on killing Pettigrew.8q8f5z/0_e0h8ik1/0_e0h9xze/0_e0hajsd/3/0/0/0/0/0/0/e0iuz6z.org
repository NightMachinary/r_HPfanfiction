sure....but, a prophecy cant avoid unfortunate circumstances. As i said before, if Fawkes hasnt appeared, Harry would be dead either by the Basilisk glare or its Poison. And lets not forget the Dementors in Book 3. His Soul was saved by a Deus Ex Machina.

I dont know, what makes Fawkes appear in CoS. In the Movie, Dumbledore told Harry that Harry proved loyalty to the Headmaster.
