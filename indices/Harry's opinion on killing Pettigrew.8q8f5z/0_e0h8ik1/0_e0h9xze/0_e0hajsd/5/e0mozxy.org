I think Voldemort's gets a little too much credit for his meticulousness. Yes, his plans are sophisticated and successful, but his own arrogance is generally his downfall. His inability to comprehend certain feelings or actions on a base level means he doesn't plan for that eventuality.

He cannot imagine loving someone so much that they would fly in the face of power, glory, and riches. He doesn't understand loving someone so much that they'd still choose to die for another when given the choice not to. He cannot imagine not fearing death, and doesn't understand sacrifice, and while acknowledging the protection from sacrifice, doesn't understand it.

That's why he never believed that Snape would work against him. What's one woman against the power he can offer him? For Lily, surely no other life is more important than your own? When Harry walks to his death, he doesn't realize that killing Harry - who has chosen entirely to let Voldemort kill him - will once again power a protection that he can't penetrate.

I think a better version of the theme would be /true evil does not understand or acknowledge love, and will always fall to the good that does/.
