If he knew where Voldemort was.

If he considered using guns, which requires at least a degree of training not available in the magical world.

If Voldemort has no defenses whatsoever.

If Harry can sneak up on a man who committed multiple murders undetected and with a distinct paranoia.

If Harry has an understanding of bombs or radiation.

If Harry has the sword and can get close enough.

That's a lot of ifs, any one of which being off leads to Harry dead, injured or captured.
