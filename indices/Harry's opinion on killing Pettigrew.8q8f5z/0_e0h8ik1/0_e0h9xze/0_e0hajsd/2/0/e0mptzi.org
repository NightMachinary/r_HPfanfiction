Here's why you can't kill Voldemort through non-magical means: it doesn't effect the soul. The only reason Voldemort is alive is because his soul is anchored to the living plane. Even if you kill his body, his soul would stay here.

I think Hermione says something along those lines earlier when she jokes about how running a sword through Ron wouldn't actually mangle his soul. So maybe at the end, once all the anchors are removed, it's possible - Rowling never makes it clear, if the soul leaving the plane is tied to the Voldmort's physical death or it was the Avada Kedavra that affected the soul.

Last, I agree with [[/u/XeshTrill]] on the extra if's. All of those require a level of knowledge that most seventeen year olds don't have, especially those that haven't really interacted with the outside society with six years. Not to mention, there's the whole magic vs muggle weaponry issue to get into.
