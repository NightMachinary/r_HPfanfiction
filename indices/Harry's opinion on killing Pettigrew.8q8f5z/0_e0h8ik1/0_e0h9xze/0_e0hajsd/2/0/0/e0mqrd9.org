You can always vacuum the soul later, something that should be a lot easier without the Death Eaters and Voldemort trying to kill you. Or even let it float around, since you can simply kill it later (when he has a body again and you have executed all Death Eaters for war crimes and crimes against humanity).

And while shield charms might stop bullets and yadda yadda, the whole point of a sneak attack is destroying Voldemort's physical body without giving him the chance to react. An AKM fires 600 bullets every minute. Even assuming just one second reaction time for Voldemort, that leaves still at least 10 bullets (any more would probably not be on target with an untrained shooter anyway), each with 2 kJ worth of kinetic energy. AKs are really easy to operate (see child soldiers in Africa), all Harry has to do is load it, know where the safety and trigger can be found and use the best invisibility cloak in existence to take care of Voldemort.
