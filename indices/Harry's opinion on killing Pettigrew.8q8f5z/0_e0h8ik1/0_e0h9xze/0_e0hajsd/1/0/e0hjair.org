I'm going to put on my historian hat here:

Trends like the popularity of fairy tale heroes and the popularity of antiheroes wax in wane in most western literature and culture. In the 1970s, Jaws and Star Wars kicked off a lot of that trend. In the 1990s it shifted back to popular antiheroes. Harry Potter and a number of other series kicked this trend off again in the early to late 2000s, and in the last ten years it has been a slow march toward antiheroes.

Look at this sub: arguably the most popular fics are dark fics about Harry and possibly the most liked romances depict him with a "bad" girl (ex. powerful Hermione, Slytherin girls, etc.). But good Hermione and Ginny used to be much more popular in the fandom over a decade ago.

And in all fairness, its a fantasy book for children. Rowling did NOT want to focus on the reality of the moral gray area, and only in the 7th and /maybe/ 6th book did she really show some semblance of this (ex. Harry crucioing Amycus for terrible reasons).
