Yes he's a very reactionary character, but I think thats partially because he doesn't understand/can't predict the consequences further down the line. For example if he knows that his friends will follow him to the MoM at the end of OotP and fight in life or death battles with actual death eaters, I'm sure he would be more serious with DA and their training.

For a Harry that travelled back in time, I can see him much more proactive because he /knows/ whats coming and he really cares about his friends and family.
