  Its about how evil will always fail to overcome good and innocence. Unfortunately, the heavy handedness of some of it does sort of also look like its saying that studying and planning are a waste of time because someone more talented or lucky will always be better than you (that was not Rowling's intent, but is something of a byproduct of her characterizations).

Pretty much impossible to avoid really. If evil necessarily fails, it follows that good just need to exist to succeed. The HP books send out a rather bad message, and these characterizations merely made it clearer. Having prepared and competent heroes defeat the bad guy would have obfuscated the importance of innocence and sacrifice.
