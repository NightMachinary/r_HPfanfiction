I think Harry surviving at the last duel with Voldemort(if one could call it that) was a cop-out by JK. Sometimes, killing someone as evil as Voldemort can't be classified as soul-changing for the killer. Look at Molly, for example. She killed Bellatrix by her wand and nobody blinks an eye or even considers that she can be evil. Because, she isn't. Killing is necessary when it comes to people like Bellatrix and Voldemort, no matter the cost to one's soul.
