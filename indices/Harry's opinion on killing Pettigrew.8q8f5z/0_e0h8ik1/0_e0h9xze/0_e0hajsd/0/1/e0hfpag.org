Yeah, I get that. It was just sort of scary to realize.

To be more specific, I read the books as a kid as they came out. And there was all this put out there about how "the Harry Potter series is encouraging reading and rejuvenating youth literacy, etc."...and this is the subliminal message in the story.

I literally knew twelve-year olds who used this series as proof that things will just work out if your good, and you didn't need to worry about stuff. And its a fantasy book.
