Short version: he didn't.

Long version: Harry as a character is almost /entirely/ reactionary. In some regards this is to his benefit. But it means that he has practically no foresight or planning ability within canon (or at least that is displayed). He takes things as they come. Everything about him reflects this.

To be completely fair, thats partly how most teenagers are as well (been there, done that). Its just more egregious since Harry knows the kind of stuff he gets involved in but takes no steps to prepare.

More to the point, what could he have really done anyway? Like it or not, the only one who could conceivably take down Voldemort in /fair/ fight was Dumbledore, and he committed suicide by dungeon bat. Realistically Harry should never have survived, but thats the point isn't it? Voldemort plans things out meticulously, studies and learns, and prepares for the future, and Harry escapes or defeats him personally seven times essentially through a combination of luck, moral strength and quick thinking.

/Its about how evil will always fail to overcome good and innocence/. Unfortunately, the heavy handedness of some of it does sort of also look like its saying that studying and planning are a waste of time because someone more talented or lucky will always be better than you (that was not Rowling's intent, but is something of a byproduct of her characterizations).
