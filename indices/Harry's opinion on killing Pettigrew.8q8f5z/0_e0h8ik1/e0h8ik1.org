Hindsight is 20-20.

Anyway, I think you are treating Harry killing as far more clinically than is merited based on canon. Even after everything that happens, he never leads off with trying to kill (see the Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts). And sure, he seems regretful, but put it in context. He regrets that mercy led to his problem, not that he didn't murder Pettigrew.

This may seem like they are the same thing, but they're not. There is an important difference between regretting that you spared someone, and wishing you had finished them yourself.
