Besides which, killing Pettigrew by no means guarantees anything, except that Voldemort does not come back in the same manner or necessarily in the same way.

- Bertha Jorkins was still in Albania, and Voldemort could possess or manipulate people as a shade
- Crouch Jr. is still fighting the Imperius Curse, and would still have triggered the Dark Mark
- There is no guarantee of anyone believing the stuff about Pettigrew being the traitor, especially if he is dead. Fudge was focused on not rocking the boat, and this certainly would given his personal assosciation.
- Lupin still would have gone all wolfman that night, because apparently even a life-long werewolf can forget about the full moon (since age 6).
- Snape was still vindictive, he would likely not have sided with Sirius being innocent unless /forced/ too.
- Sirius probably still would have to be on the run, though may more people may be made aware of his innocence.
