If you want to play the what if game, we will be here all day. Pettigrew escaping was a way for Rowling to bring Voldemort back. Thats why that happened from the narrative perspective.

And the only time he could conceivably finish him off was in the graveyard, which he would have no way of knowing about (he was in dog form nearby, no one but Harry, and possibly Dumbledore through Snape, knows what happens until he comes back to Hogwarts).

And as for the "life debt" to Harry...honestly I think Rowling either couldn't figure out how to work it in reasonably or just did not remember until later. Thats why the whole "moment of doubt" that causes his death happens in the first place. It has no real bearing on the plot, even though Dumbledore hinted at it being far more significant than this.
