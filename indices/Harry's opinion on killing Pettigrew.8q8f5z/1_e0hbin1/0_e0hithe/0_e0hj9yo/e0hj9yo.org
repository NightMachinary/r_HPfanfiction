But, I meant what if Sirius gets the chance to finish off Pettigrew <i>after</i> GoF and after his name is cleared. He doesn't have much importance after that in the books either, except maybe to prove Dumbledore's point that Pettigrew owed Harry his life and thus dying by the hand Voldemort gifted him.
