Lots of variables here.

Does Pettigrew die quickly/cleanly, or does he get a more messy death? A messy or confronting death is more likely to be an issue for Harry - he's not an overly squeamish kid in the books, but even so.

Does Harry know this is happening in advance, or does he find out after Sirius has already done it, so that there's nothing he can do about it even if he decides he wants to? Does Harry - a bit like in PoA - even get to /choose/ whether Pettigrew dies? Being presented with a guy already dead is a bit different to being asked “well Harry, should I kill him?”
