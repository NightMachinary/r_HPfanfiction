(The causality does not work both ways) Yes, there would have been a prophecy even if Voldemort didn't believe it because the Hall of Prophecies has some that never came true (it's not an exact or logical rule, it's actively the opposite of logic). Dumbledore didn't believe in the prophecy truly until the Potters were betrayed. He only had them protected because they would be a target by Voldemort. After Harry got “marked” he figured the prophecy would play out because Voldemort was so fixed on it, but he had no clue how it would happen. It's my theory that Dumbledore was so relaxed about Harry going into danger because he knew that either Voldemort would get defeated or Harry would be safe to do it another day. That said he did work to research how Voldemort survived, what he was doing, as well as just being a powerful protector.

Got a bit side tracked there, sorry.
