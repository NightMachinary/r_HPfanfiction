The causality works both ways, though. Would there have /been/ a prophecy if Voldemort had /not/ been the kind of person to act on it?

The existence of the prophecy may cause the prophecy to become true, but whatever destiny or fate means, and whatever prophecies predict, it may well include the existence of the prophecy in the first place, and thus they become a part of the happenings. Prophecies aren't neutral observers, isolated from the world they appear in.
