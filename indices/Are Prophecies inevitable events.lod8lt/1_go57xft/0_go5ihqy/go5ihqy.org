Two points; the first is that it was basically unavoidable for someone somewhere to rise and defeat him. Right now, or far in the future, whatever. The immortal witch-king always dies at the end.\\
The second point is: would Voldemort, as we know him, be able to ignore it? He has one fear : death. He seeks power primarily to avoid it; magic is his most evident path to power, the one that put him apart from others, that makes him special, and prophecies are a form of magic. He can't ignore it, he is Oedipus who caused the prophecy when he tries to avoid it (Oedipus, Son of Laius and Jocasta, is raised by - and thinks hiself the son of- Polybus and Merope....).
