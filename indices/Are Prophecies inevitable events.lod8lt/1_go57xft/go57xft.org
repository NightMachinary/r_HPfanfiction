No, at least based on what Dumbledore said in HBP. This Prophecy is IMHO a total con job, and only set in motion because that sadistic genocidal maniac chose to act on it. He could have won it right there if he had decided to ignore it.

It seems that the literary world is infatuated with prophecies these days. We are now in 21st century, and every sci-fi or fantasy flick has a prophecy. It doesn't matter whether it's in a Galaxy Far Far Away, in Middle Earth, in the cyberpunk Matrix simulation, or in some other lost realms of nowhere. Don't people get tired of it?

I really want to read fics that completely and totally shit on prophecies.
