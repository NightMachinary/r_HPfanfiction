#+begin_quote
  the first fictional piece of literature I have written
#+end_quote

I've heard it said that every writer has a million words of crud to get through before they can write anything decent. I've also tried reading stuff I wrote a few weeks previous and flinched back in horror.

#+begin_quote
  “Harry! Harry! Hey, wake up you lazy git,” Ron yelled as he threw on his robes, “Harry get up!”
#+end_quote

'Yelled' goes best with an exclamation. "Harry! Harry!" Ron yelled as he threw on his robes.

#+begin_quote
  "Hey, wake up you lazy git."
#+end_quote

Typically insert a comma here: "Hey, wake up, you lazy git."

#+begin_quote
  as he threw on his robes, “Harry get up!”
#+end_quote

Runon sentence. Period instead of comma. You have a habit of doing that. You can get away with it sometimes, but it takes experience to tell where. Also, you're having Ron yell a lot without anything else. It's a little suboptimal. I'd shorten the yelling or put in more action in between.

#+begin_quote
  Harry shot up from his stone like slumber,
#+end_quote

You're unlikely to go from stone-cold slumber (which is perhaps the expression you were thinking of?) to full alertness. But if you do so, you're likely to do so at the first stimulus of a given type and magnitude. Given the order of narration, Ron was yelling for a solid five seconds, during which Harry didn't wake; at the end of it, Harry awoke suddenly. It's possible that Ron had been calling softly at first and then broke into full volume at the last bit, but you didn't say that.

#+begin_quote
  Harry frantically patted down the pockets of his robes and whipped his head around toward the chest at the end of his bed in search of what he was missing but, what was it?
#+end_quote

Build up to a panic. In this case, he's missing something; he should be confused first, then he should search determinedly, then he should panic not earlier than fifteen seconds after starting the search.

Skipping on a bit for brevity.

#+begin_quote
  “Ron, someone stole my wand. Let's go.”
#+end_quote

"Let's go"? That phrasing suggests he's off to breakfast with everyone else. It does not seem like an appropriate response.

#+begin_quote
  /I have got to get my wand back/
#+end_quote

Right. And he'll get to his first class of the day -- Transfiguration, let's say -- and have to tell McGonagall that he's missing his wand, at which point her eyes will bulge in shock that anyone would misplace their wand, then summon a house elf to find it, or use a summoning charm, or whatnot, and if it's not immediately forthcoming she'll either contact Ollivander and get him a replacement, or scrounge up an heirloom wand that will work well enough for him to complete class.

Pretty much immediately, it's someone else's problem. So you have two options: either the professors are incompetent and Harry manages to get his wand back first (which is supporting the traditions set in place by canon), or the professors are competent and resolve the problem using readily available spells that Harry &co haven't learned yet. I'd expect Neville or some even worse schlemazel had lost their wand in the murky depths of Hogwarts many times before. There must be some way to deal with it.

I suppose you could put this as starting on the weekend to give Harry some extra time before professors find out about it. It would also help if not everyone were in the room when Harry discovered his wand was missing -- less likely that Seamus or Dean or Neville will contact a helpful professor, more time for foolhardy antics.
