How I would write it - make of it what you will.

--------------

“Harry!," Ron barked, "Harry! Wake up you lazy git!”

Harry moaned in his sleep, Ron was having none of it, and threw his dirty shirt in Harry's face, “Harry get up!”

Harry shot up from his slumber at the violation, his hair a messy black mop and glasses askew he stared bewildered at Ron, some drool escaping the corner of his mouth.

He gave Ron a withering look, his eyes promising unending torments for the method of his waking.

“We're going to be late for class," Ron explained meekly, "...hurry up and get dressed?” said Ron as he began to search for his left sock.

“What,” said Harry looking at the clock on the wall of the dormitory. “Whoa! Geez- Bollocks! Why didn't you wake me up sooner?!” Harry muttered in frustration.

“Oh I don't bloody well know /Harry/," Ron shot back mockingly, "...maybe because I just woke up as well,” Ron's voice cracked with a surge of frustration, “Honestly mate, how are you the chosen one?” he said whilst shaking his head, a small smile tugging at his lips.

Harry began frantically slipping on his robes and throwing his feet into his shoes (forgoing his socks) and was just about to proclaim his readiness when he suddenly realized that something was missing.

Something important.

His lifeline.

His /wand!/

Harry frantically patted down the pockets of his robes and whipped his head around toward the chest at the end of his bed in search of it to no avail.

“What's wrong with you,” asked Ron, “You look like a ruddy barn owl moving your head like that.”

Harry suddenly jerked his head upward at Ron with honest panic in his eyes.

“Ron," he said slowly, "/...where's/ my wand?”

“Your what? - your wand? You sleep with it /under your pillow/, you tool." Ron answered jokingly.

In answer Harry picked up his pillow and flung it on the floor with enough force the feathered cushioning blew apart, peppering the carpet and their robes in small white feathers.

“My wand Ron, my wand!” Harry near-screamed, eyes bulging in fear.

"Accio wand! Accio /wand!/ ACCIO-/BLOODY/-WAND!" He roared, waving his hands around his head insanely, hoping it would increase the spells' effect. His panic-infused magic such that half the room looked to be ensnared in his rushed spell, and within a half-second the contents of the entire room looked to have erupted, no semblance of order or tidiness remained.

Harry ran around the boy's dormitory in a frantic search for his lost lifeline; under his bed, in his trunk, underneath dirty robes, nothing. Just as he was about to give up his search he saw something out of the corner of his eye; a small, pale pink shoe-heel disappear through the doorway of the dormitory down the stairs to the common room.

Hoping beyond hope he flung an arm out and emitted an incoherent cry of rage, his fist clenched to get /any/ hold of whoever had fled; in response the dormitory door slammed shut so powerfully it cracked down the middle; looking like a mountain troll had tried to run it through.

Harry shot to the door, trying to pry it open with his bare hands - down the stairs he could hear some people shouting. When he breached the doorway he turned just in time to catch the barest glimpse of the the possible thief as they turned right to go down the stairs after they got past the Fat Lady.

/How did we not see him?!/ Harry fumed, /He had to have been in the bloody room with us the entire bloody time!/

“What'd you run in here for,” mumbled Ron as he stuffed a pumpkin pasty from last nights' feast into his mouth behind Harry.

“Ron!," Harry spluttered, /how can he not understand the seriousness of this?!/ "Someone just /stole my wand!/" he fumed, "Do you remember how shite you felt when you snapped yours in the Ford Anglia /incident?/"

Ron's eyes bugged slightly - likely more remembering the howler he got from his mum than anything else.

"...Only a Gryffindor could have let them in..." Ron mouthed, "/Or.../- It was a Gryffindor who took it - who else would know where you keep your wand?”

Ron pretended not to notice the glance Harry sent his way.

"I don't mean to go all-Hermione on you," Ron admitted sheepishly, "but can't we just go to McGonagall?"

Mutely agreeing, they left he common room together (Harry feverishly asking if anyone there recognized the thief: /No/).

As they walked the cold stone halls of the castle, Harry realized just how helpless a wizard actually /was/ when they don't have a wand to fall back on. Almost by instinct he was checking corners for a Slytherin ambush.

/McGonagall will know what to do,/ was his mantra with each footfall.

Another thought entered his mind unbidden; /His/ wand was the only thing that saved him from Voldemort...

Unnoticed by all except the portraits, the Boy-Who-Lived cowered behind his friend.
