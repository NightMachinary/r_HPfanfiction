I tried to edit it a little bit, but it's my first time editing someone else's piece as well, so I dunno if this helps at all.

“Harry! Harry! Hey, wake up, you lazy git,” Ron yelled as he threw on his robes. “Harry, get up!”

Harry shot up from his stone-like slumber, hair a messy black mop and glasses askew as he stared at his dorm mate in bewilderment.

“We're going to be late for class, hurry up and get dressed,” Ron told him as he began to search for his left sock.

“What...?” said Harry looking at the clock on the wall of the dormitory. “Whoa! Why didn't you wake me up sooner?”

“Oh, I don't bloody know, Harry, maybe because I just woke up as well!” Ron's voice cracked with a surge of frustration. “Honestly, mate, how are /you/ the Chosen One?”

Harry began slipping on his robes and shoes and was just about to proclaim his readiness when he suddenly realized that something was missing. He frantically patted down the pockets of his robes and whipped his head around toward the chest at the end of his bed in search of what was absent -- but what was it?

“What's wrong with you?” asked Ron. “You look like a ruddy barn owl moving your head like that.”

Harry suddenly jerked his head upward at his friend with a look of fear in his eyes. “Ron, where's my wand?”

“Your /what/?”

“My wand, Ron, my wand!” Harry was screaming now as he ran around the boy's dormitory in a frantic search for his lost possession. Under his bed, in his trunk, under some dirty robes -- nothing. Just as he was about to give up his search, he saw something out of the corner of his eye: a small, pale pink colored foot disappeared through the doorway of the dormitory into the common room.

“Hey!” shouted Harry. He began to chase after the mystery man, but when he reached the doorway the supposed thief was nowhere to be seen, and no evidence as to where he had gone. How had he missed him? He had been so distracted with Ron's attempts to get him out of bed for class, he had never even noticed there was a thief in the room!

“What'd you run in here for?” mumbled Ron as he stuffed a pumpkin pasty from last night's feast into his mouth behind Harry.

“Ron, someone stole my wand. Let's go.”

Harry began to head towards the door of the common room and into the halls of Hogwarts. "I have got to get my wand back," he thought. Only problem was, he had no idea who or what had taken it.
