For me, linkffn(The Strange Disappearance Of Sally-Anne Perks) is a story that has the slightly dark and /off/ feel with the world in the third book, as well as being a great mystery to boot. I regularly recommend it and would suggest that, if you read 8t, you go in totally blind. It's really good and is slightly unnerving, kind of like parts of the third book. Set in third year, based on context from things the writer says.
