There's a popular one by Marauder called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2156084/1/Another_Prisoner_Another_Professor][/Another Prisoner, Another Professor/]], which swaps Sirius Black and Remus Lupin's role in the story, and changing the plot appropriately.

I've never read it myself but I've heard it said that the fanfic author managed to capture Rowling's style well.
