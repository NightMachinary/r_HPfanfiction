I always thought it was because you can't transform a significant transfiguration.

I don't know where I got the idea from, but since you have to actively 'untransfigure' a transfigured thing to make it turn back into its original form and more distinct things are harder to transfigure into each other (you start with match into needle and only get into pig into dining table stages really late), that interferes with any new processes of change the transfigured thing might undergo. Magic is essentially forcing it to stay the 'transfigured thing' and not the thing you're trying to change it into. So, if you turn a potato into a mahogany table, it won't burn right; if you turn a glass mug into a bacon sandwich, it can't be digested right; etc etc. Magic is still trying to keep the potato as a table and the mug as a sandwich, rather than ashes and poop respectively. Magical purpose overwrites mundane nature.

It's also why you can transfigure food into more food, because it's not a different thing so the process isn't interfered with enough to make it non-digestible.

Does bring up interesting ideas on if you can transfigure potatoes into chips or cows into steak and eat them with no consequences though. Or if a magical creature can eat magical things. Or magical fire could burn a magical table.
