"Bioenergy" as you describe it is usually simply chemical energy, or potential energy stored in the form of bonds between atoms. Things like metal, rocks, plastic still have chemical bonds which means that there is potential energy stored within them. Ever toss sodium metal in water? Transfiguration changes the nature of an object, including its molecular structure, meaning that it does change the chemical bonds within an object.

Of course, I think any scientific explanation (using current scientific models, not the scientific method) of HP phenomena is doomed to fail, because current scientific models do not account for magic, souls, etc. Magic in HP is conceptual which is directly at odds with scientific explanation of concepts.
