Good point, I learned the basis of it some years back in High School and thought that it was frankly the best way of making the cannon law on conjuring/transfigurating food make some sense without falling into the old and tired adage of “Wyzardes are jwst ztubid”. I guess the idea of trying to apply real-world science to magic /was/ very far off, still think the basic concept can be used to explain why some rules are so arbitrary.
