But what is uneatable to some is food to others, not all organisms are able to break and form the same bonds, cows and other herbivores are able to eat leaves and grass, while we can't and the difference is just how the same sugar molecules are bound together. Some bacteria can eat some plastics, nevermind what some archaeans are able to use as food.

So that would mean that in the end the magic doesn't chance the chemistry of the object, but the molecule structure stays the same, you just 'convince' it that it has other physical properties
