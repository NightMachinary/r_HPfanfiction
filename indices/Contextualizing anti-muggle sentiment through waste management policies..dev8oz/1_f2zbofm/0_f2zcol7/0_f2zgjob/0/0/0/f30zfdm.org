I see what OP is getting at though. Sure, wizards may not understand complex chemical reactions but they don't need to in order to form superficial, prejudiced opinions.

Even if they teleport most places, they do live in this world. Seeing as how the hospital, Diagon Alley and the ministry is in London, it's safe to assume a decent amount of traffic goes through there.

They just need glimpses into some of the messiness of the muggle world, really. The existing sense of superiority (over the fact that they can do magic and muggles can't) is then reinforced. And it goes from there.

It's like those people who have layovers in places and cast judgement based on that. Like “Ugh, the south is so pathetic. I've never actually traveled there but I was at the airport in Alabama once and it was just sad.”
