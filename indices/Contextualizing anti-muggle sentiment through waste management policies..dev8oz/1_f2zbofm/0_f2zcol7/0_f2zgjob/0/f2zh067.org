I think we're getting a bit off topic here, but I feel the presence of the Knight Bus, Brooms at transport and the outlawing of Magic Carpets infers desire in British wizards to avoid the uncomfortable use of Apparition and Portkeys.

Either way, all this hypothetical young Lucius Malfoy would have to do was look out of a window whilst visiting the Black family residence. I don't imagine Lucius to have some grand theory and understand Muggle culture in any depth, only that he sees Muggles as inherently dirty and never seeks to examine his own conclusion because 11 year olds don't really do that.
