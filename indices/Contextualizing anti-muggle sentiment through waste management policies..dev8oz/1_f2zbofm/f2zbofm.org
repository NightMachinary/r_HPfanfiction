  Now Lucius would have no direct experience of this event, but the people who raised him would certainly have been shaped by it.

  His parents may have even been trying for a baby during the smog itself.

Wait, what? Malfoy Manor is in rural Wiltshire. For most wizards, the only contact with London they'll ever have is King's Cross for school, and Diagon Alley for shopping. They aren't exposed to or care about changes in the Muggle world, which is why Irish students are still invited to Hogwarts even though (South) Ireland left the union in the 1920's. The average wizard lives in isolated rural areas, like the Weasleys, Diggories, and Lovegoods, and doesn't even know how to dress like a normal Muggle even though it's a law set by the International Confederation. The average wizard doesn't understand technology.

I doubt wizards could connect pollution to Muggle industrialization/technology, if they don't understand technology.

Idk man, if the anti-muggle sentiment and wizarding superiority isn't based on prejudice, but because there are valid reasons that muggles are morally inferior to wizards, then the whole theme of the books is made irrelevant. I guess you could write a fanfic based on that, but it slips into the territory of legitimizing the Death Eater cause and turning Voldemort into an Ecoterrorist Crusader.
