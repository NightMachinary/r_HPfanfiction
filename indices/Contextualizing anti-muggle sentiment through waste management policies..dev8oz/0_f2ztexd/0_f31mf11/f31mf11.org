Thanks. The linked post reminds me of a scene from Prince Of Slytherin. Harry explains Salazar's anti-muggle beliefs from within the context of his own time, 1000AD not 1990.

The basic notion was that the vast majority of muggleborns that survived long enough to be enrolled in Hogwarts were Illiterate, unwashed and deeply superstitious... because they were peasants!

Slytherin wanted to locate Muggleborns as soon as possible and abduct/foster them into wizarding families.

There was another story were the rising living conditions of the muggle world in relation to the magical world meant that muggleborns were no longer content to live as second class citizens anymore.
