The Colours of the World linkffn(11949378)

It's a crossover with FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood, and the MC if from that universe. You do need to watch the anime if you want a really good grasp on what's going on, especially the first few chapters, and it's got some pretty big spoilers for that series in any case.

Even if that wasn't the case, I'd still recommend that you pull up VRV and watch FMAB if you haven't already. Really great series.

Anyways, what I like abot Roy in this fic, is that he's smart and rational, but also studious, hard working, and humble once he realizes just how different the world that he has landed in really is.

He's a sensible character, and it's a very well written fic.
