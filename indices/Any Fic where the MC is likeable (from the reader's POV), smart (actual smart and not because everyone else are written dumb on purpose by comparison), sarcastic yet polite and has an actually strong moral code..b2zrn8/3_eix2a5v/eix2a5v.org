linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom). Harry in this fic is likable, sarcastic and yet not afraid to stand up for his beliefs. One of his best qualities is that he is very personable and strives to help others and so makes genuine friends with many different characters. He is reasonably smart although not exceptional or anything like that.

While he does have a good moral code, he is stuck with Voldemort as his sort of mentor (who is more reasonable and a better leader than in canon). Their dynamic is very well written and somehow works despite them being opposites in many ways and having completely different ideologies.
