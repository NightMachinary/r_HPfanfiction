Yes. I once read a pretty good fic with Harry, Sirius and Remus --- and then BAM it's Wolfstar. I understand wanting to surprise people with a pairing, but there should be warnings for pairings like this. And that's only one instance. I can't count the number of times I've been so excited to read a fic, only to stop halfway because the author decides that friendship isn't enough. No, platonic friendships are old now, there's no such thing as really really close friends, they HAVE to be lovers.

Right, I'll go now before this descends into my rant about why I think Wolfstar is a shitty pairing.
