Right. So.

First of all, I am in no way a homophobe, so don't mistake my hate for the pairing as hate for gay people in general. In fact, bisexual!Sirius is one of my favourite headcanons.

Second, to all Wolfstar fans reading this, I mean no offence, so by all means, continue reading/writing whichever pairing works best for you. This is just my own opinion.

Now, let's get on with it.

What I hate so much about it is how Sirius and Remus' friendship is one of the greatest things in the series, but Wolfstar has to go and ruin it all by inserting romance. It's like people, even those of the same sex, can't have a simple platonic relationship. No, there is no such thing as really close best friends, there is only friends and lovers. As if romance is the next step after friendship, when in reality, the two are vastly different from each other.

Also grating on my nerves is the assumption that, just because Sirius has no known girlfriend in the series, he has to be gay. Again, I'm not a homophobe, but just assuming that he's gay means ignoring that there are people who simply don't want a relationship, can't get one or don't have time for one. Like me, for instance.

The development of the relationship in fanfiction is usually really unrealistic as well. In a lot of Wolfstar fics, it is done as a way to exclude Peter, since then we have Jily and Wolfstar, and Peter is left as the annoying fifth wheel. In others, particularly post-Azkaban fics, it is done to "let Sirius have some fun". And /of course/ the only way you can do that is by making him have a romance with his best friend. Never mind the fact that there are loads of other witches and wizards in the Order to choose from.

And this ridiculous notion that the only way Sirius can be happy is by having a partner. Or that having a partner immediately solves all his problems. Well, newsflash, depression and other mental illnesses are more complicated than that! Sharing a few kisses with someone won't just fix someone who's battling something like that.

And I actually think that, after all Sirius has been through, he won't have time for romance. He'd be too busy dealing with the past and present, not to mention that being isolated for almost 12 years doesn't do wonders for someone's social skills. So even if he decides to try a relationship, it'd be after dealing with all his problems, most likely going to a therapist. The only way I'd support a relationship straight after getting out of Azkaban is if it was with his pre-Azkaban partner, or someone who is really close to him --- but NOT Remus.

It's just, seeing them acting all lovey-dovey is weird, OOC and, frankly, disgusting. A young couple might act like what fanfiction describes their relationship as, not Sirius and Remus. And, no matter how hard I try, I can't picture them kissing or having sex. It just won't come.

I could go on for hours about how much I hate the pairing, but this post has gotten way too long already, so I'll finish up here.

Peace.
