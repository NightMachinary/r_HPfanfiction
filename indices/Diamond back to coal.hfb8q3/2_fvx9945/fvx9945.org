I thought it was pretty good before I ended it, but it was a family/sad fanfiction where Harry was depressed but was getting better. It was heartwarming and realistic..

AND THEN BOOM OUT OF NOWHERE! HARRY HAS ELEVEN FATHERS DUE TO A DARK RITUAL! HE KILLS HIMSELF! SNAPE'S ONE OF THE DADS!

...What?!
