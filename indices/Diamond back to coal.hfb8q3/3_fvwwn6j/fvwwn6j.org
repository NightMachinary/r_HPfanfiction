Not a specific plot direction, but recently I have been coming across fics that look good and the story has potential but suddenly the writing becomes unbearable.

The most glaring example I can recall is 'In the Forest of Dean' by T3Tohru (can't figure out how to use bot for ao3). The plot is really cool and I like the characters but oh god the author suddenly became incapable of writing a single interaction or emotion in less than 20 lines some 10 chapters in. Everything is written so intensely that it puts you off. Every third paragraph Hermione will remind you why she absolutely has to <insert generic war task> because she absolutely cannot fathom subjecting herself to living a second without Harry, and vice-versa with Harry.

Similarly, a normal Harry Sirius fic after 2 chapters suddenly becomes incapable of referring to Sirius as anything but the "dogman". Why?? Oh and the each twin only saying <5 words continuously before the other twin has to complete for them. Like, does a single line need to be broken into 4 parts between the two of them? And not once but every time they speak?

I'm baffled, anyone else see such fics with writing that starts off okay but becomes trash? Or am I just getting more critical the more I read a fic?
