Heart and Soul, by Sillimaure. It's a relative fun, cute, fluffy, but virtually empty-of-all-conflict Harry-Fleur fic with an interesting and original starting point for the pairing (Poppa Delacour and Sirius a marriage contract with Fleur to get Harry out of the country during his big fifth-year trial thing). But suddenly, everyone is secretly Christian.

There's another fic I deliberately can't remember the name of where a semi-decent political!Harry suddenly started Basil-Expositioning Hermione in a DADA lesson about how Homosexuality was evil and would make you lose your magic. (And the author kept talking about how she lived in a small town and taught young girls 'proper morals', which was just alarming, considering).
