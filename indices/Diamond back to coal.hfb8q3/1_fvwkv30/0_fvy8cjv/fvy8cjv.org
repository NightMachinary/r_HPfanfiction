I'd say that last point /can/ be done well, but it tends to have a very strict requirement: There must be no canon character that would fit the role occupied by the OC. For example, a story where there's a decent teacher at Harry and Dudley's primary school that starts looking out for Harry - there's basically no real Muggle characters shown in the series at all outside of the Dursleys (Hermione's parents aren't even given names or descriptions, for Merlin's sake!).
