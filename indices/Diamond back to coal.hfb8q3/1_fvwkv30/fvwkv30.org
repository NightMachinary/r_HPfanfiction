- Bashing if it turns characters into morons. I've read so many stories where it looked like the bashing was done well, and suddenly Dumbledore does something you'd expect from a five year old child instead of a supposed master manipulator that's been running everything from the shadows from decades.

- Overly self-righteous Harry. Some righteousness is just fine, but when he starts metaphorically shitting rainbows it's a no sir for me.

- Writing about rape for the sake of having rape in the story. Seriously, just, why? Like it doesn't come up at all for 100k words, then suddenly it's randomly mentioned that death eaters are rapists, and then it never comes up again. It serves no purpose and leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. Especially the ones where it's introduced as a method to paint Harry as a hero. Even more so if literally nobody does anything about it but Harry.

- Daphne Greengrass. Like I don't immediately bow out of a fic when she's mentioned, but there are some specific cliches about this named OC that just make it absolutely impossible for me to continue reading. She somehow manages to make her way into fics where she isn't even a listed character.

- Friendly, main-ish character OCs. I don't mind OC enemies. I don't mind OC side characters, be it extra kids from older Hogwarts years, Aurors or order members. But any time an OC appears and starts becoming closer then the canon 'Ministry Six', I drop the story and move on to the next one.
