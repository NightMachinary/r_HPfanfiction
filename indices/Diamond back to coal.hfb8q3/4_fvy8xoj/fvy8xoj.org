A sudden (or not-so-sudden but still major) swerve in the tone/genre is a big one for me. The two examples that come to mind are HPMoR (started out a fun and humorous fic about a semi-Stu Harry trying to analyze and quantify magic, became a dark political clusterfuck) and an old Naruto fic called "People Lie" (suddenly introduced eldritch horrors and had the characters getting turned into totally-not-vampires-honest).
