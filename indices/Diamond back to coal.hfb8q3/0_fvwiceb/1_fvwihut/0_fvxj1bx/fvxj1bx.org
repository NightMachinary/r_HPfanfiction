I don't care that much about ships. I usually prefer Hinny, but mostly because stories tend to be more interesting (especially contrary to Harmony ... Harry and Hermione tend to be *so perfect*, that it is unbearable). Dramione doesn't make any sense canonically, so it must be either heavily AU, or post-war with heavy conversion therapy for Draco (and then I would probably prefer OC ... still eagerly waiting on sequel to linkffn(Exile by bennybear)). What I am most afraid of (and which I am afraid is the foundation of plenty of Dramione stories) is the idea, that love of good girl will change a bad boy to be good. That is so repulsive, that I would generally stay away from such stories with a distance (I know a couple of victims of domestic violence).

Well, at least you are not into Snamione.
