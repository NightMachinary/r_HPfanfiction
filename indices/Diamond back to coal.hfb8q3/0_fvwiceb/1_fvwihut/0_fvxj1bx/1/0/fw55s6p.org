Are you talking about linkao3(Severus Snape and the Art of War CypressWand)? That's set in the Marauders era, so it is before most of Snape's crimes. I have specifically mentioned for Draco post-war scenario, so Snilly is not an exercise in paedophilia (with Snamione my other biggest problem is that he could be literally her father, her classmates' parents were his classmates, after all).

I can imagine (and there is just a zillion or so of such stories, I am sure) the Draco's conversion before the Battle of Department of Mysteries, where he was just a stupid prick, not a murderer (two attempted murders are quite crimes in my books on the same level as the accomplished ones; being inept and unable to accomplish your crimes doesn't make you any better). And that would certainly fall into “heavily AU” category.
