I agree that something needs to heavily change Draco to make that work (or maybe change Hermione, if you're going for something dark).

I wonder, do you think there could be special circumstances that justify "Love Redeems"? I quite enjoyed a long fic recently where Severus, upon his canonical death, is offered the chance to return to his teenage self, six months after his estrangement from Lily, and choose another path. He accepts on the basis that if he can keep Lily alive this time, anything else is worth it. But upon seeing his newfound patience, maturity, and especially his firm rejection of the Death Eaters (though he's still antisocial, private, and prickly), Lily gives their friendship another chance, and the happiness of having her back in his life sloooowly makes him less abrasive and more able to forgive others.

Severus unquestionably has codependency issues in that fic, and is paranoid about her safety, but I've seen mixed opinions on whether it's actually abusive. For example, when they discuss possible enchantments on her engagement ring, he acknowledges that his pragmatic suggestion would be a tracking charm. But he's fair about it; asked how he would feel about that being applied to /his/ ring, he's 100% ok with her being able to find him. He sets wards that alert him when she leaves their house, but when she's missing for longer than expected, he doesn't punish or shout at her, merely spends a sleepless night worrying (and his fear for her is not unjustified given the war they're in; she's later kidnapped to get to him, and they barely escape with their lives). He freaks out a bit when she wants to join the Order of the Phoenix, and uses his leverage with Dumbledore (who knows about his foreknowledge) to veto her membership, which upsets her. But he isn't idle in the war, or unsympathetic to her desire to see Voldemort gone; he just wants to fight like a Slytherin, with information and planning, and keep her off the front lines. She can and does contribute a great deal to everyone around her in ways other than fighting, even apart from her special role in keeping him sane (because, with his future knowledge, he has unique value to the war effort). And as atrocities continue to occur, she does develop an appreciation of where he's coming from, especially after her kidnapping, despite still having mixed feelings.

Would that still be unacceptable by your standards?
