  Between Hogwarts and the First Wizarding War, there is a time in Tom Riddle's life that no one talks about. There are plots and lies that not even Dumbledore knows. And there is a woman. When Tom meets her, there is a familiar feeling that runs through him right away. The desire to possess something very rare and powerful. He had felt it for the basilisk, for the ring, and now for her. She is a woman as mysterious and deadly as Tom himself, and he cannot wait to wrap her around his finger and use her to further his plans. Instead, she will alter them - and him - forever.
