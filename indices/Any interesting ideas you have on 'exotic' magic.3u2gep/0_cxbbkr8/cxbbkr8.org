Myself, I've been reading about the Egyptian view of magic, called Heka. They have a pretty interesting view of the soul, which is divided into 5 parts:

- the spark of life,

- the heart which governs thoughts and emotions,

- the shadow, which is the influence you have over the world,

- the name

- that what makes you unique.

This is especially interesting if coupled with the Horcruxes and the popular (canon?) idea that they're Egyptian in origin.

So my idea is to make a Horcrux, you seal away some part of these aspects, like one of his horcruxes contains the name Tom Riddle, etc. By doing so he left himself with only his Ka, the spark of life, and took the other aspects from his victims. This is extra horrifying because if so his victims never could move on to the afterlife.
