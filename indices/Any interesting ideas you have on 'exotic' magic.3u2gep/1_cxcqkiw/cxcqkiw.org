Voodoo is always fun,forming personal connections and using them to cause pain over distance. This could be kind of connected to Harry and Voldemort's scar connection.

Then Native American shamanistic practices using alteration of the mind and connection to nature. Animagus transformation could certainly be connected to this.

Then you could have taboos from Irish mythology, which is not quite the same as magic, but could be incorporated easily enough. It is the practice of forbidding actions. If you break a taboo then you will be cursed, but if you obey a taboo then you gain power. Unfortunately there is no cannon support of this.

O-fuda is interesting as it is the use of spiritual tags in order to ward of evil and disease. For the most part anything involving runic arrays being magical is not-canon in Harry Potter.
