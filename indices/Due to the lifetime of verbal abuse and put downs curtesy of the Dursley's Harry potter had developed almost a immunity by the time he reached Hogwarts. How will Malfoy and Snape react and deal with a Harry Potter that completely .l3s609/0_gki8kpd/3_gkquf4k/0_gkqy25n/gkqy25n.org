Fair enough, everyone has different tastes in what they like.

I don't remember Harry being miserable although it has been a while since I last read it. More just used to interacting through sarcasm and not caring about things in the same way that others might due to his history with emotional abuse. Its why everyone is convinced that Harry and Snape hate each other like in canon when in reality they are on decent terms. They are a putting on a front to others with insults and sarcasm that has a completely different meaning to them than to everyone else. I find it to be a humorous take on an otherwise depressing situation with multiple characters being somewhat emotionally messed up.
