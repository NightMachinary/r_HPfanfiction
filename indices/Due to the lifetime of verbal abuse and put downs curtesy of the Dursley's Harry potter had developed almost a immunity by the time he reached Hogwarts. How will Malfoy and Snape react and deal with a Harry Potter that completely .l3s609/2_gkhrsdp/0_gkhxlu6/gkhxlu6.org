Canon Harry isn't stoic at all. Being emotional is a pretty important part of his characterization.

  Canon Harry Potter is immune to insult, taunts

This is simply untrue, especially where his parents are concerned. But Harry doesn't ignore the taunts and insults lobbed at him personally either. He responds with his own jabs and insults.

He was actually pretty upset when Justin ran from him in the library in CoS. He even speaks with Ron and Hermione about it and tries to talk to Justin. He literally hid in GoF. He argued with Seamus and got mad at Lavender in OotP.
