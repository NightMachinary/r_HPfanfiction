It's so annyoing when they don't use magic. We know there are levitation spells, what's the point of walking around? And instead of toilets they should just vanish the waste from their bodies. There's got to be a night-vision spell, so why bother with lights. I bet there's a way to learn things through magic, so school is pretty pointless too. There are confirmed cleaning spells, so showers are entirely useless. Potions are probably just as nutriotious, maybe more than food.
