one of my biggest pet peeves are witches complaining about their period.

In a more equal world where women health problems were always treated with as much serious effort as men's and be it just that witches did the research themselves, I refuse to believe that not at least a hundred different potions and spells exist that deal with it in seconds or minutes.

No way in hell!
