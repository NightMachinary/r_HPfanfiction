Yeah, I get ya. Even if they haven't found a way to just magically stop periods entirely (it's entirely believable that they haven't in canon imo), I'd expect magic to make it a lot less unpleasant.

In a hypothetical more highly magical wizarding world, I imagine that taking care of it is, at most, as difficult as drinking a preventative potion monthly.
