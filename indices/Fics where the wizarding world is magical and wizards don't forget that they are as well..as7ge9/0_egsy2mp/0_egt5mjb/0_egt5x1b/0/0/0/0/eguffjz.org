Exactly. I can see a Muggleborn or muggle fanatic using stitches where all else has failed, but in general, the magical methods are much more efficient. They're safer, quicker and usually less painful. Personally, I've had Ron cut himself on the hand and Mrs Weasley use a healing charm that behaves like stitches, but Hermione was the only one to recognise that, â€˜Hey, that looks a lot like when muggles get stitches!' To the witches and wizards, it's just a healing charm that brings the skin back together when it's gaping slightly, then seals it.
