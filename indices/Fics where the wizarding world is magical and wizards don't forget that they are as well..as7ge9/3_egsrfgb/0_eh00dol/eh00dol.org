I'd been wondering which fic it was. Thanks!

Also thanks for the recommendations, I'll check them out.

Does she overshadow Harry? I'm perfectly happy reading about a strong/smart/etc. Hermione, but I admit that for me Harry is too entrenched in my mind as The Main Character. I usually can't help but shy away from stories where he's overall overshadowed by anyone his age.
