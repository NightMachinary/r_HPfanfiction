I don't mind stories that decide to treat magic either way - use it for everything vs. use sparingly - but what rubs me the wrong way is when the author never bothers to give even a single line of context explaining /why/ it's one way or another.

Like if you want to write a world where people pick up trunks instead of levitating them, then at least throw in something like:

"But Mrs. Weasley," Harry asked, "can't you just float all the trunks onto the train? Or magic them directly to the school?"

"Oh Harry dear," came the condescending reply. "Magic can, of course, easily do both of those things. But we don't just go throwing spells around willy-nilly, and especially not in places like Platform 9 3/4 or Hogwarts."

"Why not?"

"Well here, for example, we're nestled into a very small space sort of in-between the Muggles. With all the locomotors running around and eckletricity running through the place, we've got to be careful about destabilizing the enchantments that make the platform possible. It's been stable for almost two centuries, of course, but magic is a finicky thing. You never know."

Or something.
