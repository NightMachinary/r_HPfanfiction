  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  "Naturally," he said, examining his nails. They were long and pointed and painted a deep maroon. It took Harry a moment to realize that Corvus wasn't wearing robes, but a beat up leather jacket and torn, faded jeans. "I always seek out my alternate self when I hop to another dimension. Don't you?" Two Harry's, Dark!Ravenclaw!Harry, Canon!Gryffindor!Harry, dimension travel, wolfstar
