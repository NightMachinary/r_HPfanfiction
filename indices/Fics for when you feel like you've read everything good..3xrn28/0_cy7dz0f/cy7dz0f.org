I couldn't find anything I really enjoyed for awhile. Then I found linkffn(Grow Young With Me). Now I've got another fic I'm craving updates for.

Also read linkffn(Harry Potter and the Three Rules) recently. I found it to be well characterized with some great humor. The Twins were done very well, humorous, but not obnoxious.
