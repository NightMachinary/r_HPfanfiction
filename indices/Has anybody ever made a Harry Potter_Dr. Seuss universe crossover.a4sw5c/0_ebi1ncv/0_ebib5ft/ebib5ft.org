Skele TICKLES I thought the point of crossovers was that they are DIFFERENT TV SHOWS AND BOOK SERIES'? They are NOT SUPPOSED TO BE MIXED TO BEGIN WITH! It does not matter HOW MUCH or HOW LITTLE they would mesh, because they were not meant to mesh as a baseline. But people still do Harry Potter/Doctor Who, and harry potter/Star wars, and harry potter/marvel universe.
