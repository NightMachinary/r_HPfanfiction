Certain stories are easier to cross with others. For example, something like Star Wars is easy; Star Wars is filled with action and adventure, which fits the HP series well, and already has canon examples of mystical forces. Because the two series are similar in that regard, it's easy to cross them. Similar applies to the other series you mentioned.

With Dr Seuss, it's essentially the exact opposite of the HP series. There isn't much to crossover in the first place. I mean, what exactly would even happen in a Dr Seuss/HP crossover?
