Heh. Don't worry about it, we all have those moments where we're slow to connect some dots sometimes. :)

And yeah. It's an odd movie, no doubt about it. Gotta wonder what movie executive heard "Okay, kid gets left at home by absentee parents, then two burglars break in, and he basically murders the shit out of them with hijinks." as a pitch and thought that was worth greenlighting and making sequels to. :D
