Yep. Without a direct headshot or heartshot the wizard would live. As for getting the drop on them, I use the same logic as when Batman kills reverse flash in flashpoint paradox. Even if you can, it won't matter if you can't react fast enough. If the wizard has a gun fired at their head, they wouldn't be able to react fast enough to shield from a shotgun blast
