I think that most people forget that Harry is a child for most of the series. If you dropped Shepard and the Squad or the Master Chief into the Battle of Hogwarts, you can bet your sweet ass that the Death Eaters would have been utterly annihilated before they could even consider apparating away. Torn apart by pinpoint accurate machine gun fire, alien space magic or a shotgun to the face... you get the idea. But Harry is not a battle-hardened soldier with decades of experience in efficiently slaughtering large quantities of enemies, as fun as those thoughts are. He is a child/teenager thrust into situations which would be above most adults, and there are often no alternatives because Dumbledore is either stupid/incompetent or manipulative (you take your pick).

His biggest weakness is that he is either too trusting towards Dumbledore or too starved for adult attention and therefore follows him blindly (depending on your interpretation). He didn't even pause to consider alternate Horcrux removal strategies when he learned that he was one, Dumbledore said he had to die so he does just that. Nevermind simply asking Hermione to use the killing curse on him for a second, or Ron to stab his scar with a basilisk fang.
