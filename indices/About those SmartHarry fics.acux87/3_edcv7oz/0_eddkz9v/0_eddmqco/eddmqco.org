  You could legitmately argue Snape

I hate Snape just as much as the next person, but no.

Going to a job interview, and saying that, "Well, Snape was a shite teacher," would only win you mockery. Trying to offload your own poor performance in a test conducted by a third party (this being the Ministry) on excuses (because it sounds just like an excuse) like bad teaching is a very, very big red flag. The employer would only have to look at the list of his employees who got there through Snape's teaching and actually met the required marks to show how poor your candidacy really is.

We know that Tonks graduated Hogwarts when Snape was teaching, as did Bill and Percy. Tonks became an Auror and got through Snape's supposedly bad teaching or high standards, and both Bill and Percy got 12 OWLs. Percy even gets a perfect score on his NEWTs. Hermione gets an O for her Potions OWL, and she gets into the same shitty situations as much as Harry does - she doesn't study 24x7 like ff authors like to believe.

If you want to go into a bit off proper canon and say that Goblet of Fire picks the best possible student from the three respective schools, then Cedric Diggory would also have been in NEWT Potions.

Only piss poor students rely on their teachers to get them over the finish line. A good student will study and pass exams with flying colours regardless of the ability of the teachers to teach the subject.

As someone who used to get near perfect scores in History in school, this is laughable. My history teachers weren't anything special, but you don't need to teachers to learn History. All of it is self-study.
