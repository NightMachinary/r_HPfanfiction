Oof. As for Snape, that would also be the case, if he wasn't also involved with said student in almost every capacity in a distinctly negative fashion outside of the classroom. Whether or not Harry succeeded or failed on his own merits, with those biases in mind (that could be corroborated) I'd throw it out and have him perform potions that he would need on the job. If he failed that then no, he wouldn't be qualified. Considering that Harry had be in the Auror's for a fairly long time it's to be assumed that he could indeed do the potion work required.

This isn't taking into account his status as the Figurehead of the last war. Pulling from real life, we've seen countless Athletes with no communication degrees getting into Broadcasting and succeeding. Often being better than the ones who have communication and english degrees, if only because they have experience playing said sport at the highest level imaginable and providing insight into the sport others would'nt have.

As for History. Double Oof. A lot of what we get taught in school (In America) is the wrong history so I'll leave that alone. Unless the point is about reading what they want you to read and giving them the answers they want (in the context of a school setting).
