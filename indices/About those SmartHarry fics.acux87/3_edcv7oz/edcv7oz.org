This is incorrect. In his fifth year, he's barely averaging the passing grade in Transfiguration, while outright failing Potions, History, and Divination. We see this during McGonagall's career session.

From his OWL results, he barely passes Astronomy - he passes with the minimum passing grade, while failing History and Divination.

So, that's 5 subjects out of 9 or 10 that he is shown to be really struggling with. That cannot be called, "doing fine with most school work", under any standard. I'd be horrified if I was barely passing 5 subjects out of 10 in school. Your username suggests you're Indian, so maybe this might put it in perspective - imagine getting 60-70 for the 10th board exams in five subjects.

You can complain about bad teachers, or wonky subjects - but making those complaints to a future employer will only make you look like a joke.
