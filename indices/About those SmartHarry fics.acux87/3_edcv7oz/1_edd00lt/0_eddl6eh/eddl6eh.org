Please tell me you're joking. They're asked questions about concepts they learn from first to fifth year. The vocational system found in Hogwarts is one that supports incremental learning, meaning that a 15 year old student would find concepts learned in his earlier years a lot more relaxed and easy compared to what they currently learn, the same way a high schooler would find middle school mathematics to be simple.

Failing a couple of subjects in spite of that shows how poor Harry is as a student.

  He and Ron do significantly above average, from what we know.

Exactly who do they do better than? They do better than Neville, and the twins. Neville is consistently shown to be at the bottom of the class in most of their subjects for the majority of their school. Doing better than someone like that is not exactly anything to be proud of. Fred and George, well, they're not people you want to test your academic performance against either.
