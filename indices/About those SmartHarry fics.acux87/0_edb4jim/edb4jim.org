As far as I know most of those "Harry is as observant as a brick" comments don't really refer to his analytical ability and more to the fact that Harry hardly ever seems to notice anything beyond his immediate surroundings. For example you can fill about two paragraphs with the stuff he notices about students who aren't the golden/silver trio, a Weasley, or Malfoy.

Of course the real reason for this has nothing to do with Harry at all and is mostly due to JKR focusing on what's important to the plot and not making the books even longer than they already are.

In the end I think it's just people frustrated that the story focuses so much Harry and his immediate friends instead of involving people in the other houses more.
