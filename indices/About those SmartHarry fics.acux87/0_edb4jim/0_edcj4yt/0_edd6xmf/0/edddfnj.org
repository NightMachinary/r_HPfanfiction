I mean, I wouldn't mind a spin-off where people actually have sexualities, but OOTP and HBP would be absolutely bloated otherwise. Girls pulling the naked man, countless comfort offers after Cho dumps him, Romilda might actually just proposition Harry instead of the love potion plot and so on...

Which might have the side effect that Harry might completely forget about Ginny when he's balls deep in Susan Bones. Just imagine all the bad one liners about the power of love and magic wands.
