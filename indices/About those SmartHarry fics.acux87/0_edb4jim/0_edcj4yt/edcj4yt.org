Narrative focus is the obvious answer. For example, Harry would have had a lot of fantasies about Hermione, Katie, Alicia, Angelina, Susan, Hannah and so on.

But we don't want to read about Harry beating his meat and including any "romantic" thoughts about the background characters would just cause more confusion than it would do good. I mean, we could tell how perky Angelina is, but her tits serve no literary purpose so it's better to simply leave them out. Even if that means Harry officially didn't notice them.
