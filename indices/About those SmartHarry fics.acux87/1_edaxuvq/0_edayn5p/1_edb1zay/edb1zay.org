  anyone actually believing pureblood supremacy

Maybe they're environmentally friendly and hate the Muggleborn reforms of plumbing in Hogwarts? Just vanishing the poop wastes less water and space, no? or They're just idiots with irrational hate on a group of people and fear destabilization of their influence.

I've read somewhere that Ministry of Magic justifies its existence because of how ignorant the general populace is towards Muggle world. If everyone gets more inclusive of muggles in general, then pure-bloods in power would lose their power? So, they might actually be making a political stand and while claiming it's a blood thing.

Though I guess its too far from the point you were trying to make.
