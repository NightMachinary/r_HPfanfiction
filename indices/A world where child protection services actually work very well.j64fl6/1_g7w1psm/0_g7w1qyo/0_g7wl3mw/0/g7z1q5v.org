I just passed the whole day reading and omg.

Hermione and Harry acting-like-brothers is the plot I didn't know I needed it. I just really wanted so much to Dean and Harry to beat the living shit out of Ron, but I won't spoiler' the fun (ha I'm funny ha/s) to anyone wanting to read it.

I'm just sad the author last update was in 2012. That wasn't the kind of tears I was talking about, but ill take what I have.
