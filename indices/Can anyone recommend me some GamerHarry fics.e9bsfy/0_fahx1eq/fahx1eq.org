Gamer!Harry is code for “abandoned within 6 months.” I've never seen one get past the second year of Hogwarts unless it started later than that.

That being said, there is one currently being updated called linkffn(Harry Potter and the Game of Death by Elsil). You can also try linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20 by Sir Poley) for a different kind of “gamer” fic, without Harry as the MC.

As for Tomarry, I can't help you, slash isn't my cup of tea. You do you, though.
