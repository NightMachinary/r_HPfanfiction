I get my share of disgruntled PMs and reviews because I make Harry short. And unlike what those people complaining about it think, it is entirely unrelated to the actor since I honestly don't give a single fuck about any actor. I write Harry as short because he did not get sufficient food at the Dursleys and Hogwarts, although it provides plentiful food, does not provide a balanced diet either. Nor is Harry ever treated for said malnutrition. Canon has growth spurts for Harry, but even if he grew the same amount as Ron during those he'd end up shorter because he started with less height (the first book is explicit about that).
