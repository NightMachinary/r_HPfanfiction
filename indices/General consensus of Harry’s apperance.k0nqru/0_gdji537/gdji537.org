I mean, fortunately he's never described in extreme detail so there's a lot of artistic licence here.

I think what we do know is that he's got knobbly knees, his nose is slightly shorter than James's and his eyes green, but other than that his face looks exactly like James's. I think their faces are described as 'thin', whatever that means. James is described as the generic 'tall' and we know Harry is within an inch of him when they're 15/16. We know Harry is short and skinny for his age before that.

We know from PS that Tom Riddle, famously handsome, think that the two of them look somewhat alike, whether he's referring to black hair or their faces we don't know.

As for how tall James (and therefore Harry) is, I feel like the consesnus I've heard of is slightly above medium height for British men? We know Sirius is more than a head taller than Pettigrew and taller than Snape and we never get Remus's height described, which possibly means he's medium height, Pettigrew shorter. James is described as tall, but not anything else, so likely he's between Remus and Sirius.
