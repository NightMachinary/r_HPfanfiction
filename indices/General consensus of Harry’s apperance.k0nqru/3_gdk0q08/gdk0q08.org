In my fic, which is postwar, he's definitely a heartthrob, but it has more to do with his charisma than his actual looks. He has striking coloring and beautiful eyes, but his face is thin, angular, and not classically handsome like Cedric or Sirius. He's also short (5'7‚Äù) and more wiry than buff (he's a professional Seeker).

And yet he somehow makes it work. Consider an actor like Tom Hiddleston. He's not classically handsome either, but he's somehow so magnetic that he may as well be.

My Harry also has hopelessly untidy hair, but he starts dressing really well, which offsets it. If he were perfectly coiffed he'd look a bit douchey, but the contrast just looks cool.

Anyway, that's my Harry, but obviously other versions are valid.
