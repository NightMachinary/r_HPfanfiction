I imagine Harry as a normal looking boy. Harry looks almost exactly like James, who is never described as being handsome in any way. When they appear in the mirror, only Lily is described as attractive. I don't think it's because of Harry's an unreliable narrator, because Sirius is described as extremely handsome even when Harry thought he betrayed his parents. Also, JK Rowling said that all of the trio looked geeky, and that the actors were all too good looking.
