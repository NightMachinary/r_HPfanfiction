The idea that Harry is "severely malnourished" is certainly fanon, based only on the few days after the Dobby incident. Harry in general seems to have had enough food, but not more than that - which is of course a huge contrast from Dudley and Vernon. So he's skinny but still healthy.

His skin colour is up for grabs, there's nothing in canon preventing him from being part-Indian.
