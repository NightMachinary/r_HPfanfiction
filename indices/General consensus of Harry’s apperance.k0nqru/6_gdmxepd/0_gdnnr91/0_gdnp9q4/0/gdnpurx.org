isn't Blaise supposed to be from Italian roots or is that fanon?

Statue of secrecy was introduced in the end of 17th century, India was colonized by the British in the 19th century.

Kingsley i have no idea about, he definetly has african roots somewhere, but again, at the point in time where Britain enforced the SOS, they hadn't colonized much yet
