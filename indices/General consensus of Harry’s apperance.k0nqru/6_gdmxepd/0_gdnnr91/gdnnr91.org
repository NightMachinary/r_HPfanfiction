I mean, James family are known to be british purebloods and Petunia is described as a blonde haired woman.

idk, i can't actually find his background to be that of a darker colored person, mostly due to how Britain is described and for James or Fleamont to be anyway married to a family with indian heritage.

It isn't clear in canon if magical Britain colonized like their muggle counterparts did, they had been seperated for a while before Britain entered India.
