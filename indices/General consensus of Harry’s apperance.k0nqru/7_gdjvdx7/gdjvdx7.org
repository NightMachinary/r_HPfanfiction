I've always considered him to be small, bony, below average height, with signs of malnutrition and abuse still affecting his looks. I don't consider him a pretty boy, not one to plaster on Witch Weekly cover for most charming smile award. Not ugly, just ... meh looking.

In my mind, he could look lot better, if he actually took care of himself. Comb his hair, have a proper haircut, clip his fingernails instead of biting them, decent clothes that aren't threadbare, often dirty and several sizes too large and maybe have an extra shower or two ...

Dunno, I always get a feeling he has a bit of a "street urchin" look to him.
