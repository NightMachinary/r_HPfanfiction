He's described as being the same height as James, who is in turn described as "tall", so I would put Harry at about 6 feet, which is probably the shortest a man can be and still be considered "tall".

In terms of looks: skinny in frame (see references to being small, having knobbly knees, having the right build for a seeker, etc) but not emaciated. By his older teenage years, not as skinny as age 11, but still on the skinny side of athletic.

Attractive face - Hermione calls him "fanciable" in HBP, and he's said to resemble James who attracted admiring looks from girls in his OWL year.
