The buzz in the DADA classroom is only growing louder as the new professor is a minute late. Harry wonders where he is, or why he would decide to be late at all. The Dursley's were extremely focused on punctuality.

He looks down at the hairs on his arm as they stand in end, and looks over to Hermione and Ron, who also seem to feel a disturbance of sorts. He tackles them to the floor just as a thick stone wall of the chamber were blasted open.

Up close, he was even more intimidating than when he had been a hall away. Easily over six and a half feet tall, and in an armor of sorts with the green tunic, he looked like a mystic knight of some sort. Intense brown eyes stare at the class, and seem to be judging all of them harshly.

“Uh, professor? What was that?” Harry hears himself ask before he can stop himself. His friends try to hush him, but it's too late. The large and armored man's head turns towards him.

“Ah, yes. Harry Potter. I've heard many things about you. That, Potter, was how /Doom/ enters a room. How do YOU do it, young man?” With a casual wave of his hand, the stones begin to rearrange themselves on the wall, repairing themselves as he stands expectantly.

“Er...I would say through the door, sir.” Harry rubs the back of his neck, not understanding the question. Doom scoffs, a strange sound coming from an otherwise deadly serious figure.

“The door? Like a peasant?”

If it was one thing Professor Victor Von Doom's class taught him, Harry thinks looking back, it was how to make an entrance.
