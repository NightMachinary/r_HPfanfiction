My first fanfic took place after Arthur died. I expanded on Vows by starlight.moon.princess on FFN. It's not all that great as I look back on it and it's not complete, but I may revisit it. I don't know how to put a link through mobile but it's titled "Learning to Cope Without Arthur" by WeasleyObsession on FFN.
