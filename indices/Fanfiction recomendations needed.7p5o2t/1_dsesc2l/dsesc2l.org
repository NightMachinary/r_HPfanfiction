Hi, I am finishing binge read this one : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/288212/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Psychic-Serpent]]

It's alternatives 5-6-7th books, written in 2001 so right after the publication of the goblet of fire. You'll have a "snape adopts/mentors/is the father of harry", news spells, animaguses, and Quidditch ! but I can't say more without spoil you the story ;)

Enjoy :)
