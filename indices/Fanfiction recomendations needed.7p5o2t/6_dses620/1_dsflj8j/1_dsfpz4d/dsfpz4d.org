Probably, but the spankings don't actually hurt it's just a tap like someone would tap your shoulder to get your attention. but som people dont like that either. I don't mind it. Some times talking and grounding and coddling your kids doesn't help. I was an awful child, nothing you could say or ground me with did aything. I'd do what I want. Put me in timeouts? Oh ok i walked out and did what I wanted, even if you put me back there, i'd walk out again. tried to do it the super nanny style, still never gave up.

Try grounding me? What are you going to do tie me up in my room to stop me from going out? Nah I'll go out. You would have to physically stop me from going, even then I used to shove my way through. Took away something I like? I'd steal it etc.

So I don't believe from my own experience that talking and grounding and all the soft mushy ways of discipline always work for every child.
