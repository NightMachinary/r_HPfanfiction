lets agree to diagree here.

i would never hurt a child and im pretty sure i would have found a way to sanction your behaviour without violence

if its just like a tap on your shoulder to get your intention why did it work better than timeouts and grounding ?

hitting your child (where do you draw the line between hitting, smacking, spanking, „tapping“ btw ?) can severly damage a child and negatively influence the relationship to his parents, authority in general and other people

in addition its illegal where i live, if someone finds out your kids might get taken away
