Yes, we'll have to. Cause yelling at a child could also just as easily damage them. I still get frightened when people raise their voices. So should people not even raise their voices? Where do you draw the line on over-sheltering them? Making them sit in a chair for 30 minutes while you speak softly to them does nothing in my experience. The line can be drawn with spanking/tapping, and it is where I'm from. It can not leave a mark, or cause any internal or external injury. It can only be the rear, not any other part of the body, and only the parent's hand can be used.

The only thing that made me hate my family very much was getting screamed at and slapped in the face every time I said something sarcastic or they misinterpreted something I said. One time I said, "I know" and my mother heard 'No' and i had a bruise on my cheek for a few days. lol. Thats not a spanking thats just hitting to hit. Big difference.

I guess it all depends on where you come from, and individually how the parent was raised, and the environment which the kid was raised in. It's interesting really, I'd love to do cross-country studies, and international studies on that to compare. It'd be fascinating. But thats the old psychology geek in me.

I don't mind others views, I'm sorry if I came off snippy before, I didn't mean to. Your opinion is just as valid and important as mine or anyone elses. So it doesn't bother me that we disagree. I don't want any hard feelings or anything.
