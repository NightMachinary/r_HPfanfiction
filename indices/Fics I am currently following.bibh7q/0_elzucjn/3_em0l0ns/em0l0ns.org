Why read a fic on either ff.net or AO3? You can use ff2ebook.com to download an entire fic at once to your phone and then you never have to deal with the ads and other bullshit on FFN. And AO3 has ebook downloading built in. So you really never need to actually be online or deal with any website issues once you download the work.
