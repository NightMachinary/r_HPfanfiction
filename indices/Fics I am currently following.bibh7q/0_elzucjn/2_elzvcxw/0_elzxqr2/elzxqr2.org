Well, it's less about finding more stories I enjoy and more about enjoying the reading experience on AO3? Like... I like being able to view the full work instead of chapter by chapter? Also, I love the organisation system of it. I find ffn harder to navigate?

If you like Face Death in the Hope, you should check out the author's other HP stories! Their fics got me into reading HP fic. Like... I've read the occasional HP in the past, but I saw someone recommend a fic by them and I decided to read it and then I was like... Wow, I need more of this.
