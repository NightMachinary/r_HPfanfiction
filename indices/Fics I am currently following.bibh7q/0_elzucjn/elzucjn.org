Oh, thanks for the rec! I don't think I'll read the ones on ff because... I so much prefer AO3, but I'm definitely gonna check out that first one! It looks interesting!

About currently-updating fics, I am a fan of Face Death in the Hope. I've never used this bot before so I hope it'll work: linkao3(Face Death in the Hope)

When Harry dies, instead of just coming back to life, he travels back in time to before he was born (and saves Regulus). It's very interesting and it's a bit painful to have Harry interact with his parents who are not yet his parents.
