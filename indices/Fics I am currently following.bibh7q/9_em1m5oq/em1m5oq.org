I did read the second one because I've never seen a time traveler Remus before. I skipped some of the chapters, though, I'm not sure why. The problem is that I never liked Tonks so I'm not sure I'll make myself finish it. But I really rather enjoyed Sirius's characterization when I usually can't stand him in fanfic. I'm not even sure what it is that makes me like him in that story.
