Obligatory linkffn(Basilisk-born) because despite its grammar problems the characters are really quite incredible (and they all act more or less like real people!) and some side-characters get to be more than cardboard cutouts. Slow updates, but still active nonetheless.

Secondary fic I'm following is linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance) which is mostly just entertaining, although it has some cool ideas.

I actually have a lot of fics I follow, but they all update like once every month or so, so I don't have overly much to do. Naturally. :(
