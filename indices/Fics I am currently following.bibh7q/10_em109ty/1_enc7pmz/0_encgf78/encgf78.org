Its sort of like reading Shakespeare I feel. English is not Ebenbild's first language (or his best, for that matter) and it shows in how he arranges a lot of his verbs and nouns around each other. The sentences are in English but the organization of the sentence looks very similar to something like Spanish (not that I can tell overly well, I just took high school Spanish). Similarly, a lot of the typos and errors in the writing disappear the farther into it he gets, and the newest parts of it are really quite well written. His writing style is unique (as is his dialogue, a lot of that comes off kind of strange) but you get used to it as you read, and soon you can make sense of it pretty well.

Basilisk-born has some of the best world building I've seen, and is also one of the most original time-travel fics I've heard of. Similarly, the time travel is canon time travel where it's a loop, and if you know the result of an event it cannot change but all the circumstances thereof /can/. It's worth the read, but the opening four or five chapters are hard to get through due to the grammar problems.
