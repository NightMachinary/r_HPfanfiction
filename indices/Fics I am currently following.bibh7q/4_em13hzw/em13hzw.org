My favorite WIP, by a mile, is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14164617][An Hour of Wolves]] linkao3(14164617). This fic is pretty tailored to my interests - I love angst and I love fics where the trio friendship plays a central role - but it really stands out because of how in-character everyone is, and the strength of the writing. (Do note all the potential trigger warnings though - stuff gets pretty dark.)

Also, since you like The Phoenix Burns Brightest, you might also enjoy [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13553343][Albus Dumbledore and the Boy Who Lived]] linkao3(13553343). It is a rare, rare thing to find a fic that 1) focuses on Dumbledore and Harry and 2) keeps Dumbledore in-character, and I fervently hope it'll update soon.
