Apart from the fics you mentioned, I'm following these fics with anticipation:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/1/Animagus-at-War][Animagus at War]], linkffn(12088294): the sequel to "The Accidental Animagus". It's being actively updated again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725354/1/Gods-Among-Us][Gods Among Us]], linkffn(7725354): rare crossover with both Battlestar Galactica and SG: Atlantis. What I especially like about this fic is that Harry and Hermione are changing canon plots in ALL 3 universes with their actions.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort][I Am Lord Voldemort]], linkffn(12980210): A genre savvy SI replaced Tom Riddle after he had killed James. He was still a totally evil SOB, but at least this guy was smart had some humors. One of the very few fics in which I can cheer for the bad guys.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13161929/1/Invincible][Invincible]], linkffn(13161929): Darth Marrs's attempt at a 'Wizards in Space' fic, and this fic has been fairly typical of his style so far, which is mixed with brilliance and ridiculousness.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12195136/1/Legend-of-the-Gryphon][Legend of the Gryphon]], linkffn(12195136): Ginny and Sirius were building their empire in the Land of Fire and Ice. This fic does not nerf HP magic and shows its power in full glory. But it seems Rhaegar Targaryen could make meaningful contributions too.
