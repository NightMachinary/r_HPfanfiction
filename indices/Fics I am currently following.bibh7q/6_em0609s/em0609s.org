I'm really enjoying The Unassuming Hufflepuff. linkao3(Unassuming Hufflepuff by flamethrower)

It starts in Harry's 3rd year, when Uh is drafted as a coconspirator to the Weasley twins in pranking. They end up dealing with Sirius Black.

It becomes a crossover when you find out Uh is Alex O'Connell, the grandchild of Rick O'Connell and Evy Carnahan of the Mummy movies.
