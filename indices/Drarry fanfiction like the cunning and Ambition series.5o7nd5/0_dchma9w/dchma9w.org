Well, this is a bit vague, but if you're looking for something that goes through at least part of their Hogwarts years with them in Slytherin, perhaps these? Admittedly, I haven't read them or Cunning & Ambition in a long time, though.

- linkao3(785942), "For the Price of a Soul" (& the sequels)
- linkao3(909865), "Ice Poppies" (2nd in a set, but the first one is pre-Hogwarts)

edit: Removed "The Spellmaker", sorry - I remembered that what was written was a best-friends situation.
