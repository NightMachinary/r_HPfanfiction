  Five years have passed since Harry Potter was adopted by Remus Lupin. This time around, Harry is learning about what it means to be at Hogwarts while also finding out his own potential. Those around him are willing to help in any way they can, but they have to be careful so that he is not caught in the crossfires. All the while, Harry is learning about his elvin magic and hoping that he will be ready when his creature inheritance finally comes with his best friend, Draco Malfoy, but his side.

  Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick. Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable in the highly complicated and controversial subject of Spell Creation, a subject he soon becomes enamored with despite having to hide his interest from everyone. Besides, it's not like he's going Dark, after all.

  When Vernon Dursley's abuse escalates to unbearable levels, Harry Potter makes a deal that gives him incredible power at the tips of his fingers. Ten years down the line he's going to have to pay for it, but a lot can happen in ten years.
