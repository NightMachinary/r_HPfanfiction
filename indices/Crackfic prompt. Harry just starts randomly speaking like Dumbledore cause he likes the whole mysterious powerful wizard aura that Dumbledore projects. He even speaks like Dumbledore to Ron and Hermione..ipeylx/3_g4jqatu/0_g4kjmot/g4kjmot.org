Fake it til you make it. If you pretend to be an all-knowing, really powerful wizard, the rest of the wizarding world will readily believe it. Especially when Harry has a headstart. I want an AU where every powerful wizard is basically a Lockhart, except for Lockhart, and since he's the only one being sincere and doesn't act like Dumbledore and Harry no one believes him.
