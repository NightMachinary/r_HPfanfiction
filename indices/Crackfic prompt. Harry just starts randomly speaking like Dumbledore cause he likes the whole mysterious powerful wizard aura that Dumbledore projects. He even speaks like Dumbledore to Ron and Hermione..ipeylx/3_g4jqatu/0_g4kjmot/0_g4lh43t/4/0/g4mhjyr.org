I like them because, well, it's a true phenomenon. There were 2 equations thought to be unsolvable for a while, until a student late to class missed that part of the lecture, and copied them down thinking they were homework. He solved them in a week. So maybe it's not so impossible that Harry uses impossible magic because he doesn't know its supposed to be impossible.
