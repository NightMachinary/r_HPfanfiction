"Precisely, young Hermione, precisely!" intoned Harry with a kind smile. "Magic is a sense! When you constrain it with your other senses, like sight, like what you read in a book..." - he slowly shook his head - "that's when you tether it with unnecessary...restraints. Hmmm....curious. I wonder if...", he gazed into the distance for a few moments before closing his books, getting up and walking to the common room's exit.

"Ha...Harry?" asked Hermione with a fair bit of surprise and confusion written on her face. "What....where are you going?"

"Hmmm..." responded Harry, deep in thought as he slowly made his way to the portrait hole. "I suddenly find myself quite interested in the ingredients of a treacle tart. Perhaps I can find a list of sorts in our castle's wonderful academic collection? An off-shoot shelf in the potions section, perhaps?"

Hermione just gaped at him, her mouth making movements but no words coming out.

"Off to the library..." said Harry as he stepped out and the portrait swung close behind him. "Of food!" he added and made his way to the kitchens.
