Me too, whenever it fits, I always try and recommend it - though sadly I feel people don't really listen or check it out. I've re-read it multiple times too, and I'm gearing up for another reread soon, because I only recently came across those extra chapters on her live journal (and haven't read them yet). I'll read your compilation on my next run-through.

It's definitely still in my top 5. It was the one that made me really take a step back and re-evaluate my reading standards. Now whenever I read something I cant help but compare it to this series. The characterization and originality is just bursting.

Do you read any other fandoms?
