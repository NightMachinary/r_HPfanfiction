Yeah, tell people that it's abandoned and they just won't touch it. But it's just /barely/ abandoned. It was nearly all resolved with just one minor conspiracy and villain to dispose of. My opinion is she had a bad idea about Harry being unable to love and maybe there was a bad reaction to it and it just left her unable to finish. It wouldn't be the first good story where the author wanted so much for a story to end well that it just never got done. No, I don't read any other fandoms. When I read fiction I usually go back to Harry Potter fanfiction -- though I did go through the Odd Thomas and Nero Wolfe books as audiobooks. I'm still finding some very good Harry Potter stories to read: Heir to the House of Black, Percy Take the Wheel, face death in the hope, Harry Potter and the Greatest Show, Dobby's Deceit, A Marauder's Plan, Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin. Good fics are hard to find, but my experience so far is that they're out there if I keep looking, but failing that, I can always read the Resonance Trilogy again -- maybe for the tenth time?
