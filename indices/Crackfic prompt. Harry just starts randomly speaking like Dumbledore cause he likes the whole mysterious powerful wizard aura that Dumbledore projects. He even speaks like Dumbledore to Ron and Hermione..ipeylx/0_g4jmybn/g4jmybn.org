"Did you finish that Divination assignment?" asked Ron.

Harry sighed. "Perhaps. But with Divination, one never knows if one is correct, as any slight shift in the ever-changing randomness of the universe could alter the future. Our time is better spent worrying about the present."

"Er, okay, but did you do it or not?"

"We shall see..."

Ron turned to Hermione. "Do something about him, please. He's useless like this."

Hermione rolled her eyes at Ron, then sat down next to Harry. "Harry," she said gently, "why are you talking like a pretentious philosophy professor?"

"Who knows?" said Harry. "Maybe I'm not, Hermione."

"But you are."

"Am I? Maybe it's an illusion. Maybe this is all an illusion, and we are in a collective coma, merely dreaming of being wizards. We can never really be sure, can we?" 

Hermione blinked stupidly. "What?"

Harry just gave a pleasant smile. "I feel like waffles," he said, and left.
