  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! COMPLETE!WINNER of two 2018 Marauders Medals Awards:- Best Characterisation of Remus- Best Characterisation of James2017 Marauders Medal Awards:- Best Work in Progress
