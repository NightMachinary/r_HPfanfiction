Well, considering it started 4 years ago I thought most people already new about PoS. It's pretty good compared to most fics in terms of worldbuilding, writing and character development. One huge downside tho, it's updated very slowly (middle of the 3rd year now in 4 years of real time, so the estimated time of completion via simple calculus gives us around 2023-2024) so you kinda start to forget all the nuances in the in-between of updates.

The only other fic I've read that is kinda similar is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw][DP&SW]]
