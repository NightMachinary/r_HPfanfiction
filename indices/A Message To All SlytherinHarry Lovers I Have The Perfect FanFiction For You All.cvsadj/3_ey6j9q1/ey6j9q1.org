I don't hate it, but the author's take on what it is to be Slytherin is kind of... limited and one dimensional? There's a lot more to ambition and cunning than prancing around with Regency-era manners and attempting to maintain an unemotional facade. Just once I'd like to see a Slytherin house with future activists trying to drum up support for their pet causes, budding artists pushing their craft forward with or without the teacher's permission, a Hogwarts black market run by a cartel of Slytherin students, etc.

It's the best take on the WBWL trope I've read yet, but that's a low bar because that trope is stupid IMHO.

Also, the Weasleys and Longbottoms are part of the Sacred 28 list of Pureblood families. They don't act in the ridiculous fanon pureblood culture way in the books, it's a pretty strong indication that the way the Malfoys act has everything to do with their wealth and class, and not their status as Pureblood wizards. Nobody is ever called "Lord" aside from Voldemort, and there is no canonical indication whatsoever that the "Ancient and Noble House of Black" was anything other than an affectation that Walburga or some other terrible ancestor of Sirius' started.
