At present, the story is in Christmas of third year. So let's say he has completed 2.5 books in 830,000 words. That comes out at 332,000 words per book.

The total 7 year story would therefore come out at 2,324,000 words, of which 1,494,000 are yet to be written.

The 830,000 words written to date were written from April 2015 to present (4 years and 4 months). That's a rate of 15,961 words a month. At that rate of words/month, it would take 93 months to finish the series, or 7 years. That takes us up to 2026.

In reality, however, this is a wildly optimistic figure. This is for two reasons:

1. It is likely that later books will be significantly longer than earlier years due to the number of story threads ongoing.

2. The 15,961 words/month figure is the average across 4 years. But in reality the author's rate of writing has slowed down dramatically.

Assuming that the story is not abandoned, I would not expect it to be completed before around 2035.
