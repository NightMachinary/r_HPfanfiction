I respect the ton of effort that went into this, but it just rubs me the wrong way.

It's trope-y and smug. Most character voices blend together into a pompous, self-righteous amalgamation that brings to mind a self-satisfied, stern older person standing over your head shaking their finger disapprovingly.

Its just not fun to read at all.
