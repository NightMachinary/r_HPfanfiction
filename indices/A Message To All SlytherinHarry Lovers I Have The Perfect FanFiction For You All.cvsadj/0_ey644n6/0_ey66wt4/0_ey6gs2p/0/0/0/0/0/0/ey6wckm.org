You edit all of your posts ;). Not that I mind in principle. And I'm sorry if I've offended you, but gender neutral writing is tedious and bothersome, and I personally find singular 'they' ungainly, so I made an educated guess based on demographics on this site.

Most humbly, I beg your pardon, my lady.
