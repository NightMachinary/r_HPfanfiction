I think what [[/u/Ash_Lestrange]] is trying to say is that the idea of Slytherin!Harry being automatic friends with Hermione is ridiculous.

He's in a house that is reflexively hostile to Muggleborn, Hermione has terrible manners and social skills, and in canon he didn't even like her until he saved her from the troll. It's just the author making his favourite characters come together without a sufficient explanation for why.
