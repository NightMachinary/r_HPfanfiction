Look, what I'm trying to say is this: eleven-year-olds are so ridiculously easy to manipulate and change, I propose I can change the psychological outfit of about 85% of any year enough with only a few months or weeks, sometimes days, to change their primary alignment in regards to sorting.

The entire 'sorting', or at least the notion that it holds any real meaning, is what's ridiculous.
