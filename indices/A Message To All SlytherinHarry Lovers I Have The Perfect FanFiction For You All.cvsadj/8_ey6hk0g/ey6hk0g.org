The technical quality of this fic's writing is pretty high (what you might call production value, I guess), and -- as you pointed out -- I like both the attempts at world-building, especially those that subvert a few of the more popular tropes, and the humour for the most part.

On the other hand, I think the author did himself a disservice whith the starting age of the fic. Especially the first year feels like a smug revenge opera at times. My real gripe with the story, however, comes to light around late first, early second year when the author with increasing frequency presents canon rewrites, overly long side character developing chapters, and the like. I believe the author lost himself a bit at some point; just because you can write about something, doesn't mean that you should.
