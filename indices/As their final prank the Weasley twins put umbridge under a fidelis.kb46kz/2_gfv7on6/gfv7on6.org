Or maybe the fact that she is a person, and then after fidelius-ing the fact that she is a person, convince her she is a frog. And then, cause her to become deaf for a short amount of time. During that time, announce to everyone that she is a person. Or fidelius her name, her titles, and her position, except for her position as a defense teacher. Also, fidelius the fact that she is able to assign detentions. Announce to everyone in Hogwarts the secret, as only the secret keeper can share it. Then just watch Umbridge move around not knowing her name. Then you could tell her that her name is "Toady Awful Toad" and she would believe you. Then, send her to class, and she would introduce herself as Professor Awful Toad, and no one would be able to tell her that her name is actually Umbridge, as it is under the Fidelius. Oh, and fidelius the subject she teaches, so she just knows she is a teacher, and fidelius the fact that she hates all houses except for Slytherin. Then tell her that her subject is how to be a proper toad. Then, when she introduces herself, she would say, " I am professor Awful Toad, and I teach how to be a proper toad at Hogwarts, but you can call me Toady." Of course this is more complicated than necessary..
