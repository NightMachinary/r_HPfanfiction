Linkffn (Dreams and Darkness Collide) and Linkffn (Death of Today) both have Tom Riddle as a main character and in both fics he looks human and is Charismatic. The fics are slash but both are pretty entertaining. With dreams and darkness including a serial killer (Almost dexter like) Harry who's traumatized and a very powerful empath and a Tom Riddle who's the minister of magic. Death of today consists of a Harry's who's in Ravenclaw and working (interning would be a better word) for the Unspeakables and Tom Riddle is senior undersecretary.

This is my first time using the link bot so I hope I got it right.
