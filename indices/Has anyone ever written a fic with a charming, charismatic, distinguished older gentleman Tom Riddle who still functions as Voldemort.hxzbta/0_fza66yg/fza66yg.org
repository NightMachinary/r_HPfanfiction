It's been a while since I read this, but it definitely has a more human, less unhinged Voldemort who was quite interesting. I don't think he precisely fits the “distinguished older man” role though. The story is labeled Harry/Tom Riddle, but I've read most of it (it's still being updated and is at 400k words) and it doesn't have a romantic relationship yet. If it will at all, I'm not sure.
