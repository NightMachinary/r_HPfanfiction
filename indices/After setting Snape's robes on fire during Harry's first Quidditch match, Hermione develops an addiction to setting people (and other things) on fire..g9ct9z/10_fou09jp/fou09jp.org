  ‘If you don't stop doing it, I'm going to --'

  ‘Put us in detention?' said Fred, in an I'd-like-to-see-you-try-it voice.

  ‘Make us write lines?' said George, smirking.

  Onlookers all over the room were laughing. Hermione drew herself up to her full height; her eyes were narrowed and *her bushy hair seemed to crackle with electricity*.

  ‘No,' she said, her voice quivering with anger, ‘but I will write to your mother.'

She just needs to weaponise it.

I think there is a point in linkffn(Lady Archimedes by White Squirrel) when Hermione, in a moment of desperation, manages to pull one off, but that's all the ones I know.
