Queue Hermione and Seamus developing a friendship because fire! From time to time Hermione disappears with Seamus to have their own adventures and Harry and Ron don't learn they are behind a lot of Hogwarts Incidentsâ„¢ until years later when they drink a bit too much and it comes out; /"Wait, you were doing/ what /when you said you were going to the library the day before the finals on third year?" "Oh, honestly, Ronald. It was the night before, of course I had been prepared for the exams weeks before that and a girl needs to de-stress before something as important as the finals."/

On her second year Ginny find them trying to set Peeves on fire (they fail, that time, but eventually and after a lot of research on Hermione's part they succed on their sixth year) and joins them. It's chaos and also, explosions.
