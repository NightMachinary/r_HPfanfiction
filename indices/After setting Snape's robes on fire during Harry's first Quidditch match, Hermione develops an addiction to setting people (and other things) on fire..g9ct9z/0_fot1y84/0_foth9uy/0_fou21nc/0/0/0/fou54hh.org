Ron starts learning other spells so he can mess with hermione back which causes hermione to learn study chess so she can beat ron at his own game.

Ron eventually askes hermione out to the yule ball in a much better way she had been asked by krum and accepted she tells ron this and says she will save him a dance or two

they eventually start dating after the yule ball

hermione still sets ron on fire, only because its funny to see him chasing after people while on fire
