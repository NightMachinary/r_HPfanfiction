/[Department of Mysteries./ */Harry/*, */Ron/*, and */Hermione/* /have found themselves hiding behind several stone tables, exchanging spells with Death Eaters, amid a general din of spellfire and alarm.]/

*Hermione:* /[shouting across the aisle]/ Harry, Ron, go on! I'll take care of them and catch up with you in a minute!

*Harry:* /[shouting back]/ We can't leave you behind!

*Hermione:* But Fiendfyre is hard enough to keep off me without having to worry about allies!

*Harry:* What if you lose control again?!

*Hermione:* I haven't lost control of Fiendfyre in over two months!

*Harry:* What about Malfoy's left ear?!

*Hermione:* I meant to do that!

*Ron:* Hey...

*Harry:* Really?! You meant to do that?!

*Hermione:* Are you calling me a liar?!

*Ron:* Hey!

*Harry and Hermione:* What?!

*Ron:* The Death Eaters are gone.

*Harry:* Are they flanking us?

*Ron:* No, mate, I think they just ran away.

*Hermione:* Oh, they did, didn't they... C'est la vie.

*Harry:* Are you... disappointed?
