Well, her wand /is/ dragon heartstring... I know two post-Hogwarts fics:

- In /Dangerous/ by Black Lotus (unfinished, went down with the Granger Enchanted site but can be found at [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwfE6l6RtZAsYlo4cG9IOG9nWnc]]), Hermione is leading a terrorist organisation and uses tightly controlled Fiendfyre as her signature attack.
- In (also unfinished) linkffn(The Meaning of Father by The Obsidian Warlock), Hermione wields Fiendfyre as well.
