Canon!Hermione once said she's aware of Fiendfyre, including its abilities to destroy Horcrux, but refrain from using it. Keep in mind she already lost Ron for a while due to the locket influence, and acutely aware of the terrible effect on her and Harry by carrying it around. Not even once she suggests the group visit a deserted beach, chuck the locket then apparate away after unleashing Fiendfyre. Even when Harry is seemingly killed and she's doomed to live under the reign of a racist wizard whose very lieutenant recently tortured her, she doesn't resort to unleashing it to the advancing Death Eaters.

Now we have a Fire!Hermione who solved even the tiniest problem with Incendio (albeit with Flame-Freezing Charm for most non-Slytherin). Just a single demonstration should be enough to convince every single baddies in the canon to sit and behave.
