I feel like as long as you visualize the intended result and use the correct spell, magic takes care of the details... so if a pureblood with no knowledge of chemistry Conjured something that has tungsten in it, it'd work? but I assume you would need to create a completely new spell (whatever the process for that may be) to conjure a Mi'go or whatever it is?
