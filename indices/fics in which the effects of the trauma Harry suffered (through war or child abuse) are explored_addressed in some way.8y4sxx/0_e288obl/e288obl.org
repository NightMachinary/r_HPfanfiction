Chary Potter and the Years of Reluctance linkffn(Chary Potter and the Years of Reluctance): when confronted, he literally wants to go find a closed place like his cupboard to hide in.

The Mind Arts linkffn(The Mind Arts): Harry is sort of an emotional vampire

Harry Potter and the Nightmare of Futures Past linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmare of Futures Past) : its actually time-travel PTSD, but it does come up.

The Darkness Within linkffn(The Darkness Within): this one is kind of hard to explain. I honestly feel less sympathy for Harry than usual.
