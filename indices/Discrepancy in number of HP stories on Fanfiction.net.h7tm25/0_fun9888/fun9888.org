Some websites don't properly update information when they delete stories. It could be that the discrepency is due to deleted stories (there was a big NC-17 purge a long time ago).

Moreover, this count can be inconsistent in different places, since most code has inconsistencies.

For instance, some places might count how many stories were ever created (a fairly quick thing to do); whereas, other places might actually do a search and then filter out deleted stories (much more expensive to do).
