Would Dudley even qualify for Slytherin? I can't imagine him as particulary cunning or ambitious, and he doesn't even have a family tradition to push him there like some pureblood (Crabe and Goyle). Though I can't imagine Dudley as anything else than a bad Hufflepuff (the one who got sent there because they didn't fit any house, not the hardworking ones).

Also, a Slytherin Dudley would have a /very/ bad time. PS Harry is still the dear of the Wizarding World (without any affair like the death of a Professor or the Chamber of Secret to blemish his reputation). The only people who would be happy to see Harry bullied would be the less savory type of Slytherin (Junior Death Eater) who would hate Dudley for his blood status.
