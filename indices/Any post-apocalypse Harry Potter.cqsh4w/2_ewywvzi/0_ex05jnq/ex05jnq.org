Really?

Because the first 5 chapters that I read a few years ago had me convinced that the story is incredibly bad. At least 20 plot holes every chapter, huge ones at that. People behaving totally irrational. And I don't mean understandably irrational, as it is a zombie apocalypse. No, irrational like they are 10 year old kids. And the whole premise is so fuckin idiotic, I can't even begin to explain it. Everybody is constantly taking shit from some pureplood elite that for whatever reason is STILL ruling over everybody, nevermind that they are a huge minority and have no actual powerbase. And on top of all that he writes a Harry that behaves like a kicked puppy for 99% of the time...

Ah well, sorry for the rant, but that story is just really, really, REALLY bad and even after a few years it stands out in my mind. There is a reason it only has ~300 reviews after 8 years, most of which are reviews of early chapters, telling the author how bad it is.
