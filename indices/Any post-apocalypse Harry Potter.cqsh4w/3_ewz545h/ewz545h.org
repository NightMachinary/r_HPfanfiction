[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9310847/1/][Future of Ruin]] The fight between Harry and Voldemort in the books isn't the first or last time they fight, they are both reincarnating immortals and the fight goes back millennia. Many centuries after a nuclear apocalypse Harry comes across a time rift that spits out a ~25 year old Hermione.
