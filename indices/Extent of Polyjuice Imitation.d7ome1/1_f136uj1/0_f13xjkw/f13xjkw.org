No clue if there's an official answer, but there's really only a few outcomes of imbibing Polyjuiced Metamorphmagus that wouldn't be broken beyond belief.

1. Turn into what Tonks looks like naturally.

2. Turn into what she's currently morphed as.

3. It does nothing (ruining the potion from whatever magic is likely running through the bit of DNA.)
