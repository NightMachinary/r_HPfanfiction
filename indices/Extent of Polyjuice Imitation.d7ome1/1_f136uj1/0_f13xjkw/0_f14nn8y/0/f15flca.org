Even if it straight up made someone exactly like Tonks for an hour, including her metamorphmagus talent, I imagine that that talent takes a lot of practice to use, so the person would have no clue how to really do convincing disguises. They'd be flailing around, turning all different colors and shapes for that hour, and would be much clumsier than her. They couldn't even keep their legs the same length.
