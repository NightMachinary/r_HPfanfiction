There was a one shot I read a while ago, which I am unfortunately unable to remember the name of. In it, Harry and Voldemort are dueling in a muggle area and Harry shoots a blasting curse at Voldemort. Voldemort sidesteps the curse, and it ends up hitting a natural gas line causing an explosion and blowing Voldemort to bits. This leads Dumbledore to say, "Natural Gas was the power he knew not".
