For themselves, not a big deal. But since they can catch the common cold (hence the need for pepper up potion), they should catch COVID too because at least 30% of the common cold is also caused by corona viruses. COVID can be considered a "super cold".

Wizards need to modify their pepper up potion accordingly.

In 2020, Wizarding Britain is run by Hermione Granger and Harry Potter, and they are neither ignorant nor negligent about the Muggle world. But the shear scale of the COVID spread means that they can offer only limited help. Production of magical potions is not automated or industrialized, and duplication spells do NOT work on magical items.

The best they can do is provide the cure to families of Muggleborns and some Half-Bloods, and Muggles they work with, including the Prime Minister. Remember Boris Johnson's near death experience in April? He was actually saved by wizards.
