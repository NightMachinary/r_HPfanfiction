Magic in Harry Potter is versatile and conceptual. The freezing charm can stop pixies and freeze a burglar alarm. Episkey can heal a cut and heal a broken nose, the differing anatomy of the injuries don't matter. The pepper-up potion cures the common cold and helps warm someone up. I'd say that the pepper-up potion probably would work, the concept of the diseases are similar enough.
