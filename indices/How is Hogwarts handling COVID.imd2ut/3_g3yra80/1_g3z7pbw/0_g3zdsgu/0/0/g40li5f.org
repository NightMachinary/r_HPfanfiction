  Magic in Harry Potter is versatile and conceptual

To an extent, yes. But not entirely. You can't use Alohomora to unlock your untapped potential, for example, only regular locks.

  The freezing charm can stop pixies and freeze a burglar alarm
#+end_quote

Yeah, because it freezes things in place. An alarm works via the laws of physics and requires electrical signals to be able to move through the wiring. Freezing it would prevent those signals from travelling through the wire, the same way it would prevent the pixies from flying/moving around.

  I'd say that the pepper-up potion probably would work, the concept of the diseases are similar enough.

Really depends on how the potion works. Does it specifically target the cold or does it eliminate all viruses? If the former, then it's doubtful, though could probably be used as a base for a Covid cure. If the latter, then sure, it'd work for any virus. We don't really know how it works, however since it's specifically called the cure for the common cold and not a virus cure, and potions seem to be more rigorous than other forms of magic, I'd lean towards the former.
