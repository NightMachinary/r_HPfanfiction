  Prisoner of Azkaban AU: After the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff Quidditch match, Harry finds himself striking up two unlikely friendships. The first is with Hufflepuff's captain, Cedric Diggory. The second is with the Grim. You know, that canine specter of Death that's been trying to kill him. Between that and learning the Patronus Charm, surviving Sirius Black, passing his classes, training for the Quidditch House Cup, trying to figure out why Professor Lupin treats him so strangely, helping Hermione fight for werewolf rights, and more, Harry seems to be in for yet another busy year at Hogwarts. (Tl;dr: an alternate canon for POA, featuring crushes on handsome Hufflepuffs and canine Marauder dads.)
