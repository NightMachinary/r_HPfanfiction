I haven't read many of those, although I do quite like The Peace Not Promised. If you're ok with a sympathetic Severus, have you read linkffn(The Snape Chronicles)?

linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) tend to be violent, if you haven't already read about them, but his level of angst isn't too bad considering what he's going through. I don't recall whether there's a pairing for Harry; if there is, it's not a big part of the story.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series has a gripping plot, and no character-bashing (there are plenty of villains, for remarkably understandable reasons, but no-one that the author just randomly turned into cartoon evil). But it may be longer than you want; the first book is over 220k, and the fourth is over 440k (with one chapter to go). Harry is quite a bit more powerful and skilled than canon, but it's a) somewhat justified by growing up with both her parents and full knowledge of magic; and b) a liability when she's trying to conceal her identity and her gender and can't afford the spotlight. Not to mention it attracts people who want to use her in their political games or just outright steal her large magical reserves for themselves.
