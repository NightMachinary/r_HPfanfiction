  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

  Harry's words spiraled out through Remus' mind in dangerous fractals. What exactly did â€˜gone' even mean? He had thought Peter was gone for a dozen years, only to find that he was alive. The entire Wizarding World had thought Voldemort gone until he had returned! Why should he assume the permanence of Sirius' death when that line was blurred, when that line was as fragile as the flutter of a Veil? Could fabric not be torn?     In which Remus Lupin must come to terms with third chances coming at a very dear price.*Written for Fireside Tales 2020*
