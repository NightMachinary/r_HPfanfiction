Two reasons - the first is that Rachel was originally a separate character, but I realized the story worked better with her taking the role of Harry. The second is that I had a teacher who saved my life, her name was Mrs. Snow, and even though she's passed on, I like to include her name in some of my works as a sort of memorial to her.
