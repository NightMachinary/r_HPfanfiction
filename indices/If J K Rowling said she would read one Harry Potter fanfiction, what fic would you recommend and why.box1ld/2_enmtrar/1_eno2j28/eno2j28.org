i thought Aunt Marge's Even Bigger Mistake was fantastic but i thought the aurors was a naff HP story, loads of ways they could have solved it with a couple spells, even canon spells not just cliche fanfic trope spells. However i thought it was a great little detective story and if the author stripped out the HP characters, pretty much the one spell used in the story and added some world building back story to replace the HP, it could easily be sold on amazon
