I mean to be honest the common criticism of veritaserum never made sense to me because there's plenty of times in canon where Rowling conveniently hand waves it away too. It's an over powered tool that she never really utilised in canon, and as someone who reads very little fanfic I hadn't realised how prevalent it was in other stories and how much people expected it to be used. But yes in general it becomes more difficult to write a procedural drama when people can vanish into thin air!
