I would suggest a few of FloreatCastellum's fics, because she and JKR have the same philosophy about what makes a good story: humor and warmth, but also loss and struggle. I think so much of the bulk of HP fanfic is so serious or grim or overly formal that Rowling would just roll her eyes and tell people that they'd missed the point entirely.

Probably “The Aurors,” “The Colour of Everything,” “Tired,” or “Aunt Marge's Even Bigger Mistake.”
