Serious suggestion: linkao3(11457669). It offers an original take on the "Snape apologizes" trope with the twist of not much about canon changing. Instead it's an indepth examination of Snape's mind and past and presented and a hint of his future, with the some of the most impactful prose I've ever read. It shows all the minor inconsequential moments in the life of a Snape who apologized, expressing the resulting changes to his relationship with Lily and the Marauderers without any grand plot changes.

Half serious suggestion: linkao3(67766) The only way I can describe this fic is as crack played straight. And yet, the only part of it that feels cracky is the premise, whereas all the characterizations and dialogue come across as consistently grounded, including the variety of OCs. In a world where fics with accurate characterizations of Snape are far and few between, this somehow comes across as surprisingly true to life, especially considering that in this fic he is the bald, raybans wearing owner of a rural American diner that employs ex gangsters. (this is a Canon divergence, not a full on au. Snape was still Harry's teacher in hogwarts as per Canon prior to the story)

I would recommend these specifically to JK because 1) no one else has and 2) they feature interesting alternate universes where Snapes is in a very different position than in Canon, and yet the spirit of his character remains unchanged from canon.
