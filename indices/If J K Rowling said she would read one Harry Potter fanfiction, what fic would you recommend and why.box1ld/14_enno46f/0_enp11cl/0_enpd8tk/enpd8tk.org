There are lots of little details, like the lack of houses at the schools, the stronger presence of extra-curricular clubs like the Wizard Scouts and Junior Regiment Officers, the inclusion of American folklore like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodag][Hodag]] and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_panther][Underwater Panther]] etc. etc., which helps to sell the idea that Wizarding America has a distinct culture from Wizarding Britain. It also feels much more diverse; we get to see and hear about many different cultures living alongside one another: Old Colonial cultures, which have remained largely unchanged since the early days of European colonisation, Native American cultures, non-European immigrant cultures, etc. all of which have different levels of autonomy and assimilation. The political situation of the so called "American Wizarding Confederation" is quite complicated, and we get to learn a lot about it and its early history.

Perhaps as a natural consequence of trying to govern such a large, diverse, and politically divided collection of territories, the government of AQ's America is much more corrupt and authoritarian than that of Wizarding Britain. The Confederation tries to portray itself as democratic and egalitarian, while almost all power remains vested in the hands of a small number of powerful, aristocratic families. Classism and blood supremacy are much more entrenched than they were in Britain: Alexandra's school of Charmbridge Academy only recently started accepting non-pure blood students. Freedom of speech and the press are heavily restricted, with the threat of dark-wizards used as an excuse to pass increasingly draconian laws which often end up targeted at political opponents, or at anyone who dare threaten the status quo. There are a lot of parallels with the real America, especially the political climate post-9/11.
