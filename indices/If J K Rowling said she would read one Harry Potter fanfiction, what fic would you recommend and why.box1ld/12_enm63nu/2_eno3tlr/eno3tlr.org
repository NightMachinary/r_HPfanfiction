tbh if she ever did, she wouldn't anymore because the writing is so bad except literally less than a handful of writers. i read them for the wacky ideas and trope rehashes and the power fulfilment stories etc but i cant see her doing it for that reason, as she has probably had them all already in the process of her worldbuilding trial and errors. she'd read it for the characterisation, but based on how the fandom is so against Harry-Ginny (and therefore missed all the wonderful subtleties in her writing - barely anyone recaptures that and so misses her characterisation by such a wide margin, JK would be disappointed there too)
