I'd recommend 'Dodging Prison and stealing witches: revenge is best served raw' by LeadVone. Just, besides the HP/Multi element of it, it's brilliant. Rare is a fic with any actual brains applied to it in a creative way /which doesn't let the plot die without the author's direct support/.

There are other good ones too - loads of them.

Another good one to rec is Basilisk-born, a truly nice fic.

A third candidate is Groundhog day. It's silly and stupid at times, but it's brilliant at many other times.
