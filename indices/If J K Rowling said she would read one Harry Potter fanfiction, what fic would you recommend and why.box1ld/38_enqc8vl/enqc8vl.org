There's a fanfiction where Ron is the Main Character where he realize he's gonna die in 6 month and slowly the story reveal more about of Ron sacrifice, heroic deed, and loyalty for his friends in Deathly Hallow 2, and how the character of Ron with flaws is created, overshadowed by his brothers and especially his sister who is being spoiled a ton by her mother who really want a daughter.

​

It's freaking emotional, 10/10 despite how somewhat complicated the writing are, the quality story is that GOOD. It make's me want to beg JK Rowling of making it canon instead of Curse Child whatever.

​

I forgot the title tho. R.I.P
