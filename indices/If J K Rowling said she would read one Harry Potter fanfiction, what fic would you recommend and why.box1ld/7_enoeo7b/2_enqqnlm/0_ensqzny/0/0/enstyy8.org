That was a very bare-bones summary. But the age question imo is the reason Debt of Time's recommendation is controversial: Hermione is returned to age 11 and starts school again with the Mauraders - but she still knows everything from before. So is she 16 when she bangs a 16 year old, or is she 22? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

That's not the only issue with the fic... but it's rather understandably the one most likely to turn people off.

Edit. That being said, it's a well written longfic that's a fun guilty pleasure read, for when you aren't going to think too hard about it.
