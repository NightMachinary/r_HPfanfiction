This fandom has now 12 years since the books are released. Of course, there isn't much "new" anymore, as we have a proud history to look back on.

However, there are still new, great stories, for example I personally would recommend her linkffn(What's her name in Hufflepuff) -- because it is a delightful fic that shows how to have fun in her universe.
