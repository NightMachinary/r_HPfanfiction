Feels more like this subreddit is in a bit of a rut, tbh. Stick around long enough, every forum eventually turns into a bit of a hivemind.

Writers are still writing, so for better or worse there's still good stuff coming out occasionally. You probably won't see 15-20 great new recs every week, but good fics are out there.

The problem is finding it. Ask yourself when was the last time you went to the HP section, filtered by all ratings and publish date, and just went down the list looking for gems. I certainly haven't done that for a decade, and I don't know that I ever will again.
