- Albus: white (without lustre) / clear, bright / pale, fair, gray, hoary / (figuratively) favorable, fortunate, auspicious, propitious
- Percival: Possibly related to Welsh Peredur, from ber (“spear, lance”), from Proto-Celtic *beru (“spit”) + dur (“hard metal, steel”)
- Wulfric: wulf "wolf" and ric "rich, powerful"
- Brian: It is possible that the name is derived from an Old Celtic word meaning "high" or "noble"

^{sources: Wikipedia/Wiktionary}

It's very clear: Bright, noble and powerful wolf with a spear.

​

And since I'm at it:

- Tom: Diminutive of Thomas (Aramaic תאומא‎ or תאמא‎ “twin” )
- Marvolo: Does not exist, created only for anagrammatic purposes

... Huh... a small twin who likes puns I guess ?
