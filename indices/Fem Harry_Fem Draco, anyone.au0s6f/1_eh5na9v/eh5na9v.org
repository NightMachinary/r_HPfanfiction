Linkao3(791048) For the sake of a name is complete, although I didn't finish it, but should scratch that itch. Draco starts off male, which might put you off.

Linkao3(11518236) The changing lights is also a genderswap story, and Draco continues to use the male pronoun. The characterisation is better in this fic, though it's unfinished. It also seems to be heading towards Draco becoming a man once again, but Harry is supposedly demisexual and won't mind.

Both have elicit scenes.

I started Linkffn(6863983) Harry Potter: the Serpent Lord but couldn't get over the name /Draconica/ but I remember it being otherwise compitent
