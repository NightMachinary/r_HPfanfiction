I would keep the story, but add /Alexandra Quick/ linkffn(3964606):as a second series that happens later on, just continuing the story of special wizarding children across the world. I'm really interested in the idea of how wizards live in different cultures. I would totally be interested in a series (fanfiction or not) that takes place in another country.
