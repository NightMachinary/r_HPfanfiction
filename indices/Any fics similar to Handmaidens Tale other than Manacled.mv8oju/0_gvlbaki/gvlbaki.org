There's /The Tale of Two fools/ linkffn(2026165) but it is seriously underdeveloped and hasn't been updated for a good sixteen years.

You could also try /The Auction/ linkao3(19101535) by LovesBitca8. It's not that much in the Handmaids Tale trope as Manacled is, but is an amazing book and part of an amazing series.
