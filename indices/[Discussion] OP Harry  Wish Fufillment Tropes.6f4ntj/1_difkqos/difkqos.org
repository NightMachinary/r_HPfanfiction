Make sure you add animagus, if you're trying to go for OP Harry. And for bonus points, acquiring the Hallows is another possibility for OP stuff. Absorbing the horcrux in his scar, stealing magic from death eaters, etc.

Even time travel, if you're so inclined.

Edit: for absurd crazy bullsh*t, go for wandless magic.

I'm sorta depressed that I can list all those off the top of my head.
