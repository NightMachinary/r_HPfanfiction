Omg please ping me when you start publishing. I love it when people flesh out minor characters. Personally I would love to see Ollivander, Fortescue, Moody, the Longbottoms (who I headcanon as older than the Potters), the Prewetts, Emmeline Vance. That being said, these are minor characters who I don't think are particularly popular (that's why I'm so excited to see you writing this fic). So I don't know if writing those characters would translate to a ton of readers.

That's my two cents!
