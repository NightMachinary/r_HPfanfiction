Peter Pettigrew. Fanon often make him some stuttering idiot, only good to be punished by Voldemort. But the guy managed to frame Sirius for all his crimes, and was a spy for a good year before that. Not to mention that James and Sirius chose him as the Secret Keeper because he had their full trust (unlike Remus).

I wish there were more fics with a competent Peter.
