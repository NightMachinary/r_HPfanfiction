It looks like it's a part of [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/15025][Magical Relations]] by evansentranced linkao3(331625)

I found the phrase used to describe the fic in a fic rec roundup [[https://demifishblog.tumblr.com/post/174934242459/harry-potter-fic-recs-ii][here]] :

  Magical Relations is a series rewrite of what might happen if Dudley Dursley also got a letter from Hogwarts, including Slytherin!Harry to get away from Dudley, inter-house study groups, Hermione and Neville as The Best Gryffindors, sneaky sneaky Slytherins, *How To Manage Vernon Dursley: A Guide by Dudley Dursley*, so much character growth, and Harry's adorable crush on Padma Patil.
