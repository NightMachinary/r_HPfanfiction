"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies...."

'And either must die at the hand of the other' Is the key bit for me. It really comes down to arrogance vs practicality, how insane do you think he is, and how much do you think he thinks you can meddle with a prophecy.

In my opinion little would change, it would only confirm what he already suspected. Voldemort already thinks he knows the power is love. He thinks he's beaten it already when he took Harry's blood. Voldemort always wanted to kill Harry himself and Harry is the only person other than Dumbledore who has faced him and survived that we know of. Now someone might, and i have seen it in fics, take the idea that since Harry is the only one who can kill him that he's immortal so long as he doesn't fight Harry. Either find a way to make peace with Harry or just have him stunned and locked away for all of eternity. I don't think that fits with the Voldemort we know. I don't think it would even cross his mind that he could be the loser if they faced again. He believes he knows the power and all it will take now is for Voldemort to kill him by his own hand.
