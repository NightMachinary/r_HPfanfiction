  but you dislike Molly for her relationship with Sirius?

She mocks Sirius about his time in Azkaban to his face in his own house. That's something you expect from a lowlife like Snape, to be honest. She says this when Sirius wants to tell his godson why he's being hunted - which, in hindsight, was absolutely the right thing to do.

Sirius wasn't reckless or damaged in book 5 - for all that canon characters (and fanon authors) like to think that Sirius is very reckless, he doesn't actually do anything reckless in Book 4 or Book 5 at all.
