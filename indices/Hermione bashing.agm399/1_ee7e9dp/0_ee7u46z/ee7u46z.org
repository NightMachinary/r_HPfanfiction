Hard to explain, but my friend who got me into HP hated Hermione, so when he explained about her bossyness and other annoying qualities it kinda stuck.

And for the Weasleys, i only dislike Ginny and Molly. Molly for how she treated Sirius and Ginny because i was so dissapointed when Ginny ended up with Harry in canon.
