You can do a quick search and you'll find that even asking for a fic where Harry doesnt befriend Hermione(so no bashing) is going to be downvoted. And you'll probably get upvoted if you ask for Ron bashing in this sub. The problem lies in those stupid person who doesn't understand that downvoting is for offensive, irrelevant, etc... post. But you shouldn't Downvote if you just disagree with what op is looking. Sadly, most of those stupid person are also Hermione fanatics.
