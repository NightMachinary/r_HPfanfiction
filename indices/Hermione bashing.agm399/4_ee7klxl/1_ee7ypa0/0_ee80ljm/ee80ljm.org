The "bashing" I was talking about was that some of Hermione's smarts and research get attributed to Dumbledore feeding her the information. As well as this paragraph:

Miss. Granger however did accept the bribe. She spied on you at every opportunity. Each time you had too little information, Dumbledore would tell her what she could pass on to you. She was given several rare books from his own collection in return. She didn't understand the books yet and they were confiscated by the Unspeakables, so she didn't gain a single thing.
