I don't know any Witcher ot GoT crossovers but here are some that I liked (mostly slash, hope U don't mind) About 40k and longer.

Linkao3(4148136) A Marvel x Harry Potter crossover. Brilliantly written, great relationships and characterizations and the plot was great. Pairing Loki/Harry

Linkao3(1134255) A Sherlock x Harry Potter Crossover. Also really good. Pairing is Mycroft/Harry

Linkao3(3205676) It's shorter, I think about 15 k but there I would recommend you to take a look at the whole series, I think it's only two works at the moment therefore you get to read a little bit morw, it's also really good and funny. Basically Harry and Hermione examine the veil of Death and everytime you walk through you land in a different Universe. This one is a Supernatural x Harry Potter crossover, the next work in the series is a HP x Marvel Crossover. Here is no real pairing but I think Ginny/Harry is mentioned in one of the works but there is no focus on that.
