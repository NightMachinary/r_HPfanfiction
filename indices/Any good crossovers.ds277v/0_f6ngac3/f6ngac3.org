My favorite crossovers (that don't require knowledge of the other universe) are linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) - a D&D crossover - and linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) - a crossover with the Dresden Files.

Both are quite well done, so I'd definitely recommend them. I haven't really come across a GoT/Harry Potter crossover that I've enjoyed, though people seem to like the already recommended Wizard of Harrenhal one. I believe [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bjjd7f/lf_some_good_harry_potter_and_game_of_thrones/][this thread]] has some additional ones that you may want to check out.
