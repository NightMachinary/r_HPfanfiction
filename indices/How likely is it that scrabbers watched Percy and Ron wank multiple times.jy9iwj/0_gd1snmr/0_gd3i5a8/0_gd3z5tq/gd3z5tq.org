I don't think it really matters. Harry doesn't check up on most people unless he is actively trying to avoid them. The only people he checks up on are Ginny because he wanted to see how she was doing and Malfoy because he was hoping to find out what he was up to. Pretty sure the twins didn't give a shit about how Ron was sleeping.
