Readup - Pro Overall I love the app, but it does have it's shortcomings.

It's ffn only, the update process can take a while if you have a loy of stories and the narration feature requires the app to be open or it randomly closes the app and stops narrating and will lose your place.

On the other hand, the library is fairly efficient with several sorting methods as well as filtering and customizable tags, it's convenient and can favorite/follow stories in app or review in the internal browser. You can add by story id or by browsing/searching. Overall the interface is fairly user-friendly.

I actually paid to get the premium version which doesn't add any features besides being ad-free.
