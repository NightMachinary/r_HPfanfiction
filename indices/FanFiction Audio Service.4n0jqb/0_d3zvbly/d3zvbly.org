I can't say I have the stuff to be a vice actor, but having stories be taken into an audial context would be amazing. I use a Fanfiction app to narrate stories I download, but it isn't perfect by any stretch and is downright cumbersome at times.

I think this is amazing and look forward to seeing it reach fruition.
