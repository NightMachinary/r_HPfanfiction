From OotP Chapter 38:

#+begin_quote
  Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at Harry.

  ‘He won't come back.'

  ‘Who?'

  ‘Sirius Black,' said Nick.

  ‘But you did!' said Harry angrily. ‘You came back -- you're dead and you didn't disappear --'

  ‘Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to walk palely where their living selves once trod,' said Nick miserably. ‘But very few wizards choose that path.'

A ghost isn't the actual wizard, it is an "imprint" of them. So I don't think a ghost staying behind would necessarily be viewed as a sad thing.
