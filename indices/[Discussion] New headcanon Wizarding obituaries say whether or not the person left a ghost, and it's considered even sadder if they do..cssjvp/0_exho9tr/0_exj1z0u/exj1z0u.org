"Choose that path" would imply to me that it's an either/or situation. There's a metaphorical fork in the road, and you can either choose the path where you go on to the next great adventure, or you cling to the living world and leave an imprint of yourself.

If you could have your cake and eat it too, why wouldn't everyone leave behind a ghost? There have to be negative repercussions that explain why the world isn't flooded with them.
