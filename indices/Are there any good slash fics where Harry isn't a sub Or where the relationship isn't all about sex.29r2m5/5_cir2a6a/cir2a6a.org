Try to track down some of [[http://fuckyeah-drarry.tumblr.com/post/40443518591/the-complete-works-of-maya][Maya's stuff]]. Her characterization of Harry was always so complicated and nuanced (really, all the characters were well served by her writing). I suggest Drop Dead Gorgeous, If You've a Ready Mind (not from Harry's POV), and Underwater Light in particular. I hate pretty much all Drarry slash except hers.

In the three I mentioned above, they have to develop a friendship and trust before anything beyond that happens. It's all very critical of JKR's treatments of the characters (and DDG is actually a satire of bad slash).

If you get nothing else out of it, they're fucking hilarious. I always giggle audibly when reading them.

EDIT: I feel I should mention that this stuff is pretty old. She stopped writing in 2008 and most of her stuff is only current through the 6th book
