Can't help you with the gender politics, but if you sort by favs every third or fourth fic is slash. I assume that if you stay clear of the ones featuring Snape or Malfoy you'll find the stories where Harry is on top.

*Edit*: also Voldemort, but fanfiction.net only lets you filter out two characters at a time.
