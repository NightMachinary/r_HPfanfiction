I just want to say that I completely agree with you on the believe that pairings should be believable. So many fics are written with the goal of just putting two characters together because the actors who played the characters were sexy or whatever. I've never read a fic that I liked where harry is paired with the Malfoys or Snape either.

However, I do want to say that there are some slash fics that I do enjoy because they don't fall into this trap. And if I would recommend any of them to you, I would recommend Aorist Subjuctive by Minisinoo. Absolutely fantastic, and the pairing is completely believable from my point of view. It's not on ff.net, but if you just search in google it should be in the first few links.
