I've read several good fics with Sirius Black and Remus Lupin in a romantic relationship, but I've never found any good Harry slash fics.

I have nothing against slash, but I can't stand the dom/sub stuff, and the concept of mpreg definitely turns me off. And that's the problem, because most slashfics go all out on the weird (to me) stuff. It's like the authors think that since they've crossed one or two lines, /all/ the lines should be crossed. That just turns slash into crackfic territory.

And the pairings should at least be /believable/. Harry with Snape or either of the Malfoys? Or even Voldemort? Please.
