It does not work for me either! Does anyone know how to get access to the fanfics now? Some authors (for example everythursday with "The Fallout" (which I would highly recommend if we could read it)) only posted their stories on dramione.org. If anyone knows a way please share it :) It would be a shame if all those stories disappeared forever!
