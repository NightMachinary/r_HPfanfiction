Ik. I mean I look at the wordcount because of that. I mean i think it's alright if you put out a prompt so to say but it's sometimes a bit disappointing if you click on a fic and then there is someone telling you "This my headcanon, might write a fic about it here one day..."

I think requests/prompts are alright but it's still kinda disappointing if you expect a fic and then you get a desert of emptiness
