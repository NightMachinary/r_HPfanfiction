I'm not sure about other fic hosting sites, but on AO3 this is explicitly against [[https://archiveofourown.org/tos_faq#max_inclusiveness][their ToS]]:

  Where we provide a specific function (search, bookmarking, challenges) we will ask you to use the specific methods we provide for those activities rather than create separate works. So, for example, a request for recommendations for particular kinds of fanworks would not be an appropriate work. That search should be carried out by searching works and/or bookmarks. A list of recommended works on a particular topic would also not be an appropriate work. Recommendations should be done by using our bookmarking function. A description of a challenge for other creators would also not be an appropriate work. That should be carried out by using our challenge function.

  In addition, as an Archive whose goal is preservation, we want permanent, nonephemeral content. To the extent that your content is designed to be ephemeral, such as liveblogging episode reactions, it should go on a journaling service and not the Archive.

If you believe a work violates this, you can report it to the Abuse team (there's a handy link at the bottom of the site), who, in my experience, is very good at following up on complaints.
