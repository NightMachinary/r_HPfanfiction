I haven't run into those too much and I only get the updates for 'Bunny Ranchers' for authors I'm subscribed to/following.

I don't mind running into the occasional Essayist as long as their work(s) tie into the fandom.

The works that are really grossing ME out lately are when I do a search for some new reading material (I know, with 1300 bookmarks and 600 subscriptions on AO3 and about that on FFN, why would I need anything *new*! Lol!) using just my regular tags and I keep on getting something called "Potter-Cest" popping up! The tag honestly squicks me. I just wish that these people would go post their stuff on AFFN and quit tagging, in such a way, as it's pushed constantly in my face!

That's *my* pet peeve. ;D
