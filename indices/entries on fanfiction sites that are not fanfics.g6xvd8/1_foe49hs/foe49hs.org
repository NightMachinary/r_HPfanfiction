It's incredibly annoying to see on the FFN app.

I also really hate when someone marks a story as complete so it shows up in my custom search (which is along the lines of complete, 60k+ words, recently updated), but it shows up /every damn week/ because it's actually a collection of stories that they add a new 500 word piece to frequently, bumping the update date back up.
