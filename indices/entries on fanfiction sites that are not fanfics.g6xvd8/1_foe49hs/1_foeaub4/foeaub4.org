I feel you. I don't like it more when the work is marked as complete and you go like "oh, nice" and read with expectations for closure only to find out the last chapter's actually something along the line of "abandoned" or "on hiatus indefinitely". Or not even that, marked as complete and no info nowhere - not in the description, not in the last chapter... Just a normal chapter with a cliffhanger or one that was obviously not meant to be the last one.
