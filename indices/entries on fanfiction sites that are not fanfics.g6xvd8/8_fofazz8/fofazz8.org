On most 'Archive' sites, such is against the rules, so just mash that Report button XD

Additionally, if you do not have time to bother with that and you saw an "author" who does that a lot, or even exclusively (note the " "), on FFN there are a few communities of bored busybodies that can take care of the whole lot for you - just shoot them a link to author profile. Hate them, but they can be occasionally useful.
