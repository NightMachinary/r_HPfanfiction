Gonna go with the wizards. If for no other reason than magic can directly effect the mind.

But I agree with [[/u/HarryAugust]], I feel like the intention of this idea is that the Kingsmen are wizards. They've got tech, magic, and maybe the two combined into more effective/powerful techno-magical gadgetry.
