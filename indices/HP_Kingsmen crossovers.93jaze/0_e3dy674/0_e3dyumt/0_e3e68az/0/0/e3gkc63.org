I personally love when Magic and Muggle stuff mix in a fic, it doesn't all have to be guns and shooting cause magic itself is highly malleable, imagine creating instant cover, walls to cut off escapes, create birds to take shots for you, and thats just defensively. I love when stories mix the two together, sure Harry has a self replenishing magazine in his 1911 and a enchanted dragon leather skinned bullet proof vest but he also has a wand that allows him localized reality warping
