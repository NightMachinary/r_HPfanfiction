Personally, I'd prefer completely separate and character-focused (we don't have enough character-focused works in the fandom, IMO), unless you have a particular underlying plot you're passionate about - though I'd say a plot-focused story would probably make the transition to global scale easier later on ("You found the MacGuffin and uncovered the evil plot, come join the ICW auror branch and help us hunt down the perpetrators!").

I like the idea of an auror's caseload for a frame story - do you have an idea of how you're going to portray that 'case by case' nature? eg. Is it a series of verbal case debriefs to a superior officer, are we reading the auror's after-action reports, is the audience the standard omnipresent witness, etc?

I have no particular opinion on having only OCs in the series - I've seen good OCs and bad OCs alike - though I would say that the occasional cameo by a character we know might be a fun treat to draw new interest (eg. if they need to solve a case in England, the auror department there might throw up a few familiar faces; or maybe they meet Hermione at an ICW conference and have a brief chat exchanging ideas, etc).

About the only thing I'd actively request to be in your work would be at least one CSI-style pun, complete with sunglasses. Because how can it be a Law Enforcement story without one? :)
