'Finally, my treasured rival you have appeared before me my entire life I have had one true passion and it was for gobstones. sadly I quickly found that no wizard nor witch could match my prodigies powers in the art of the gobstones and my dream of having a challenge match of gobstones was crushed. but how fitting that the one who was chosen to by prophecy to defeat me as lord Voldemort is also the one who shall face wits against Tom Marvolo Riddle at Gobstones.''
