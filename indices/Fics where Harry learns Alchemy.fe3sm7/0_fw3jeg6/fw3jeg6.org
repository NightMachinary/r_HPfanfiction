I just caught up with the linkffn(Pureblood Pretense) series, where alchemy is similar in effect to Transfiguration, but achieved through calculation and runic arrays. It takes a lot more preparation, but is more energy efficient, allowing more impressive effects at the high end. Harry learns it one on one from Professor Dumbledore.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/][Enter the Dragon]] takes a different approach, with alchemy being direct mass-energy conversions. Easy to perform, but equally easy to kill yourself via tremendous nuclear explosion (for exothermic transmutation) or total magic drain (for endothermic), so using it successfully requires excellent magical control. Harry is still in the early stages of learning.

And if you're ok with a protagonist other than Harry, then linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) has Severus learning alchemy from Dumbledore because he's not properly challenged by his other classes (since he's repeating his life). This version of alchemy achieves a complete and permanent transformation (unlike Transfiguration which affects only some properties of the material and is temporary), by breaking down the material at the molecular level and rearranging it with the aid of a catalyst.
