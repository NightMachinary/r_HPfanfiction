Seconding this one. Also one of my favorite Harry/Fleur fics(plus an awesome Katie Bell).

It has believable character growth, Harry doesn't just start randomly killing people and he's certainly not evil, not even at the end but he makes very questionable decisions but it's perfectly understandable why he makes these decisions.

He gets influenced by someone that maybe shouldn't be allowed to talk to thirteen year olds, which also gives a great reason why Voldemort turned out the way he did.

The beginning is a bit questionable since Harry learns a lot of things really fast but it gets more reasonable later on and i really don't think the ending is /that/ bad. Sure, if felt rushed and just...out of place? I'm not sure how how describe it... It might be better to just skip the last two chapters and make up your own ending but it's not as bad as some people make it out to be.

Edit: okay i just read my post over and it's a real mess... I'm sorry, i'm a little tired. I hope i got my point across.
