Based on canon Fiendfyre, none could have survived. Throwing that out of the window, that has to be the shittiest OC name I have seen in quite some time. Marco does not fit the rest of the naming scheme (Marius would be more fitting). The triple first name comes across more snobby than Malfoy. The Saint prefix is generally bestowed upon by the pope (or equivalent orthodox authorities) and is not hereditary either way. With those formalities out of the way, what exactly is the purpose of that fic?

If you want to write ruthless revenge, Harry will go down better than OCs. If you want a family working for revenge, kill off Molly and Arthur in 81 and have the Weasleys go dark. If you want next-gen revenge, Teddy works just as well. Who would be the target for them? Because as much as I detest the existence of Scorpius, killing him for what Draco did does not really seem appropriate unless you go full "Mafia" and execute his entire family one by one in front of Draco, but even then that would be rather evil.

The way you set up your idea also leaves little room for creativity since you have Voldemort himself and not Umbridge (and by extension the Ministry) responsible and as future targets. Hunting down collaborators one by one has not been done in fanfics very often, Voldemort and his Death Eaters as opponents have been sucked dry. And after the second war, there aren't that many possible targets around (I am assuming that this is post Battle of Hogwarts since after the first war, the only attack was on the Longbottoms)
