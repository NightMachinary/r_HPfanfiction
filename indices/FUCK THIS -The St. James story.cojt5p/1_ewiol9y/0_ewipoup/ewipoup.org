This is a portion of the first chapter. I am going for an OC pureblood family that was more a middle of the road family if you have the dark grey and light canon wizards in some fics. I am thinking a family that was neutral until Voldemort demanded there father kneel to the dark lord or be destroyed kind of premise. As for fiendfyre the post says Ancestral home. So they are a Malfoy style family. This is an OC fic where a normally political neutral family that is push to the point the say fuck it and this has gone to family. They are out for vengeance against the death eaters and Voldemort and want to end the war and the blood shed any way possible. This more of an OC (Dark Mauraders) fic kind of vibe I am going for . But If the name doesn't fit I might change it.The fanfic would be very OC character wise, but using the Harry Potter setting more than anything else
