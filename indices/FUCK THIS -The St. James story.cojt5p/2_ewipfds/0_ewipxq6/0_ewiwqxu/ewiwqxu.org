That's a pretty unusual last name for the UK. I've never come across anyone with the word 'saint' in their surname - very occasionally you hear about St. John being used as a first/middle name but it's pronounced 'Sin-jin'. I'm going to be honest the name of the character feels fairly ridiculous and Gary-Stu like.
