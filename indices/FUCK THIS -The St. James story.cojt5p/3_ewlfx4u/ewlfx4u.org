You should absolutely write this, because literally any story you want to write is better than not writing at all. It being a first draft means it will be absolutely terrible, since first drafts are, but can be revised into something better. Then write another story and so on... Eventually come back to this, see if it has merit and went somewhere interesting, but even if it didn't, writing it will have taught you a whole lot.

It may not be received with joy, but one of the reasons some people write is to end up with stories no one else will write for them. That means sometimes you end up with a story only a handful of people will ever like. Sometimes a 'terrible' story will turn out to be actually popular. (The snippet posted needs a great deal of revision but I have seen /so/ much worse, and the point of the first draft is to tell /yourself/ the story, then you can clean it up later.)

The fun thing about this particular one is that, with a little rewriting, it could end up as an original work. That frees you up to use non-canon magic and make up your own names for spells. If canon ends up feeling like a straightjacket, consider going that route.

If you end up with an audience of one, you're still way, /way/ ahead of anyone who writes nothing at all.
