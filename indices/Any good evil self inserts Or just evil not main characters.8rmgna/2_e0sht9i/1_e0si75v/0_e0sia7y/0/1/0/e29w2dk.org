Well... Blood and Chaos was originally forged from the frustration I felt when I realized I had reached the end and there was no more of "[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/welcome-the-hellmouth-or-how-i-found-out-you-can%E2%80%99t-outrun-a-vampire.319716/][Welcome to the Hellmouth]]" by SirRabby.

I enjoyed it, but it's definitely a different tone than I wound up with in Blood and Chaos.
