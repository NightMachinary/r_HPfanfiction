If you're willing to make some sacrifices in the 'sanity' department, there's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/blood-and-chaos-the-story-of-a-btvs-si-turned-vampire.354777/][my BTVS SI.]] "I" get turned by Drusilla in the prologue and the story follows the blood demon born three days later with my memories of Buffy Canon.

Then there's my [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/magic-and-mayhem-a-harry-potter-story-about-tom-riddles-diary-eating-an-si-of-sorts.368704/][sort of spin off but not actually all that related HP SI]] in which "I" pull a merger with Tom Riddle's diary horcrux.
