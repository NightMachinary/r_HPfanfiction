Spoilers ahead:

Unwoven Threads of Fate has the main character turn his back on his friends and threaten their lives to make an escape. That's evil.

Stargate Galactic Imperium has wholesale genocide. That's evil.

A Twelve Step Program to Omnipotence has the main character nearly destroy an entire nation for personal gain. That's evil.

Point is, they /are/ evil. Just because it doesn't happen immediately doesn't make that false.
