[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/magic-and-mayhem-a-harry-potter-story-about-tom-riddles-diary-eating-an-si-of-sorts.368704/][Magic and Mayhem]] isn't a true SI in that the main character is a merger of "me" and the diary horcrux, who still considers himself to be Tom but has my knowledge of the series. Updates are sporadic as I usually write bit of it when stuck on other works, but I'm told what I have is amusing.
