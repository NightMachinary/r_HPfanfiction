The key to authenticity I think is a certain sense of down to earth touch. Many people looking from the outside-in see a culture's most obvious differences, or rather their stereotypes. As an example, many would focus on something like 'Britishisms' or the use of different slang because that would come up more often. And so they end up overtly throwing them into stories written by outsiders to the culture, making the whole thing clunky and inorganic.

But the real touches that make something 'authentic' are far more subtle. The different Christmas traditions, the activities children participate in or discuss, the views on different members of their own culture, etc. These are things Rowling honestly somewhat blows herself, particularly in GoF with how she stereotypes much of the European wizarding communities.

I guess the shorter way of parsing this is that its not about the big differences, but the synergy of all the differences that makes up the culture. You need to see how individuals simply live and act/react in their daily lives. Best way to do that, in the case of the British, is to watch some of their television programs.

Just my thoughts though.
