Sort of. For some things.

Weight can be in either Stone (not pounds) or kilos. For the 90's, use stone.

Milk and beer come in pints (though are labelled in ml), all other liquids come in litres. We pretty much never use gallons, except when buying cider straight from the farm (may have just been my childhood, not a standard thing)

Money is in pounds, but in the 90's older people would still remember the shilling and talk about how much better it was (they were of course wrong)

Length of most things is in meters, except for the human body which is in feet for height, and inches for circumstance. Fabric was sold in the 90's with the width in inches (45" or 60") and length in meters, but old patterns used yards for the length. Which all makes perfect sense of course...

Basically, the generation born in the 50's used imperial, and were having kids in the 70's and 80's, whom they taught the imperial system to, but by the 80's, schools had moved over to metric so the generation who went to Hogwarts at 11 in the 90's had about the worst of an utterly confusing mishmash of metric and imperial that is still dying out today. And of course wizards have their own mess of imperial, so muggleborn kids had a complete hodgepodge of random units. Muggle studies almost certainly had to have an entire module on conversions between the various systems.
