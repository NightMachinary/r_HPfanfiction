A lot of farmers have shotguns so do target shooters and handguns were only banned in 96, in 91 when Vernon gets one it would have been easier to get a gun, you also have some older people in the countryside might still have them, see the Tony Martin case. I could believe he got it from the old man who lent them the boat.
