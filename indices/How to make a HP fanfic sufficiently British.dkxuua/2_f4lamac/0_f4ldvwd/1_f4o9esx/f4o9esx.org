I'd always read that as Vernon borrowing it along with the shack and boat.

I think it also fits if Vernon had picked one up years ago for bird hunting which he'd acquired in hopes it'd help him rub elbows with important clients and executives, then never learned how to handle it and never ended up getting to make any connections of that sort, because it would be so very Vernon.

But I wasn't clear on gun ownership re: sport hunting between the US and UK at the time, and I've less idea how that'd work back in the 1980s when Vernon would've presumably bought the thing then left it abandoned in the attic behind a bunch of other crap he wasted money on in his mostly fruitless attempts to climb socially.
