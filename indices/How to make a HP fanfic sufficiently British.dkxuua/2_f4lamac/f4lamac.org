A couple of offhanded things:

I've seen people complain before about how easy firearms seem to be to get hold of in fic, which I'd definitely agree with. (although Vernon Dursley somehow does mysteriously get one in canon, in a scene that's always bugged me. What, respectable middle manager Vernon knows gun runners?)

One of my absolute pet peeves? People referring to "little league Quidditch". Maybe "under 11s quidditch team" might work better.

I do think it's worth bearing in mind that a few of the turns of phrase that some people might pick up on sounding pretty American ("I've gotta go do this") or some of the other comments talking about conjunctions or other broader things about phrasing) are probably okay under some circumstances. Many modern Brits would speak like that without a second thought; decades of cross pollination with American pop culture will do that for you! So especially for muggleborn characters who are more likely to see American films and tv, I really wouldn't bat an eyelid at that.

Also, if you're not sure about it... Never try to write out an accent. To be honest, I lean towards never writing one out full stop.

I agree with other posts that a) you'd do much better to avoid obvious americanisms than slapping what you think are arbitrary britishisms in - it can just read as /way/ too forced sometimes. A britpicker is also probably a good idea for anything longer, especially if you're worried about it. (PM me, I'd be open to it!) But I think it's also worth mentioning that as long as the rest of a fic is well written? I don't normally find myself really caring, to be honest. If it's particularly glaring I might take note, and I try to work out as I go whether an author is British or not, but it's never stopped me reading, and I'm pretty picky.
