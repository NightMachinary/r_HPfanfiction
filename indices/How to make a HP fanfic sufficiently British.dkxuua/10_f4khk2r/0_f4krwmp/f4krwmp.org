  Money! Personally, it gets to me when currency gets mixed up: £ not $/€ etc. pounds/pence or quid as slang for pound, and just p for pence.

This one's good advice. The UK got currency decimalization in 1971, so in any fics set before that, Brits would be using the pounds/shilling/pence system. Young Pre-Hogwarts Lily and Snape living in Cokeworth would be using the old currency system, since their date of birth was 1960.

And it's also a good tip to watch for figurative language using currency. A wizard would not be saying "penny for your thoughts", because they use Knuts. A British muggleborn would not compare a wizarding Sickle as "the size of a nickel".
