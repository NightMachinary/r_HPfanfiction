It's hard to think of words and things we use that no one else does...

•We dont use 'bloody' in every other sentence •Some spellings of words: arse instead of ass, colourful instead of colorful and things like that. •Insults: most insults we really use are curses (speaking as a seventeen year old) - "you're a C/nt/tw/t/w*nker)." •Something else is accents and similar: we'll sometimes pronounce things different and miss off 'h's and 't's : "Oi! That 'urt, mate!" Not all the time, and I'm not positive if this is particular to Manchester.

Hope that's enough :)

Edited to add:

Money! Personally, it gets to me when currency gets mixed up: £ not $/€ etc. pounds/pence or quid as slang for pound, and just p for pence. "I've only got 10 quid, sorry, do you have any change? I need 50p."
