Oh boy. I hadn't even thought about money.

"Quid" is not a synonym for "Pound". One quid might equal one pound but the circumstances where you'd say "quid" are very different to ones where you'd say "pound".

And there was one story I read where the author had obviously done a little research and used "monkey" and "pony" for £500 and £25 respectively. Yeeeess..... but that's very much Cockney slang (the terms comes from the symbols on the 500 rupee and 25 rupee notes during the latter days of empire if you're interested). You won't hear those words used outside TV soap operas.

We *do* use "a grand" for £1000, and "tenner" for £10 is pretty typical.

Another story has something like "Harry still had some Muggle pounds." No way would Harry be thinking that. "Harry still had some Muggle money" or "Muggle cash" would be better.
