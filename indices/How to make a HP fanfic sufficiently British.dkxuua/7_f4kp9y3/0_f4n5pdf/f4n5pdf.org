Can you give some examples of shops in the UK? For example, what's the equivalent of Walmart? If I'm shopping at a Walmart, I want to get a variety of things, I don't want to use up a lot of gas, time, or effort to get this variety of things, and I don't particularly care about the quality. I'm probably filling a pressing need to just have "a pair of jeans" or "a wirecutter" or "something that will taste not-horrible that I don't have to cook", and I don't need to look like a fashion plate, or re-work the wiring in my house, or impress dinner guests, I'm just glad that there's a 24 hour supercenter nearby in my hour of need.
