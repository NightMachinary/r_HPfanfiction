Every time I see a variation of "hairy/Harry" I assume the writer is American, as those words don't rhyme in British English (barring some regional accents, possibly, but they're not well-represented in HP canon). Ultimately, though, what [[/u/FloreatCastellum][u/FloreatCastellum]] said elsewhere in this thread. Cultural differences like what we eat/drink and what our homes are like and what kinds of shops are available (very few British people, for example, have ever been near Harrods let alone shopped there) are just as important as remembering to use "tap" instead of "faucet", "street" instead of "block", "torch" instead of "flashlight", or "boot" instead of "trunk".
