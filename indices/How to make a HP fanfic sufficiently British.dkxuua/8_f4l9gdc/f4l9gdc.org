I think it depends on what your goal is in it - the easiest approach, in my opinion, would be to start by smoothing out the larger cultural differences.

For instance, let's take the difference with the US. If you've got a UK with a ton of guns lying around, healthcare dynamics similar to the US, and everyone using $s, that'll be the most jarring. I would focus on those first - because getting them wrong it wouldn't matter if you got little details right.

After that is where you get more into the nitpicky aspects - words/sentences to change up slightly, and that's where it gets a bit harder to say. In a sense, it matters how important it is to people reading that Harry Potter is set in the UK - I've mentioned before that many of the britpicking doesn't really matter to me, because when I was reading it I kinda lumped in the UK/America into 'English' (I started the series in French first - it's only after book 6 that I really had a good grasp of english that I would have noticed those subtle differences).

So stuff like 'Mom vs mum', 'sweater vs jumper', 'trash vs rubbish' - that's all basically the same to me - whereas for others, they wouldn't be. What /does/ stand out more in the language of a fanfic is where it looks like it might have been taken from an action movie - so tons of normal/modern american curses, use of things like 'tank tops', or the like.

If you /are/ interested in switching up words after you've gone through the cultural smoothing, it might be worth doing some googling around. There's sites that love to list out/point out such wording differences - eg, [[https://www.spellzone.com/blog/Sixty_American_English_Words_and_their_British_English_Counterparts.htm][here's one]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_words_having_different_meanings_in_American_and_British_English][perhaps wikipedia]]. I wouldn't just copy/paste those in without some thought, but it'd be a way to not just pester someone british all the time ;)
