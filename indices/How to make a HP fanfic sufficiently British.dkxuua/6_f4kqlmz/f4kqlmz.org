Really, rather than trying to add excessive or random "british-isms" to a story, I'd recommend avoiding "american-isms" instead.

Nothing is more jarring, even in a great story, than seeing Mrs Weasley called "mom". Than having Harry's fever described as "104 degrees". Than having Ginny wearing a "tank top". Than having Harry tripping over the "sidewalk". It pulls me out of the story, and I actually find changes the whole flavour of the story in my head.

So... get a Brit picker. I'm not British, but moved to Britain at 21 and lived there for several years. There are so, so many tiny random things they say differently that took me sometimes years to realise. Instead of "I've got heaps to do" they say "I've got loads to do". Instead of "I feel sick" it's "I feel ill". Honestly, some of them I didn't realise were different until I moved back home and got laughed at for saying "hiya" as a greeting.
