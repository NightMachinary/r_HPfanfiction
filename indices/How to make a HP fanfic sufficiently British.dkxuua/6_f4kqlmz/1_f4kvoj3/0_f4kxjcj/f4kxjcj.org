Vest instead of tank top.

Don't stress about little things. British people still say sick, just will commonly say “I feel ill” where that would never have naturally come out of my mouth prior to moving to the uk. I don't find little things like that throw me out of the story, but it does richen it and make it feel more realistic.

Hiya's a bit specific to the person as well. A very upbeat greeting usually. I never got comfortable with “Alright” as a greeting. I always got the deer in the headlights “yeah I'm alright, why wouldn't I be alright” feel. And then felt like replying with “hey” was weird, so would awkwardly grunt “alright” back at them.
