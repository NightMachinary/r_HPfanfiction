My American understanding of a tank top is as a mostly womens' garment, made of similar material as a t-shirt, worn in similar contexts as a t-shirt, consisting of a tube of fabric, sometimes form-fitting, sometimes made with molded cups or a "shelf bra", and held up by thin straps over the shoulders. Lose the straps, and the garment becomes a tube top. Obviously, women above a certain bra size can't wear tank tops, not without displaying their industrial strength boob harnesses. Such women usually go for t-shirts, or other sleeveless styles.

There are tank tops for men, but they are technically undershirts, and a man wearing a tank top instead of a t-shirt is dressing even more casually then a woman wearing a tank top.
