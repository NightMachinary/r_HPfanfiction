Sounding British isn't just a matter of getting the right vocabulary words. I've seen some authors Find + Replace specific words in their fics to be more British, and it doesn't always work. The end product comes across as really weird dialogue, and doesn't fit with sentence structures and speech patterns that are clearly American, with some random Brit-ified jargon scattered through to make it look "authentic".

Replace "shit" with "shite" and "ass" with "arse" looks weird when the rest of sentence sounds like American action movie speak.

  "This place is a shitehole! I swear to Christ I'm gonna kick his arse!"

Getting that structure and syntax right is what makes British characters feel more British, and Hogwarts more like a timeless classic boarding school and not some TV high school with a Catholic uniform aesthetic. Good dialogue especially highlights certain characters - the well-educated, well-spoken, or the pompous wannabe intellectuals. Without the author having to drop it to the audience by straight-up saying, "Oh my god, Sansa, she's the smartest person I know!!!"

Here are some sentence structures that might help your dialogue sound more authentic.

Different use of contractions in UK and UK English.

#+begin_quote

  - UK: "You'll not be needing that wand today, Potter."

  - US: "You're not gonna need that wand today, Potter."
#+end_quote

Different use of conjunctions:

#+begin_quote

  - UK: "Deducting house points is my duty, as I am this year's Head Boy."

  - US: "Deducting house points is my duty, because I am this year's Head Boy."
#+end_quote

And some other things like "From whom"/"To which".

#+begin_quote

  - UK: "You received this information... from whom?" said Snape harshly, glaring at Hermione with beady eyes. To which Hermione could form no response.

  - US: "Where did you get this information from?" asked Snape, glaring at Hermione with beady eyes.
