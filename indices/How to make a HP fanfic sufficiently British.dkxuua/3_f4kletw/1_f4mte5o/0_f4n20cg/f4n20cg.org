Exactly. And many times the same word can have different connotations. For example, the word "quite". In British, when it is used to modify an adjective that has degrees to it (e.g. "quite good", "quite silly", "quite interesting"), it's usually analogous to the American, "pretty", as in "pretty good", "pretty fun", etc.\\
However, Americans use it analogously to "very". "Quite good" -> "very good", etc.\\
Since I use "quite" a lot as an American, I have to keep an eye out for it in my Harry Potter fics because I don't want British characters to use the word as an American would!
