  slang (because use of slang is often more complex and structured than you would expect)

Slang is not just a "we use "X" instead of "Y" to mean "BLAH"

Slang studies are an entire Linguistic topic that people spend years studying. there is grammar and syntax rules that you need to follow. It's why you can tell when a parent is just parroting what they hear young kids say, vs an adult who has an actual connection with the culture.

So unless you can actually immerse yourself in the culture of where you're writing about, it's easier to get someone who has actual contact with that culture/sub-culture to nitpick the details.
