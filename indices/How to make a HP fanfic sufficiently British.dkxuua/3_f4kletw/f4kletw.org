I think rather than just trying to slip in a few bits of slang (because use of slang is often more complex and structured than you would expect), it's more effective to get a Brit picker to give it a quick glance over to look out for Americanisms. There are lots of things you would never come across in lists of common Americanisms, but immediately highlight that the author is American - characters sitting on a swing chair on the porch of the burrow/Grimmauld place, for example, or making pancakes for breakfast, or even just the syntax of the way characters speak.
