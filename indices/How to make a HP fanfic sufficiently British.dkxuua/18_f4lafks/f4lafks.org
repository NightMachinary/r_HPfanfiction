Not gonna lie its is a bonus for an non British writer to fully encapsulate the feeling of the UK.

Top tips from a born and bread Londoner:

1) Don't make your characters say 'Shite' Bruv Harry lived in Surry, which isnt far from London and plus I have been to Surrey many times we speak the same slang.

And we do make dark comedy. We say dark things for banter, there is a good word for you. Banter, it's what Ron and Harry do. And cuss each others families out. I know if HP was more realistic some mugglevorns Hufflepuff would have crossed out Harry's family and called him a c*n. I would say it but the mods have been watching me.

Oh and try to include Bruv, beef things like that. Now I ain't been to America since I was a kid so I dont know of you have this, but in the nineties sayings like Wagwan were popular especially in S/SE London which is where I'm from. Which is I assume where Dean Thomas is from so dont make him say cheerio.

2) Movements is important. For example kids dont high five, we spud each other or in simpler terms a judge with the fist tilted upwards and we do it with force ( I'm 16 I'm giving you minor details) and also teens particularly have sex. I'm not saying to describe it, God no but especially in public schools seeing a chavy girl get pregnant before her GCSE's was mad.

And dont underestimate chavs, they are in Hogwarts I know it.

4) Sports. I know you have Quidditch. But some of you Americans make NFL things which I have no idea on, and likewise with a lot of UK readers. We dont care about some NFL player who played for Minnesota Wolves or whatever, speak to is woth Football, not b tec Rugby, FOOTBALL. And at that time Harry might have liked Arsenal or Man U. Personally I lean more towards Liverpool but that's because I support them myself.

5) Please. Please dont say mom. It hurts me everytime reading Harry talk like a yank. For example:

Harry woke up and saw a strange woman with lo g red hair. "MOM? IS THAT YOU? MOM?"

Or a personal favourite of mine in a WBWL fic

"Mom, you left me alone for all those years. And now I'm back. Back to kick some ass!"

We dont say things like that. We just dont.

6) Who actually drinks coffe in England. Barely anyone. Even immigrants dont drink coffe. As an Albanian we drink Turkish coffe which is different from American coffe, or we drink the most popular drink TEA.

PG, Earl grey, some dutty Tesco brand. TEA IS OUR DRINK!

7) Finally dont over do it with British-isms. Be low key about it and if your stuck dont be afraid to ask.

How this helps and remember TEA!
