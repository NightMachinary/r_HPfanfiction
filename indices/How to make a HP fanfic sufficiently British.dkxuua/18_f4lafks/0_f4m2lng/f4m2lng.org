Everything you have recommended has ignored the class realities of the UK and the environment Harry grew up in. He was in a middle class suburban area in the 80s and his cousin was being sent to a public school. They were not using inner city slang like wagwan and bruv. This is what I mean when I say slang is nuanced and structured - I have no doubt that this was your experience growing up, but if I came across it in a fic I would assume it was a non Brit trying too hard.

Plus... people definitely drink coffee here. I am baffled that you could grow up in London and not see the starbucks/Costa on every corner.
