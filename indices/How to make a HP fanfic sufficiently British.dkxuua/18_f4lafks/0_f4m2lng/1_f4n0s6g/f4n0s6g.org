Ite to be fair you are right. And yh I do see alot of Starbicks and Costa but the thing is when o go in there most people get a Latte rather than an actual coffee. And it really depends how far in Surrey as there are some bits that overlap with London. And outskirts of London still use slang.

However you are right about slang in the nineties, I have no clue at all. And tbf it's not exactly common knowledge for some slang we use. However surely at that time there were a few Catholic schools, in my area growing up we had around 15.

Anyway love your fics bro, keep up the good work!
