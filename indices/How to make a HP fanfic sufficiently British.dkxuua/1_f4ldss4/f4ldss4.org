I'm going to agree with other authors who've said the best idea is to concentrate on not sounding American rather than trying to sound British.

Imagine if the situation were reversed and Harry Potter was set in America. Now imagine your horror at every character from the North East sounding like a New York cab driver, with the occasional stereotype Jew in there for good measure; every Californian being ridiculously cool and tanned, and any character from south of the Mason-Dixon greeting people with "Hip diggety-dawg! It's rootin' tootin' good to see y'all".

If you try to do British slang and regional dialogue you will get it wrong. Judging by the commenter advising you to use "bruv", I'd say a lot of Brits would get it wrong too. [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] has already pointed out that slang is more complex and structured than you would expect. Add in regional variants and class variants and you're in a minefield. I've lived in NW England for 18 years, Edinburgh (central-belt Scotland) for nine and London for... the rest, and I like to think I know English pretty well, but if I were to write a story that tried to accurately portray the speech patterns in a school based in the Highlands of Scotland, with pupils from all parts of the UK (and nearby?), from all classes and across seven years, with teachers even more diverse than that... I'd spend a lot of time researching it.

Luckily, JKR pretty much skipped the problem and everyone sounds like the sort of middle to upper middle-class kid you'd find in a typical talent agency. Funny that.
