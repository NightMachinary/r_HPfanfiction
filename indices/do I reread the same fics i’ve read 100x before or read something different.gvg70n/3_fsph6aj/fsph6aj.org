My favorite ship has like 5-10 longer fics I can appreciate, and like 5 that I truly like. Whenever I feel fic-starved, I pick one of them at random to re-read. If a long enough time has passed, I can get close enough to the first time experience.

Paradoxally I actually tend to read my favorite fics overall less because if I let more time pass, I can enjoy them even more when I do get back to them.
