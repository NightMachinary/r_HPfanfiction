I've always wondered: What if the Black family wasn't evil? In this case, the devestation of the world would have been caused by hatred. Hatred of the jews, specifically. Wizards and muggles all participated in the holocaust, in this world. As such, there really isn't an anti-muggle ideology in the Wizarding World. Only an anti-Nazi ideology. The Death Reavers are just as anti-Nazi in this timeline as the Death Eaters are anti-muggle in canon.
