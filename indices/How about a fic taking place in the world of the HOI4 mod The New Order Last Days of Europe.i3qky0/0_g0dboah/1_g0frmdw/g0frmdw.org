Yes. MACUSA is integrated with the US, and Tom Riddle leads a small group known as 'the Death Reavers' within HMMLR. Bellatrix is a young girl in 1962, and is a scout for HMMLR. Ironically, Bella is friends with Molly Weasley, another scout only a year older than her. Equally ironic, Riddle is friends with Bill Alexander, a muggle Libertarian Socialist, and leader of the 'red monarchist' faction of HMMLR.
