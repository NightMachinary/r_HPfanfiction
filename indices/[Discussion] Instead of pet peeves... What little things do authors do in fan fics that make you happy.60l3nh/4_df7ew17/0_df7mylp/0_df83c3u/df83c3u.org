I feel like the key to writing a manipulative character like Dumbledore is to allow them to stay in the background as much as possible.

Manipulative people don't run around openly forcing people to do things.

Manipulative people evaluate situations, and enact subtle pressure on the situation when and if the pressure is needed to keep things going in a favorable direction.

Dumbledore wouldn't just tell Harry what he has to do or blackmail him into doing something. He would manipulate Harry's circumstances in much more subtle ways. For example, placing him in Gryffindor where he will be influenced by his housemates, giving him access to people who will guide Harry in the direction Dumbledore thinks is favorable, or using his power at the Ministry to create a specific outcome and then telling Harry that the Ministry had made the decision.
