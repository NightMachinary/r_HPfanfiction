Bingo. I love a perfectly used [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit][Batman Gambit]] because that's what manipulative people do: they get you to /naturally/ react the way that they want to. That way it can appear as if they're not doing anything, which is what makes them that much more manipulative. If you're actually reacting the way you normally would, is the other person really manipulating you? Or are you conveniently reacting in a manner that benefits them?

That is the beauty of a manipulative character. You. Don't. Know.
