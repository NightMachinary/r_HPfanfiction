Almost exactly. As a writer you do need to show these actions being done, but you don't need to let the other characters see beyond the veil of ignorance. So show Dumbledores thinking, make references to what he's doing, etc. Why is the action he's taking manipulative? How is he controlling the dice?

It's never going to be overt, it will always be subtle. And a manipulative character shouldn't be a main focus. Just enough so you are shown their work, not just told that it happens.
