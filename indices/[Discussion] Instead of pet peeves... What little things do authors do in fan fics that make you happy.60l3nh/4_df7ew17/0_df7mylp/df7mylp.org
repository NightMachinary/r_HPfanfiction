  Making Dumbledore competent. He might be evil or good, but most stories don't have him competent.

I feel most people don't know how to successfully write a character that is manipulative. It's a lot more than setting back talking about what a great schemer you are, while cackling madly about all the orphans gold you're stealing, and then huffing candy fumes while stroking your beard to pensieve memories of Harry getting the belt by his uncle.

On the same token a competent character is more than just a Deus ex Machina. Having him consistently ride in at the end to save everybody, while at the same time passively allowing those events to happen (or worse, not even noticing) doesn't make a character competent no matter how many times the characters in the story say so.
