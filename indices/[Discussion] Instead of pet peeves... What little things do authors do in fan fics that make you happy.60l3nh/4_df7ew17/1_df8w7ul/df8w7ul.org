You just gave me a brainwave. A new plot device, explaining why Dementors are used as execution. Necromancy. It's all well and good to kill someone, but if they just walk in the next day wearing the body of a sacrificed virgin, then you will have some problems. I have seen fics touch on this, but you just made it click for me for some reason.
