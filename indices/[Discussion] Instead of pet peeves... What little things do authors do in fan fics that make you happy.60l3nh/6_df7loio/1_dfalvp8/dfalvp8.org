  Snape thinking the years Sirius spent in Azkaban as punishment enough
#+end_quote

The /Innocent/ Saga has this a little. Snape knows Sirius is innocent, and, while he doesn't do much to help him, he also doesn't rat him out or try to capture him in any way.

Then later Sirius apologizes for being a prat, himself, Snape realized he's grown up a tad, and they end up friendsly.
