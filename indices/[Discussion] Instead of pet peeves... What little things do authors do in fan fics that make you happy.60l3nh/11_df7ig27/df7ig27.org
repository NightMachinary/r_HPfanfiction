Great worldbuilding with fantastical new places, societies or whatnot. Good use of the magic system (including giving a wide berth around /magic cores/) and maybe some new spells. Snarky and witty banter between characters who are both of these things, including for example, Bellatrix, Sirius, Harry and Snape.
