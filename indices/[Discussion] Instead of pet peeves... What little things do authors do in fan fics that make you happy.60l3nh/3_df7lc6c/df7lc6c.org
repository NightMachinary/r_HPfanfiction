Things that made the canon series so magical and whimsical to me. Some of those things are:

- Letters/newspaper clippings
- Other trivial, detail-oriented minutiae, e.g. clever shop names, book titles
- Food descriptions; in fact I wish there were more food descriptions in canon (I'm talking Farmer Boy-level)
- Some description of day-to-day happenings; this is, I feel, a bit tough to get really right, since it can easily seem like the author is just writing and including things to take up space
- Minor characters that have their own small arcs

I feel a lot of the above can be lumped into "expanding on the world JKR's already given us". I like that world. When people explore more of it, it's grand.
