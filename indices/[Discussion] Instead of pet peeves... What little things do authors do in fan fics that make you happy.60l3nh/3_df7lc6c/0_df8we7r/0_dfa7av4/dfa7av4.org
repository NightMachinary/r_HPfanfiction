There is wiki-sites so someone could set it up. Probably would have to have several different 'definitions' for each thing because people will change it. If you look up Severus Snape there will be like 'Loyal to the order because Voldemort killed Lily', 'Loyal to Dumbledore only because he wants Vengeance', 'More Loyal to either side that is winning at the certain time', 'loyal to Voldemort, and only wanted Lily as a possession' etc. They'd have to more detailed than that considering there is different representations for character.
