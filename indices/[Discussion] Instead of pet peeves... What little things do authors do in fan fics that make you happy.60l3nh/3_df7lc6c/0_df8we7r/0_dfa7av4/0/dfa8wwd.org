I suppose, but really it would be more intended for non-plot relevant things. Actually get a list of shops with a map of diagon alley. Nobody is going to need to change that unless they have a plot specific shop. Whereas things revolving around say Snape's loyalty are suspect. Perhaps have it in the style of the HP wikis, but everything fanon must fit seemlessly into canon. And mark which is which, so authers know which can be changed accordingly to comply with the fanon. So like, the magical government of New Zealand. Never going to be important, but if we have a Harry travels the world fic, having an established Ministry for New Zealand, as well as a minister and political issues could help prop up some plot points. A lot of authers rely on canon as a way to prop up their stories, sticking to canon names, dates and everything else. This would just be good, because it adds more reference points for writers to follow.
