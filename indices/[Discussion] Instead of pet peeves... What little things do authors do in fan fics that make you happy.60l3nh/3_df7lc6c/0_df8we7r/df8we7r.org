I wonder if there is like a fanon website, where fanfic writers just write a common fanon for everyone to use. Like make a wiki page about the sweets of the Wizarding World, and then have discussions on what to add. Then in the story description, you can say that it is compliant with the extended fanon, so if you name drop "Twinkling Sugar Crystals", you don't have to spend a paragraph explaining how it make your skin luminescent, and it tastes like Raspberry's.
