Ahhh!

I agree with so much of your "Magic" points. I'm currently working on a fic with moderately deep magical theory and it's incredibly exciting for several reasons

- world building
- cool details
- and perhaps most importantly, /setting limits on what characters can do/ but also /offering opportunities/loopholes that characters can use/

#+begin_quote
  Any mention of needing to understand a spell to be able to cast it properly.
#+end_quote

Absolutely $100% agree. It literally makes no sense if a character can be like "whoa, that's a cool dragon-destroying spell right there, how did you do it?" - "Oh, the incantation is /Draco Destroyerius/." - "Okay, /Draco Destroyerius/, wow it worked, thanks!"

In my theory of the HP universe, you /have/ to understand what a spell is and means before you can cast it. In my mind, knowing the incantation is next to useless--the only reason you need an incantation is to be able to strongly focus on exactly the spell you need. That's why nonverbal magic is so hard: have you ever tried talking/reading/praying/etc in your head? It's nearly impossible to do it in a way that doesn't have hundreds of images, sensations, and words leaping in and out of your mind's eye/consciousness. (This next sentence is true real life, not just my view of magic universe) That's why so many people recommend saying things /out loud/ as a way to organize your thoughts, figure out what you're thinking, and help solve problems.

#+begin_quote
  Any explicit denial of exhaustible magic.
#+end_quote

What do you mean here? Do you mean that there should be no such thing as a spell that you can only cast once or twice before you're tired/before you run out of... magicn-aether around you?

#+begin_quote
  Presentation of spells as related nodes in a theoretical structure rather than discrete and static objects.
#+end_quote

Absolutely. Spells are just a small aspect of magic; there is so much more.

#+begin_quote
  The presentation of magical theory as completely incompatible with the body of knowledge known as "science". E.g. a magical theory of matter which directly contradicts atomic theory.
#+end_quote

So you're saying you like it when magic is presented as incompatible with muggle science theory? Why so? To be fair, I don't know if I recall ever seeing an explanation of magic that was /consistent/ with muggle science.

#+begin_quote
  Complex magical theory which does not devolve into a science analogue e.g. that avoids the use of formulas that are reminiscent of the formulas of physics, only with magical units instead of physical ones. The best kind of magical theory is that which draws on philosophy, theology, alchemy, law, numerology, astrology, etc. Essentially a constructed narrative about some aspect of the world or human experience.
#+end_quote

Great point. I especially agree with theology and alchemy (simply because that's stuff I'm working on in some fics). I've only seen a couple fics even /touch/ on alchemy, which is insane, since Dumbledore worked under Flamel who was a famous alchemist! I'd love to see more alchemy. I just read a fic recently (hmm, was it Patron? I don't recall) where it described Albus as a master alchemist, and in one of his duels he did all sorts of cool alchemy spells.

#+begin_quote
  Pluralistic magical theory. That is, there not being a single, comprehensive and unified theory of magic but rather a large number of competing magical philosophies, which have different merits and may be suited to different areas of magic. Further, it's not the case that a single unified theory is possible and it simply hasn't been arrived at yet, but rather that there is no single "magical truth". Instead, many different narratives can be told about magic, all of which have validity (though this does not exclude the possibility of a magical theory being completely wrong, it just means that there are more than one which are right).
#+end_quote

I can go both ways here. If a singular, magical truth exists; a magical truth/theory out of which all "types" of magic are derived, then I can buy it. It's really hard to write a fic with that correctly, however.

#+begin_quote
  Single-word incantations.
#+end_quote

+1.

I read a fic awhile ago where there was a moderate focus on single-word incantations, because they're so much faster than other spells with multiple syllables/words. I vaguely recall a scene where Harry duels Snape using single-syllable blasting hexes. Anyway, what a great fic.

#+begin_quote
  Complexity of magical theory being alluded to by reference and by illustrative examples but not explicitly detailed. The problem is that it is impossible for any author to come up with a convincing magical theory i.e. one that is suitably complex that it bears the appearance of a deep field of study which has been developed over thousands of years by countless different thinkers. Any author-described magical theory will feel far too simplistic. As such it's better to allude to there being this body of theory out there, and to illustrate it with small slices of bits of theories, but to never attempt to go into any comprehensive description of any given theory or magic generally.
#+end_quote

This is a great point.

As for some of your other points:

#+begin_quote
  Goal-oriented duels where the opposing characters are moving through the environment towards some objective, simultaneously duelling to prevent the other achieving it. These duels tend to be far more dynamic.
#+end_quote

I've never thought about this! I could see this being very exciting to read.

#+begin_quote
  Politics being more than the possession of titles. Far too many fics give Harry de jure legal authority in the form of titles and that is the end of it. There's no struggle for de facto power because magic itself enforces the authority of those titles. This is boring and arguably not really even a political storyline. Politics is about having to make deals, compromises, about winning influential people over etc. I'm okay with Harry having a title, but I prefer the title to be largely defunct.
#+end_quote

In theory I agree with you; however, I do enjoy the occasional guilty-pleasure indy!Harry where he steamrolls everyone politically. Anyway, I do like some political wrestling in fics. For example, minor things like

- so-and-so person who appears to be (or is) evil has diplomatic immunity so legally no one is allowed to touch him
- manouvering through certain laws (e.g. in a trial or arrest) using certain loopholes/by-laws
- aren't technically allowed to fight duels on foreign soil, or can be arrested for it

and so on.

#+begin_quote
  Small wizarding population (under 15,000).
#+end_quote

I actually disagree with this one. I really like it when the story plays with the global context of the magical world. Magicians, sorcerers, wizards, etc. all over the world with differing types of magic. Usually meaning that the wizarding population is in the millions.

#+begin_quote
  Strategic Voldemort.
#+end_quote

Definitely this one. I've seen too many dumb, blood-thirsty Voldemorts. "What? Harry Potter and the Order are attacking the gates of my fortress? WAHHHHH I'm mad, go, send a few dementors!" - "What, the dementors have been repelled? Send death eaters" - "More death eaters" - "Oh no, they're here now!"
