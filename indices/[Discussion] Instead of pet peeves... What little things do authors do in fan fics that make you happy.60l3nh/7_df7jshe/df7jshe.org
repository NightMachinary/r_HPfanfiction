Pet delights:

Magic

- Any mention of needing to understand a spell to be able to cast it properly.

- Any explicit denial of exhaustible magic.

- Presentation of spells as related nodes in a theoretical structure rather than discrete and static objects.

- The presentation of magical theory as completely incompatible with the body of knowledge known as "science". E.g. a magical theory of matter which directly contradicts atomic theory.

- Complex magical theory which does not devolve into a science analogue e.g. that avoids the use of formulas that are reminiscent of the formulas of physics, only with magical units instead of physical ones. The best kind of magical theory is that which draws on philosophy, theology, alchemy, law, numerology, astrology, etc. Essentially a constructed narrative about some aspect of the world or human experience.

- Pluralistic magical theory. That is, there not being a single, comprehensive and unified theory of magic but rather a large number of competing magical philosophies, which have different merits and may be suited to different areas of magic. Further, it's not the case that a single unified theory is possible and it simply hasn't been arrived at yet, but rather that there is no single "magical truth". Instead, many different narratives can be told about magic, all of which have validity (though this does not exclude the possibility of a magical theory being completely wrong, it just means that there are more than one which are right).

- Single-word incantations.

- Complexity of magical theory being alluded to by reference and by illustrative examples but not explicitly detailed. The problem is that it is impossible for any author to come up with a convincing magical theory i.e. one that is suitably complex that it bears the appearance of a deep field of study which has been developed over thousands of years by countless different thinkers. Any author-described magical theory will feel far too simplistic. As such it's better to allude to there being this body of theory out there, and to illustrate it with small slices of bits of theories, but to never attempt to go into any comprehensive description of any given theory or magic generally.

Story

- The tying in of plot, character arc, and magical theory. E.g. a character has been struggling with a personal issue, the resolution of this personal issue leads them to better understand a concept which in turn means they now understand a piece of magic which had previously been eluding them. Being able to finally cast that piece of magic allows the plot to be resolved. Non-HP example: Kaladin in The Stormlight Archive.

- Goal-oriented duels where the opposing characters are moving through the environment towards some objective, simultaneously duelling to prevent the other achieving it. These duels tend to be far more dynamic.

World

- Politics being more than the possession of titles. Far too many fics give Harry de jure legal authority in the form of titles and that is the end of it. There's no struggle for de facto power because magic itself enforces the authority of those titles. This is boring and arguably not really even a political storyline. Politics is about having to make deals, compromises, about winning influential people over etc. I'm okay with Harry having a title, but I prefer the title to be largely defunct.

- Presentation of the wizarding world as changing over time, not static.

- Small wizarding population (under 15,000).

Character

- Strategic Voldemort.

- Villains in general who adapt and change their plans based on developing circumstances.
