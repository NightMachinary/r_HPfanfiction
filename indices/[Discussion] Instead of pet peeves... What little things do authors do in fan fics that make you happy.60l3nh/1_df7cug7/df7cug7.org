I like witty banter and good snark.

But on a more serious note, truly original ideas about the magical world and beautiful writing.

In /Rough Magic/, birdsofshore has Harry and Luna go to The Whispering Library, where the dusty old tomes whisper to the patrons, begging to be read. Gorgeous and totally original, at least to me. linkao3(2678267)

There are so many Harry Potter fics out there that it is a delight to find a story where either the imagery or the emotional impact sets it apart from the crowd.
