Line breaks, you can't tell a real epic story if every chapter is a 5 minute block in the life.

Twisting Canon and Fanon slightly, instead of wandless Harry we see Harry using another focus like rings or gauntlets or staffs. Or Harry doing his shopping spree, but instead of just going to Flourish and Blots he goes to Second Hand storys buying up hand written grimoires and other "pieces of junk" sold by families of "insane spell creators".
