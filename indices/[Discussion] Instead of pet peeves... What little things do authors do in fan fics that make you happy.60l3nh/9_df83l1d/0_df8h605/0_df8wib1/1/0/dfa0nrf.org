He can't be that tall, or at least doesn't think of himself as such. From DH, at the wedding:

#+begin_quote
  a vivid picture formed in Harry's mind of Ginny in a white dress, marrying a tall, faceless and unpleasant stranger
#+end_quote

(I assume a tall person would not jealously imagine their crush marrying someone also tall. Or at least, they'd specify someone /taller/.)

And later:

#+begin_quote
  "We don't know who he is," Hermione said, passing Harry several curly, black hairs, "but he's gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, *he's pretty tall, you'll need bigger robes...*"

  She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them, and Harry retired to take the Potion and change.

  Once the painful transformation was complete, he was *more than six feet tall*
#+end_quote

So Harry's shorter than six feet in September '97. Personally, I tend to think he's an average 5'9", but I've no issue in fanfic with anything between about 5'5" - 6'0".
