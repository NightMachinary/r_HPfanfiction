Where Harry is his canon appearance - small, unassuming, not 'sexy' or intimidating, and that's OK. So many fics make him into some kind of 7ft muscle machine, who strikes fear into his enemies with a single glance of his 'Killing curse green eyes'. He doesn't need to be impressive looking to be awesome.
