As a slight modification of this, when his cannon appearance is enough to be intimidating. I like the way he is in cannon- average, maybe a bit scrawny, average looking, but I also enjoy when there is just something about him that is intimidating. Just the force of his brave/angry/single minded personality is enough that people take a step back when he's pissed.

Plus, I always liked that his eyes and the killing curse were the same/similar color. Dunno if Jo did that on purpose but there's some deeper level of meaning there I find interesting.
