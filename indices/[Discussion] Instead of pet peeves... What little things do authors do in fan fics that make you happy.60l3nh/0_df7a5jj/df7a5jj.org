When the writer gives a minor character a moment of awesome, while still keeping them in character. Tougher than it sounds, and really rare when you're talking about the bad guys. Most fanfiction writers don't want to give the enemy any moments of delight, but really, everyone just wants to look good, get a babe and enjoy their perks.

A well-written Luna is a thing of joy to behold.
