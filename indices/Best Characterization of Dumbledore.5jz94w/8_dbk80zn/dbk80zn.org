「"Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux" by the Imaginizer.」

「In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest place...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again. 」

Towards the end, there's a chapter solely in Albus Dumbledore's perspective and gives the readers a better idea of what's going on in his head throughout the story. It was refreshing to see this kind of Dumbledore since I've never really come across a fanfiction that tried to explain his actions through his thinking. This story doesn't revolve around Dumbledore, but I thought it was an interesting read.
