linkffn(A Long Journey Home)

A Long Journey Home doesn't focus on Dumbledore, but there is one fairly long chapter from his perspective that I've always thought to be excellent.

I know fem!harry isn't everyones cup of tea, but if you're up for it it's one of the best stories, if not the best, I've read in the fandom.
