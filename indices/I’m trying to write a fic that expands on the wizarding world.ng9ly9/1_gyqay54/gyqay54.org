The statute of secrecy has existed in Europe since the 1690s, which means since at least then, the muggle and wizarding worlds were separate. IMO in order for the statute to be enforceable, they mush have been at least mostly separated for a generation or more prior.

While some events, like the world wars probably did get noticed across the divide, JKR presents it as the two worlds having mostly nothing to do with each other. Therefore, the political and cultural landscape will be completely different to ours. With the exception of very major natural barriers like the sea, there is little reason for countries and borders to match up.

Magical colonialism just doesn't make sense for me. Magical Europeans just don't have the numbers, comparative advantage or the population pressures to mass emigrate and colonise other parts of the world. This could mean that the magical cultures of, for example China or Central America, could have mostly resisted the cultural shifts that the mundane populations have experienced over the last few hundred years, or perhaps they had different ones of their own. This could mean that it is even harder for muggleborns to fit in than it is in Britain. Just be careful to do enough research that you don't just make offensive stereotypes.
