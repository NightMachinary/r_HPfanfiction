My main-gripe with non-British authors is when they take the brit-picking too far. Not everyone says 'cuppa', and it certainly doesn't belong in a 3rd person narrative outside of direct quotes, imo. I was living in England for quite some time without hearing anyone say 'cuppa' even once. (I was, however, confused by people saying 'tea' about dinner, which honestly still confounds me...)
