I generally don't mind fanfic where it's in dialogue, but there should be differentiation between characters. It's almost as if people don't recognize the plethora of dialects, sociolects, etc. that Britain holds.

I lived in the North where everyone seemed pretty agreed on tea for dinner, love as a nickname for just about anyone, and nobody seemed to say cuppa (they just said "would you like some tea", meaning I was never sure if they were offering me food or beverage).

And yes, the extreme Irishness of Seamus, as well as the extreme Scottishness of McGonnagall is so exaggerated at times that I just stop reading, or skip their dialogue.
