It might be more lovecraftian than gothic- I could imagine a novel about some unspeakable doing research on the veil of death calling up something that he couldn't put down.

On the other hand, I could see Dracula being more of a comedy of errors from the magical perspective- this vampire just wants to immigrate to Britain and “raise” a family of his own, but his lack of familiarity with the statute of secrecy ends up getting him killed by a superstitious muggle, of all people!
