My headcanon is that from the Watsonian perspective, Tolkien was a squib from a more liberal branch of the Lestrange family (they exiled him with a falsified backstory instead of killing him). Here's my evidence:

Lestrange means “the strange” or “the mad” in medieval French, while Tolkien was thought to mean “foolishly clever” in medieval German. (Modern linguists dispute this claim, but Tolkien himself used it as a pun by having Gandalf say “fool of a took”.) The meanings are quite similar to each other, which shows an interesting connection.

I also saw a Lestrange house crest that was composed of the letters in “Lestrange” in the same way that Tolkien's personal seal is composed of his initials. (I don't think the Lestrange crest I saw was the official version, but it's what gave me the headcanon in the first place.)

Combine all of this with, among other things, the whole resemblance between Acromantulas and the giant spiders in Tolkien's legendarium, and it would make sense for Tolkien to be an exile from the wizarding world.

IRL, this is all just a coincidence, and Tolkien's stuff came way before Rowling's. It still makes a good headcanon.

TLDR: I imagine that witches and wizards would be familiar with Tolkien's books because he'd be a Lestrange squib.
