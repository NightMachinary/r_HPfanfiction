I honestly think the lack of presence of fictional books has more to do with JKR not investing time towards that particular avenue as it didn't really push the plot forward.

I personally like to think there would be a whole world's worth of fiction and other things related to lifestyle, not just in terms of books but entertainment as well and they would all experience fads and trends.

Witches and Wizards would have to do something for their entertainment and I doubt, contrary to popular belief in the fanfic community, that all they do is devote their time to dancing, duelling, flying, studying to become super powerful edge lords etc.

Fiction and stories have been around for a very long time, gathering a good bit of steam by the time the Victorian Era came around. So yeah, I think fiction would exist.

Also a lot of fiction reflects the norms and problems of society of the day it was written in. Take a Christmas Carol, or even the Harry Potter series. They reflect problems of the day in which they were written, but take adopt a different approach.

I feel if you go along those lines of thinking, you'll find that trends and fads would exist as well.

JKR covered all she could without deviating from the plot too much. Unlike Fanfic authors, she didn't have the luxury of a pre-existing and set world, so the extent to which she could develop the world is limited.

Personally I'd consider this an opportunity to expand the HP verse along my own lines of imagination rather than limit myself to what has been set in stone.
