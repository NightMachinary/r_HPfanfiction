I think it's likely they have fiction in the Wizarding World, I just don't think Harry was all that interested in it so we never hear about it in the books.

I'm actually having a lot of fun writing about a series I call Horath Bogtrotter, which is the tale of an auror hunting a dark wizard. In my series I have a Horath Bogtrotter book come out every Christmas, which gives my protagonist the opportunity to read and comment on it.
