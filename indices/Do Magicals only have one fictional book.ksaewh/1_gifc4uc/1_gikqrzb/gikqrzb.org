I know - I did say that I wasn't counting it, since it was a comic and not a novel. :)

My point was more about the lack of fiction novels for adults. Like, we never see Molly scrambling to put away a Harlequin Romance Novel, and no teacher's bookshelf is ever mentioned as having fiction stuff written for adults (or even young adults) on it - there's no Flitwick or McG reading whatever the Brandon Sanderson or Terry Pratchett or even Twilight/Hunger Games equivalent is in the Magical World. We even have our main character bookworm, but she never seems to sit down with an actual novel, not even offhandedly mentioned as putting one down when Harry storms in due to that years drama.

Fiction exists and is mentioned, sure, but in small numbers and only really for younger people (I forgot to mention Babbity Rabbity). That I acknowledge. But there's no classic literature, or genre fiction, or whatever else mentioned even once that I can find.
