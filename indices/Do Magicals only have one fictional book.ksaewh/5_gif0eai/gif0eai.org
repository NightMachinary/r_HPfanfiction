Mechanically, it's like because fiction stories have little relevance to the plot.

In situ, I find it difficult to decide what kind of fiction there actually is, because they live in a magical world, so that means fantasy/ sci fi would not be as relevant an option. I suppose there might crime stories, Historical fiction and things, but i think the folk stories would have more prevalence. Beedle occupies the sort of ‘Grimm's Fairy Tales' niche but there might be prosaic retellings of the Táin Bó Cuailnge, but the Tuatha Dè Danann are powerful wizards. The Iliad, Aeneid and the Odyssey seem ripe for the plundering, same with the stories of Arthur and his Knights. The problem is these wouldn't necessarily be seen as ‘fictional' more Legendary accounts of history.

I reckon their might be more an emphasis placed on Poetic traditions, as the recounting of Stories through prose was a ‘relatively' new thing at the time of the Statute of Secrecy. Think 1500s ish Don quixote.

There is probably a niche market for muggle stuff. Though given the propensity for Muggleborns and half-bloods to forget about muggles, and the nature of magic and secrecy I don't know.
