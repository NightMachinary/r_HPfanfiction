Almost the whole series is filtered through Harry's POV. Harry doesn't show any interest in fiction, or have time to read it, so there wasn't much opportunity for Rowling to show us fiction in her world.

In one of my fics, werewolf erotica is a popular genre. I figure that a group of people that's oppressed and shunned might also be fetishized. Humans who know nothing about real werewolves profit off stories about how excitingly dangerous they are.
