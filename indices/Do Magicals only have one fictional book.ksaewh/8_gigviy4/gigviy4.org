I think that there's just about as big a market for fiction in the Wizarding World as there is in the Non-Magical one, just possibly with different genres being more popular between the worlds, and possibly a few Wizarding-exclusive ones replacing those that wouldn't have any real place there (I can't really see Sci-Fi or Fantasy taking root in the Wizarding World, for instance).
