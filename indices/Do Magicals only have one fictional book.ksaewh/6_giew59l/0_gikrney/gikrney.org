I mean, sure, but we literally have an obsessive bookworm as a deuteragonist, and she's not mentioned as reading a novel even once, even offhandedly. Like, I could totally see her putting down her novel when Harry storms in after some drama goes down. Even Flourish and Blotts seems to lack a fiction section altogether.

That's what brought the question about. Sure, them not being plot relevant is probably the answer, but there's not even a trace of them existing and I'm curious what people think about that. Does it mean anything, is it just Rowling, etc.
