Harry is a true heir in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]], which is my favorite Slytherin!Harry fic and one of the only 'wrong boy who lived' fics that I've enjoyed reading. (First book in the series is "Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes".) linkao3(12608820)

Harry is also a descendant of Slytherin in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]], which is a fun read even though it dips into some OP!Harry, indy!Harry and manipulative!Dumbledore tropes. linkffn(6254783)
