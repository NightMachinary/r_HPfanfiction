July of last year.

The author was reliably updating the fic at a fast pace (at least one chapter per month) until last year when they mentioned that their free time had decreased due to college, family and other life commitments. 649k+ words over the course of three years is amazingly prolific for a fanfic author, so I have high hopes that they will return once life evens out for them.
