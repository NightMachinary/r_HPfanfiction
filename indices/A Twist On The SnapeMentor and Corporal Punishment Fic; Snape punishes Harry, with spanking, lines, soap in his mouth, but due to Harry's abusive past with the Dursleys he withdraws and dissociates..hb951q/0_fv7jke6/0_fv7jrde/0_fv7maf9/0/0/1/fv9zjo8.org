I once talked to a social worker, and where he lived they had actually codified acceptable corporal punishment into law: it had to be with the bare hand, on the buttocks, and as I recall limited the number of strikes allowed. As Snape says in the cited stories, it's intended to get the child's attention, not to injure them.

As somebody who was told at 16 I was not too old to spank (although I wasn't on that occasion), all I can say is that the threat of spanking worked for me as a deterrent. It doesn't work for all children.
