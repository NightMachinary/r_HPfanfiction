Well, I will also say that my mother was one who slapped in the face. I do NOT condone that method of so-called discipline. It is simply demeaning and nothing more than an attack. So it's not just that I was spanked that makes me feel that spanking is acceptable: it's that, as an adult, I can look back and acknowledge that it was an effective deterrent FOR ME.
