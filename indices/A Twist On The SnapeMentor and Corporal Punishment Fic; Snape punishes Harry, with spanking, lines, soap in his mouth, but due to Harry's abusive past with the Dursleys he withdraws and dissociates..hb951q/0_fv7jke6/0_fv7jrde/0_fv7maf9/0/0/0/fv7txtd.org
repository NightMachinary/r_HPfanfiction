I just think it'd be ineffective. Young children learn more, usually, from actions, from role-models, than just from words. I feel like spanking a child is like saying "you can solve this issue with violence", and might lead to aggression, or other behavioural issues. There's a saying I hear sometimes that "Kids who hit, get hit", and it's not always true, but a lot of the time, it will be. Idk, that's just my view on it, I don't find it an effective form of punishment, at least if you want to teach lasting lessons.
