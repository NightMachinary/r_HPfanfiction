Yeah. I'm just not the same. I don't have any children myself, so I don't really have much experience beyond my own childhood, but I feel like spanking is acceptable, so long as the chastised child is able to sit comfortably after a couple minutes, but anything beyond that is unacceptable.

I've more than once wanted to punch an adult in the face for slapping a child across the face. People bringing belts or canes into it are right out.
