There's two I have to link.

The one shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4307359/1/Harry-s-First-Detention][/Harry's First Detention/]] and followed up by a much longer sequel fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4437151/1/Harry-s-New-Home][/Harry's New Home/]].

Mind you, a more painful experience than a spanking is part of the one shot, but it's unjustified, and the character who inflicted it acknowledges they were wrong.

After that point, Snape is basically forces to see Harry for the abused little boy he is, rather than the spoiled brat he perceived him to be.

By the way, this fic is /not/ for those that take corporal punishment as 100% wrong all the time. Snape does use corporal punishment(namely spanking) to reinforce the boundaries he sets for Harry. Due to my own personal history, I don't view this as a big issue, but some might disagree.
