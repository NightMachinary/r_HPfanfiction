The [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/death_eaters.html#profiles][HP Lexicon]] lists about 30 known Death Eaters. Like you, that is about the amount of Death Eaters that I always imagined, but I think that they could be interpreted to be something akin to his lieutenants with many other lowly foot soldiers. These lower supporters would probably help in battles, but not be trusted with important information or missions.
