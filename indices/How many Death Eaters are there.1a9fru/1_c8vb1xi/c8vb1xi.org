I don't think JK specified exact numbers, but in the final film there seem to be about 200-250 snatchers/low level DEs in the bridge scene with Neville, and about 40 people behind Voldemort when he brings Harry's (assumed) dead body. Assuming those were actual Death Eaters and assuming about 40% losses in the previous battle, that puts a conservative estimate at about 50 high ranking death eaters and about 250 low level mooks/snatchers.
