I would say around 30/50 Death Eaters. 30 we know of by name and 20 who are unamed. I assume there are ranks within the Death Eaters, hence why Snape is, pretty much, Voldemort's right hand man. Many Death Eaters may not have been summoned to Voldemort's rebirthing party, others may not have joined up until after he returned. Then we got to think that some of Voldemort's followers aren't Death Eaters at all and are just plain followers that Voldemort feels he can afford to lose. Thats not to mention all the people he tricked and curesed into following his orders, as well as all the magical creatures he has on his side.
