Story time: when I was in college, my school's Harry Potter club had unofficial sub-clubs for the Death Eaters and Order. Neither sub-club really did anything beyond an initiation ritual and an extra meeting tlwhere we just hung out every week. I, being an edgy 18-year-old, joined the Death Eaters. At the first meeting I went to, a masked and hooded girl calling herself Alecto asked if I wanted to be her brother. I agreed because why not?

3 years later we were married.
