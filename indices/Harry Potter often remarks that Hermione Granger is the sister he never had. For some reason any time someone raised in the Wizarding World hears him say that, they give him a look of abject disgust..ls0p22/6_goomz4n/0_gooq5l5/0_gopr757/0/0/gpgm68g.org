At least one of the types of polydactyly is dominant rather than recessive, so you don't really get more of it from inbreeding. It just shows up in small populations because of the founder effect. And extra normal toes don't look *that* weird. I certainly wouldn't be horrified to find out a small, somewhat isolated population thought extra toes were attractive.
