I mean, it would be respectable if a Black married a Potter, which did happen, and I don't think Dorea was ever burnt off the tapestry, while Cedrella was for marrying a Weasley, and they ARE in the Sacred 28.

(Unless HP wiki is not to be believed, though I've found them to be generally accurate for most of the lineage stuff, regardless that they seem to heavily favour the movies)

Also, it's pretty much confirmed with the cloak that the Potters are an old line that the Peverall family branched into. These are just notes taken from actual canon and Pottermore, more so than fanon too, and not to mention the gold in Harry's vault (though that could be from Sleakeazy royalties).
