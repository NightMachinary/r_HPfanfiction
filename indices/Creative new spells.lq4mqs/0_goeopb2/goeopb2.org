In Harry is a Dragon, and That's Okay, they were trying to invent a spell to duplicate books, accidentally creating a translation spell Xenographia until they managed to get the plain duplicating spell, Xerographia. You'd think the Xenographia is far more versatile, except they often got the result in extinct, incomprehensible languages.

Same goes with Tempus, while most fics treat it just like a regular clock, here the concept of our time keeping is being questioned, so it might give a completely useless result like "now", or based on different timezone, even planet.
