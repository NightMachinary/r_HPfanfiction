Lily is a muggleborn, and thus armed with the very rare trait in the Wizarding World called "common sense". There is a trivial solution to take the target off your back -- just force an early birth. I wouldn't put it past her to convince (Confoundus, perhaps) a Muggle hospital to do a C-section a week early or so.

But I guess that doesn't make for nearly as interesting a story!
