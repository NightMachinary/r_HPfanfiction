There was a fun request I recall which was for Lily to take a gender-forcing potion (on the theory she heard the prophecy early enough to do so), thus getting out of the prophecy. I thought it was a fascinating idea, as you can play around with concepts puke 'fate doesn't like to be avoided' and 'is prophecy about specific language or intent'.

I am not sure what the value of simply making a duck by fem-harry is. Seems like it would be virtually identical to the standard WBWL formula (variant where Nevill gets attacked).
