...Welp, that gives me yet another silly idea.\\
When Harry and Neville are born to the Potters and Longbottoms, knowing the prophecy, and the 'Dark Lord will mark /him/' bit, conspire to conceal the newborn childrens' genders. Hence, Harriet & Nevina.

And because this is diving into crack fic territory, Voldemort can't fall for it yet since he doesn't know the relevant line of the prophecy, so everyone has to figure out how to leak it to the Dark Lord without him getting suspicious.\\
Alternatively, he did learn of the whole prophecy, courtesy of a sneakier Severus Snape, and when the two likeliest candidates 'produce' girls instead of boys, he gets paranoid and goes on a world trip to find the suspect baby.
