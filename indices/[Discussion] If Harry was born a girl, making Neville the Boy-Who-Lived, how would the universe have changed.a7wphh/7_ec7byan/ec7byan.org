No matter what else happens, such a plot is likely to give very different outcomes for Peter and Severus -- to the Order's disadvantage.

Let's say that Voldemort is afraid of Neville. He targets the Longbottoms. There isn't a Severus "equivalent" to beg for Alice (or Frank, I guess) to be saved. So Voldemort hunts down the Longbottoms and kills the entire family -- Neville never becomes the BWL. Now, they're gone. Voldemort is happy.

The Order now has no spy (Severus turned for Lily's protection -- he cared little for the Longbottoms). Peter is still not outed (or in hiding). The Order is much worse off, and the war is still at large.

Dumbledore might at some point be able to wrangle a spy into the Death Eaters -- perhaps even Severus, if Dumbledore figures out his reluctance in harming Lily and runs with it (or maybe he sees his patronus? I have no idea, to be honest), given how big he seems to be on the power of love to solve all the problems in the world, and second chances -- but likely he'll have to start from scratch.

Either way, the Wizarding World at large is much worse off.

Even if Neville does become the BWL (say, Voldemort offers the Longbottoms to join him on the spot, they refuse, and Alice manages to induce sacrificial love protection on Neville), the Order is worse off, with Peter still at large and Severus not being a spy... unless he turns as a result of being desperate to magic up a potion to reverse Cruciatus-fried Potters, by somehow avoiding Azkaban? Actually this is a plot I kinda want to explore, a SS-centric fic that reverses the Potter and Longbottom situation, where he does everything in his power to reverse the damage to Lily (and, begrudgingly, James), and following his endeavours over months/years.
