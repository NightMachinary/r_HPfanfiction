Neville or Harry could have been the chosen one. Voldemort basically chose his own opponent by marking one of them.

If Harry was born as a girl and the prophecy did not change then the prophecy now states a gender and thus one 1 child now meets the requirements. However Voldemort wouldn't have heard the part that says it's a boy so would have still killed the Potters but girl-harry wouldn't have the benefit of prophecy backing her up. It might just end with all the potters dead.
