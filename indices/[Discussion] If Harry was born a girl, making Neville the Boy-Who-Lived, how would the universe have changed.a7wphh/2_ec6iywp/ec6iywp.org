There's one issue with the question asked OP. While the prophecy does state the gender of the Chosen One quite explicitly, none of the lines which Voldemort knows state the gender of the child. Since Voldemort picked Harry over Neville due to him subconsciously picking the half blood like himself, it is quite likely that none of the aforementioned events would change. The only person aware of this would be Dumbledore and since, according to canon, he only believes in the effect of Voldemort believing in the prophecy, it is unlikely to change much of his plans either.
