Why would Neville ever become "The Boy Who Lived?" Harry only lived because Lily was given the chance to live by Lord Voldemort, in good faith, and denied it, creating the sacrificial protection. And that chance to live was only created by Snape begging Voldemort spare her. Which follower of Voldemort would beg for Alice or Frank Longbottom's life? Why would Lord Voldemort offer to spare him/her?

Basically, if LV chose to assault the Longbottoms as canon stands, everyone in that house dies that night. Prophecy, no prophecy, female Harry, transgendered Neville, Turian Harry, ... dead.

This is my problem with every Neville!BWL fic.
