Very true, things would probably have been different if Voldemort had begun targetting the Longbottoms personally. For one thing, they too could have chosen the Fidelius. Which would lead to a whole different situation, as I doubt they would have also chosen a death eater as the secret keeper, which would likely lead to a prolonged first war.

This would make a good story now that I think about it, a whole balance of terror where V dedicates all of his focus in discovering the Longbottoms' location while the order scrambles to figure out wtf to do.
