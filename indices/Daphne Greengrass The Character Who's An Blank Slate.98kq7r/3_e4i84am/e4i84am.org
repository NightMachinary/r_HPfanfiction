I'm not a fan of "ice queen" Daphne, mainly because I think that characterisation does not fit with children well. Perhaps it could be a good characterisation for an adult Daphne, but I don't like the trope of super political teenagers or Slytherin house being some kind of cult.

The stance I take is that Slytherins are just normal children like the rest of Hogwarts, and behave as such. Of course, the social elite are well represented in the house, and so many will have had a privileged upbringing, and will display certain unconscious biases, but there should be (at least in the first few years of Hogwarts) something quite innocent about it.

With this in mind, "ice Queen Slytherin girl" (whether Daphne or someone else) doesn't quite fit with my vision for Slytherin house, in so far as it refers to someone who constantly comports themselves according to correct etiquette, who conceals their feelings, behaves very formally, and has their entire life and behaviour oriented around some political stance.

Another thing I dislike about it is that it presents "correct pureblood behaviour" as quite one dimensional, with the "ice queen" being the extreme end of a linear scale - "maximum pureblood". Not only is this uncanonical (in canon, "pureblood" does not equate to "social elite") I think this displays a lack of familiarity with real life upper class people.

In Victoria Potter, which features the Slytherin girls heavily (being a fem!Harry in Slytherin), I am attempting to use Pansy and Daphne as a kind of case study in how there can be multiple dimensions within "correct upper class behaviour".

Pansy represents the "metropolitan upper class". She's into fashion and carefully selects her outfits. She's not especially bright but she values academic performance and works hard because it's expected by her parents. She likes things neat and ordered and done according to rules, everything in its correct place (with her, naturally, at the top). She prefers controlled environments and dislikes the mess of the outdoors. She's aware of her privilege and enjoys it.

Daphne, meanwhile, represents the "rural upper class". She dresses well, but with a certain informal effortlessness rather than careful coordination. Practical, outdoor pursuits are valued as highly as academic success, and she enjoys adventures through bogs and forests. She has a happy-go-lucky approach to life and enjoys spontaneity. She considers herself "normal" and is unappreciative of the gilded life she leads.

(Note that I use the terms "urban/rural" as useful labels for their characteristics, not literal descriptions. In the literal sense, they're both rural upper class, in that they both live with a large amount of land, outside of urban areas.)

Each of these girls is based on girls I went to school with: on the one hand, the "fashion show" types who were big into music and drama, who tended to be the children of upper-middle class parents like lawyers and doctors; on the other hand, the "horse girl" types, more into sports and parties, who tended to be the children of genuine upper-class people (i.e. farmers).
