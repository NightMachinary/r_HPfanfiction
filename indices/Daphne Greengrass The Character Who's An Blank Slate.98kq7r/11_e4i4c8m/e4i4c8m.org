I don't mind the Ice queen stuff as long as its just a mask.

my favourite use of Daphne in fics is as the Stoic Woobie.

A Daphne who in first year thought she had it all figured out, that had all sorts of plans about how she was going to be some political mastermind who though she was going to rule Slytherin house.

Only to be Crushed under the heel of the other Slytherin students, after being crushed she then after Joins Pansy Parkinson gangs for protection and then over the years she becomes the Stoic Woobie/ Ice Queen that most Fics portray her as.

Maybe add on some extra Tragedy to her story by having her have to make sacrifices to Protect her sister
