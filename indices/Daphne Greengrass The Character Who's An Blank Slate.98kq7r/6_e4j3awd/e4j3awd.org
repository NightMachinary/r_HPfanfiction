I believe the "ice-queen" persona is so popular because it represents a possible archetype love-interest that isn't available among the HP characters, but also highly desired by fandom people who also enjoy anime:

The Tsundere. (look it up if you don't know what that is)

We already have a nerdy girl, a upbeat beautiful and sporty girl, a crazy tomboy kind of girl (maybe even 2), a "classic beauty" unattainable girl, etc. These serve as a basis for all kinds of romantic entanglements, but there's really not a female character from canon that could convincingly pull off the: "I totally hate you, baka!" (while blushing and secretly in love with the MC). Enter Daphne Greengrass.
