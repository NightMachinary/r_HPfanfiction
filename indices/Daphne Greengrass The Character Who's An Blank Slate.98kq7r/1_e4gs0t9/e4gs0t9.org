Simple, no physical description of her is ever given. Daphne is basic super hot Slytherin #1, Cho Chang is basic super hot Ravenclaw #1, Sue Bones is basic super hot Hufflepuff #1 and Katie Bell is basic super hot Gryffindor #1.

I'm pretty sure she first became popular as a character in lemons and stuff. Given the personality assigned to her in the most tropey fanficions, it wouldn't shock me at all to learn that it was mainly first developed by smut writers. The whole heiress ice queen persona is just to differentiate her from other members of the harem. It's just flushed-out enough to be able to spot her in a big pile of limbs whenever she has a line to speak during an orgy.

If compelled to write my own Daphne Greengrass, I would probably start back from scratch. Give the poor girl a bit more personality than a B-list character from a crappy japanese dating sim.

PS: Please fix your title... "The character who is A blank slate" would be acceptable. "The slytherin blank slate" would be okay. "Daphne Greengrass: as slated, a serene stare at the Slytherin blank slate" would be goofy but my personal favorite.
