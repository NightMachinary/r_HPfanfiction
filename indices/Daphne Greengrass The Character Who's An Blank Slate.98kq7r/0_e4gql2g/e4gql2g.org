Writers like her exactly because of her blank slate and the canon name.

I personally hate the 'Ice Queen' trope with a passion now. It has become so boring and repetitive.

That being said, I do enjoy quite a few Harry/Daphne fics, among them [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9095016/1/Betrayal][Betrayal]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw][Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches]] (this one is an exception), and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess][The Pureblood Princess]], linkffn(9095016;11697407;11574569;6943436).

  And most importantly, how would you write Daphne personally to put your own spin on her?

During his years at Hogwarts, Harry had never singled out Daphne (and Tracey Davis) for any kind of transgressions or anything special, whereas he had dissed every other single Slytherin of his year in his thoughts. That led me to believe that Daphne Greengrass was:

- was not a great beauty or Harry would have remarked in his thoughts. Harry did have eyes for hot girls.
- was not an openly confrontational person and knew how to keep a low profile.
- was likely not a blood purist since there was zero evidence of her antagonizing Hermione. (JKR might have said something bad about her, but I at least haven't seen that particular interview)
- could be one of "a handful Slytherins" who came back with Slughorn in the Final Battle.
- had hidden strengths that a writer could expand on.
