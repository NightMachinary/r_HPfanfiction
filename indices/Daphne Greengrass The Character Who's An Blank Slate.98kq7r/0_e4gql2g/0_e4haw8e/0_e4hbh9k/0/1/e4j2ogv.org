Stuff like this just reminds me of the lack of vision JKR had for her characters and world (at least in regards to the epilogue and post-series). It's like Magical Britain is some kind of backwater incestuous Texan town. Everything is so tiny and just crossing names and locations of a list: *rolls dice* Dean Thomas marries Fay Dunbar and they *rolls dice* take over Madame Malkin's after she retires.
