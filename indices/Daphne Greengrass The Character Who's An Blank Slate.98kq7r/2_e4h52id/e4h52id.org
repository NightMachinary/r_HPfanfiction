The blonde haired description of her doesn't bother me, since there's that one random blonde slytherin in the movies that could be her. But the "ice queen" thing makes my skin crawl, I hate it so much.

Originally her name was going to be Queenie, so I think it would be interesting to see a fic written with her having the personality of Queenie from Fantastic Beasts.
