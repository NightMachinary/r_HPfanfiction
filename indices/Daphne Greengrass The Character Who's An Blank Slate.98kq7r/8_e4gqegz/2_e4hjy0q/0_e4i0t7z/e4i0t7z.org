  That is canon Sirius

So what, does Sirius suddenly have a monopoly on doing that sort of thing exclusively?

#+begin_quote
  That's more like teenage rebellion.

Not really, because it doesn't come from a place of spiting her parents even if she does disagree with their ideological stance and beliefs. it comes from a place of affection.

  That sounds a little too political tbh. I mean, banging Hermione (a Muggleborn girl) to spite her parents is one thing, but the whole "side with Muggles" sounds a lot like her working for MI5, not like a plot suitable for Hogwarts.

Where did I say banging Hermione? I'm legitimately curious, because I can't remember even typing such a thing in the first. and I do believe, that done well it could be a good base for a personality as long people remember to differentiate Daphne from canon Sirius. and there is a certain amount of politics involved in even the canon books like Order of the Phoenix or to a smaller extent, Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows.
