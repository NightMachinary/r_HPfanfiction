  How about Daphne as someone who sides with muggles, muggle-born and wizards & witches who were raised by muggles?

That sounds a little too political tbh. I mean, banging Hermione (a Muggleborn girl) to spite her parents is one thing, but the whole "side with Muggles" sounds a lot like her working for MI5, not like a plot suitable for Hogwarts.

  Daphne wears their clothes, has their memorabilia in her room

That is canon Sirius

  maybe she even dyes her hair, like say brown with blue highlights for example

That's more like teenage rebellion.
