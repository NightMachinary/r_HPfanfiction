I personally have an idea for a possible personality, one that would be a bit cliche if it were a character who is fully defined like Draco Malfoy. who's an out-and-out bully with little redeeming qualities.

How about Daphne as someone who sides with muggles, muggle-born and wizards & witches who were raised by muggles? that hasn't been done yet right? Daphne wears their clothes, has their memorabilia in her room. maybe she even dyes her hair, like say brown with blue highlights for example.

And if her parents and sister are kept as pure-blood supremacists who are Death Eaters, maybe that type of behavior can actually get Daphne disowned as the elder daughter by her parents. so she's living in an apartment of her own that she maintains via having a job when she gets the Hogwarts letter.
