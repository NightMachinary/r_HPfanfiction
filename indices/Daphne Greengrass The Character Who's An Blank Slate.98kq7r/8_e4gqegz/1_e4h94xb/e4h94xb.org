Well, every Daphne story I have ever read portrayed her like a pureblood that is different. As the unusual and tolerant Slytherin, the pureblood who is not a supremacist and quickly becomes a rebel. I do not remember where, but I have definitely read something where she was disowned. As for being muggleborn: You would have to have a pretty fantastic explanation to put a muggleborn in Slytherin, since its founder literally left a monster in the school to kill all muggleborns. Applied Cultural Anthropology put Hermione in Slytherin and tried its hardest to show the reader why and it still feels forced.
