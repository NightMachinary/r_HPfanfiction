I find it interesting that in addition to the Ice Queen persona, most fics have her as best friends with Tracy Davis, mine included. No idea where that came from.

My Daphne was introduced to muggle dome mystery suspense novels as a young girl by Tracy's mother and, combined with what she thinks she knows about Slytherin, comes to Hogwarys expecting plots and manipulations and Machiavellian 11 year olds. She turns out to be completely wrong about the other students but is constantly claiming she is right about everything because of all the plots and intrigue surrounding Harry.
