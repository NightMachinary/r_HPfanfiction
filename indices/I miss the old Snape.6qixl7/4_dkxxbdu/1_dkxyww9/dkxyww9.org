I have never read that fic, but can you explain more about his character there? I have seen a few fics that try to explain his attitude in that it's a cover, but I don't agree with that and I find that it's often just an easy way to explain why his character starts acting OOC and super nice for no reason.

He is supposed to be spying on Dumbledore as well and it just doesn't make any sense for Voldemort to need to him to act super bitter and mean when he is also supposed to act like he is on Dumbledore's side. Traumatizing Neville by threating to poison his frog, along all the other things and antagonizing Harry Potter just seems personal and not at all a cover or really necessary. I find it much more likely that it is just the way he is due to his childhood and his personality.
