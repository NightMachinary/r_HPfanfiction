Well, in that story, he obviously was a professional spy, since he taught at a prestigious spy school. So while Hermione was being taught about tells, the little clues that tell people when you're lying, bluffing, angry, happy, etc, she realized that Snape actually had a range of false tells. Because you thought you could tell when he was angry, frustrated, etc, you wouldn't notice any real tells he had. If he were in disguise, you wouldn't be able to recognise him through any tells because all his mannerisms were never real in the first place.

He was a bit of an OC Snape, I don't think he was as nasty in the books, he was just a stern teacher. But he was definitely a good spy.
