I love fics with him like that, unfortunately too many writers prefer to write him all nice and comforting for some reason which just drives me crazy.

These fics have decent characterization of him:

linkffn(Keep your enemies closer)

linkffn(The Professor's Discretion)

linkffn(All That Glitters by mangoaddict)

Also soul play by snapesforte portrays him as more dark and cunning, although I am not sure where to find it since it seems to have been taken off the major fanfiction websites.
