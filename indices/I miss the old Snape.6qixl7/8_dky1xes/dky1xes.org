Linkao3(Swung by Serafim by flamethrower)

If I remember right, a good chunk of this is from Snape's perspective. Things get pre-Slash towards the end, but even with last chapter implying its about to grow further, it doesn't happen in-story and you can essentially go 'ehhh' and decide it didn't happen. (I could at least, but that might might just be me.)

Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by Wyste)

Snarky mentor Snape that confuses everyone on how he and Harry get along. It's wonderful. (And not slash.)

Linkao3(World in Pieces by Lomonaaeren)

AU-world Snape and Canon Harry slowly finding shared ground and people to rely on (not slash) as Harry adjusts to his new world and Snape slowly sees how difficult a Griffindor-housed Harry would've been instead of a Slytherin-housed one.

Hope these are to your satisfaction.
