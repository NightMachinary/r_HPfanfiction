The issue I had with this story is how rigidly it follows canon, even when there are so many divergences. I felt like I was mostly re-reading canon.

I did love the Snape-Harry interactions though.

Also [[/s][wtf Snape had a kid? I'm so confused can someone explain the random blackouts he'd have after meeting VOldemort?]]
