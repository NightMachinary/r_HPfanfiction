The Apprentice - Snape time travel, different in that it focuses on Snape's ability as a Potioneer. linkffn(6306296)

Secret Keeper - First war AU. Focuses on a platonic relationship between Snape and Lily, and also on Snape and James. linkffn(7287541)

Never Say Remember - Canon Harry is transported to an alternate universe where Snape married Lily after James' death. Well, sort of. The situation is more complex than that. linkffn(3983170)

Under Pressure - Snape after the end of the first war, acclimating to Hogwarts after his career as a Death Eater. Gets his bitter, sarcastic voice right. Probably my favorite Snape fic. linkffn(10091292)

Romance of the Age - Probably the second best satire in the fandom. linkao3(638325)

something in the depths of the dark - An interesting and incomplete take on Snape's relationship with Dumbledore. It's my favorite dynamic in the books, so I'll take what I can get. linkao3(8622892)

In which Snape befriends an old grey donkey - Snape befriends Eeyore. Naturally, it's the greatest friendship ever. linkffn(4903653)
