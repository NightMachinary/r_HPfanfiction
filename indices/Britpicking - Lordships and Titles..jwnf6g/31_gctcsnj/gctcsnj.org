Thank you! Apart from the obvious bad points of most Lord fics (Indy!fics, /shudder/) that bothered me the most. Though I did find some fics that used those titles, but as far as I recall they weren't anything great... Isnt DP&SW by LeadVonE using them? Can't be bothered to read it again after I dropped it.
