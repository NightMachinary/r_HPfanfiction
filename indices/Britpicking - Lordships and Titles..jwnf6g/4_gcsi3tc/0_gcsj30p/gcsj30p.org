The best source is Debretts information on the peerage: [[https://www.debretts.com/expertise/essential-guide-to-the-peerage/]]

So there's sections in there about each of the five types of peerages, and how these things work in terms of what you'd call them and so on.

There's also an etiquette section on Debretts, which is useful if you want to ensure your characters are behaving like aristocracy for extra realism. Also Google "u and non u behaviour" and there's a list of words which are "u" (ie upper class) and their middle/lower class counterparts - so for example, "spectacles" is U, "glasses" is non-U. "Napkin" is U, "Serviette" is not. If you want the Malfoys to "not have have the class they think they have," have them have major airs and graces but drop in some "non U" words to prove they're actually not that posh.
