My take on the Lord/Heir/Scion/Patriarch concept is that it's purely internal Wizarding World. It would have sort of developed, probably after the Statute of Secrecy came into effect, especially for those without Muggle titles but old families. If that is implicit and consistent in its use in a fic, I've got no problem with it. For the most part, I prefer to leave mundane titles out of it altogether (although, just to make a liar of myself, I'm working one where Harry inherits a minor Baronetcy in Wales. Not a big deal, although he will meet the Queen). The Queen, who is usually not depicted as a Witch, would not be using Wizarding forms of address to her own subjects, so Harry would still be Mr Potter (or whatever Mundane title he should happen to have), so I share the eyeroll there.

Consistency is key. And when dipping into Mundane politics and etiquette and so on, do your research!

I have seen a couple that call Voldemort out on the Lord thing and I always find it amusing.

Could you please give me your sources for this? I've had a dreadful time finding these details and I've got that one fic...and my husband wants to write one where there are multiple titles at play. And we both /need/ to be correct.

I will be renaming Potter Manor, in light of the comments here. And the Malfoys don't live in Malfoy Manor, but a pretentious French equivalent because even after 900 years, they still don't have the class they think they have.
