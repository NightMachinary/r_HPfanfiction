I can't explain the first two, but the last two are simple.\\
Wizards don't have any specific qualifications related to teaching and it seems likely that all you need to teach a subject is a NEWT in that subject, for most subjects there's plenty of candidates to choose from and its the headmaster's job to pick the best one, but the DADA job has been cursed for half a century so there's really not many people willing to take it.\\
The job of inspecting Hogwarts was created specifically for Umbridge, as in it likely wasn't even thought necessary until then, for all we know the only requirement or limitation.

She got both jobs due to the significant amount of fiat power than the Minister seems to wield, Fudge simply made a few decrees which say she's now teaching DADA regardless of qualifications because Dumbledore can't seem to hire anyone and she's now inspecting Hogwarts because he says so.

Oh yeah, that's a point this sort of aristocracy fic seems to miss, the Minister might be elected but he seems to be more of a dictator than anything, able to simply declare new laws as he sees fit. Not something you'd expect in a nation that still gave power to the aristocracy.
