And it was /never/ part of the British system officially. Sometimes it's practised, sometimes it's not, but was never practised in /full/ because the Lord Chancellor was, until the Supreme Court Act (I haven't looked it up since becuase this happened /after/ I quit being a litigator) a cabinet minister and part of the executive, speaker of the house of lords and therefore part of the legislature, and led and appointed the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council /and/ the Lords of Appeal In Ordinary and as such was the country's most senior judge.

Most of those functions got handed off to other officials after the Supreme Court took over the House of Lords' appellate functions and the Lord Chancellor is basically just the minister for the Justice Department these days and as such only violates separation of powers two ways like all the other ministers.

Just to really rub it in, Lord Chancellor was a political appointment on the advice of the Prime Minister (and in matters of formal precedence, outranks the Prime Minister and every other minister except the Great Steward - an office that is only ever filled for coronations)

Remember: it's not a British Institution if it makes sense outside the context of a thousand years of civil wars and narrowly-avoided civil wars.
