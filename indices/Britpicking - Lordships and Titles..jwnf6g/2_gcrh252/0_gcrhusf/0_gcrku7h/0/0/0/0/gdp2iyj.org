Depends on if the 'everyone spawns at age 20' thing like we saw in canon is typical or not. Wizards canonically live far longer than Muggles (130-150 years is their life expectancy, IIRC) so they'd probably most often spawn later in life and only really spawned early on due to wartime and the typical 'baby boom' that happens after those.
