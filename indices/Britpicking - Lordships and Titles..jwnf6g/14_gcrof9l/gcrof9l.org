  Don't call your adult posh wizards "Lord [Surname]".

Pretty much. And after I got that far into researching it, I decided to throw all the real life stuff into the bin, do my own magical fictionalised system, and call them Lord [Surname]. (Simply as a honorary title, meaning nothing else than that they are a Wizengamot member -- an inversion of the usual cause and effect.)

But I do agree it'd be nice if people did that consciously, and not because they actually think this is how it works.
