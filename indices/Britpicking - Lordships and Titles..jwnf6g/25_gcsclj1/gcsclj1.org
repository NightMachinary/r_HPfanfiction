Does this count as a Britpick? I too would like to see people use titles and use them right (mind you I've studied them independently as I study older civilizations) but all things considered I understand why people go the lazy route.

Side note: I'd imagine that if they (wizards) really wanted to do titles in the fullest, they'd probably stick to Roman titles. They also might not as they don't keep calling London Londinium so idk. I think a book using references from around Roman times would be interesting and could possibly fit considering Olivander's claimed age (store/family not the person).
