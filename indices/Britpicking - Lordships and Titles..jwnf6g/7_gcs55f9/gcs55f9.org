Very comprehensive.

I actually have a fic on my hard drive (half written) with titles done properly.

Lots of people in fic kept wrongly calling Sirius "Lord Black" (I made him "the Earl of Grimmuald" I dont think wizarding titles would be linked to land in the same way muggle ones due to the statue of secrecy so I linked them to the houses for example Lucius was Earl Malfoy but Draco was viscount Devizes which is another town in Wiltshire I just liked the name better than Salisbury or Swindon or any of the larger towns) and Sirius didn't care he was addressed wrongly because he was as anti his family as he is in canon but it was commented on that the people who kept doing it were "common".

I also made the Potters minor gentry. It annoys me that Harry gets stupid titles in fic when canonically the Potters were wealthy but not mega rich. Also most of their cash seems to have come from Fleamont's potions ,which is trade and therefore common). That was a point in the fic too. Harry was sort of lower upper class which fits the Potters better in my mind.

I might pick it up again actually now you've reminded me.

Only petty point, courtesy titles can be used before a child is of age. James, Viscount Severn the son of the Earl of Wessex isn't an adult (he's 12 I looked it up for this comment) and he is known as Viscount Severn.

But noone would be going around a school calling each other "my lord" or "your grace" because it undermines teacher's authority though in an insular world like wizarding Britain chances are that most students (except muggleborns) would know who in their year had a title anyway
