It was a political fic. Harry's parents were still dead and he was the ward of the scandalous Earl of Grimmauld (Sirius) and he was raised by Sirius and his "secretary" Remus (his secret lover because I like wolfstar).

I messed with the timeline so Tom Riddle was Harry's age and he was still raised in an orphange but he had at some pointed killed Morfin, Earl of Hangelton and had put the Duke of Slytherin (Marvolo Gaunt) under the imperius so he (as Merope's son) was next in line to be Duke of Slytherin. He was waiting until he was a few years olds to kill The Duke of Slytherin so he could take the title without suspicion in the meantime he was controllong Marvolo via imperius. Tom and Harry had a kind of weird friends slash enemies relationship where the was mutual respect but they kept trying to outmanoeveur each other (my Harry was a Slytherin but not a blood purist).

I had a whole plan for a wizarding house if lords but never got that far. I wanted to write more with Tom in the lords and Harry elected to the commons and them trying to thwart each other.

I really must pick this back up.

I coudnt find any info on age barriers for courtesy titles though it wasnt that important for when they were children (aside from a scene in year one in which Draco tries to use his title to flex and Snape shuts him down for behaving in a common fashion).
