Oh I want to read this now. It sounds great!

  Only petty point, courtesy titles can be used before a child is of age. James, Viscount Severn the son of the Earl of Wessex isn't an adult (he's 12 I looked it up for this comment) and he is known as Viscount Severn.

I think this is specific to the monarchy - Prince Charles was Duke of Cornwall from the age of four and Prince of Wales from the age of ten, although not formally investiture-d and able to act as such until the age of 21. Harry's son Archie is technically entitled to call himself Earl of Dunbarton even though he's a baby, but Harry and Megan have decided not to use it and the kid himself is too young to make the decision. Whereas, on the non-Royal side of the family, Charles Spencer wasn't allowed to call himself Viscount Althorp until he was 21

What I find weird is the Wessex's kids have courtesy titles, yet Wills and Harry never did, and I don't think the Duke of Yorks children did either - although that may be because they're girls. Maybe Wills and Harry didn't because they got to call themselves Prince, and the Wessex's kids don't get to style as such? Which would also explain why Harry's son is entitled to a courtesy even though he doesn't use it, and George, Charlotte and Louis are just Prince/Princess.
