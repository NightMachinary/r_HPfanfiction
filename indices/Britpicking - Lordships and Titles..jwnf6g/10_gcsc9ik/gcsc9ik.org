OK serious question in Scotland aren't there individuals with the title liard, Or something similar to that like doesn't it indicate clan chiefs or something like that

â€‹

Also I thought at least in Scotland they could have a title called a lord of Parliament , Which I'm not sure what that conveys but I thought there was a house of lords still for the UK, And there could be lifetime appointees to the house of lords that were lifetime peers rather than hereditary peers. And quite a few of them are referred to as either serve sir or Lord I think
