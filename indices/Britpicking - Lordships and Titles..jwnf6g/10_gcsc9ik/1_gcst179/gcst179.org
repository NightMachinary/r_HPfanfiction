  Also I thought at least in Scotland they could have a title called a lord of Parliament , Which I'm not sure what that conveys but I thought there was a house of lords still for the UK, And there could be lifetime appointees to the house of lords that were lifetime peers rather than hereditary peers. And quite a few of them are referred to as either serve sir or Lord I think

Lord of Parliament is specifically Scottish. Theres about 30 of them, and probably half that number are styled as Barons, although about 10-15 are indeed Lord. I'd forgotten about them when I made the post, but yes. These blokes are the exception to the rule.

The House of Lords is indeed so called, and is also known as the House of Peers. It is the Upper House of British government. In this context, "Lords" is used as a collective to mean "the people who sit in this Chamber are titled," it doesn't mean the people therein are specifically called Lords. There are two classes of "Lords" within the House.

The first and smallest is the "Lords Spiritual," which is currently a group of 26 Archbishops and Bishops representing the Church of England. These people mainly are not peers in their own right but are entitled to sit in the Lords due to their high status in the Church - the current Archbishop of Canterbury, for example, is not a peer in his own right but is the "Lord Archbishop" by virtue of being the head of the C of E.

Some spiritual figures have been made life peers - Baron Sacks was Chief Rabbi, Baron Williams is a former Archbishop of Canterbury - and they are entitled to take a seat in the Lords and sit with the Lords Spiritual. They are also often, like other life peers, informally called "Lord" in the media - Sacks was regularly referred to as Lord Sacks when in the news - but the correct style, as for all life peers, is Baron.

The other, and larger part of the Lords is the Lords Temporal. Again, none of these people are officially Lords, apart from a small number of Scottish Lords of Parliament (and I'm not sure if any of those currently have a seat in the HoL). 92 of these are hereditary peers - which is the form of peerage I discussed in my OP. They will be a Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, or Baron.

The rest of the Temporal, about 650 seats, is for life peers. All of these are Barons or Baronesses, and most Barons are officially styled thus: [Full name], Baron [name] of [place the baronetcy is linked to]. Men will be referred to as "Lord Surname" or "The Right Honourable Lord Surname" but their rank is specifically Baron and Lord is an honorific term of address. Women can choose to be "Lady Surname," "Lady Place of Baronetcy" or "Baroness Surname," but again their rank is specifically Baroness. These are political appointments and the Barons and Baronesses sit with their chosen political party, much as the MPs sit in the Commons.

No member of the HoL would be addressed as Sir. A Sir is a knight, and the peerage ranks are higher than a knight so supercede it. Being a knight does not confer the right to sit in the HoL. An example of this is Lord Sugar (him of The Apprentice UK fame). He was Knighted in about 2000, and was addressed as "Sir Alan" thereafter but definitely wasn't allowed in the HoL! He was then made a life peer about ten years later, and became Baron Sugar of Clapton, and was thereafter known in public as Lord Sugar. At that point, he was allowed in the HoL. But his /rank/ is Baron, which superceded his former rank of knight.

Basically, you can get away with calling a life peer (which is a political appointment) "Lord Surname," but you absolutely wouldn't get away with calling a hereditary peer that.
