So the "Lords Temporal" is both the hereditary peers that are still allowed to sit in the Lords, and then the life peers.

The life peers, yes basically you're right. The government chooses people that they want to give a peerage to - but that title only lasts as long as the individual survives. They can't pass it to their children. That title is always Baron. So those titles are given to people who have done a lot of public service or achieved something. So quite often senior judges, businesspeople and so on. Some of the more interesting ones are Floella Benjamin, who used to present kids TV, A lady called Doreen Lawrence who's son was killed by the police so she's campaigned for police reform for years, Ian Botham who was England Cricket captain when I was a kid. But most of them aren't interesting celebrities, they're law types and politicians, and businessmen who aren't famous but successful.

Where it gets a bit complicated is that the Temporal - so the peers both hereditary and life - have party affiliation. So a hereditary peer can choose to sit with the party of their choice, or to not have any party affiliation which is known as being a "crossbench" peer. Life peers get to do the same, but it's usually announced when they're made a Baron/ess which party they're going to represent or if they've chosen to sit as a crossbench lord.

If you've been made a Baron to be a life peer, yes you're automatically allowed to sit in the HoL and vote on stuff. There are still some hereditary Baronetcies, but most of them don't sit in the Lords as they're secondary titles that get used as courtesies by the eldest son or if the person has no children, they will still likely have another title that superceded Baron. And obviously you go by the highest one. But yes, really you're right - if someone is Baron/ess whoever, it's fair to assume they're a life peer and sit in the Lords.
