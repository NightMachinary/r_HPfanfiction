Yes, I believe they can switch party, which is called "crossing the floor," but it's very rarely done. A lot of the political appointments have existing affiliation anyway, so they'd been an MP for one of the parties, or if they're a business person maybe they'd assisted the government on a project and helped them understand the issues or something.

The government tends to pick a majority of their own people, but there are some conventions. For example, if the outgoing Prime Minister has said someone should be made a lord, it's not the done thing for the new PM to block that. So, when John Prescott, who was Deputy Prime Minister for the Labour Party, left the House of Commons in 2010, the outgoing Labour PM, Gordon Brown, named him as someone who should be made a lord. The new PM, David Cameron, was a Conservative, but he still made Prescott a life peer. Because there's convention. Sometimes the government will take recommendations from the opposition as well. For example, the Conservatives have been in power since 2010, and in 2018 they agreed to make Iain McNicol, who was the former General Secretary of the Labour Party (which is the parties most senior non elected position) a life peer after Labour MPs recommended it. The opposition parties get a certain allocation of how many people they can recommend each year. So it's not as cutthroat and partisan as the US, although the ruling party does get a majority.

It's generally not controversial, obviously when they're well known politicians some people have an opinion. John Prescott for example, some people weren't keen on his appointment because when he was Deputy PM he smacked a bloke who threw an egg at him. Half the country think he did the right thing and anyone else would have smacked that bloke too, and the other half think he's some sort of thug! But ultimately no one made a fuss because he was Deputy PM for a decade and it's the done thing. The press covers it when someone famous gets it, when Ian Botham got it recently there was footage on the news of him being sworn in. But that's because people like him and were interested to see it, not because it was controversial really.
