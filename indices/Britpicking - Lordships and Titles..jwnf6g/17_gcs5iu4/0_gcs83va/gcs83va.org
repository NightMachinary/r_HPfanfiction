Now, Lloyd Webber is an interesting one for two reasons. Firstly, he recently resigned from the House of Lords, so although he is entitled to keep his title or Baron (or Lord, colloquially) he is no longer entitled to be styled Right Honourable. And secondly, although his surname isn't hyphenated on his birth certificate, it is on his title. So his son could be made "Baron Lloyd Webber" whereas Andrew is "Baron Lloyd-Webber". A subtle difference, but its there!

The main difference would be /where/ he was baron of. So Andrew Lloyd Webber is Baron Lloyd-Webber of Sydmonton, and his son could be made Baron Lloyd-Webber (or Lloyd Webber) of [another place] and that's how you'd differentiate. Or you could refer to one as Lord Lloyd Webber and one as Baron Lloyd Webber, or for example the son gets to be called Lord or Baron Lloyd-Webber and Andrew gets called Lord or Baron Sydmonton.

So yeah, minor context clues basically.
