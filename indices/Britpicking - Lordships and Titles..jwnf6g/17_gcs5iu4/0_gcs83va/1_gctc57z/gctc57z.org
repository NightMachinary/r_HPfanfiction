An example is Douglas Hurd and his father, Anthony Hurd.

His father's title after being given a life peerage was Baron Hurd, of Newbury in the Royal County of Berkshire. As a life peer, his father's title didn't pass on to him, so when he was elevated to the Lord's he had his own title: Baron Hurd of Westwell, of Westwell in the county of Oxfordshire.

Other examples:

Vaizey (father/son)

Baron Vaizey, of Greenwich in Greater London Baron Vaizey of Didcot, of Wantage in the County of Oxfordshire

Gummer (brothers)

Baron Chadlington, of Dean in the County of Oxfordshire Baron Deben, of Winston in the County of Suffolk

Howe (married)

Baron Howe of Aberavon, of Tandridge in the County of Surrey Baroness Howe of Idlicote, of Shipston-on-Stour in the County of Warwickshire

Cheshires (married)

Baroness Ryder of Warsaw, of Warsaw in Poland and of Cavendish in the County of Suffolk Baron Cheshire, of Woodhall in the County of Lincolnshire.

So a few things to point out: - Titles don't have to be the same when related, it's easier if they're not. - Sometimes someone else with the same name has used their name in the title, if you're new you add a location to your title, or choose something else -You can have a location not in the UK, if you were born there - You can have a location that isn't a village/town/city but rather an area (e.g. Lord Hammond of Runnymede)
