Okay, question on life peers. Andrew Lloyd Webber was made a baron. So he is now (to the best of my American understanding) Baron Lloyd Webber. But somehow also The Right Honorable Lord Lloyd Webber. Now, his children won't inherit the title. But, if one of his sons does something remarkable enough to also be made a life peer, how would that be handled? Would he not be able to be made Baron Lloyd Webber until his father passed? Or would they just both be Baron Lloyd Webber and you have to figure out which one someone was talking about based on context clues?
