  There is no such substantive title as "Lord [Surname]." In fact, outside of one person, there is no such title in the UK as "Lord."

Sorry to correct you on this, but in Scotland the equivalent of an English Baron is Lord of Parliament. Scottish Barons rank below English Barons in the order of precedence, as they sit under the Lords of Parliament in the order of precedence.

And they are simply documented as Lord X.
