The associated courtesy title would probably be Viscount something else - they tend to differ. So if your dad is Earl X, you'd be Viscount Y.

In this situation, however, Harry would be Earl Stroud because he's the eldest living male member of the family so would automatically inherit the title. He'd have an adult to act as "regent" - ie make decisions about the estate and finances until he reaches his majority.

In the UK House of Lords, that regent or proxy could not take the family seat to vote (when seats were inherited, they aren't now), so the seat would sit empty until the boy reached majority (21 in those days). Lots of fics have people acting as "proxys" for wizengamot votes for eg Harry, but this doesn't really happen in any political system I can think of. It's probably ok to do it in a magic government chamber though as you can say there's charms to make sure the proxy votes in the interest of the family and sticks to their values.
