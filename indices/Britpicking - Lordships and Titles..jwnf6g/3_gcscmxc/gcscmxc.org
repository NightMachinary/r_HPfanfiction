Interestingly the Death Eaters always refer to Tom as either Master, My Lord or The Dark Lord. Only Quirrell bucks this trend, but that occurs in Book 1 when the larger HP world is still rather nebulous. But I now read this as Quirrell claiming favour. No one is allowed to speak the name Voldemort, lord or otherwise in front of Tom without consequence. But Quirrell can get away with it because Tom has no other options at the time. I imagine is must have thrilled Quirrell each time he said it, knowing that not even the Dark Lord's inner circle would dare to do the same.

Quirrell is also a Half-blood who used to teach Muggle Studies which further confuses things.

Dobby is the first character to use the title "Dark Lord" something he no doubt picked up from his family, just as Kreacher did in book 7.

Amusingly the person who uses "Lord Voldemort" the most often is Dumbledore. No doubt Albus thought it funny to use Toms' silly teenage nickname constantly. Being the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, he's no doubt familiar with the proper forms of address and Tom's infantile use of Lord would certainly tickle him.

That being said, I think the term "Dark Lord" has providence outside of muggle peerage conventions. It shows up in the Prophecy for instance, so Tom's use of Lord Voldemort might be a contraction of "The Dark Lord, Voldemort."
