  The one with the power to vanquish the *Dark Lord* approaches... Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and *the Dark Lord* will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the *Dark Lord* knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... The one with the power to vanquish the *Dark Lord* will be born as the seventh month dies...

I think you've slightly missed my point. I'm not saying /Voldemort/ isn't an anagram, just that the term "Dark Lord" has a use in prophecy which suggests a use for the Lord moniker that isn't connected to the muggle world.

The Prophecy could have chosen another title for Tom. Something that referenced his Riddle name or his heritage/ kin killing or simply called him a Dark Wizard (Which is how Grindlewald is refered to on Albus' card btw). So magic/fate is choosing to use *Lord* which, again, suggests that there might be a non muggle providence to the term.
