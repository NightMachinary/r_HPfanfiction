  That being said, I think the term "Dark Lord" has providence outside of muggle peerage conventions. It shows up in the Prophecy for instance, so Tom's use of Lord Voldemort might be a contraction of "The Dark Lord, Voldemort."

No. It's part of an anagram of his name. There is no nobility, no peerage, no Dark Lordship involved at all. He just chose a pretentious name and then scammed a bunch of nitwits with it.
