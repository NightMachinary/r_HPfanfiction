  However, what we're told about where Hangleton is tells us it has to be up north somewhere (two hundred miles from Little Whinging, per Goblet of Fire chapter 1)

200 miles from Little Whinging doesn't have to be up north! It could be somewhere in Devon or Cornwall. It could be North Lincolnshire. 200 miles from Surrey is actually a bit lower down the country than Lancashire or North Yorkshire. 200 miles west of Surrey would put you onto Dartmoor, which has it's fair share of old houses and remote little villages. It could even be somewhere in the west of Wales.

  the Harrying of the North made most of it unattractive to be given out to feudal henchmen, land ain't that valuable if your genocide killed off three quarters of the productive peasants - and very little of it was parcelled out as manors before quia emptores was passed and more-or-less froze the growth of the manorial system.

Right, but there's plenty of Dukedoms and Earldoms in the North that date from before the Statute of Secrecy, and replaced the old baronetcies. It doesn't have to have been given to Salazar himself, but potentially a descendant. And the Gaunts specifically don't have to have had a manorial dignity - say the Slytherin's were some form of nobility, maybe Earls, made in like the 1350s. Then the name died out as we know it did and the title went with it and no one in the Muggle world remembers because of the Statute. But the Gaunt family is, as we see from Marvolo, obsessed with their heritage. So it's likely the Gaunt family, at some point before Marvolo was born, acquired a small home on what used to be Slytherin Lands because they're so proud of the heritage. When Tom discovers all of this, he decides to bring back the title.
