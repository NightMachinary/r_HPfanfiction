  "Marvolo Slytherin, Earl of Hangleton" would work if we say that where the Gaunt shack now stands has been Slytherin land since way back when.

If it's from way back when he'd almost certainly be Baron Hangleton (and far more likely be a small-b baron, the now largely defunct lord of the manor that mostly survives only in Scotland nowadays).

However, what we're told about where Hangleton /is/ tells us it has to be up north somewhere (two hundred miles from Little Whinging, per Goblet of Fire chapter 1) nearly all of the land in that radius across Lancashire and North Yorkshire (with a bit of old Westmorland included if you make it a fuzzy 'two hundred miles') was crown land from the conquest - the Harrying of the North made most of it unattractive to be given out to feudal henchmen, land ain't that valuable if your genocide killed off three quarters of the productive peasants - and very little of it was parcelled out as manors before /quia emptores/ was passed and more-or-less froze the growth of the manorial system. The Gaunts were as such /really/ unlikely to have had a manorial dignity.

(Gaunt is an anglicisation of 'Ghent'. There's a hill that's within the band where Hangleton lies called Pen-y-Ghent...)
