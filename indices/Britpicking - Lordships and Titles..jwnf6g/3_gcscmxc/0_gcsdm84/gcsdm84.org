  Tom's use of Lord Voldemort might be a contraction of "The Dark Lord, Voldemort."

Yes, I have always seen it that way. Tbh even in the most wanky Lordship fics if Tom wants to claim any political or social power he ends up styling himself as "Lord Marvolo Slytherin," which is an upgrade from Lord Voldemort! I'd still like to see him calling himself something proper though - "Marvolo Slytherin, Earl of Hangleton" would work if we say that where the Gaunt shack now stands has been Slytherin land since way back when.

Or the Sorting Hat sings of Slytherin being "from Fen," which could mean Ireland but it could also mean, if we assume he was English, "the Fenlands" which is Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk mainly. So Tom could be the Earl of Lincoln, or he could be just Earl Slytherin and his heir gets to be Viscount Hangleton (Little Hangleton is now in Lincolnshire and no one can change my head canon about this soz).
