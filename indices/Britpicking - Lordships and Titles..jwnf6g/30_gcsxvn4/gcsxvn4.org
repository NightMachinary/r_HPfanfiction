thank you very much for this!! i have never considered exactly the specifics of titles in hpffn --- i just kind of went along with whatever was fanon. this post is going into the bookmarks! however i will still read and write lord potter fics because thinking up all these places for people to be earl of is extremely time consuming. i think there should be a certain degree of inaccuracy allowed in fiction.

but now this post has me thinking of a royalty au where all of hpverse are earl or countess something or rather and they are all just there for the drama
