This was very interesting to read and very informative. I think some of the differences between Fanon noble titles and real world titles could be explained away in-universe though I will totally agree that most authors haven't really put on that much thought or effort.

For instance in the 300+ years since the Statute of Secrecy the style of address went from Duke of [Whatever] or Earl [Something] to simply Lord [Whatever/Something] because the families that cared the most about having a noble title were of lower rank ("Dark" families care about lineage and bloodlines, but are less likely to have served muggle royalty to get higher titles, while "Light" families are more meritocratic and care about individual accomplishment, but have acquired more titles by serving and intermarrying with muggles). As a result the important point is that you /have/ a noble title rather than what the title actually /is/, so the snobbiest families start referring to each other as Lord [Whatever] to emphasize that they are better than everyone else without having to admit that they only have the title of Baron.

Also it could be that Wizards didn't care about collecting multiple titles to show how great and powerful they are the way muggle nobles did, after all a wizard noble can just knock over your castle with a few spells to show how powerful he is. because of this there aren't many courtesy titles available to let your heir use to show that he is better than everybody else (or will be when you kick the bucket) and the nobles themselves are already being referred to as Lord [Something]. Given the longer lifespan of witches and wizards that is a potentially a long time to go without a tangible excuse to sneer at your "inferiors" so the practice of referring to the heir apparent to a title as Heir [Something].
