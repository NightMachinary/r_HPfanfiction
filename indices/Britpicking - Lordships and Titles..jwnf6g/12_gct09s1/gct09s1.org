Awesome post, cleared up a lot of things, (in my fics I either don't apply nobility or just have the Wizards have different titles 'Warlock, Grand Warlock, Sorcerer, Grand Sorcerer and maybe Magister') but I have a theory on where this trope comes from.

1- GOT I think most of the Lord part is due to this, there, in Westeros, unless you are royalty you get called, Ser(for knights and landed knights), Lord(most of nobility) or Lord Paramount(for the Lord of a whole Kingdom), though even the latter goes by Lord.

It's simple and gives a feeling of authority.

2-For the "Heir" part and even the over use of Lord [Surname] it could be Naruto fanfiction, because in some Shinobi noble clans they had a title for heirs that when used is translated as Heir, so the addressing would be as Heir [Family Name], it was a pretty big trope back then.

And the Lord [Surname] part is because in some translations (even official ones) Lord is used when the person has the -sama honorific, which is more of a sign of deference and/or respect, than nobility (AFAIK Japanese had many different actual noble titles) so Jiraiya-sama was translated as Lord Jiraiya and Hokage-sama (whereas Hokage /is/ a title and/or rank) was translated as Lord Hokage.

I find that both these fandoms exchanged and still exchange many tropes.
