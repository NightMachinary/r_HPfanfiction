Aren't Muggle titles tied to the land because (traditionally) power and wealth grew from the land?

*Every wizard must grasp the truth: "Political power grows out of the tip of a wand."*

I suspect wizarding nobility would name their titles after fields of magic: there might be an Baron of Legilimency, an Earl of Broomsticks or a Duke of Transfiguration, who would have some authority over any use of that magic within Britain.
