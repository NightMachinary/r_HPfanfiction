Actually, they can be referred to as Lords. Most are called "Lord XXXX". Earl Mountbatten of Burma as Lord Mountbatten etc. So he could easily be 'Lord Malfoy' where his title is derived from a family name rather than a place.

This also occurs constantly in the UK nobility - Earl Mountbatten, as I mentioned above, is one title, The Marquess Curzon as Lord Curzon another, even Earl Spencer whom you mention is also known in conversation as Lord Spencer. The only exception to this is Dukes, who would not be referred to as Lord_Lastname (see what I did there?) But simply as their title. For example the Duke of Norfolk would simply sign a letter as Norfolk and be referred to as Your Grace, My Lord Duke or Norfolk by his superiors.

Heirs usually use a subsidiary title but the sons of Marquesses and Dukes have the title of Lord_firstmame_lastname as well, which may have added to the confusion.

I agree that in most fanfics, very little research has been done which does annoy me greatly.

The only way I can see the 'Heir' title working is if they introduce it expressly as a magical title which the Queen would know as she is aware of the Magical community.
