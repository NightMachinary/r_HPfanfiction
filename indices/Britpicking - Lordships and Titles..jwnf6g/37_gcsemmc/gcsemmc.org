Not to be a naysayer or anything, but I'm pretty sure there's also no such thing as Director of the DMLE or Minister for Magic in England. Or Hogwarts Transfiguration Professor, for that matter. I appreciate the point you're trying to make, but I honestly don't think that magical nobility is supposed to reflect IRL British society. Though, there are some fics that imply that “it works the same way as in the Muggle world.” In that case, I guess your Britpick would be fully applicable.
