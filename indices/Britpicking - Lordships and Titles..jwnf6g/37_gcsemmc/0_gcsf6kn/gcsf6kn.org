Ok but Director of the DMLE and Minister for Magic are counterparts to the Home Secretary and Prime Minister. Transfiguration professor is the wizard equivalent of a physics teacher - both deal with states of matter. The things JKR invented in general have recognisable counterparts in the real world.

There is no wizarding aristocracy in canon, but many other things work the way they do in the Muggle world but with a magical twist. So I don't think it's too big an ask to say "make this at least vaugely recognisable, because the style of the HP world is a magical twist on how things actually are in the UK."
