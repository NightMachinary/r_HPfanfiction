I have now read this. I really like it. It's a huge shame the author never put up part two as I'd got quite invested by the end.

The first scene with the mention of Lords (in the "canon universe") made all the typical mistakes of HP fanfic doing nobility - they were all just Lord Surname. But then the AU they end up in did it so close to correct, which was awesome. It wasn't exactly as it would be irl, but the difference was subtle enough that it could be put down to minor differences between Muggle and Magical worlds. So yeah, fantastic. Realistic enough that it didn't bring me out of the story.
