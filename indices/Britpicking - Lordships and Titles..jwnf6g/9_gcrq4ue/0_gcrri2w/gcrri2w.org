Oh that does make sense! But the older peerages in England would definitely predate the statute of secrecy, so it's also possible that some wizards have Earldoms given by the crown before the 1600s that muggles think have died out because the owners of the title disappeared after the SoS came in. Still no excuse for "Heir Malfoy" though!

  Out of curiosity, who is that person? I don't think you mentioned it.

I /thought/ it was only Lord Willoughby de Brook, but it turns out he's actually a Baron so I was wrong on that, but another poster has reminded me that Scottish Barons are Lords of Parliament and about half of them are just styled "Lord X" so there's 10-15 people who are officially "Lord" but they're all in Scotland.
