  "Lord" used purely to mean "male aristocrat with no title."
#+end_quote

I think this actually makes a compelling argument /for/ the use of "Lord." After all, they may style themselves as aristocrats, but they don't actually have titles, do they? (Or at least not any that The Crown would recognize.) So, since they can't call themselves Earls or Viscounts, they just stuck with "Lord" as a generic title. And after a few generations, they might not even remember the origin of the title. I am certain that almost no one who writes fics about lordships and the like intends it that way, but I think it makes a lot of sense.

  There is no such substantive title as "Lord [Surname]." In fact, outside of one person, there is no such title in the UK as "Lord."

Out of curiosity, who is that person? I don't think you mentioned it.
