Great summary! My only real response to it all is just 'tru that'.

Though I would add two things for anyone else reading.

First, the most important thing from all that to remember is that titles (basically, the thing Aristocrats would put on their business cards) and styles (the way people address said Aristocrats) are different. If you're unsure of what style corresponds to what title, there's a lot of surprisingly accurate resources online.

Second, for anyone considering other types of European Nobility, remember that the systems do vary, even accounting for the simple variation in terms due to speaking different languages. Don't just assume the English system applies everywhere because there are variations and twists all over the bloody place. Especially since Royalty and Heraldric Types just made shit up as they went along in places.
