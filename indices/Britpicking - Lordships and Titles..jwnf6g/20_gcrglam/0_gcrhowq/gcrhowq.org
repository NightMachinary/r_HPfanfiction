Yep, if you're talking to a Duke you call him "Your Grace," if you're talking about him you refer to him as "The Duke of [wherever he is Duke of]". Same thing for the lower peerages, except it's "My Lord" instead of "Your Grace." Baronets and Knights are "Sir" unless you know them well (my boss is a knight and I just call him by his name, sometimes "Sir [first name]" when speaking about him to people who he doesn't know).

European is absolutely different, I think Viscount is very high up the ranks in some European systems, whereas in Britain it's second to bottom.

Also important to note that someone like Sirius won't take it seriously, but he would absolutely know the rules. Can't break them until you know them!
