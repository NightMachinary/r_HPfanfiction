How have I missed that?? I am blind, ashamed and totally lost. I've read the book several times and never once looked at the chapter title - otherwise they're just talking about ‘their house' and ‘the Malfoy's place' and so on, I just thought ‘well, Malfoy Manor has a ring to it, wonder where that comes from' when reading fanfics. Thanks for the heads-up! Now I need to re-read with focus on chapter titles to see what else I've missed..
