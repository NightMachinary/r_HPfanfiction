The Malfoy house isn't called “Malfoy Manor” in the books, though? It's just called a manor - adding “Malfoy” before it seems to be a fandom thing (like using wards - not done in the books).

Not to detract from your point about the Malfoys being pretentious twerps, which they are, but criticise them more on the grounds of having white peacocks in their park, rather than the name of the house :)
