If it's Douglas we might be related XD. As a side note I'm sad that as an American with more than a passing fancy of lords and lordships it's actually quite hard to get accurate information about them in the states. Plus while we generally had a aristocratic system, and while still in place its really low key(read dodgy af like the Lee's, Kennedy's, Clinton's, and Rockefeller's). After the American civil war you don't hear about them much unless they came after it, like the Rockefeller with being oil barons or the Kennedy's with their mob connections.
