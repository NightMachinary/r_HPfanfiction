Yep that's how we got them in the first place, they got rich and could afford to be “Aristocratics”.

Also that's pretty cool, Douglas for the win! Also the Black(or good Sir James) is like one of the coolest historical figuresXD! And I did read that the Douglass' were pretty freaking widespread, the best example being that the head of the Swedish army during WW2 was a Douglas, he had a hyphenated name.
