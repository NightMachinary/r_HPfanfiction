°embraces long lost transatlantic cousin° Haha it is, awesome.

Have a look at Burke's Peerage, which is a list of who's who and posh in Britain, and Debretts has stuff about how to behave and how to talk to aristocracy. Both interesting if you want to get an idea of how it all works, both have websites.

For an allegedly classless society, you guys definitely have your own equivalent of our aristocracy that's for sure. And they're mega, mega rich. Like, the Rockefellers as a whole are probably richer than the Queen, in terms of cash value.
