  Castle Douglas, seat of Clan Douglas Skene Castle, seat of Clan Skene The entire county of Moray, spawns the name Murray, sometimes ancient aristocrats take names associated with their lands as surnames eg Earl/ Countess Sutherland, Chief of Clan Sutherland Wemyss Castle, Seat of Clan Wemyss and the Earl of Wemyss and March Castle Kennedy, Ancient Seat of Clan Kennedy, though not the current seat

Ok one of these is my surname :) And now I want my castle back! Although apparently my particular branch of that family is the product of a second sons affair with a servant and said "issue" was packed off to Glasgow and allowed to keep the name in exchange for no money or house. Isn't aristocracy wonderful ðŸ™„

Absolutely agree on the interesting names, especially if the point of the house having a name is that it's connected to Harry inheriting a peerage - older aristocracy especially in England have names for their house often connected to the lands around them or similar.

  Why not â€˜The Kiln' of the Potters, where generations of Potters have sought to test their mettle and magic against the creatures that inhabit their land. It could even have an older name from when the Peverells inhabited the land, but has since been lost, or rechristened.

I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS.

In all honesty, the Weasleys behave more like English aristocracy than the Malfoys do. They have a named house and prefer to wear old outdoor clothing!
