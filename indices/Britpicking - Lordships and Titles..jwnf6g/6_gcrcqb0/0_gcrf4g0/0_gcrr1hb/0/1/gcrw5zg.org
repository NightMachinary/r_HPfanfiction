Thats an interesting lineage, better than mine anyhow. Mine are all farming and crofting folk, some spoke Gàidhlig a few generations ago, i.e. Grandad's Grandmother etc. Though the branch that gives me the patronymic surname ‘Arthur' comes from Wales/Cornwall in the Napoleonic Era, an we can't tell if they were evicted as part of the Clearances and moved there because they moved back to Scotland or they were there in Cornwall originally, so im choosing to be fun and say I'm actually descended from King Arthur, facts be damned.

I love a good wizarding aristocracy fic, but i really wish people would be so much more creative with the titles and how it feeds family magics etc.

For instance i have two more head canons for you;

1) Despite ‘Peveril' being a traceably Norman name to a ‘Sir William Peveril'; The Wizarding Peverells were descended from Sir Peverell, one of Arthur's Knights of the Round Table and a wizard who was taught by Merlin, his descendants either created the Deathly Hallows or were actually gifted them by Death, him/her self.

2) The Weasleys actually lost most of their wealth and assets to the Malfoys, a couple (2-3)of generations ago, hence the Nouveau Riche Malfoys who rechristen the original Burrow to ‘Malfoy Manor'.
