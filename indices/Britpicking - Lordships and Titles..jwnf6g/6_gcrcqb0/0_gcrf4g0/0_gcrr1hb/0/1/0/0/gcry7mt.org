I do think its interesting if authors do at least try to incorporate actually British attitudes about class, as complicated and messy as it is and how difficult it is when most of fanfic is written by Americans, into stories. In my experience, since i went to private school with both old money people and nouveau riche, unless your an old etonian twat, then old money doesnt tend to give as much of a shit, like money is just a thing that they have, its not a huge deal. For nouveau riche they have something to prove and they want to show it, hence the flashy cars and pageantry.
