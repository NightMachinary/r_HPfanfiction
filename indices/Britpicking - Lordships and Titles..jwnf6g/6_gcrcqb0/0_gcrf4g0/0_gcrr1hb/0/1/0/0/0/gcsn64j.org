My city has so many private schools. A lot of children are privately educated. It's insane.

I went to a private school but it wasn't the poshest school in the city by a decent margin and a lot less posh than schools like Eton. It felt like all the actual pretentious rich parents sent their children to The Posh School and the children of mid to upper middle class parents or the crazy smart lucky children on scholarships and bursaries went to mine or one of the numerous other private schools. I have no idea if that's accurate though.

To me, The Posh School was how I pictured Hogwarts to look like bc the grounds and building are so impressive.

There were no obvious divides in the school over wealth (school uniform was skirt/trousers, tie and blazer so everyone looked the same) (excluding privately judging the parents who parked really expensive cars in a car park with minimal cctv bc come on), until students turned 17 and started driving brand new cars they got for their birthday. That was a lovely reminder about how much money some parents had.

So a great way for class/pretentious to poke into the children is the richer ones having the best (and most expensive) extra curricular equipment and going on holidays abroad or too their second home for the holidays. Eg nimbus 2001s instead of 2000s or cleansweeps; expensive chess sets; brand new top of the line equipment for classes; expensive clothes; talking about their experiences in [insert city here] or their wizarding skiing trip equivalent; etc.

How people talk is partially influenced by wealth, class and social situation they are in - A Good And Proper young wizard would probably speak in received pronunciation to their parents instead of informal language whereas a normal young wizard would be a lot more informal with their parents and probably use the regional accent and slang (Draco v Ron v Seamus).
