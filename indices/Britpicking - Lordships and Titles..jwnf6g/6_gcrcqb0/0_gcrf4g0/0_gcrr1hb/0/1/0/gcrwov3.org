Oh that's a genuinely interesting family backstory. Nice! I wish I could claim descent from King Arthur. I think my mum's side might have been Vikings at one point though. And Vikings are cool.

  1) Despite ‘Peveril' being a traceably Norman name to a ‘Sir William Peveril'; The Wizarding Peverells were descended from Sir Peverell, one of Arthur's Knights of the Round Table and a wizard who was taught by Merlin, his descendants either created the Deathly Hallows or were actually gifted them by Death, him/her self.

  2) The Weasleys actually lost most of their wealth and assets to the Malfoys, a couple (2-3)of generations ago, hence the Nouveau Riche Malfoys who rechristen the original Burrow to ‘Malfoy Manor'.

Absolutely in love with these. Number 2 especially absolutely gives background to why the Weasleys and Malfoys hate each other, and gives another layer of meaning to when Arthur says to Lucius "we have different views on what disgraces the name of wizard."
