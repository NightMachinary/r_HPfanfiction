Sometimes though, surnames do become the name of seats and places. As I'm Scottish, i know more about Scottish Aristocracy, which has its own quirks occasionally especially because of the remnants of the Clan System. I should also stress how legally distinct Scotland is, especially in these matters.

However, back to my original point,

Castle Douglas, seat of Clan Douglas Skene Castle, seat of Clan Skene The entire county of Moray, spawns the name Murray, sometimes ancient aristocrats take names associated with their lands as surnames eg Earl/ Countess Sutherland, Chief of Clan Sutherland Wemyss Castle, Seat of Clan Wemyss and the Earl of Wemyss and March Castle Kennedy, Ancient Seat of Clan Kennedy, though not the current seat

This trend happens a lot in Scotland.

Brings me to another point want to make; For the love of christ please come up with better names for family seats than Potter Manor, or Potter Castle. Castle Potter flows better if you really want to follow that convention, but I urge authors to come up with more interesting names,

We already have The Burrow of the Weasleys Ive seen The Ossuary as the fanon seat of the Bones family.

Why not ‘The Kiln' of the Potters, where generations of Potters have sought to test their mettle and magic against the creatures that inhabit their land. It could even have an older name from when the Peverells inhabited the land, but has since been lost, or rechristened. That is if you want to ignore the Pottermore etymology where ‘Potter' is not related to muggle occupational Surname ‘Potter' but is in fact a corruption of ‘Potterer' from ‘Linfred the Potterer of Stinchcombe'. I personally really like the Pottermore version, but to each their own.

Edit: One of my personal headcanons is that the Potters do have a family magic, that was originally just stuff from the Peverells, but The Potterers added some random stuff they thought up. As the name mutated to Potter, some ancestor, call him Smart Alec Potter, thought it would be a really funny joke to make all the puns like ‘The Kiln' and started the tradition of Earth based family magic, some of which is useful, the rest of which is just stuff about magical pottery.
