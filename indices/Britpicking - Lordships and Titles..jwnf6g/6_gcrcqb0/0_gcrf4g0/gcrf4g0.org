We tend to say social climber or class jumper. Nouveau Riche is also used, but generally by the old families who resent new money. They consider /everyone/ new money though, not just Kardashian style people but even those with less old titles. So if your great great great grandfather was made a Baron in the 18th century, you'd still be considered new money by the poshest of the British aristocracy. It's utterly ridiculous.

Yes, Malfoy Manor would absolutely not be called as such if the Malfoys were true aristocracy. Houses have their own names, and they are nearly always "house" (as in Highgrove House, where Prince Charles lives) unless they're actually a castle or palace. Never "manor," a manor was originally a term that meant a feudal estate, and the place the owner of that estate lived was generically a "manor house," but that house would have a name that had the suffix "house," or perhaps "place" or "court." Using the suffix "manor" wasn't done until late Victorian times and is absolutely a sign of the nouveau.

Want to make your Malfoy family posh AF? Rename Malfoy Manor as, idk, Oakgrove House or something. Call Draco Viscount Oakgrove. And for heaven's sake, never ever have any of them say "toilet" or "serviette"!
