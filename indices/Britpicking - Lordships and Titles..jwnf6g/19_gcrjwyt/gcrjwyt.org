Wow as someone reading fanfics for awhile and knowing basically zip about Britain or Nobility, this was something I have never thought about. After being a patient person and reading your entire speech (lol), I have to say that I am almost glad most fanfic authors use the wrong style because that is way complicated! I do understand that it is not correct, but to use the correct style the author would have to do an entire note to explain the difference/hierarchy to most readers. By now Lord and Heir is kind of a trope in fanfiction, and it would probably confuse many to switch to correct forms. Thanks for the lesson though ðŸ˜˜
