Oh I know most people will still do Lord and Heir because that's basically now "how it works in the wizard world" and it's fine to do, because it's clearly separate to the muggles.

But I'd just like to see one or two fics that show the author has done some basic research on how it works, because you could get really creative with the names of the Earldoms and stuff. Tbh it's "heir" that pisses me off most, "Lord" is often used colloquially by the media anyway - for example, there's quite a famous former minister called Jeffrey Archer in the UK, and he was given a peerage after leaving politics. He's officially "Baron Archer of Weston-Super-Mare" but the papers always call him "Lord Archer." But I don't think there's a system in the world where the eldest child of a titled aristocrat would be called "Heir [Surname]."

Thank you for sticking all the way through it ðŸ˜‚
