There was also another story that I can't recall the name of, in which harry and his faction plot to get Justin Finch-Fetchley into the magical nobility to increase their numbers due to already being muggle nobility and that being an established way of creating a new, magical noble house. Reveals that he's a Viscount, son of an Earl, and grandson of a Duke.
