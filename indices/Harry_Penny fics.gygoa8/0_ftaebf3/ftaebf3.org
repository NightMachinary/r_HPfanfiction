Penny Haywood is about seven years older than Harry. The only time they would have been at Hogwarts together, she would have been a seventh year taking her NEWTs and Harry would have been a first year. Shipping them would be creepy on several levels.

You'd be better off specifying this as an "after Hogwarts" thing, but by that point, I still doubt they'd be a ship, given how they'd only really have interactions post-Hogwarts when Harry's already got far stronger relationships (romantic or otherwise) with those he's actually grown up around.
