Definitely creepy when she's at Hogwarts. OOTP/HBP after he's been Shazammed, Penny fits into the same sort of plotlines Tonks does. Maybe not as interestingly, but still viable.

  You'd be better off specifying this as an "after Hogwarts" thing, but by that point, I still doubt they'd be a ship, given how they'd only really have interactions post-Hogwarts when Harry's already got far stronger relationships (romantic or otherwise) with those he's actually grown up around.

I take the opposite view. I think with how much crap the studentry put him through, he'd actually have a hard time getting involved with someone he went to school with due to trust issues. He'd always be waiting for them to turn on him the second DP published some bs rumor about him.

IIRC isn't it pretty much just Hermione, Luna, Ginny and the Vixens that never took part in a harassment campaign and he actually spent enough time around to be aware of it?
