You say that it was a small thing? A little reason? There is no such thing as a small, little reason. You say that the world of harry potter and its fanfiction is comforting, but nonetheless not real? It is not so. Here is why, and (hopefully) it will help inspire in others the hope that the work of JK Rowling inspired in you.

The world of fiction is no less real than ours, in this the real world where our senses can be confused, altered, or even taken away, where the laws of reason and science are as ever changing as if they were water in a stream, it is the life if emotion that defines what is real and what is false. The feeling, the emotion, the LIFE, that can be found in these communities, in these books, in these stories. That is real, as real as you and I reading this now. There is no such such thing as a reason too little a hope too small. The struggles, the dreams, the things concieved and concealed within our minds, they are all real. As real as the physical world. Everything from movies, to books, to videogames, to our little daydream fantasies of a better world. All of this is real. "For in dreams we enter a world entirely our own" and if our world is defined as real by the feelings it creates, then who is to say that these stories are not real too?

We mourn the passing of a great repository of fanfiction yes, but that does not mean it is gone. While there are many who have preserved and archived the stories that is not what I mean. These fictions and their authors have painted a world entirely their own, and shown us a glimpse of what that world is like through the written word. Which has in turned created new worlds, new stories, new possibilities in our own minds. Some of these worlds may be very similar, some may share only their roots. But one thing connects them all, they are all real. And they will live on to inspire others to make their own worlds for as long as they are remembered. Now we need only remember, and the world of HarryPotterFanFiction.com will continue still more.
