I use [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Harry%20Potter%20-%20J*d*%20K*d*%20Rowling/works][An Archive of Our Own]]. A lot of authors are there, so you might find some of those favorite gems. Don't forget about the classic [[https://m.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/][FanFiction.Net]]. If you're a Snape/Hermione shipper like me (it's my OTP), there's [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/index.php][Ashwinder]]. They are hosted by [[http://sycophanthex.com][Sycophant Hex]] which is another fan fiction archive.

I completely, completely get how you feel. These sites have a lot of great stories that keep me going. I swear if I read "real books" instead of fan fiction I would have completed so many of my to-read books, but I just can't stop.
