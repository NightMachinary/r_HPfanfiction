Isn't the easier option just to say he didn't care. Not to mention if you disarm someone like Snape then he might resent you. I dislike Snape but I would hate for him to be an enemy. Alternatively an option you fail to consider is that Voldemort knew Snape had questionable loyalties but used him to control the information the order received. The battle of Hogwarts would have been his final victory over the order and so Snape was no longer needed which makes him expendable.
