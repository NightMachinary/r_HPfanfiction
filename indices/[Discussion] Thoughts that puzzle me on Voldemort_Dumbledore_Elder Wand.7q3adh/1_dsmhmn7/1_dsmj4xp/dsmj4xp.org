This was brought up on Tv tropes. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallowsWandDisarmament]]

As mentioned, for the elder wand at least, I think that the person who disarms the other has to really want the wand in order for it to change allegiance so say a practical joke for instance, won't be enough for it to change its master. Not to mention the kids were just practicing dueling (most of the time anyway) and hand the wands back to their original owner afterwards.

However taking a job that would involve a lot of dueling and large possibility of being disarmed, I'd say they did the right thing to snap the wand in the movie.
