I find the whole wand lore/master thing to be very confusing and unnecessary. Dueling is introduced in CoS, so kids were already losing their wand's allegiance back in their second year. What's the point of that? You disarm your friend as a joke and now you've apparently fucked them for decent magic as long as they have that wand. It just seems silly.
