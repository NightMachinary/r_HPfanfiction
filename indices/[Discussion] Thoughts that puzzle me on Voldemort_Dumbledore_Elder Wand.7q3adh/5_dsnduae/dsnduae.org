  Voldemort goes to Grindelwald and finds him alive. He is told Dumbledore was in possession of the wand. (I can not recall if Grindelwald tells him if Dumbledore was the master of it or simply in possession of it)--but this matters not because obviously Voldemort seems to acknowledge Dumbledore as the master of the wand (Hence why he killed Snape because he thought that Snape became the master after killing Dumbledore, where if Voldemort believed Dumbledore wasn't the master because he hadn't killed Grindelwald then all he'd have had to do is kill Grindelwald but he soon came to the conclusion that wasn't the case) So he admits Dumbledore to be the Master of the wand. But he saw Grindelwald alive. So therefore once he acknowledged Dumbledore as the master of said wand, and noticing Grindewald was alive he must have known therefore that you needn't kill, simply disarm, the owner of the wand to gain the allegiance of the wand.

Voldemort presumably believed that there were multiple conditions that must be filled for the wand to transfer ownership. The allegiance of wands was a fickle and esoteric subject. It's possible that he believed killing transferred ownership in some situations but not others - and technically, he'd be entirely correct to believe that. His decision to not kill Snape initially, but to kill him after the wand failed to transfer ownership, was essentially correct. There was only a risk his situation would improve. Snape was a dubious asset at that point in time, and the failure of the wand to transfer could itself be seen as evidence of some sort of treachery.
