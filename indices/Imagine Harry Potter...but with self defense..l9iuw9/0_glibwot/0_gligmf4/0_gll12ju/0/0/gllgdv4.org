Indeed. At least there's that. :)

My only real note on this is that I don't think it would really make much difference. The people who fought already were decent at fighting, and equipping the people who didn't probably wouldn't make them any more likely to do so. Canonically, most of the Ministry can't even cast a shield charm (hence why the Hats sold by the Weasleys were so successful) or a Patronus (which the DA learned pretty easily, implying that the other Wizards just never bothered to put that level of effort in) so I highly doubt the vaguely indolent Wizards would put all that much effort into learning martial arts either.
