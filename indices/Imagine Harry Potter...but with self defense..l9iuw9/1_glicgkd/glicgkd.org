I agree that more physical elements would make magical duel more realistic and interesting. You can make it even easier to introduce. There is almost certainly someone in the Order who knew physical self-defence techniques, and it was taught to the children during the holidays to keep them busy and tire them out as much as anything else. I would be careful though of making it a 'wonder power' that solves all problems. Given the usefulness of dodging spells, werewolves and possibly other 'dark creatures' needing to get close and Godric Gryffindor being famous for wielding a sword that those trained to fight, i.e. Aurors and elite Death Eaters, are used to these tactics. Given the fact that Harry and co. even by book 7 are not fully physically developed, it adds a new dimension to the fighting without being a superpower. Unless they take their opponent completely by surprise, so in your examples possibly if they are not expecting resistance, or they are utterly incompetent like the snatchers.
