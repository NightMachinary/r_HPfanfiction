The Golden Trio definitely learn physical self defence (and computer hacking, and a bunch of other skills) in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822-1/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]. Instead of a magic school, "Harworts" is training the next generation of MI-6 agents, who are noticeably smarter and sneakier than canon as a result. But "Lord Deathstrike" has gotten his hands on a cache of unusual technology, and is working to take over the Ministry; they're going to have to track down all of his memory backups before he'll be gone for good.

It's a complete rewrite of canon with magic being neatly replaced by Bond-style technology, set in a larger multiversal crossover (but this one's a prequel, so it works fine as a stand-alone story).
