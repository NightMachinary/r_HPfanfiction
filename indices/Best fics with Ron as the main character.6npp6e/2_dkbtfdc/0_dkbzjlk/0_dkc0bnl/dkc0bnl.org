Well, i actually thought that "possessiveness" was attributed to a certain amount of PTSD that they all have. And harry did support Ron, doesn't mean he wasn't sad about him leaving. But I can see your point about the fic being melodramatic, it kind of takes all the best and worst things that cancer literature has to offer. I found it hard to finish it because it gets a bit too much.
