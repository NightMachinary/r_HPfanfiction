I tried to read Stay Standing before and I thought it was a bit rough. Harry and Hermione act weirdly possessive of Ron. I think if he wanted to go off on his own for a year for a training program they'd both miss him but be very supportive that Ron was taking the initative. It rather ignores some of Ron's flaws too. Magic cancer gets kind of melodramatic too.

Reading it I kind of wish it was just about him going off on his own for an auror thing minus the illness. I feel like some time on his own proving to himself he can stand on his own without Ron and Hermione or his family would do him a world of good.

It's at least pro-Ron though. I also actually remember it and got pretty far into it so its engaging in its own way.
