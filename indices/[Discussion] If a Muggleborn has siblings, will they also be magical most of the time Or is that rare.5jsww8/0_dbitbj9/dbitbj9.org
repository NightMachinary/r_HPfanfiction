As far as Madam Rowling's word goes, muggleborns are all descendants of squib lines and are only considered muggleborns rather than something like “squibborns” because usually enough time passed between the squib in question and the muggleborn down the line that none of them remembers about magic anymore.

As such, I believe that there is some factor in play that leads to the reemergence of magic (like crossing of two squib lines, rather than a squib and a muggle) and that for as long as this happens the chance for each kid to be magical is fairly high, high enough to make Petunia an outlier. That said, this is just my guess, and we really do not have enough data to conclusively say how it truly is.
