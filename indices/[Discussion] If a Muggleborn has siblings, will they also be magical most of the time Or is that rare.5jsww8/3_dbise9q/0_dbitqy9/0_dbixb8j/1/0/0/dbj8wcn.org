I've been looking too, but the only thing I found was this in the HP wikia:

" Colin had a younger brother named Dennis, who was also a wizard, an unusual thing to occur for two magical offspring to come from Muggle parents. "

I don't lik the HP wikia. I'ts often not accurate, and sure enough, I can't find a source for this "unusual" business.
