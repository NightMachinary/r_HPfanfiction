I never wrote it but i may play around with it. It would be hermione or another muggleborn learning her father isn't her actual father, potentially after the real father telling her during a torture session in the malfoy manor. Later, after it was all over, harry or another bff would point out that just because their dad isn't their bio dad, he's still her real dad because he chose to trust her mom didn't cheat, he chose to raise her as his own, chose to BE her dad. And a father and/or mother that elects to raise a nongenetic child is a better person than a bio dad who just follows some genetic imperative.
