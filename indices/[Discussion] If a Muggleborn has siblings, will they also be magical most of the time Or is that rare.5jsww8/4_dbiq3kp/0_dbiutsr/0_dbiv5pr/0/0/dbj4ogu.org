Huh, in that situation I wouldn't be insecure about the dad who raised me, I'd be wondering if I should hurt my mom by telling her that she was raped and magic erased her memory of it. (I know people who didn't tell their parents after they were raped because they didn't want their parents to be devastated for them... I can't imagine telling your mom that SHE was raped.) And also I'd be freaking out about possible genetic predisposition for evil. To each their own, but I feel like paternity fraud would not be the greatest concern in that situation.
