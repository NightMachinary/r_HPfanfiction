My thought is very simple: Not enough data. Frankly, other than Justin Finch-Fletchly, pre-death Moaning Myrtle and Penelope Clearwater, I can't think of a single other muggleborn by name (since Dean Thomas never knew his birth father, we don't know about him), and none of them are important enough for their family situations to be discussed often.
