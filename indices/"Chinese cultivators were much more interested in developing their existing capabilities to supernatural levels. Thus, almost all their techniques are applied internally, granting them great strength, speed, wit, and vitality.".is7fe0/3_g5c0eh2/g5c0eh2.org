I don't think it works well with canon at all. The canonical wizarding world is a single global community of wizards who have been working closely together since at least the 1600s. Logically, different traditions of magic should spread and compete with each other, with wizards adopting the techniques which are the most effective. By the modern era, you would expect magic to have largely standardised across the world, in much the same way that the Muggle world has adopted the industrial revolution, replacing their traditional industries with modern industry.

And that's what we seem to get in canon. We know that Japanese wizards use wands. We know that Native American wizards did not use wands but that wand use is now standard in North America. There's even mixing of magical creatures: Lupin introduces Kappas in POA, a magical creature of Japanese origin.

In particular, the idea that immortality magic is out there in China and Voldemort never learnt it because it's from a different part of the world is kinda absurd.
