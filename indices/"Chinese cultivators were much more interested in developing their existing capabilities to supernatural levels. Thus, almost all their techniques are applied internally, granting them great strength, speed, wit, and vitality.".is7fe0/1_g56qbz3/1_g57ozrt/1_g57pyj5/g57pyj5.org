Sure, I mean, technically? That's more likely due to there being a number of other large countries between China and Rome, including the Parthian Empire and India.

And as I said, Magic kind of mitigates that issue. You can travel directly between very large distances in virtually no time. Even flying carpets and brooms are orders of magnitude better transport than caravans.

Check out the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Roman_Relations][Wikipedia page on Roman Chinese relations]]. If you base things solely on their mythology, which crystallised much earlier (ostensibly in the Bronze Age Collapse or in Early Hellenistic times, for Rome at least), you might be right, but they basically had embassies in each other's countries. We don't import culture from countries which are far away from us without a large amount of people moving back and forth, which again, is probably aided dramatically by adding magic to the mix.
