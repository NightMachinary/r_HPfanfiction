While super interesting, it does speak to a somewhat common misconception in history. China and Rome weren't isolated from each other in the real world. Going back to the Greeks, and Alexander the Great, there was certainly trade between the regions through Mesopotamia and the Silk Road, and Chinese Silk was a precious commodity to rich Romans.

To suggest that there is no chance of cultural exchange would need some measure of justification. Even groups that are actively at war with each other try and steal each other's secrets, and with magic, travel is much less a burden than for regular people, since they are able to cross vast distances in an instant.
