An asexual/aromantic character would not put me off reading, but it would seem to be unnecessary if all you want to do is not write about sexuality. Because obviously going into detail about the MC's asexuality is still talking about sexuality.

There are plenty of fics where romance/sex just doesn't play a role. Sure, if you were writing a coming of age story with a YA tone then it might be odd if you didn't address sexuality at all. But if you're telling a mystery, or an action-adventure, or a war story... then you can just not write about it because the characters are busy doing other stuff.

Hell, that is largely the direction canon took.
