I may be in minority here, but I can totally see relating to such a fic, as I somewhat identify myself in ace category. I've been specifically looking at tags in AO3, with "asexual character" or "asexual Harry" or "demisexual character" to look for more stories in this category. There aren't many, but ones that are there are pretty good fics. These fics explore relationships where only one person is asexual. I thought it was interesting.

I really dig Aromantic fics where sex or romance is pretty much background or non-existent. Many of the Top fics in the fandom are Gen fics, so if your story has content, I think it will shine.

WRT to Drinking or other 'teenage activities', I feel like it depends on you, are you going to Americanize your fiction (I've no problem with that) or make it more British? Or are you going to stick with trend of British Children/Teenage Authors, and make the fics more conservative? Maybe I'm wrong, but I've read quite a lot of British Children's /Teenage Books (having not grown up in America) and they tend to be pretty conservative and more idyllic. Just a perspective from someone who's neither British nor American..
