Honestly making a MC asexual in a HP fic would make me more inclined to read it. Im not ace and normally I love shipping but in HP fics im much more interested in plot and a ship especially one i dont think is well done (whether i ship it or not) distracts from that and can be frustrating and can ruin a story that I actually did like the plot of.

And btw even though Im not ace I was very uninterested in dating as a teen and had very few crushes and none of them were ones i felt particularily passionate over. And I dont think thats all that weird as a teen alot of people dont really get interested in dating until their 20s while some start in their early teens it just depends on the individual if they arent ace. My grade was mostly girls. So it wasnt uncommon to not have a boyfriend so maybe there was less peer pressure to have one. Maybe there was more pressure if you were a guy idk. Not that gay people were non existent or that the school environnent was particulatily homophobic but most werent really open about it till college.

As for the teenage drinking I didnt really drink till I got to college. I was pretty introverted tho and in the states the drinking age is 21. So drinking as a teen in highschool in my experience was something that happened at bigger parties not casual hangouts and bigger parties I avoided. While in college casual drinking while hanging out even if you arent 21 isnt all that weird especially if you have 1 of your friend group that is 21+. Personally I never felt super pressured to drink but again i was still more of the kind to have small get togethers where you binge shows play videogames and board games in your apartment than go to big parties. So i guess consider what your MC would prefer.
