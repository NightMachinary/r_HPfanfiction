To me, if you write a story well, it doesn't matter what the character's sexuality or romantic status is.

This type of thing is easier in a 3rd person and harder in a 1st person. 3rd person gives you some distance from the character in question, and you can say "the focus of the story is not on sex/romance so what I choose to show isn't going to touch on those things."

1st person on the other hand..I think you would have to at least skirt those topics, even if it's only something on the lines of "gee. Everyone else around me is talking about this stuff constantly, how do I feel about it?" because teens are constantly questioning themselves.

This isn't to say that you cannot do it, just that it is going to be difficult and require a lot of thought on your part.
