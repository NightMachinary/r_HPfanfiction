Asexuality exists!! Any questions you may have have probably been answered in [[/r/asexuality][r/asexuality]] at some point or another, including straight up confusion about why the fuck everyone else is shagging but you feel like you missed the memo.

Generally, there are PLENTY of plots that don't require a bedroom scene - so write what you feel like writing (and send me the link, because I only felt comfortable using the label asexual after reading a fanfiction with an asexual character in it and I'd love to read another)
