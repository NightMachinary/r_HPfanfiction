This may be TMI, but I'm gonna input my personal experience and feelings on the subject. I'm a 19 year old virgin and while I have attraction towards people, I rarely feel sexually attracted because I associate sexual attraction with trust. I cannot see myself have sex with anyone unless I've known and trusted and loved them (platonically included) for at least 3-4 years probably more. Right now I would only ever had sex with my best friend, who I've known for almost 8 years, but I am not attracted to her at all. This being said, I am openly bisexual, so I find men and women attractive. In high school a few of my close friends had regular sex, one had casual sex once, and the rest of us are barely virgins now in college (except me). No one ever gave me any slack for it and I never judged anyone for having sex. In regards to a fanfic I would see it reasonable to have little to no romance or for a main character they could be like me. For example "Harry thought Cho was beautiful and he had a crush on her. Eventually they start dating, but are not involved sexually because Harry isn't ready" you could end it there, make it never start, or have the characters grow so that Harry eventually does trust someone. Anyways, spiel over and good luck!
