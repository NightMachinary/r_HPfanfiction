Having no romance or sexual themes in a story is ok, even desirable in many cases - if you're not writing a story that is about everything and covering large timespans or explicitly a story about romance it doesn't need to be included whatsoever.

But having the character be shifted into some nieche sexual orientation just to avoid writing romance? Naah. First of all, if you aren't exploring it, there is no point in mentioning it. And if you're exploring it, then it's not the kind of fic i'd like to read because i'm not interested in other people sexual +deviancies+ preferences.\\
And on a technical note, having the MC be asexual isn't going to kill romance in a story, unless everyone is asexual. Better to just not write about that stuff.
