I'd give you a medal if you wrote a story that had interesting plot and no romance. It feels like you sort of have to want to see romance and particularly explicit sex in a story, and if you don't, you are in a minority. Ithink it would not even be necessary to make your mc asexual, a choice of genre would allow you to avoid this topic altogether. Best stories I've read, even if they had romance in them, had no explicit sex because authors found other things to include in them. There are so many other things to write about and so many kinds of relationships to explore! It's explicit sex I find [[https://offputting.It][offputting.It]]'s like, I know it's happening, but I don't need to know every single detail. Classic novels had romance in them and still somehow managed to be good without being explicit.
