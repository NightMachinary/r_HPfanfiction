It's different for everyone, but one of my favourite fics (not Harry Potter) just happens to have two asexual protagonists. The author doesn't make a fuss about it, but it is tagged that way.

I prefer non-sexual stories but if a story is well-written I'll read it anyway, while a badly written story without sex won't interest me. The quality of the writing takes priority but I do enjoy reading stories without sex where I can.
