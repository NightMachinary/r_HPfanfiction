All I can say, if you don't want to write about sexuality, just don't write about it. I have read many K+ or T rated stories that did not cross into that subject in 200k+ words, and I liked them. But I do prefer fics that include sexuality, maybe even explicit. But if the author is uncomfortable writing it, the scenes will just come out bad.

On the other hand, the few fics I read where the asexuality of the MC was made a subject of the story, I dropped. Simply because the subject is so far out for me, I could not identify with it at all. And every line the author spent writing about it, trying to explain it, made it worse. Maybe that is just me, and I can't really explain it. I mean, I am straight but some of my absolute favorite fics are explicitly slash. Yet asexual MC's are a straight up "no thanks" from me.

And teenage drinking? I never in 18 years of reading HP fanfiction thought "mhh, this story is unrealistic, they don't drink at all!". So, don't get hung up on what some people feel must be included to make the story realistic. If drinking and masturbation are not mentioned in the story, that does not mean they don't happen at Hogwarts.
