I strongly agree with your last point. After all, should you write about every time a character goes to the bathroom, or brushes their teeth, or showers, or eats? Sometimes reviewers ask authors about those things, as if by omitting them the author is saying that they never happen. But wouldn't it be much stranger to read a fic where, for no reason related to the plot, the MC's hygiene is discussed?

I think things like drinking, masturbation, and sex can be like hygiene: they are understood to probably be happening somewhere, but just aren't relevant to the story.
