Before I answer your questions it's important for me to say that the point of fanfiction is to express how you feel. What other people think of those topics is less important than your need/want to express them.

About asexuality - it really depends on the plot and how well the story is written. Usually I search for specific ships and read how the characters develop a sexual and romantic relationship, but I don't mind reading a story involving a ship I'm not into or a story where the character isn't in a sexual/romantic relationship at all if the plot is interesting, like a mystery or an adventure story. Something thrilling.

People can also be ace/aro and in relationships. If you wrote about queerplatonic relationships or about nonsexual bdsm I would really enjoy reading that.

About alcohol - drinking alcohol isn't necessarily a big part of adolescence. Some teenagers don't drink. Some of them drink a bit of wine sometimes. It doesn't have to be a dramatic thing where they get really drunk at parties. I think it's not okay that people are judging you for not wanting to mention alcohol in your fics. I don't have an opinion for or against teenagers drinking so I don't care if you write about it or not.
