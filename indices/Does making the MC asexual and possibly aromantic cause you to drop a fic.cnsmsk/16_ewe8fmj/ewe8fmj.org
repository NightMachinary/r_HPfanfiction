Absolutely not. I prefer it, being somewhere between aro and ace myself. I can appreciate a good romance subplot, but it doesn't really seem as important to me as I know most other readers consider it.

I don't drink, nor do any of my acquaintances, nor have I been part of any such circle when I was younger, so it is a non-issue for me personally.
