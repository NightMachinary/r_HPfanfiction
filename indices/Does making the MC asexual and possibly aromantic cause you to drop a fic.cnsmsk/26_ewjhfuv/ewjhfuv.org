Nope. For me, it depends on the character and the fandom and if the author makes it feel plausible for the character. I've read a few good James Bond fics where 007 is ace and it feels very plausible because of how it's written. But that's pretty much my standard for any pairing, trope, plot twist or kink. Write it well and I'll probably stick with you. Write it poorly and I'm back-buttoning out.
