If you're going to write an asexual character, write it as if the audience already knows that they're asexual. You don't need to shove it down the reader's throats. Just... don't have sexual situations. If they encounter conflict because of it - i.e. their romantic partner wants to get intimate, you can naturally address it then by having the character simply say no. You don't need to have them explicitly say "I'm asexual" - especially since the awareness of that is a relatively recent, post-internet phenomenon that wizards wouldn't really be aware of in the 90's. But even if they don't explicitly come out and say it, people can just not want sex.

Because sex is like tea; British teenagers probably want both, but sometimes, they're just not thirsty.
