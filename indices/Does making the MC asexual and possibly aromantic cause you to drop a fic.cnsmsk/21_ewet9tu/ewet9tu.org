The only time I could see asexuality as something relevant to the plot would be if you were doing some sort of marriage contract or other romantic storyline.

Generally you can just not talk about sex or sexuality, it doesn't come off as false or poor writing. Generally everything on the page should relate in someway to your plot, whether it's directly part of it or simply has an influence on it at some point.

For example in an action heavy independent Harry fic, a good reason for him to have a romantic partner is for that person to be kidnapped or to betray him at some point in the story. Another good reason is to give him someone he can expose or explain his inner thoughts or motivations to, effectively they act as an audience proxy to understand the main characters actions. But you could accomplish these goals with a friend or a mentor, just as well as with a romantic partner.
