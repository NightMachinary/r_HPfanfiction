I'm not a big fan of the teens obsessed with sex and sexuality stories. Maybe because I haven't been a teen for 15 years.

I've read stories where the MC just /is/ asexual with no issue. It's when the plot stops so a chartacter can make a 2000 word speach about their sexuality, regardless of what letter it is, that I nope out of the story. When it's obviously the entire story is just an excuse for the author to preach to the reader about how horrible they are for not knowing the difference between all the letters in the soup. I mean seriously, I don't know what the difference between pansexual and bisexual is, and I don't care.
