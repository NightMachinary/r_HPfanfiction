An asexual MC wouldn't cause me to drop a fic, no. It might even make me more interested in reading it, just to see what the fic says about this. Asexuals don't exactly get a lot of representation in media. (I really liked the Archie comics reboot explicitly making Jughead asexual.)

When it comes to teenage drinking... meh. It happens, I mean it happens a LOT. But you don't have to include it in a story about teenagers. In my experience it's far MORE detrimental to a story to force a lot of sex and drinking into a story where sex and drinking doesn't fit, just because the protagonist is a teenager.
