Write how you feel the character should be. It would make it more realistic than being forced into a stereotype.

I'm usually excited about asexual characters in stories as I identify with them. I avoid stories solely based on romance and skip sexual scenes in all stories.

However I prefer it if the character is subtle about their realisations. I have rarely seen anyone IRL openly admit that they are asexual and find it jarring if they are the type of people who carry banners claiming "I am asexual!!!!" (Though this could be because I am from a conservative society where any talk of sexuality is frowned upon.)

I crossed my teen years without even seeing alcohol though I am quite sure my male peers would have had alcohol in their parties. Again I think it is simply a cultural difference - a woman drinking is judged much more harshly than men.
