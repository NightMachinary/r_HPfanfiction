I usually don't care too much about romance and more about plot.

I'd happily read a fic without any romance if there's something else interesting going on.

The first few canon books didn't have any romance at all and they were just fine.

Just don't have the character being asexual their only defining character trait that they start every conversation with. You don't even have to mention it, it's probably best to just subtly imply things like this unless it becomes plot relevant.
