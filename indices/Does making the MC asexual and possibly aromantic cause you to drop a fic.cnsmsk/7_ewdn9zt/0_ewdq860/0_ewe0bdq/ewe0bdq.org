That's absolutely true, the author should consider such things (depending on what kind of story they want to tell). In a coming of age story a character with low/absent libido would have some different experiences than their peers, might experience moments of emotional conflict, self doubt, etc. but those differences don't have to be the defining core of their personality.

During that same period of their life the character would have plenty of other interests/goals for the plot to focus on. An asexual person is a person like anyone else in that regard.

What I'm trying to get at is that you don't have to treat an asexual character the way Hollywood often treats sexual minorities in film/television. Film/TV writers often create token representations of sexual minorities that emphasize their differences, thus leading to unrealistic sterotypes rather than just presenting the characters as people with the same range of lifestyles, skills and goals as anyone else while incidentally happening to have different partner preferences.
