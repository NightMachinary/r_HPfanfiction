I think a large part of it would come down to "show, don't tell." For me, it'd be interesting to read a fic with an asexual or aromantic MC, showing how that impacts their adolescence, self, and relationships, as long as it wasn't full of chapters of first person inner-dialogue or heavy-handed conversations explicitly bringing it up at every turn. It could seem normal and natural to the MC experiencing it, because it's their own internal experience, and exploring how that interacts or conflicts with the sexual and romantic norms and expectations of their peers would be really interesting.

I'm not sure I would be able to infer that a character was deliberately written as asexual if the fic just never mentioned romance or sex, so it seems like a fine line between making it an intentional writing point and making it the overarching focus of the plot.

Edit: I mean to say that it could be an implicit or explicit feature of the story, but it would ideally be written in a way that doesn't break immersion in the story itself, which is just a facet of good writing in general.
