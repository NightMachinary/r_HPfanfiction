It's not wrong to want to write a story that doesn't involve sex or romance, but just avoiding the topic altogether is not writing an asexual character.

If the character is asexual that is going to affect their motivations, how they interpret other people's actions, how they interact with other people, etc. For example, in a setting like Hogwarts, an asexual character is going to see people around them start pairing up as they get older but they won't experience the attractions that are driving that. They may feel pressure to be in relationships because they've absorbed the idea from the culture around them that that's what is normal, and that may increase the older they get.

If the writer is making a conscious decision to make a character asexual they need to consider these kinds of things.
