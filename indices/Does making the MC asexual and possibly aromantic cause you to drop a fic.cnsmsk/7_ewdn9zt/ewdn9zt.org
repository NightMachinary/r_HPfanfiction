  people often talk about how unrealistic it is for teenagers not to feel sexual attraction, have sex, and engage in sexual relationships.

I often see people use this as a justification /for/ having teenage promiscuity in a fic (i.e. "teenagers often have sex in real life, so there should be nothing inherently wrong with depicting such acts in a story, even though laws and subreddit rules forbid it"). But I've never seen anyone claim that /lacking/ sexual urges at that age is unrealistic.

The reality is that human beings naturally have a wide range of libidos. Not every teenager is a horndog, and many have a less active or absent libido even without identifying as asexual. Considering the popularity of "gen" fics without romance, you are not going to offend anyone by choosing to have an protagonist not interested in sex/romance.

If you are going to write a story with an asexual protagonist, then I'd prefer that you just show that character's personality through the story without posting a big neon sign over their sexuality. If they have a low/absent libido , then it's likely that other parts of their life (interactions with friends and enemies, goals, things they are good at and things they struggle with) are going to be more important to their central identity than sex. Thus, I think you would do the character more justice if you thought of them as a person for whom their sexuality is incidental rather than their sexuality being some guiding force that the whole plot needs to fit around.
