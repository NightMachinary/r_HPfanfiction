I mean, if you don't want to write it, don't write it. There are plenty of stories that exist without sexual/romantic themes and many more than never even have anyone drinking in it.

Personally, I don't want to read stories that are straight-up romances or too smutty. I like the story to be about other things, fighting bad guys, dealing with loss of family, building an unlikely friendship under interesting circumstances, ect. If there's a romantic subplot or a dash of drinking here and there in expected situations (a party, a bar), I'm cool with it, but it's not what's compelling to me. Never has been.

Truthfully, I don't actually think anyone's going to get critical because your teenage characters aren't crushing on each other or others or aren't having dirty thoughts. If there's plenty else going on, they probably won't even notice it's lacking.

Admittedly, a lot of my stories have some romantic/sexual elements and drinking too. There's also some delving into even darker topics too. Yet there's never more written than I feel comfortable writing. If anyone were to complain to me about it lacking romance or smut or anything else I would honestly tell them that they may want to go looking for a different story to read because that's not something I'm going to force more of into my stuff.

I do want to caution about using tags like asexual!Harry or such, though, because doing so may cause people to expect some kind of delving into that topic or the experience of being asexual or aromantic and they might be a bit upset if there is none of that exploration or just mentions of them dealing with the issues that arise from their lack of feelings for anyone.
