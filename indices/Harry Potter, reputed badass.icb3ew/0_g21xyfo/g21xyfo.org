You know, I feel like this is surprisingly rare. Seems to me that even fics that have a powerful/badass Harry often do not have him being widely known for it - it's more like he just developed his skill and so it's something new that his enemies are still learning. Training montage power up, time travel, dimension travel, that sort of thing.

Even so, I really ought to be able to think of some better examples than these, but here they are:

Linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon) has a bit of this. A little ways into the story it becomes publicly known that Harry, with Sirius providing support, defeated Voldemort in a duel. There's a scene later where Harry is faced with something like two dozen Death Eaters who are clearly intimidated. He fights his way through them and ends up routing them.

Linkffn(Contractual Invalidation by R-dude) - Only one small part of the fic is really relevant to the request. The last fifth or so of chapter 6. Harry and Daphne are ambushed by 8 or so mercenaries and after a brief conversation it's the mercenaries who are the more nervous ones.

Linkffn(12381694) - This is a series of unrelated one-shots set in the same universe as the previous fic. In the first one, Harry and Daphne corner a couple that has something they need. Harry's reputation as being both honorable and badass is a large part of convincing them to surrender, despite the fact that one of the couple is an international dueling champion.
