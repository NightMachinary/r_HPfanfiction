I read Contractual Invalidation recently and enjoyed it. but there are two things I'd preface a recommendation with. One, the Daphne in it is /nothing/ like the common fanon interpretation. She's very much a pureblood elite in it. And two, Harry comes off as /incredibly manipulative/. Uncomfortably so at times. But the payoff was amazing in my opinion. So it's a fic I do recommend as well.
