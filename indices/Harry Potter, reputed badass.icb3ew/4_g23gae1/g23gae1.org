Starfox5 typically has badass trio with competent not bashed other characters. For example Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) has badass Hermione as main character with her own badass muggleborn group similar to the DA being extremely dangerous and feared, Harry and Ron are badass fighters trained by Moody and Dumbledore, and the Umbridge bashing is taken a bit too literally.
