A big part of canon Umbridge "charm" comes from the fact that she is the perfect blend between "evil" and "believable". She is the abusive teacher, the superior who takes pleasure into tormenting you.

By trying to make Umbridge "worse" (let's say by making her a pedophil as an example), fanfics authors take the risk of losing this believable part. And without it, Umbridge is just another caricatural vilain, and a pretty average one at that, that would fall short compared to a big one like Voldemort.
