Part of me thinks that the reason fans (esp. female fans) are drawn to "bad boy" characters within their fandom is because there are so many people who purposefully write bad boy characters as charming.

I'm reminded of Zuko from A:TLA. Genuinely a dick at first, though most of that was related to being the scapegoat child of a narcissistic, abusive asshole. (Not a professional diagnosis, just a personality descriptor.) But the writers had 1) always planned a redemption arc for him, so we are consistently given little moments where we are shown that he isn't what he seems; 2) many of us remember Rufio from Hook with great fondness, and 3) besides redemption arc moments, Zukois s also more relatable than the true villains of A:TLA. He's awkward and shy and impatient. Since Zuko does, in the end, join the good guys, it's understandable that people are rooting for him.

I think we're optimistic, as human beings; and I'd like to think most fans of Draco wanted him to be... well, Zuko. It's possible to write Draco like this if you remove him from his canon bad influences very early on in his development, but that's an AU type that very few people have done well. The Dangerverse manages it, but there are a host of other factors involved as well in that one. (I'd be interested in other fics that remove Draco from his racist upbringing early on, if any of you have them. ðŸ‘€)

My conclusion in this observation is that it's possible to take a bad boy character and redeem him without changing his fundamental personality; but I agree with you that the majority of ficwriters do it very poorly. If you want to do it well, watch A:TLA. Also because it's the best TV show ever written, but that's besuee the point.
