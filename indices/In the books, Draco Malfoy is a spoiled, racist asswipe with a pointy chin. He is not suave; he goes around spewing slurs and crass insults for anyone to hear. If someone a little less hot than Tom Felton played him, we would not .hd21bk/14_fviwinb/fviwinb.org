I disagree. I haven't even seen all the movies (I still haven't watched the second half of the sixth and I haven't even touched 7 part 1) and I don't particularly like them, plus I don't think the actor that plays Draco is all that attractive.

I'm just a sucker for bad characters because I like writing and reading redemption arcs. Sue me.

And yes, it's unrealistic for Draco to get a redemption arc while still at Hogwarts (not that that should stop anyone from writing it if they want to) but considering he's 17-18 when the books end - a /kid/ - and he's just gone through a pretty traumatic war, imagining him getting a redemption arc after that isn't really all that outlandish.
