Sorry, of the two good Draco redemptions that spring to mind, one starts with him slightly OOC and goes from there, and the other starts his redemption arc pre-Hogwarts, so he never really acts like canon (although his older brother tends to fill that role). Both are great stories, but not quite what you asked for.
