linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) has a decent Draco redemption arc, overshadowed by a /great/ Snape redemption.

linkffn(Innocent by Marauderlover7) has Draco with an older brother. So, their father decides that Draco is a spare, and puts him through behavioral conditioning to make him suited to Gryffindor, in order to hedge his bets and get a foot in the door if Harry turns out to be important. And he doesn't tell Draco he's doing it.
