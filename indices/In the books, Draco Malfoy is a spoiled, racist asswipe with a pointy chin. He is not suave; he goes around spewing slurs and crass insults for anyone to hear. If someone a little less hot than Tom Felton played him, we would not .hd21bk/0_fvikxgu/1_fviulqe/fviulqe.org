Precisely because it didn't feel like either, it makes for such a good starting point for fanfictions. You can take Draco in that nebulous state and go anywhere with him in a fanfiction. There's quite a bit of creative freedom there, while other characters are more restricted by canon.

I like to read fanfictions about Draco because he's a gray character that has some very deep flaws and is in a lot of trouble. I don't mind him being paired up with someone if it's done well, but I'd just as well read genfic about him.
