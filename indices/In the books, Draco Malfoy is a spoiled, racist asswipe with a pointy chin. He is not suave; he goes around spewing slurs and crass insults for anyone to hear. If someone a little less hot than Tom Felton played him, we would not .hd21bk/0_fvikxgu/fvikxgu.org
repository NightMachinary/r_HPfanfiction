In the spirit of this post having a point, rec me some fics where Draco behaves like canon Draco. But he either gets his just desserts or has an actual redemption arc (which for God's sake does NOT mean you hook him up with Hermione; in fact it probably means he dies); in canon his character is in such a nebulous state at the end. I don't know if I'm supposed to be angry he didn't die or feel like he redeemed himself. It doesn't feel like either.
