Sorry, but I doubt that anyone on [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] (who doesn't already hate Draco, like most of the sub does) will read this post and go, “You're absolutely right. Insulting this character has lead me to the shocking revelation that he's not as much of a sexy bad boy as I thought he was. I only liked him for his actor, anyway.”

It's fanfiction of a children's book series. Live and let live.
