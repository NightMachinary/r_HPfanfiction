Exactly. Also when it comes to male characters that interact with Harry and are of similar age the only other person that gets more “screen time” within the book is Ron.

Canon Malfoy is an annoying brat but canon Malfoy is basically an OC that can be anything you want. A lot of people really like the rival dynamic and the whole “different House forbidden romance”. And since Slytherin!Harry stories are popular it makes sense that Draco ships are popular especially within slash.

The same thing can also be said about Draco/Hermione ships as well
