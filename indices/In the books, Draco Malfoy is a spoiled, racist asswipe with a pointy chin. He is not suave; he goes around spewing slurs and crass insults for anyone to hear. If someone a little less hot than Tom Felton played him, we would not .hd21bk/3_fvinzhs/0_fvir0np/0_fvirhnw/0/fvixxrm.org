Yeah I was in the HP4GU group (I was like 12 lol), and was *deeply* into fan fic in this era. It's actually been really interesting to see how fanfic trends have evolved in the 20 years I've been reading. It used to be so black and white with characterisation, and shipping, and I guess in some cases it still is, but it's really hard to get across how... intense this era was.

Also was a stage where I didn't even need fanfic because the fandom drama was just so entertaining. Now there's no fandom drama and I've become a fanfic snob. I miss being 15 and being a petty little shit in forums over shipping.
