Yeah, there's definitely a world of difference between Draco and Joffrey. Joffrey is straight up monstrous, and would be no matter what. Draco's just a product of his environment, even said product is still a shit person.

And yeah, the HP4GU era fics often killed off or bashed Ron, before the movies started or when the cast was still too young for any of them to be attracted to (I should hope, anyway). Pretty!Hermione (also known as sue!Hermione and, less flatteringly, Homione at various points in fandom history) also predates Emma Watson growing up. While the cast impacts fandom today, most of the common tropes we're so familiar with today originated with those early fics.
