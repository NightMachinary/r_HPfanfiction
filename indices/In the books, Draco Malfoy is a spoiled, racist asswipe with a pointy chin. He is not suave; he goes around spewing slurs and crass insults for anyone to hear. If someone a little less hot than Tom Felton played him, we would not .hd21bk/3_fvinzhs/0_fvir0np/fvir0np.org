Agreed. Was part of the fandom then and the sexualisation and romanticising of Draco has been going on for as long as I can remember. Also Ron bashing has been going on long before Rupert Grint was a thing.

I was a straight, female young teenager then and didn't get it. Am a straight, female adult now and still don't get it. Draco's been an unattractive little shit for 20 years in my books.

I will say there's a difference between Draco and Joffrey. Draco has room for redemption. Joffrey is actually a sadistic psychopath. Draco is a discriminatory, bullying, spoilt kid who proved himself incapable of murdering anyone. Joffrey brutally kills a prostitute with a mace for... pleasure? And redemption arcs are fun. In saying that I'm not interested, because I find Draco pathetic, but each to their own.
