Have read the books but so long ago I've conflated the two in my head. From memory the show definitely upped the sadism side of Joffrey, but he was still an irredeemable little psycho even in the books alone.

Draco took glee in the thought of torture before he'd ever witnessed it, and certainly can't imagine him inflicting it after he understood the reality of it. I work with teenage boys. They want to shoot and kill and torture everyone who does anything they don't like, and relish in it. But in 99.9% of cases it's because they don't have the maturity to grasp what torturing and murdering actually is in real life.
