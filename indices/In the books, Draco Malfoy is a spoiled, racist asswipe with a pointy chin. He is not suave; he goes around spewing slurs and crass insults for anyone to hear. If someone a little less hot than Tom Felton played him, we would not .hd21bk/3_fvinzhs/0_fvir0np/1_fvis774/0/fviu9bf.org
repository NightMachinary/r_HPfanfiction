Maybe. As a teacher I work with a lot of kids who are the most entitled little shits, whose parents think they can do no wrong, and have never been disciplined in their life. They've been told from day for they're the best at anything they do and they can do anything they want.

They're shitheads. But they're also mostly not sadistic psychopaths.

I will also say I work with a kid who's the product of incest and he actually is kinda a psychopath so basically don't fuck your sibling/cousin friends.
