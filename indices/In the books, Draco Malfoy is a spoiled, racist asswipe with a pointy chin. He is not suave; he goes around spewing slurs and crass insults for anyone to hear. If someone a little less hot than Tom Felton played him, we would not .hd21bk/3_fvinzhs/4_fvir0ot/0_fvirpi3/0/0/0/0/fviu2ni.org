The one about the Valentine killing the bird (falcon? Eagle? I haven't read TMI in a long time). Jace is very similar to Draco in the Draco Trilogy in general, though the rest of the cast is different - no one could compare Isabelle to Hermione, and who the hell would Magnus' counterpart be? But you can definitely see her Harry Potter fandom past in Jace.
