The major fic writers were generally grown ups, like Cassie Claire. MsScribe even claimed to work for Joe Biden and to have kids of her own, if I remember correctly - obviously she was lying through her teeth, because this is MsScribe we're talking about, but the fact that people believed her when she claimed it shows that adults with jobs weren't uncommon. You've got a point about the Stranger Things fandom, but Draco Trilogy still predates the first movie.
