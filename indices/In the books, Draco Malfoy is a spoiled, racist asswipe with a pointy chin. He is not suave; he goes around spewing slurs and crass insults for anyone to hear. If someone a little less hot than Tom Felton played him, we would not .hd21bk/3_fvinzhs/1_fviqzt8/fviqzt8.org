Not to mention Draco ticks off several categories for bad boys. Rich/aristocrat, dark past as a result of affiliation with Death Eaters, possible redemption by end of series, and I can see where the Draco in leather pants would come into play. Only bad boy trope he's missing is the badass one in canon, he's not shown as an alpha male who flexes his power.
