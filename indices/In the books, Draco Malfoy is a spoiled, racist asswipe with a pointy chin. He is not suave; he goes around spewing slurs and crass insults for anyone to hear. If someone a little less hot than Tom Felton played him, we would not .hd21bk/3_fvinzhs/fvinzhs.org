Not quite true. The Draco Trilogy, the OG Draco In Leather Pants fic (literally - the trope is named after the second fic, I think) was written in 2000, and the first movie didn't come out until a year after, and I doubt eleven year old Tom Felton was really driving the fandom. People just like bad boys, I dunno what to tell you.
