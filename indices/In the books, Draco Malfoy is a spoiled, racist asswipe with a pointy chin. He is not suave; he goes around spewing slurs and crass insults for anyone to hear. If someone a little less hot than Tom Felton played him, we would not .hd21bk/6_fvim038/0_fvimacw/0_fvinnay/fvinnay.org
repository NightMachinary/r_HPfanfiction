Joffrey, poor lad, was a psychopat from when he was little. He opened a pregnant cat because he was curious. Draco is basically a stupid spoiled kid who imitates adults from his family without really understand nothing (like Joffrey, yeah, he actually tried to imitate his father and mother too, I honestly feel sad for him, he was crazy and a kid and nurtured horribly in a world made of blood and death, what you expect?). But Draco discovered he couldn't stomach actual violence in the moment he actually had to do something. He looks terrified by violence after the Dumbledore's disaster, Harry pities him when he sees in his vision he is forced to crucio people, soooo... yeah he is too romanticized, but he is very different from Joffrey.
