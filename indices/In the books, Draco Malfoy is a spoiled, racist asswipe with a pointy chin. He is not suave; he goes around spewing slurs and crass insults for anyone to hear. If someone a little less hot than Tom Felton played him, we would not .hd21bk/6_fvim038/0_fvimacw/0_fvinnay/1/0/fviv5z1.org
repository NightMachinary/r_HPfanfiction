I think to bully people on web because they like a character is far worse to romaticize fictional characters. I think to try to make people feel bad for fanfiction is stupid. And I think people often use the word "white washing" out of turn, just because they would want all simple and clean and can't stand complexieties or shifting vision.

The truth is... the entire "Draco redeemed by love" thing is now canon, with Astoria Greengrass apparently.
