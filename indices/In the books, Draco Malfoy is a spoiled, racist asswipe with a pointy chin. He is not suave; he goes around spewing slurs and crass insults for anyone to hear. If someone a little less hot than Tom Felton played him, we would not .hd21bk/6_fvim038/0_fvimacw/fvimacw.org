Draco goes around cheering and rooting for the deaths of muggle borns in Chamber of Secrets. At age 12, same age as Joffrey in the books. If he had the power of a king he would've ordered deaths, I bet. I know he has a problem with killing Dumbledore, but ordering death is easy and abstract and I don't think Draco would've had a problem with it. He almost kills Katie and Ron after all and doesn't seem to struggle with it.
