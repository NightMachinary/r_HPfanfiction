I get your point but other than Ron what other male characters with the same age as Harry and Hermione do we get as much screen time? Neville?

If JKR had given another Slytherin like Blaise or Nott as much screen time as Draco I swear the number of ships involving them would be insane.

I just don't get this whole “canon Draco is an ass writers shouldn't write about him” thing

It's fanfiction. Most ships involving Draco will alter his background or personality to make him more palatable. It might not fit canon but within that fanfiction's universe the pairing makes sense

Draco the character is just a very convenient template that is used.

Of course I do understand that it can be annoying when people mistake fanon Draco with canon Draco
