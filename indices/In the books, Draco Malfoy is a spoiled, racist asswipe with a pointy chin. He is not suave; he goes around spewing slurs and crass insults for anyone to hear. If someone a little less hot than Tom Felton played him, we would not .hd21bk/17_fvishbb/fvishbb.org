I think I made a mistake in going on a tangent about attractiveness. Ultimately, my main point is that Draco should not be romanticized and I wish the majority of the fandom shared this view. (And they don't, no matter how much of a cold take this is: Draco is the 3rd most tagged character in FFnet, and the top-rated story is a Dramione fic; on AO3 ALL the stories at the top are Harry/Draco slash.)
