Like others have noted, Draco was a popular ship well before Tom Felton was of the age to be considered attractive non-pedophilically and even before the movies came out. Of course, Tom Felton being attractive certainly doesn't help later on. Draco is enough of a "bad" boy but isn't downright evil like Joffrey, so he can be redeemed. Though the fact that Draco in Leather Pants started at about GoF or a bit before when he was just mostly a sniveling coward without any of the cool bad boy traits yet astounds me that fandom decided to dream up everything about him.

For an actor that really carried a character though, that would have to be Alan Rickman. Snape in the books really isn't redeemable until more like book 5, he could be redeemable but he's such an asshole throughout with not much backstory, so you don't want to redeem him. But then Rickman steps in and he's handsome and really sells Snape as a cool character, and the rest is fandom history.
