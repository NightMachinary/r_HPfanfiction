Purple Days over on Spacebattles

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/]]

I recall really enjoying Joffery's character development through the beginning. Somewhere around chapters 30-40 it shifts to finding out why the time skips are happening, I recall finding that to be less captivating.
