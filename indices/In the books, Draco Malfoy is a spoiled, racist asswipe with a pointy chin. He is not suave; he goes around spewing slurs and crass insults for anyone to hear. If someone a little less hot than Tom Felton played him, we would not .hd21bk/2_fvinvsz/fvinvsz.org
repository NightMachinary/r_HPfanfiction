  Thus, no Joffrey ships.

Oh you sweet summer child...

(I mean I pretty much avoid anything that says Joffrey pairings because they are almost always abuse,!fics, you sickos, but they do exist).

Interestingly, one of the better ASoIaF fics I read was the time loop Joffrey one, where he kept reliving his death until he grew as a person/character. Sadily that fic eventually went off the rails into weird military unit stuff then space aliens, but before that it was really good, especially the Joffery/Tirion interactions.

Sadily, if there is a good Draco redemption fic out there, I haven't read it as it is drowned in the shitty whitewashing of the character. They don't usually leave him as much of a evil got as he was in canon. I think I recall one he was reborn as a girl where he was still his scummy self before, but the author had him be redeemed/grow offscreen before his death.
