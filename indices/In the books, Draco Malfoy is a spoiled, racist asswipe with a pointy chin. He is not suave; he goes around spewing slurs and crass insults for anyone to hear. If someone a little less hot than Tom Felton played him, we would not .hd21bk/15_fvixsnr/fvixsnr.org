Agree with you on the fact he's an atrocious person and the only possible redemption (maybe) comes from his being so young that he didn't know better.

That being said, my favourite stories are about shoving together two characters who don't fit in canon and seeing what happens. Unfortunately, most stories based on these sorts of pairings (I.e Dramione, since I've read a lot) make them attracted to each other “for some reason she didn't understand” from chapter 1 and then they're fucking and basking in each other's love by chapter 6. Which like, if that's your thing then go for it, but I think it should be acknowledged that that's ooc, wildly implausible, and potentially unhealthy.

I wish more authors wrote gritty stories. Give me redemptions that are long and excruciating. Or maybe they aren't redeemed at all, and corrupt the “good” character until they're just as bad. Maybe they meet somewhere in the middle. I don't even care if it's explicitly romantic (I'm really not into fluff---I have a whole rant about how shipping isn't necessarily about romance but that's another issue entirely.)

These kinds of stories are difficult to write, though, and aren't what a lot of people are looking for. I'm trying to write one and it's 40-50k before they even think of each other even remotely romantically. Hope there are people willing stick around that long when I finally post it D:
