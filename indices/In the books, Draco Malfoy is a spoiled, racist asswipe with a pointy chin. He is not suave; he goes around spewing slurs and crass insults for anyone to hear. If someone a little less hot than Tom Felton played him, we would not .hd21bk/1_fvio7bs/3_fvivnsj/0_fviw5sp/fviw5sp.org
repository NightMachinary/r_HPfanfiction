JKR based the main love interests on her own life experiences, IIRC (correct me if I'm wrong?).

Ron and Hermione were her first marriage that actually succeeded (instead of divorcing), and Harry/Ginny was meant to represent her "happily ever after" with her current hubby.

Only...

1. The Harry/Ginny romance was terribly-written and shoe-horned.
2. Ron/Hermione was terribly-written, even though she tried to lay subtle seeds of it in the early books (like Ron blowing up at the Yule Ball) and her actively trying to improve on it in the films.
3. The series organically outgrew her overall outline, and I think she panicked a bit near the end (HBP onward), and instead of changing things, she tried to force it back on track. This is one of the big no-nos in fiction-writing, and as a result... yeah.
4. The movies pushed Harry and Hermione, partly because the writers/directors both shipped the two and wanted to give Emma Watson more screen prominence.

Still, JKR, years after DH, admitted she was mistaken to go with the canon ships, but it's too late now (unless she writes another book exploring parallel timelines and different outcomes, but that's unlikely).
