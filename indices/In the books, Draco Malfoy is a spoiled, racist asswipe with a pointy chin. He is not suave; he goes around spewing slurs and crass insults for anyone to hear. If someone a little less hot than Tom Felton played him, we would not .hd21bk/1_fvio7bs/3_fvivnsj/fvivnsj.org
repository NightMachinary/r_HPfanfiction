  The rabid Hermione/Harry shipping's underlying motivations
#+end_quote

Not to mention that a Ron/Hermione relationship would be difficult at best, they're a match made in Hell.

I'm at a loss to find anything they have in common, except Harry as a friend. He belittles her with all his "mental" comments, he's lazy while she's studious, he's obsessed with Quidditch while she only cares about it because Harry plays it. I know that opposites attract, but Ron/Hermione is beyond believable.

My major difficulties with the canon pairings is that Ron/Hermione can't possibly work, and with Harry/Ginny is that Ginny is at best distant fangirl. She's mostly not there, and then suddenly she's Harry's main love interest. The "chest monster" or whatever Harry feels isn't love, it's raw jealousy.

It doesn't have to be Harry/Hermione, it just has to be something that's /not/ Ron/Hermione.
