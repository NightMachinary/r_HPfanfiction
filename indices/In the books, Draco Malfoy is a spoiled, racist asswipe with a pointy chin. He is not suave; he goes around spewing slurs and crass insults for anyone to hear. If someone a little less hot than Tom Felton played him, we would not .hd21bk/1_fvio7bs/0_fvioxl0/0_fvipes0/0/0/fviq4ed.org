I'm not disagreeing with you -- if anything, authors tend to 'bend' Hermione's canon characterization to fit their needs (often to the point where she's HINO) instead of trying to be creative and try their hand at creating an OC (even one with a canon name, like Su Li, Morag, et cetera).

Heck, Padma has the same issues like Katie does -- she has a twin in another House, is of Indian descent, likes to dance like a lot of girls do, and... that's it?

I think she's a pureblood, but that's all? Oh, and she has a kid with Ron in an aborted reality, but I tend to not think about Cursed Shite. At all.
