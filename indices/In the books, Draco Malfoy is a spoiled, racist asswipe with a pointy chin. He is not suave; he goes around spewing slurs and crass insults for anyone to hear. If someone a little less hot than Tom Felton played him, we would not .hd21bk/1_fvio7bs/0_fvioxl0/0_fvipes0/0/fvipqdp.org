True, I'm just saying when wanting a character in that mold for a story/love interest, and given the choice between creating an OC / using a blank state ravenclaw, or simply writing Hermione with a slightly modified personality, most seem to go for the latter.

Compare with Daphne if you want a cunning/ambitious Slytherin without the baggage of the blood politics, and getting the choice between a blank state and modifying an existing characters personality, a different choice is common
