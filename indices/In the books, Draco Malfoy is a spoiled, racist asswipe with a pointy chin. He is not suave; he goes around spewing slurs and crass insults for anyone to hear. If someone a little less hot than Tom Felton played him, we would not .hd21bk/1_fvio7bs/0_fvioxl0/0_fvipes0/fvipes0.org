Ravenclaw doesn't really get much screen-time in canon, though.

I mean, there's Cho, but her and Harry's interactions was mostly focused on the disastrous love-life angle (from the "woah she's pretty" from Harry a year prior to her openly weeping all the time about her dead ex), Marietta (presumably a Ravenclaw), who was a traitor and disliked Harry, Roger Davis (Fleur's date, whom she probably snogged in the bushes outside), and Luna, who I suppose had a thirst for knowledge in her own... unique way, but that's it. They weren't really given a chance to have any qualities like that shown to the readers. Same could be said for the Slytherins, outside of the antagonists being mostly childish dicks (though, Malfoy was a bit cunning in the last two books), and the Hufflepuffs, who acted like they did in canon for understandable, though flawed, reasonings (angry at Harry for the Goblet thing, scared at Harry because they thought he was the Heir and had it out for one of their number, et cetera, though I suppose the latter did exemplify their 'loyalty to each other' thing).
