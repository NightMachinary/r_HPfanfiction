  The rabid Hermione/Harry shipping's underlying motivations can be excused/understood a little because of JKR's initial plan of their hooking up eventually, the terribly shoe-horned Ginny romance, and the actual friendship/relationship they had over the course of the series (she's a primary protagonist, after all) compared to other ships, though.

Just to add an additional reason, there isn't really any other character that fits her archetype (perhaps because she was a primary protagonist, thus not having any background characters trod similar ground.)

Although there is supposed to be an entire house that exemplifies this, there is really no other character that really represents thirst for knowledge. The Ravenclaws we do get tend to be defined by other primary qualities.
