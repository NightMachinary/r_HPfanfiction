I see no reason for guilt. I'm certainly not a rabid Harmony shipper, and I think Ginny would have been a great match for Harry if she'd just had more and earlier spotlight, but there's a lot to be said for dating your best friend. In earlier years Harry tended to find her annoying, but they survived the camping trip; apparently they can live together peacefully.
