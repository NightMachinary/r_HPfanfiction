Snape is the same.

Book Snape is an ugly piece of shit. Hooked nose, greasy hair, ugly face, and a seriously messed up, creepy obsession on Lily, et cetera.

The late Alan Rickman was a decent-looking guy. He's the primary reason why, uh, "Snape Wives" are a thing. If they had made Mr. Rickman look like Book Snape more accurately, let's just say the amount of slash and unconventional pairings, like Snape/Hermione, would be a tiny minority compared to what they are now.

And speaking of the lovely Miss. Granger? She's a similar case.

Hermione is supposed to be an (initially) buck-toothed "Plain Jane" with unmanageable hair that slowly grew into being a pretty woman (after she basically dolls herself up a bit).

The rabid Hermione/Harry shipping's underlying motivations can be excused/understood a little because of JKR's initial plan of their hooking up eventually, the terribly shoe-horned Ginny romance, and the actual friendship/relationship they had over the course of the series (she's a primary protagonist, after all) compared to other ships, though.

Emma Watson, when she was young, initially fit the role ideally. She looked like a plain, average kid -- just like Hermione. They even tried the buck-teeth prosthetic with her, though it was canned due to impracticality.

And then puberty and the time lapse between filming hit like a freight train, and eventually Hermione had a beautiful girl/woman (yes, Emma Watson is goddamn attractive physically), years older than her character (DHp2 had her at 21 playing a 17 year old, for example), playing her in the films.

That no doubt dumped petrol on the Harry/Hermione fire for fan-fic writers, too.
