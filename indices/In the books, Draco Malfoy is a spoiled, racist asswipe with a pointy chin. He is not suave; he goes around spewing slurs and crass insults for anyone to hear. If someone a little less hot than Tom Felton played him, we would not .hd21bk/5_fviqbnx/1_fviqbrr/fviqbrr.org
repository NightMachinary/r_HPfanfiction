Ahoy Griffithdidwrong! Nay bad but me wasn't convinced. Give this a sail:

Fandom in general has a bit o' a obsession wit' attractive "bad lad" characters n' pairing 'em wit' thar main character. Cold take but I be pretty sure 'tis because a lot o' teenage lassies use thar main character as a self insert/ like thar idea o' being courted by a hot bad lad.

Me issue wit' dis be that so many fanfic authors just ignore all thar bad things that make 'em a "bad lad". Like ye said Draco be a cowardly, racist douche bag through much o' thar books who has a somewhat sympathetic upbringing t' explain dis but fanfic authors like either ignoring all thar shitty things he did or wave it off as "poor misunderstood Draco". If only he could get a nice muggle born lass like Hermione t' explain t' him why being a bigoted piece o' shiver me timbers be bad in a nice gentle way because she's desperately in love wit' him. Bleargh.

Nay t' d' wit' HP fandom but thar BNHA fandom suffers from something very similar wit' thar character o' Bakugo Katsuki. N' t' be fair t' fanfiction authors thar actual Mangaka ignores a lot o' thar issues he first presented wit' Bakugo's character (he be a arrogant child like Draco who be raised t' believe he be superior t' others BC he had a strong quirk, as opposed t' thar main character Deku who be quirkless. Because o' dis Bakugo be a massive bully t' Deku n' a overall cunt but 'tis just...glossed o'er later on. Bakugo faces nay repercussions despite multiple events o' abuse/bullying n' he nary even loses like Draco does t' have a moment o' realisation that what he did as a child be wrong.) Because o' all dis Bakugo be loved very similarly t' Draco in thar HP fandom n' he often gets paired wit' thar main character Deku or Uraraka in much thar same way Draco gets shipped wit' Harry n' Hermione. So aye me think 'tis just fandom being comprised o' a large percentage o' teenage lassies who love thar misunderstood bad lad trope, especially when they've been protracted by attractive actors or be just handsome in thar source material.
