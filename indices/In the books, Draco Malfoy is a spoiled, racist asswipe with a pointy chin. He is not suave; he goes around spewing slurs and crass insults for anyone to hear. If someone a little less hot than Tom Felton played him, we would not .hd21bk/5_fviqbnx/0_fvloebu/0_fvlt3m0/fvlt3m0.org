I 100% agree with you, and admittedly draco is one of my least favourite characters so I avoid fics with him as a central focus so I may be wrong here, but don't a large amount of Draco fics occur post canon? I have no issue with Draco being redeemed pre book 6 but imo once he actively starts making attempts on Dumbledore's life and in the process almost kills Katie he's gone too far. He's not past redemption but it's considerably harder for me to empathise with him without him facing serious consequences, consequences he never had to face in canon which adds to my distaste towards his character.

Do you have any recs for Bakugo/consequences BC on ao3 there are depressingly few fics with that tag, something like only 50 or so. I really dislike how in canon Bakugo and Endeavour are both given a free pass for their shitty past behaviour, as if them wishing to be better without truly apolosing to this victims or making ammends/ facing any consequences makes their previous actions ok. it's really gross to read because it's almost victim blaming in the way it excuses their abusers. Deku holds Bakugo as his "image of victory" so it's ok that Bakugo bullied and belittled him for years with no consequences. Endeavour used his wife as a breeding factory for his fucked up eugenics experiment but it's ok now BC he said that "he wants to be a hero shouto can be proud of". Get the fuck outta here with this pussy ass redemption. They aren't getting redeemed, their crappy behaviour is being washed away and their victims suffering is made to be lesser than their personal epiphany.

So yeahhhhh I have issues with BNHA and unlike HP fandom where Draco seems to be somewhat evenly loved/hated everyone else seems to love Bakugo and while that's fine I want him to face some serious consequences and actually acknowledge what he did as an adolescent was wrong. If u have any recs I would love them.
