I just started looking at BNHA stuff and one of my favorite ships to sort by is Bakugo/Consequences or Karma. Relative to Draco though, he is better at the start compared to Bakugo, he's insulting and spouts threats, but nothing truly actionable until maybe book 4 telling Hermione she might get caught up by the DE's at the world cup. Bakugo at the start of the story is using his quirk to hurt people and throws out threats that he very much intends to follow through on.

Bakugo's situation can then lead to very satisfying consequences, but usually it seems to be dealt with quickly. That's fine, there seems to be legal president to deal with him in pleasing ways. Starting a fic with the canon beginning makes it a bit harder for a natural and realistic redemption to occur without taking him away for some jail time(I also just favor him getting stomped on and then if needed, Deku getting help in seeing Bakugo for the asshole he is). With Draco, its the opposite until book 6. Draco while an unrepentant asshole, has plenty of time for a slow intervention to change his views, which I think lends itself for SI's to help change their bad boy crush. By the time book 6 with him joining a terrorist organization and plotting murder, he can be dealt with swiftly; maybe book 5 if he did questionable things while part of the inquisitorial squad.
