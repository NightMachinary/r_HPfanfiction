Fandom in general has a bit of an obsession with attractive "bad boy" characters and pairing them with the main character. Cold take but I'm pretty sure it's because a lot of teenage girls use the main character as a self insert/ like the idea of being courted by a hot bad boy.

My issue with this is that so many fanfic authors just ignore all the bad things that make them a "bad boy". Like you said Draco is a cowardly, racist douche bag through much of the books who has a somewhat sympathetic upbringing to explain this but fanfic authors like either ignoring all the shitty things he did or wave it off as "poor misunderstood Draco". If only he could get a nice muggle born girl like Hermione to explain to him why being a bigoted piece of shit is bad in a nice gentle way because she's desperately in love with him. Bleargh.

Not to do with HP fandom but the BNHA fandom suffers from something very similar with the character of Bakugo Katsuki. And to be fair to fanfiction authors the actual Mangaka ignores a lot of the issues he first presented with Bakugo's character (he was an arrogant child like Draco who was raised to believe he was superior to others BC he had a strong quirk, as opposed to the main character Deku who was quirkless. Because of this Bakugo was a massive bully to Deku and an overall cunt but it's just...glossed over later on. Bakugo faces no repercussions despite multiple events of abuse/bullying and he never even loses like Draco does to have a moment of realisation that what he did as a child was wrong.) Because of all this Bakugo is loved very similarly to Draco in the HP fandom and he often gets paired with the main character Deku or Uraraka in much the same way Draco gets shipped with Harry and Hermione. So yeah I think it's just fandom being comprised of a large percentage of teenage girls who love the misunderstood bad boy trope, especially when they've been protracted by attractive actors or are just handsome in the source material.
