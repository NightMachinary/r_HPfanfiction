I think it has more to do with the fanon than anything. Snape in the movie was not a good looking man (unlike the actor that played him) and while he was trying to protect Harry, he was still a very cruel and despicable man, then there was Voldemort and his noseless self. Yet, I have seen a lot of fics that ship both of these people.
