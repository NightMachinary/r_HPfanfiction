I hate pairing Harry and Hermione with Death Eater scums, period.

That being said, I do not object these pairings in time travels and extreme AUs. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), is after all one of my favorite fics.

Ultimately though, it comes down to writing, character and plot development.
