I'm super put-off by most Harry/Hermione fics, as they tend to be the most boring romances possible. I've only found a few worth reading outside of one-shots.

Besides that, I'm not picky at all about pairings. As a lesbian, I don't care much for M/M pairings, or het pairings with super macho guys, but I'm fine with pretty much everything else otherwise.

I'm fine with most themes, but I tend to back out of most fics the moment Ron or the other Weasleys are bashed. I don't like bashing in any form, but Weasley bashing irks me the most, just because so many people do it and it's hardly justified to the extent that they're bashed
