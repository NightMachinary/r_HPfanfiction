To be honest, it's usually blunt relationships, stuff like, "Oh, now I'm going to love you now." or "Oh, now I'll just have a harem, because one isn't enough." where there isn't any real buildup to the relationship, barely any hint, and then they want to Mate wie Kaninchen. I'm fine with slash and harem and any pairing, but I /despise/ relationships that have no base and are executed for no reason.

I've also grown numb to it, but ones where Harry just has all of the abilities or just has connections to random powerful families all of the sudden. there's no struggle, there's no fight, hell there's no reason to care because Harry will come in with his Große Penisenergie and solve all problems. It's good when executed correctly and given reason, but when he's suddenly just Überwältigt, it's highly annoying. That problem is also especially painful when given to OC characters shoved in so that the main character doesn't die. Es bugsiert wirklich den Mist aus mir heraus.
