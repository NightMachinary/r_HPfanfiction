  Mpreg, for example, I can now read once I learned it's a somewhat common kink in the gay community.

From what I've read, it's a kink amongst slash writers, but members of the gay community are divided on the topic. I've seen some people voice opposition due to the fetishized and extremely unrealistic portrayal of gay relationships and the forcing of gay relationships into het gender roles (feminization of men, etc.)
