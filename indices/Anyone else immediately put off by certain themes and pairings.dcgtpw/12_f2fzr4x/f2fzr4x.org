Yes, I have those:

- teenage pregnancy for example is an insta-close (unless it gets aborted because IMHO kids should not have kids!)

- same for slash (just not interested - I am not homophobic, hell I am all for giving homosexuals the same rights (marriage included, despite the fact that I despise marriage!) as heterosexualy (I am glad that Germany finally did this a few years ago!))

- bad spelling (especially of things that are canon - occulmancy for example (it is called OCCLUMENCY -.-) or similar things Epleriamus...damned, stop it I am in pain reading this!)

- Hermione worship! Seriously, she is pretty flawed in canon (and not as smart as she thinks, because her grades take a lot of effort and time, while a true genius wouldn't need to spend that much time - look at Snape and the Marauders who were all good students, but didn't spend much time on it (they were busy - Snape was busy making better potions recipes and the Marauders were busy pranking people and sneaking around and becoming animagi etc.))
