Mmmhmm. Mpreg is actually my biggest one as it squicks me the hell out and I won't read anything with it in the story no matter the story. Extreme abuse Dursley's is another one I'm tired of, and so are the huge number of Independent! Harry stories that read exactly the same. Super! Harry stories come to mind as well as they're very rarely done well, and always contain poorly written smut that turns me off.
