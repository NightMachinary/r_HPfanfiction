Uhh big age gaps are a huge no-no for me too. And teacher student relationships; that's just gross

Voldemort/Harry in any shape or form. Just no. Not even as time travel

Nice/paternal!Snape or Snape adopts Harry fics

"Hadrian". I have yet to see a fic featuring this word that wasn't cringe worthy

Evil!Dumbledore fics

Weasley bashing
