Any story that feels the need to put that it will be realistic in the summary is generally a warning that it will be trash.

Edit: as for theme that I hate Friendly golbins and multi core wands, are the main ones that I remember I haven't been reading that many Hpfanifcs lately and am mainly only read old stories as they update.and have forgotten a lot of my most hated HP fanfiction themes and tropes.
