Mpreg is an unconditional drop for me. Doesn't matter if the fic has one of the premises I like and my favorite pairing in my favorite era (yes, there is actually a fic that fulfills these traits). It's still a drop.

There's a lot of ships that also causes me to ignore a fic -- far too many to list. But the most common ones among my usual filters is main-focus Jily, main-focus slash/femslash, any Snarry and any Tomarry.

There's also things that cause me to ignore the fic unless other things make up for it (be it me liking the premise, it having one of my preferred pairings, etc), such as soulmate fics.
