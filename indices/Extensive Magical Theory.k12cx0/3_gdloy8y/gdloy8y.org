I think zeitgeistic is an author with good magical theory, and there was this one fic where Harry and Draco have to break curses in Hogwarts left by the death eathers who scaped at the end of the war, a lot of how to identify and disable them, but I can't remember the name.

EDIT: Sorry, zeitgeistic is the author, azoth a fic.
