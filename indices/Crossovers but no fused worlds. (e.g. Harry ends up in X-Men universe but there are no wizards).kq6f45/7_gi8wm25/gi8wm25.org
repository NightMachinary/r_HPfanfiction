This one does not exactly fit, as it's technically a Fusion... but the Wizarding world is secretive and unknown to the Mafia, and the Mafia have 'omerta' which means the same thing is true-ish.

now the reason I feel like inserting the recommendation here is that after the story goes through the HarryPotter-story, the cast of HP become something unknown and strange for the Mafia people to deal with.

I also feel just about everything in the fic is about fits very loosely into the same feeling.

edit: oh also, do note: =Chapters 1-41, Hogwarts Arc= and then it starts transitioning the the crossover...and it's =334= chapters long.
