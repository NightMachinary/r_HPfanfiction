Kneazle has two crossovers with GoT. One where [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12689889/1/The-Winter-Witch][Hermione goes to help Robb]], and another where [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12963901/1/Cursed-Be-this-Soul-that-Ties-Us-Together][she AND Teddy Lupin help Ned]].

Personally, Winter Witch is my favourite of the two, and includes a neat little extra twist where someone also goes the other way to Hogwarts, causing all sorts of head scratching from adult HP characters looking for Hermione.

Other notable crossovers that do this:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11120132/1/][Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous]]: by the same author as shadow of angmar suggested elsewhere in this thread - easily the best HP/LOTR story - for when they need a break from their very serious fic. Laugh out loud hilarious.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12653732/1/][River Lily]]: Lily potter ends up in Harry Potter world. Your mileage may vary but it's very popular. I got tired of it eventually.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12588838/1/][Poisoned Apple]]: Hermione never went to Hogwarts. Instead, she was trained alongside Black Widow and others... however this doesn't fit as well because wizards, in fact, DO feature in this somewhat. I like it though and wizards do not feature for ages.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13569941/1/][What's a Gungan?]]: funny crossover of Harry falling into Episode one. Luckily he has a soft landing ;)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13315728/1/][Daughter of Oak]]: Hermione arrives in the world of the hobbit and becomes Green. What does that mean? Read on!

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12092681/1/][the harbinger's song]]: Harry is an elfling in the lotr world.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12775152/1/][The length and breadth of Skyrim: a witch's tale]]: Hermione lands in Skyrim. I enjoyed the start of this but IMO it goes off the rails a bit.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13201562/1/][Winter's Tale]]: Hermione and Captain America crossover. I remember enjoying this and it has the important distinction of actually being finished!

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12005496/1/][The Elvenqueen]] a great fic where Hermione ends up in the Lotr universe

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12819887/1/][a witch in the family]]: Hermione helps Watson and Sherlock. Nice story but doesn't really fit your post. Still, I know I liked it.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12809171/1/][crooked stars]]: Kneazle again, this time plopping Hermione into Star Wars though.

You should also check [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/429239/][lil drop of magic's profile]], they have a vast collection of crossovers and their sequels. Their Hermione in avengers fics are great and should keep you busy. While the wizarding world does exist as well, it's barely relevant and there's still culture shock etc. They write good action scenes and this will keep you busy for a long time!
