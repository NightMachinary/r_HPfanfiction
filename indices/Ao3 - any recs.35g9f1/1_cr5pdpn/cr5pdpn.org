You /can/ filter out tags on AO3, using the 'search within results' box. stick a - in front of anything you don't want (with quotation marks if it's more than one word) and it'll filter it out. /-"Draco Malfoy/Harry Potter" -"non-con" -mpreg/ for example. You can also use the 'other tags' box (not the exact wording, but similar) to search for Dark Harry fics. With a little tweaking, AO3's tagging system is easily navigable.

Besides which, being able to search for things like /Alternate Universe - Canon Divergence/ gives it an automatic leg-up on FFN, which has a god-awful filter system.
