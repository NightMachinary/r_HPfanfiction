[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10228563/1/I-m-a-Witch-Dudley][I'm a Witch, Dudley]] sounds similar, though I think you might be looking for something along the lines of:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12544259/1/][Unlikely, Impossible, and a Little Bit Looney]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11923249/1/][Cousin Harry]]

You might also like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11577120/1/Harry-Runs-Into-An-Old-Muggle-Classmate][Harry Potter Runs Into an Old Muggle Classmate]] which is kind of similar.

I don't think this helped, but good luck!
