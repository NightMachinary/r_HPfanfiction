I can definitely not compete with [[/u/DariusA92]] so, with due apologies, I am going to hijack your post and hope that I get some help myself. I remember reading a very well written fic a while ago. It starts immediately post-war and it's canon compliant. Everyone hates the Slytherins and people who were closely associated with Death Eaters, some fairly (the Malfoys, Pansy) and some unfairly (Andromeda, the Greengrass sisters, the Carrow twins). Former victims of Death Eaters start hunting them down and former Death Eaters who are still at large try to fight back and also win the power back. Displeased goblins and centaurs are also involved. Harry, trying to avoid the tensions and to protect Teddy and his grandma, makes a public appeal to peace and forgiveness but people ridicule him as "the champion of Slytherin" or something. So he holds a rally for the unfairly treated Slytherins in which he asks them to prove their allegiance and show the world that not all of them are bad and leads them in a three-way battle (Harry's Slytherins vs the Death Eaters vs the Goblins and Centaurs).

I can't remember for the life of me the name of that fic and I can't find anything remotely similar anymore, so if anyone knows of it, I'd be very grateful.
