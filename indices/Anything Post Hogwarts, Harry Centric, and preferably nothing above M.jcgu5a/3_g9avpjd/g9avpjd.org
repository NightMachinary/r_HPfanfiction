Ya know what, after reading a few post-Hogwarts fics in the past and then a few of the recs here, this is now my favourite type of HP story. They are more interesting than reading about schoolkids. Thanks to OP who started the thread and also to everyone who posted recs. I have several more to work through in coming days.
