  He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.

--- Friedrich Nietzsche

By throwing these kids to the wolves, by making them the frontline fighters against those sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums, the establishment of Wizarding Britain has created a whole generation of hardened and ruthless child soldiers.

They won a brutal victory against overwhelming odds, after experiencing unimaginable hardships and suffering, so don't ever expect them to go easy on their enemies. Even the Wizard Jesus can only take so much, and he will crucio any enemy who spits on his friends. His friends will be even less forgiving.

But if you keep betraying them and think you can go back to business as usual, then you are sorely mistaken. These child soldiers are gonna make you pay, with exorbitant interest. Good guys can only be pushed so far
