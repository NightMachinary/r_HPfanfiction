Yeah I get that. I'm about halfway through the story now and don't know where it's going. But I'm going to be disappointed if it ends up in the obvious trope of Harry becoming yet another evil Dark Lord that needs defeating. /That/ story should be written as, say, a poem of a dozen or so lines rather than a novel-length fic. Well, we'll see. This is one of the better and darker adventure fics that I've read, so I hope it stays that way.
