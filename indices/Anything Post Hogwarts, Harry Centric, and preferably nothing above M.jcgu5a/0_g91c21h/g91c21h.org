Finally, my favorite post Hogwarts fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): The Trio and their friends finally had it enough and declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. They began with vigilante killings against Death Eaters who got off again. I just love the following excerpt:

#+begin_quote
  The Ministry would burn. Not today. Not tomorrow. But soon. They would burn, every last one of them, because if that was the only way to keep them from ever going after Ron and Hermione again, then that was what he would do.

  Burn it all, scour it to the very bedrock, and rebuild it from scratch in the ashes. If the Minister could not command the Wizengamot, then the Wizengamot would yield. By Fiendfyre, blackmail, or loyalty, he did not particularly care which.

  His left hand rested by Hermione's neck, tangled in her hair. His right had a tight grip on Ron's shoulder, “silent reassurance that he was there, that they had him back for good.

  "They will burn," he vowed quietly. "Every single last one of them will burn for this."

  Hermione's breath hitched. Then her grip tightened and she looked up to meet his gaze, stubborn and furious and defiant through bloodshot eyes and ash-grey skin.

  "They will burn," she agreed.

  "... Every single last one of them," Ron finished, low and hoarse. "Every single last one."
