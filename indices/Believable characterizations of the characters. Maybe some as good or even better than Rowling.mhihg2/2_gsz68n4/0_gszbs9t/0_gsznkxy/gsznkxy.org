^ This. She had a ton of characters and not enough space to develop them all. For example, some day I'd really like to read a canon compliant Remus x Tonks romance fic that shows how they got together, all his angsty angsty-ness, etc to the point where they reconcile and he accepts that his family needs him. It would be okay with me if it deviated from canon to have a happier ending than them dying in the battle of Hogwarts though.
