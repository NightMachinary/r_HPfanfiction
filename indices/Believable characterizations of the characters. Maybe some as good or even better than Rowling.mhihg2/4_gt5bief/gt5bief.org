Linkffn(Green Eyed Monster by Sphinxs-legend)

Best characterization i've seen. The characters are so real, and in many ways I prefer it to the original. This fic is super long and feels like it's own book series. However, it makes the characters so real and brings so much life to the slytherin side of things.
