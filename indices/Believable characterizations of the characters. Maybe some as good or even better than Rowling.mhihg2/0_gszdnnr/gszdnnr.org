they've been recced 100 times but it's for good reason so IM SORRY, MODS, FOR ONCE AGAIN RECCING linkao3(All The Young Dudes by MissKingBean89) and linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down).

ATYD is the Remus origin story. But you really see Remu's grow and go through his teenage years, he struggles with who he is, what he believes in ,where he fits in. It's just fantastic, truly excellent characterisation of all the characters. Even Marlene and Mary are so perfect.

TSS is an adventure story with Harry ending up in 1978. Every other character is non-canon/minor canon and this story does a FANTASTIC job of fleshing them out and making them really unique individuals that still stick with me. I still think "What would Pel do?" before I do anything slightly illegal. Even Harry I think is developed much better than canon. At least, he handles his worries better. I adore it. Excellent characters, you'll cry trust me.
