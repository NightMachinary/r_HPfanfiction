What about more inter dimensional fanfics? I think the idea of main characters interacting with and meeting themselves could hold a lot of potential for a strong (if perhaps confusing) plot. I enjoy my romantic pairings from time to time, so there could even be some hilarity from one group meeting another (for example Canon Ron/ Hermione and Harry/Ginny meet an alternate universe Harry//Hermione or some nonsense like that).
