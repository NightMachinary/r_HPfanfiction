Here's one that I can never start.

Self-insert. OC enters the Harry Potter world but it's very different. World is much darker, more corrupt. Voldemort not around physically, but instead he is acting more like a God/devil and slowly corrupting people. Muggles birth rates are declining, Death Eater religion is popping up, etc. OC job is to get the world back on track somehow.

Also I wanted to do a Harry Potter / it crossover. That and Sirius Black is actually guilty and evil fic.
