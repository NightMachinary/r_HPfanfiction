Fishing for plot bunnies/ideas?

Harry not being chosen by the Goblet. Grindelwald escaping Nurmengard. Lockhart getting the Diary. Sirius escaping during 2nd year. Anyone reverse-engineering the Mirror of Erised (if it shows you what you want, it just needs someone who wants to know how to make one). Umbridge as the actual Minister of Magic. A regretful Pettigrew hunting Horcruxes/Horcrucises
