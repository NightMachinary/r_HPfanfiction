Here's a few:

- All anyone needs to rule the world is a well-placed Imperius curse commanding the subject to obey without question, and to cast an identical curse on two more people - exponential doubling takes care of the rest. Over the centuries, shields and counterspells have been developed, but the effect is a scary, scary world wherein anyone can betray anyone at a moments notice. Every corner of the magical world is subject to extensive security measures, and every interaction is laced with paranoia. Voldemort disappeared in '81, but everyone knows he has placed countless Imperius-cursed sleeper agents in key positions, waiting for the right moment to strike. You think Joseph McCarthy was bad? Wait until you meet Rufus Scrimgeour, newly promoted Head Auror and hero of the quasi-fascist /free magic, free people/-movement whose meteoric rise within the department was fueled by several Imperius-hunts conveniently removing his superiors...
- Harry Potter spent every possible moment of his childhood on school computers, library computers, and whenever possible Dudley's unused machine. Naturally, it took quite a bit of fiddling with the operating system to gain access without acquiring the password from Dudley, and Harry had to seek out aid from the dark corners of the internet. Arriving at Hogwarts, Harry brings with him an enchanted laptop - think IBM Convertible - bought in a seedy store at Diagon Alley and kept hidden from his classmates. Lacking in enthusiasm for the magical subjects he is being taught, Harry relies on the advice - of varying quality, sanity, and legality - of a circle of IRC aficionados to make it through the school years and combat Voldemort. As an optional extra, the story may or may not be told entirely through IRC chatlogs.
- The Philosopher's Stone is left at a school full of mischievous students behind a series of extremely easy traps. The only real difficulty is the mirror, and that is not even used in the beginning of the story. Cormac McLaggen and several friends of his break through the traps to impress the girls, and end up with the actual Philosopher's Stone as a prize. They start small by making enough gold to buy a couple of racing brooms, but things spin out of hand and they flee to the muggle world, leaving a trail of cheap gold in their wake. The economy of magical Britain, being closely tied to a Goblin-enforced gold standard, enters a crisis. A Neo-Death Eater movement is born and gains momentum without any influence from Voldemort at all, blaming muggles and muggleborns for the financial losses of the British wizarding families.
