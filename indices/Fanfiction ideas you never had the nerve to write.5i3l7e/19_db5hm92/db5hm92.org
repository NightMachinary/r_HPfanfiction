I've never written a fanfic before, and there is a good chance I never will, but I had an idea in my head to write a crackfic (which was half parody, half insanity). If I do ever write a fic, it wouldn't be that one, because that one had way too much stuff for my limited writing skills to juggle.

But the one idea from it that I still think would be interesting for someone to write involves a whole bunch of the characters making their own horcuxes. It'd probably have to be some sort of dark humor crackfic, but I'd be especially interested in seeing it played straight.
