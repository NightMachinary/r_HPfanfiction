A twoshot story, starring Dumbledore. Ch 1, it's the Blitz in 1940. Grindelwald uses the confusion to launch an attack on Hogwarts. While the staff shields the school and hold off GG's minions, Dumbledore returns to Camelot (having visited there during his second year), picks up Fawkes, and uses the Phoenix to destroy Grindelwald's attacking force. GG and Albus talk; the gist of it being that Albus blames GG for killing Ariana even though he launched the killing curse. GG is perhaps rightly peeved, as all he did was shield himself from Dumbledore's curse. Albus confesses he still loves GG and would still gladly fight alongside him. GG says he never loved Albus, and apparates away after insulting AD some more (GG was there to get at Charlus Potter's invis cloak, but after his little army got destroyed, he backed off).

Chapter 2 is 1945, German Alps. Dumbledore alone attacks GG's fortress, realizing that his former lover won't surrender peacefully and is in fact creating magical WMDs. AD kills the hundreds of magical and muggle goons in GG's castle. Then, the two face off in a battle of epic proportions. Think the battle of the Ministry, times a thousand. For instance GG summons a tornado, and uses it to suck up and fling back curses. The battle ends when AD's wand snaps, unable to overcome the power of GG's Elder Wand as they cross red-green streams for the final time. GG then crucios AD, and throws him around a bit, then starts torturing him to death. Wandless, AD summons a Nazi pistol to his hand, and shoots GG twice. GG hunches over, AD is released from the spell bind. Dumbledore snatches the Elder Wand from Grindelwald, prepares to use the killing curse and stops only when they legilimize each other; GG wants to die, to be a martyr. So instead AD petrifies him, and waits in silence in the burned out husk of GG's castle for the Aurors.
