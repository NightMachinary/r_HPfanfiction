POV fic from a Ravenclaw where everyone is welcoming to Luna after she starts school but she's so annoying: getting in people's space, stupid creatures, nonsensical ramblings etc. that the character starts to bully her to try to correct her behaviour. Follows over time to when the whole house is so fed up of her that they think nothing of shoving her outside on a cold night without shoes (which is more or less what we see in canon).

Never going to happen because people love Luna and assume all of her random crap is actually insightful/prophetic and no-one listens to her to properly understand it.
