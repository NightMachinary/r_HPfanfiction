I want to see something like that too, and can't recall anything similar.

That said, the version I imagined was basically that nothing much changes until Quirrell doesn't find Voldemort in 1990/91 (due to the lack of the latter), and then the ripples of that change the Hogwarts life slowly. Definitely not pre-Hogwarts (except in the earliest stages).
