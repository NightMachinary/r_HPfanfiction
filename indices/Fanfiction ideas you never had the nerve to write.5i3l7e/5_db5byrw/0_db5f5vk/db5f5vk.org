Now, this is a story all about how

My life got wingardiumed upside down

And I'd like to take a minute

Just sit right there

I'll tell you how I became the prince of Slytherin Lair

In west Chichago born and raised

On the Quidditch field was where I spent most of my days

Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool

And all shootin some Q-ball outside of the school

When a couple of guys who were up to no good

Started throwing curses in my neighborhood

I got in one little duel and my mom got scared

She said 'You follow' your uncle in Slytherin Lair'
