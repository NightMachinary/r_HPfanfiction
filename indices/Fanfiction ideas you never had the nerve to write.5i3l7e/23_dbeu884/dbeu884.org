My all time dream fic... If you do do this, I will never be able to thank you enough!!

Snape ends up having to communicate more with Hermione (she becomes an order member in 6th year since her time turner use actually makes her the legal age of 17. Severus is charged with the responsibility to help her train in some combat and occlumency/legilimens). He grows as fond of her as Severus Snape can. A VERY slow build in the relationship. No actual action is taken besides a small touch here and there, like fingertips brushing, glances that last just a second too long or brief hand on a shoulder when something serious happens (much later on and is initiated by Hermione). Maybe find a way were Hermione was the one helping give information as one of her tasks by Dumbledore (when they are moving Harry, where they are for him to deliver the sword of Gryffindor, Snape gives her some information too, ect.). By the end, Snape realizes he doesn't wish to die when he goes to the shrieking shack. He is bitten anyway and Hermione runs in just a couple seconds before Harry and Ron. He looks at Hermione as she cries and drops beside him and cups his face whispering his first name. Severus realizes and admits fully to himself the extent that he cares for her. Harry comes in and drops down beside her and Snape reaches for him to go through the whole memory tears while Hermione is slightly pushed out of the way and gets the bottle out to hand to Harry. The "look at me...." Is actually directed at her. She goes into his mind so she can feels his emotions/thoughts and pushes her emotions for him to feel. He dies knowing and feeling more than the regret he felt for betraying Lily. He feels compassion for someone and the feeling of that being returned, regardless of all he did. He dies feeling forgiveness.

Snape keeps his characteristics; proud but insecure, rude, stubborn, intelligent, and good at controlling emotions from showing (besides the squeeze of a chair or slight twitch in his finger when something very serious happens).I

Hermione keeps hers too; smart, caring, shows control when it comes to trouble and is logical.
