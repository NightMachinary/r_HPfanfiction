I don't write, but I've had this tickle to see Harry as a Necromancer. Not Dark!Harry like most necromancer fics. I'd really prefer it to avoid the dark/light magic thing and just treat magic as magic and intent determining whether it is bad or good.

So necromancing would just be another job description. Maybe it wouldn't be a "normal" career path for most people, but Harry's experiences with the hallows make him particularly suited for it. People might raise an eyebrow and be uncomfortable talking about the job, sort of like when a friend works in the morgue and you /really/ don't want to know the details of their job.

I've kicked the idea around in my head a bit, but couldn't flesh it out enough to warrant an entire story.
