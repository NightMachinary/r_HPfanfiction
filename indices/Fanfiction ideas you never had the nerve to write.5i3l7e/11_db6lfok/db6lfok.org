It is late June, 1991. The Dursleys try to find anyone who will take care of Harry so that they can celebrate Dudley's birthday in peace, and settle on Petunia's friend Yvonne.\\
Unbeknowst to the Dursleys, Yvonne is really nice, thinks Harry is totally mistreated, and happened to get an extra ticket for her Majorca cruise. So she uses the opportunity to take Harry there while the Dursleys are away. They might or might not be enraged by this, but it's not like they can do much, anyway.\\
A few weeks later, while still on Majorca, Harry gets a Beauxbatons letter...
