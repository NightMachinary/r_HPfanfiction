I wouldn't say I didn't have the nerve (other than I know they wouldn't have got many readers), but I would have liked to write a series of long short stories or novellas featuring members of the Order of the Phoenix and set between GoF and DH. They would be 'Auror procedurals'. I got as far as planning a couple of rough outlines but didn't get further than that.
