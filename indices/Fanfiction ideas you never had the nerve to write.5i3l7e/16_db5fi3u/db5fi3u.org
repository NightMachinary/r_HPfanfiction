After 4th year Harry really needs a holiday. He's never had a holiday before, a break from all the pressure. Cedric was murdered in front of him, Voldemort is back and the ministry don't want to believe him. How can he cope with this pressure?

In France the Delacour family want to say thank you to the brave boy who rescued their Gabbi. They invite him to come stay in France and things spiral from there. You can go with Harry/Fleur or Harry/ Gabbi. Harry can transfer to Beauxbatons, Harry can run away from it all or he could see them as the sort of people worth fighting for and go back motivated. If Harry is in France but nobody knows would the Dementors kill/kiss the Dursely's would Fudge blame Harry. International murder trial with Harry Potter being defended by the French government. How would Dumbledore react, would he be overjoyed Harry is learning about love or would he see Harry as trying to escape his destiny.

You can go so many ways with this. Independant Harry, Harry who runs, Harry who learns something different, Harry at another school, Harry trained by the French ministry even. The amount of places you could take this is crazy all based on the idea of Harry Potter needing a holiday and a family wanting to say thank you.
