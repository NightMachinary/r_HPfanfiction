I don't know if I'd say I don't have the nerve to write these, but I don't expect that I will any time soon. I'm bone idle and lazy, and I struggle to commit to projects like this.

--------------

*An anthology series* inspired by the [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/][SCP foundation]] and, to a lesser extent, the works of H. P. Lovecraft. It would exist as a collection of short stories, where each would tell of some sort of supernatural or unusual occurrence that the Department of Mysteries investigates.

There's a lot of room to play around with tropes; one idea I had involved a few Unspeakables inspecting a magically enlarged trunk, whose previous owners all vanished without a trace. Maybe a beast lives inside the trunk, or maybe enlarging trunks and then going inside of them is just a really bad idea. Who knows?

I think the fact that a story like this doesn't really have an end is probably what's keeping me from writing it.

--------------

*A Harry/fem!Harry* story. I could leave it at that and it would be enough--there's a great dearth of this pairing, and it's quite saddening. It's an extremely weird pairing, of course, but there's something compelling about it, I think.

The version I came up with involved Harry coming across a magical fish that also has the ability to travel between dimensions, and this fish would serve as the messenger that would help Harry and fem!Harry communicate until they eventually meet in person.

It's kind of a cute, light-hearted idea, without much lasting appeal, but I would want to write it on the merits of the pairing alone.

--------------

*A dimension travel* that separates itself by crossing the characters into a dimension that is neither an AU, a time travel, or a crossover. I came up with this story during my 'ambient' craze. I used to put on songs like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZAAByuWKWc&t=47s][this]], sit back, and imagine the landscapes. The subreddit [[/r/ImaginaryLandscapes]] and its brethren are also great inspirations for this.

It exists as a worldbuilding exercise. The dimension travel crosses the characters into a world that once housed a mighty, almost utopian kingdom, but which has now been abandoned and retaken by nature, sorta like a Dark Souls game except a bit less bleak.

I have all sorts of worldbuilding ideas for this, such as an in-universe explanation for why magic exists. The people of this kingdom had magic to wield for themselves, but after a calamity struck, they were mostly killed off and forced to leave. The few survivors took their magic with them, and it so happens that they found themselves in the HP world.

The story itself would begin at the end of year five, with the Department of Mysteries infiltration. The characters take a wrong turn, finding themselves in the DoM room that studies magic as one of the 'forces' on which the world runs. Here exists a passage to the dimension.

While I'm attached to this idea for personal reasons, I think it's far too open-ended and 'plotless' to be spun into any functional narrative.

--------------

*A mentor!Dumbledore* fic, packed full of action, that is also a dimension travel in its own right. It involves necromancy, black magic, the undead, and going down into literal Hell.

I've always loved Dumbledore, and I've always loved his relationship with Harry. It's a dream of mine to find a fic that crosses quality action with a Dumbledore in a teaching position for Harry, but which does not devolve into the pointless faux-politics that the fandom is plagued by.

The change can be said to begin when Slytherin is still alive; during his travels and research, he discovers the existence of an 'underworld' of sorts, and toils away in the Chamber of Secrets in an attempt to work out a way to get there.

His work is then passed to Voldemort through the Basilisk himself, who would only reveal Slytherin's knowledge to the true heir. However it is that the 'underworld' is accessed--through a spell or a sacrificial ritual or the Veil or some other geographical location--he manages to get there. Harry and Dumbledore must team up and follow him there, with a possible help from Grindelwald, before Voldemort can release whatever lurks beneath onto the surface.

I might be forgetting one or two, but that about sums it up. In the hands of a capable writer, I think these could all be great ideas, but I'm fairly confident that I'm not said writer.
