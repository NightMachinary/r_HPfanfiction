No it's more like a big party game. Like teenagers playing manhunt when they get together, or some other complex version of tag.

But... I could kinda see a 'The Most Dangerous Game' version pursued by certain dark families in a fic; and disappearances of animagi for those sorts of nefarious purposes could be an explanation for why we see all of like.. one registered animagus and several unregistered ones in canon? Aside from the 'but escaping violence in animal form in the war' trope.
