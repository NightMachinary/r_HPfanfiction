I do know of the Wild Hunt myth, and I like this reinterpretation of it, even though the story itself is not my cup of tea. I always liked the idea that most of our legends of the Fair Folk aren't about "fairies" at all (those are, as we know, tiny probably-nonsentient beings in the /Harry Potter/ universe), but instead about the Wizarding World.

Rather like how I imagine most ancient mythologies had at their roots families of powerful wizards and witches who made themselves the gods of an unfortunate Muggle people --- the Olympians being a particularly powerful and long-lasting dynasty because they had access to Elixir of Life and Philosopher's Stones (a.k.a. Nectar & Ambrosia).
