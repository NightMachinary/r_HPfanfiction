I've extensively studied Georgian and Victorian English society too, and some of the above are paralleled in 19th Century England, however I was more using Early Modern society and court structure as an example of how nuanced and complex the ruling apparatus of the monarchial state can be compared to the shallow "it's like Medieval/Feudal society" trope that has very little actual basis in historical fact or context.
