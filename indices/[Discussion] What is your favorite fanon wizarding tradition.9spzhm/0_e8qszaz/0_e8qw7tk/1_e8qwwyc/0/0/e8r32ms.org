I'm still compiling information, but here's things typical of the upper class Victorian society:

- Whitened front steps for nicer houses.
- Rooms dedicated to showing off your vast collections (like the drawing room in Grimmauld Place).
- Extravagant hats for women (like the one Neville's grandmother wears) and top hats for men.
- Sentiment rings. Men gave these to the women they loved. (I think they're similar to promise rings (i.e., pre-engagement rings) but I'm not sure.)
- If the funeral was held at home, then it was an open-casket service. If it was at a church, then usually the casket was closed. (Don't ask me why.)
- Rose-scented perfumes
- Lots of men smoked pipes and cigars.
- Herbal soaps
- Scented ink

Most of this was taken from one site, and the author seemed to be American, so I'm not sure how much is applicable to Victorian England. However, I think wizarding society would be more like that era than the earlier ones.
