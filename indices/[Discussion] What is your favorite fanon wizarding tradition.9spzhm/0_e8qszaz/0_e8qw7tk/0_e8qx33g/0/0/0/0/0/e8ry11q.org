I have to admit that I really struggle with SF's fics, especially their portrayal of Hermione... I don't know why, but I've tried to read three of their stories and have closed them all down because it was too painful... They really seem to be loved or hated though but I can't tell you why that is. I just didn't like the stories, even when the premise was interesting.
