I know tons of people HATE the expanded trunk thing but even though I roll my eyes a bit when I read it (especially as part of a pre-Hogwarts shopping trip) I still love the idea of them, even though (like someone mentioned below) they're supposed to be restricted, usage-wise. I've always kind of headcanon-d that that's one of the more regularly ignored laws. If you break it, it's just a fine, and the only reason you'd get caught doing it in the first place is if you massively mucked it up or someone told on you. I can see a luggage shop being given a license or a permit or whatever anyway though.
