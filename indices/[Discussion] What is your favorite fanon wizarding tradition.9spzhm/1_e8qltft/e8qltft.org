I'm a fan of fics that explore pureblood culture, but leaving out all the usual tropes from those, there are a few fanon traditions that I liked because they fit well or were original.

- In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] it's a coming-of-age tradition (going out of fashion in modern times) for young wizards to design and create their own custom magical trunk. They would then expand and adjust this trunk to fit their needs throughout their lives. I like this idea because it would fit well with what we see of Newt's trunk in the recent movies.

- In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12157995/1/Tom-Just-Tom][Tom, Just Tom]] Hermione researches the traditional magic of familiars in America, such as a potion that can allow the witch or wizard to hear their familiar's thoughts. She adapts a ritual that was commonly used to move an aging familiar's mind into a new body. This seems like an incredibly creepy idea, but I could see it being the norm in some wizarding communities.
