The first one is interesting, though it doesn't mesh too well with the fact that canonically, space-extension charms are illegal to use unless you've got special permits from the Ministry.

The second... ugh, I'm sorry but I have an intense GRRR-reaction to anyone mentioning "familiars" in the Potterverse. Nagini was a one-off deal, okay? (And per more recent canon she's not even really a snake at all, without even going into the fact that Potterverse snakes aren't really animals to begin with.) The others are /pets/, no more, no less.
