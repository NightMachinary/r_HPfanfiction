I enjoy fics that stray far from canon, so I've never seen that as a disqualifier if an idea is executed well.

Regarding familiars, JKR's series incorporates many 'pop culture' ideas about witches from history (i.e. riding brooms, using cauldrons, historical witch trials, skinwalkers, etc.) People were accused of having familiars during the Salem Witch Trials in real life, so I don't think it's a stretch to incorporate them as a outmoded historical tradition for American wizards/witches.

I agree that it's silly to call something a familiar if it's just a slightly more intelligent pet, like in canon. However, I would enjoy reading a fic in which witches/wizards have a mental bond with an animal in a way that actually impacts their magic.
