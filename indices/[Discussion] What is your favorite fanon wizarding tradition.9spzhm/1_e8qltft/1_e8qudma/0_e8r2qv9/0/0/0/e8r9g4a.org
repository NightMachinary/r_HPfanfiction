And see, I would not necessarily consider /Dodging/ an AU on the basis of the Wild Hunt. The Wild Hunt /could/ exist in the canon universe, we've just never seen it.

For me, the difference between an AU and a general fic is "if it weren't for the speicifc point of departure, could the canon books have happened in this fic's universe with no visible change?". So "what if Harry was born with red hair" or "what if Voldemort won the first war" are general fics, while a story where magical Lordships exist, Hogwarts is a paying school or bonded familiars exist are AUs.
