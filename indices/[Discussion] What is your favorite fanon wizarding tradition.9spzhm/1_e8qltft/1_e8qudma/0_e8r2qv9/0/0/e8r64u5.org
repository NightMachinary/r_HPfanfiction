To be honest, I've never read a fic in which those pets were called familiars, though I have seen some with passages that specifically point out Hedwig /isn't/ a familiar. It's as if that idea became so infamous at one point that now the norm is to react against it.

I suppose I'm a bit blas√© about AUs. Since I'm not attached to the idea of canon, my knee-jerk reaction is to say that it's a meaningless distinction and technically every word that didn't come out of JKR's head is AU. But that's just me; the distinction is of course very helpful to people looking for 'canon-compliant' fics.

I'd say both of the fics I linked are examples of deliberate AUs. In particular, /The Well Groomed Mind/ contains world building that is a steep departure from canon. I've never read /Dodging/ (since the idea of harems doesn't appeal to me), but the Wild Hunt idea posted by a different redditor in this thread did pique my interest
