Oh, I enjoy /intentional/ AUs --- but, rather like "magical exhaustion" or pureblood Lordships, one gets the overwhelming impression that a lot of people who refer to Hedwig or Crookshanks as "familiars" aren't really /aware/ that they're straying from canon. Perhaps /Dodging/ isn't one of them, but it's the reason why I recoil at the idea so.
