If it were a long-held tradition, I don't see why the Ministry would have a law against it, though. If the purebloods are going to keep something secret, it really ought to be something obviously dark and illegal --- something that no amount of "generous gifts" can buy the authorization of.

Something as mild (dare I say charming?) as this trunk idea... if it ever had been illegal, I can't imagine why Lucius or someone would not have taken Cornelius Fudge aside at some point, offered him a drink, and told him "really now old chap, we're not harming anyone, and I /mean/ it this time, so why don't you whip up a little Ministerial Decree for us to clear up this whole business?"
