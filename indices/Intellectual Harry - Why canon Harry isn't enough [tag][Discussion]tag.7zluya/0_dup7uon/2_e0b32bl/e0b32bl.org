Is he? Harry would need combat magic to survive (if he didn't have tons of "expendable" people basically jumping in front of curses for him!) but he really only knows a stunner, reducto and his signature spell "expelliarmus" and maybe a shield, but that's it! Sure he uses some unforgiveables, but that only shows that he lacks knowledge because he needs to use forbidden magic (hell, I wouldn't have a problem if he used everything else he saw like legilimency and if he truly tried at occlumency, but the sad truth is that Harry kind of is a one trick pony!)

No, Harry is a slacker who IMHO either needs an attitude change or someone who makes him see magic as what it is - MAGIC, not something boring that isn't fun to learn (I meam I am sorry, but I'd turn into a recluse if you gave me the ability to learn magic and a library of magic-books...damned, the ability to basically tell the universe to go fuck itself - "I want this to hover! Gravity be damned!" - you bet I would want to become good at it!)...

Harry sadly lacks that sense of wounder you'd expect from a mundane raised child (Hermione has it IMHO), while Harry kind of acts like a stuck up pureblood ("Magic? Yeah, seen it...now can we go play quidditch?")...he kind of makes Snape right and that pisses me off!
