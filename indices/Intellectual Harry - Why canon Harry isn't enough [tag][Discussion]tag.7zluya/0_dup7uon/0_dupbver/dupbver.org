  As I said, weird. Methods of Rationality... I think I can only take a Rationalist circlejerk so long until my inner Empiricist rebels

Eh, considering that Harry falls for the lies of the main villain because he relies entirely on his rationalist conclusion instead on empiricism, I don't believe "rationalist circlejerk" is a fair conclusion.

I thought the fic made a good point that you can come to the opposite of the correct conclusions when you rely entirely on rational logic. Harry got trapped in a web of rationalisations instead of going "Yeah, looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, swims like a duck... it's probably a duck"
