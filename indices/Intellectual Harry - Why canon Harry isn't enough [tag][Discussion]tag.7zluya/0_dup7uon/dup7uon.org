I share your like for an intellectual Harry. I dig the idea, but I'ver never seen in done in a way that I like. All the fics you named had one point where I stopped reading it. Blindness just /dragged/, I felt. I also disliked that Harry's blindness, the thing that brought me to the fic in the first place, was eventually made from a weakness of the character to an extremely powerful tool for him. Black Luminary was just... weird as fuck and I always had the feeling like the author didn't really disconnect from what he wrote there. As I said, weird. Methods of Rationality... I think I can only take a Rationalist circlejerk so long until my inner Empiricist rebels. I get that the Harry in the story wasn't really a character, but more just a carrier for a continuous argument. I did enjoy some of the conclusions, especially the timetravelling, even if I think I disagreed (I can't remember).

I think the only fic in which a Harry is truly /hunting/ for knowledge that I liked was Magicks of the Arcane linkffn(8303194). It's a nice mentor!Dumbledore fic in which Harry excells in his tasks and under the mentorship of the headmaster.

For me a intellectual!Harry fic needs two things. Harry needs to use the magic he learns. One of the most defining traits of Harry,. I find, is that he is absolutely driven whenever he needs to know something to survive. The Patronus Charm is the perfect example of the ridiculous heights Harry can reach once he feels the need to. The second point is that Harry also needs to earn these skills. I kinda despise fics in which Harry reads a few books and gets more powerful than Voldemort in the timeframe of a summer (and */fuck/* those time-turner do-over montages "One summer is 10 years hurrrr". Bullshit). Harry needs to put in blood, sweat and tears to get to a point where he resembles Voldemort /in his seventh year/, not even mentioning reaching the skill-level of a Voldemort, Grindelwald or Dumbledore who studied, researched and trained for decades.
