  Because this Harry is so special that no other genius's out there in the wizarding world didn't delve deeper into how magic itself works.

If you find HPMOR!Harry annoying, there's no helping it --- for whatever reason, half of the people who read it love him, and the other half hate him. However, you didn't keep reading long enough to judge that particular plot-point fairly:

Harry's investigation of how magic works is /pointless/ and is /treated/ as Harry being overconfident.

His experiments in trying to figure out the principles of magic /totally fail/, with his only true "discoveries" over the course of the story being the nature of Dementors (which he's far from the first wizard to figure out, it's just that all those who do keep it a secret) and Partial Transfiguration (for which knowledge of advanced physics was needed, so no wizard could have figured it out in the past).
