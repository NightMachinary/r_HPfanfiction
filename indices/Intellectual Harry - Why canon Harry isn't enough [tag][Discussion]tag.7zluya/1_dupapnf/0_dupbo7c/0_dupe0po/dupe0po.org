People who claim Harry is a Gary Stue think that Harrys opinion of himself = authors opinion of Harry. MoR Harry most certainly is an unreliable narrator.

Personally i'm kind of annoyed with many MoR dissers. Sure the story had more than a few faults, but the most often seen complaints tend to be due to wrong assumptions made by the reader, who then dropped the story.
