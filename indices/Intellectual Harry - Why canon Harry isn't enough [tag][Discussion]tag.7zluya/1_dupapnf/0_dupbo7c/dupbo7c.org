  Harry's investigation of how magic works is pointless and is treated as Harry being overconfident.

  His experiments in trying to figure out the principles of magic totally fail

Thanks. Any opinions about that stuff from people who haven't finished the fic are completely invalid anyways.

It's still strange when people keep claiming that the main character is some kind of Gary Stue though. He's being played completely by the (possible) villain very early on.
