  Human Transfiguration is a sub-branch of Transfiguration and a form of transformation in which one transfigures *human body parts* or an entire human being into another form.

  Human Transfiguration is more difficult than any other form of Transfiguration, including Cross-Species Transfiguration and is therefore N.E.W.T.-level, taught only to sixth years and above at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
