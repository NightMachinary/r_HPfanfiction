The torturing pupies thing is weird but it is mentioned only couple of times and is more the because of Bellatrix who is insane. It is easily skippable and the rest is still good. Of course there is the thing with the monsters later in the story which is cotroversial especially the ending of one chapter that may make people dislike the fanfic.
