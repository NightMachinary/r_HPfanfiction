I don't get what you are trying to say. I assume you want to know why people write about Intelligent Harry?

I think it has much to do with expecting explanations about the magical world. /Why have we hidden ourselves?, What is Magic? How does potions work? Can Magic be explained using Muggle */Laws*/?/

If I read a story about an Intelligent Harry, I expect Ideas that tries to explain a world of Magic, I expect solutions that I could not have thought of and I want to see how the Magic world simply does not comply with a teen that thinks he is right.

Maybe I am thinking more of a Scientist than an Intellectual. But it is not as an Intellectual Harry is presented in these stories. He is a researcher and a researcher answers questions that are yet unknown.

As to why he is /The smartest person ever!/ is simply to make it feel like Harry is the only one that matters.

If you think about it, there is probably many things in the magical world that is already explained in a book somewhere. We just never get to know about them because Harry, our point of view, doesn't care about that kind of knowledge like, for example, Hermione.
