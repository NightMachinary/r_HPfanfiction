By about the third or so paragraph, I found myself skimming, because the action, though ostensibly quick, didn't go anywhere. I skimmed hard. Then, by the time Harry wakes up from the stunner, I found myself flat out unable to continue. The pacing is weird, but the premise comes right out of left field, and is a bit too random. I can't sympathise with any of the characters, and their behaviour is way too out of what I'd expect from them to be believe-able. I pretty much stopped reading after the point where you mention something about a warming charm. I mentally checked out.

Aside from that, please make sure to check the spelling and grammar issues before posting publicly. Loose means that something isn't tight. Lose is the present tense of lost. Waive means to give up. Wave means to move something back and forth. These are just two of the many errors scattered throughout the fic, making it not only distracting, but even more difficult to read through.
