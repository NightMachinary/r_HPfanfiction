[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9095016/1/][Betrayal]], linkffn(9095016), is canon compliant until both Ron and Hermione left Harry, then it gets super grim dark. One of the very few Harry/Daphne I have enjoyed.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/][Children's Crusade]] and its prequel [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6884267/1/Stop-All-The-Clocks][Stop All the Clocks]], linkffn(6884267;6989327), are dimensional travels, and things went horribly wrong in the other one.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771), features a very damaged Trio who are in a relationship despite their families' strong opposition. On top of that, they had to defend both Muggle and Magical Britain against the extremely powerful zombie battleship BismarckMort.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925), is another dimensional travel. Only this time, it's the canon dimension becoming a horrible place after the Wedding attack.

Their real trouble begins after Voldemort's defeat in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971). Just when it seems they have finally turned the table on their enemies, they ran into something very unexpected.
