Romance isn't really its focus, but linkffn(12132374) is a great slytherin!Hermione who don't need no man and travels back in time to save the world.

An older (complete) one, linkffn(2303240) is a classic marriage law fic that pairs Hermione and Oliver Wood, but Draco throws his hat in the ring, too.

You might also like linkffn(11837220), a Hogwarts AU that puts Tom Riddle and Hermione in roughly the same generation, with him pursuing her. This author has a ton of fantastic creepy, antagonistic Tomione AUs.
