Arguably we see them through Harry's perspective.

In terms of what they actually /do/ - well by 3rd year they like Divination, and in various other subjects they're happy to get stuck in - iirc one of them gets injured herding Skrewts in Care. Plenty of fuel there for alternate interpretation. Maybe one of them has an encounter with a seer in between age 11 and 13 that influences their interest. Maybe Hermione would get the same kind of interest if exposed to the right evidence.
