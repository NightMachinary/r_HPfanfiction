Yeah though they would've never been in Myrtles bathroom where the entrance to the chamber is if it weren't for Hermione brewing polyjuice potion there. So Ginny would've probably died. Though in his first year it would've been probably better if Harry hadn't went through the wall of fire with the potions. This was also hermione who got the solution to the riddle. Hmm though I guess they might have become friends in the third year because of the time turner, depending on the fact if Dumbledore would've been willing to let Sirius die. It's more of a butterfly effect
