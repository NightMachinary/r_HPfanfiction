I just can't see Hermione becoming friends with Parvati and Lavender... though it's something that'd be amusing to read. A lot of comedy, I'm sure. I wouldn't mind reading a story with Hermione being friends with Parvati and Lavender.

I really wonder, if Harry, Hermione and Ron hadn't of been friends, who would they be friends with?

Like if Hermione was still attacked by the Troll, and Harry and Ron still saved her, so she was more chilled out, but they just weren't friends.

That'd be a interesting story, I could see as a drabble fic or a oneshot or something.
