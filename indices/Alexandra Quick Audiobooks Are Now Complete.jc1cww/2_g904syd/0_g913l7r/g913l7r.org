Pronunciation is something I coordinated very closely with Inverarity on for this! I had to go back and re-record instances of names that I got wrong at first. Though I declined to do this with Cejaiaqui. I had recorded him as “Seh-ZHAI-ah-kee” and Inverarity told me after the fact that it was “Seh-jee-AH-kee.” His name is all over chapters that are very intense and emotional and I didn't want to re-act that many bits.
