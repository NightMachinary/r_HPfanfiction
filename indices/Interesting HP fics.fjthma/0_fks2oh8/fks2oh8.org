Since no one recommended anything for now I'll rec you a WIP. (Wordcount currently about 100K) Might not be your thing but it's 24 year old Harry traveling back in time but the Author marked it underage because Harry lands in his 15 year old body. Sirius is pretty present in the fic. Ships are Harry/Death and Wolfstar. Pretty interesting since Death is an actual character and Harry is a bit on the darker side but not outright evil and clich√©. Snape is also in the fic but he doesn't really play a major role he is just regular Snape. Not bashed not elated to some position.
