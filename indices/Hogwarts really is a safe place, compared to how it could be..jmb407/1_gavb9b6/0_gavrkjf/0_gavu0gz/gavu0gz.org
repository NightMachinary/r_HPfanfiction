Ah, sorry. I didn't mean to imply that the legend of the scholomance was created from a HP fanfiction! It's a pretty old tale that originates, if I'm not mistaken, from Transylvania? The author mentions in an interview during an episode of the "Be the Serpent" podcast that the current novel evolved from the mentioned fanfic she was writing years ago, which is what I intended to convey when writing that post.
