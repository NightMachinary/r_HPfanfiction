This sort of concept is done really well in "A deadly Education" by Naomi Novik, excluding the whole teacher bit. In that novel the school itself is sentient and teaches the kids as it protects them from roaming monsters. Everything wants to eat the children. Even the school. But it's better odds then being outside of it, at any rate.

It's based on the legend of the scholomance (The devils school for wizards in which he claims the soul of the last person to walk out of its walls), and allegedly it's origin can be traced to a fanfiction the author was toying with in which Draco attends the literal scholomance.

Great book if your looking for a darker, more sensible magical world then Harry Potter.
