I could be wrong but I believe in the novel it's implied that only Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students who were of age to enter even traveled to Hogwarts.

So presumably huge, as Harry would be at Hogwarts. Which would make his 'I didn't put my name in' defense even better as he was, you know, not on the continent.

Assuming Moody is still hired as Dumbledore may have wanted more security given he likely would have been with the students at whatever school the tournament was held, it would probably make it fairly easy for Crouch to get Harry to trust him then kidnap him whenever for the ritual.
