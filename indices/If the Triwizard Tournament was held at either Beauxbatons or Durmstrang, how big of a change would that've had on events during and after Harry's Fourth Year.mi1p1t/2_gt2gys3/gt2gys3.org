The age restriction, if I recall correctly, was Dumbledore's idea. But that's just me being a know it all as Harry would still most likely be left at Hogwarts.

Unless Dumbledore sends McGongall in his stead, that leaves Hogwarts, and Harry, pretty vulnerable. BCJ could sneak in, kidnap an unsuspecting 14 year old, and sneak out.

But if you're trying to see how to get Harry in the TWT, imperiused Karkaroff or Dumbledore feels uncomfortable leaving Harry vulnerable.
