Well the crux of the problem is whenever Voldemort needed Harry to be tested by the Tournament for his ritual as an element or optimisation ? Because even at Hogwarts with Dumbledore it would have been easy for Crouch to kidnap him. I don't recall if in Canon there was any mention about Harry needing to do the task for the power of the blood forcibly taken to be supercharged.

But it would have changed nothing after, the British ministry would still stick its head in the sand. And the ICW as always would do nothing to try to reel in the British Ministry of Magic.
