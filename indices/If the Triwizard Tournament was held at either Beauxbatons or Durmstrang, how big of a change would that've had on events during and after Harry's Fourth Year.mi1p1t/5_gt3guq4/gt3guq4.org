A bunch of 17 year olds travel with Dumbledore. Minerva stays in charge at Hogwarts. Assuming Moody is still Hired as DADA teacher, Crouch Jr and Riddle don't need an overly complicated plan to kidnap Harry now.

So I'd say it's a pretty big change. Crouch Jr can just vanish with Harry and Dumbledore could be none the wiser for ages, unless you know, some serious deus ex machina.
