Maybe have it were most of the seventh years are away from school. Only the ones struggling or who are two busy studying (overachievers like percy or Hermione) stayed behind. It starts out with harry thinking it will be a easy year with just school to worry about. The night of holloween harry gets a bad feeling and in the morning g he gets called to the headmaster's office becaus this name came out of the cup. It's actually moody at the school and Barty is polyjuiced as a teacher from the school they are hosting from. People are in an uproar because they know there is no way he put his name in the cup being in a different country.
