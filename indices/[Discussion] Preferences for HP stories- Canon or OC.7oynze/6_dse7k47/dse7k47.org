I generally don't write Hogwarts-era, so Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione are out in the adult world doing adult things. This entails meeting new people, so OCs abound as supporting characters. I've gotten some compliments on some of my OCs, so if they're interesting characters, I don't find anything wrong with them. I don't know that I would be super-interested in a HP-set fic with an OC as the main focus, but again, interesting character is key.
