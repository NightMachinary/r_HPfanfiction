The canon characters have been in my life for nearly two decades so I naturally feel more of a connection to them. I have no qualms about the insertion of a OC; however, I usually don't like them to dominate the story. But if I'm reading post-war fics, it's inevitable and justified to insert some new blood and almost weird when I read a post-war fic with no OC.
