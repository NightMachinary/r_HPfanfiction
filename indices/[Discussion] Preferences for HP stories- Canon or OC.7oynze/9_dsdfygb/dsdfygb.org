As for main characters definitely the canon ones. I might make up some OCs when the plot calls for it (and I have to do that a lot for "Dawn of Darkness") but generally, I prefer to use canon background characters as much as possible since they are a blank sheet to work with but at the same time have some established characteristics which the readers are familiar with. And for them, it is easier to "attach" information to a known name than to keep track of a legion of new characters.
