People say OCs are generally badly written but frankly they're no more badly written than the canon characters. It's a pretty fair bet that if an OC is badly done, the canon characters are as well; and vice-versa. I write OCs so obviously I like them.

I like adult characters or young children so fics set at school usually don't appeal. I like stories that happen 'behind the scenes' with minor characters but don't affect canon. And I do require an actual plot.
