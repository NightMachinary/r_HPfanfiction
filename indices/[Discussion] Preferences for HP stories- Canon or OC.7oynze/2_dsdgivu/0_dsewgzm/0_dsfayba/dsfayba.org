I'm terrible at favouriting things and I don't find a lot of the sort of thing I would like to see, but I think these have good OC characters. This one is Hogwarts-set, so not my usual preference but I think the OC is very good. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10810579/1/The-Rebel-Snakes]]

This one is a historical and could be an original fic without too much difficulty [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8596476/1/Starnlicht]]

This is about Lucius Malfoy and has good OCs [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11166683/1/Of-Beasts-And-Men]]

And this is a delight. The author sadly died a while back, but left beautiful stories. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2736250/1/The-Garden-Gate]]
