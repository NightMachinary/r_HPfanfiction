  It depends exactly what you mean by Canon. A lot of stories have a character called Harry Potter who, within a couple of chapters, has fixed his eyesight, changed his hair, magically repaired his malnourished body, attained a Lordship, become one of the wealthiest people in the world and is lusted after by the entire female population of the wizarding world. You may as well have just invented a character called Wayne Clams and gone with that instead.
