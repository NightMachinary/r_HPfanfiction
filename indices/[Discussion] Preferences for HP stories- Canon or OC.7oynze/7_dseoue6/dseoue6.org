It depends exactly what you mean by Canon. A lot of stories have a character called Harry Potter who, within a couple of chapters, has fixed his eyesight, changed his hair, magically repaired his malnourished body, attained a Lordship, become one of the wealthiest people in the world and is lusted after by the entire female population of the wizarding world. You may as well have just invented a character called Wayne Clams and gone with that instead.

On the other hand there are stories with characters like Daphne Greengrass, who's mentioned a grand total of once in the books, or Susan Bones who appears slightly more but isn't exactly fully developed. Can these really be described as Canon when used in fanfiction? Obviously they exist in the original books but we know basically nothing about them.

My point really is that there aren't all that many characters in the books that are well-developed enough to matter when it comes to the Canon/OC debate. The Trio, the other Weasleys, some of the adults... that's about it.

For me, a story has to have Harry, Hermione and Ron in it unless there's a very good reason. beyond that, I don't much care where the rest come from.
