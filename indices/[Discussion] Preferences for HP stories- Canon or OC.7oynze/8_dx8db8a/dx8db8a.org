I like to use OCs to round out a fic and encourage development for canon characters (it sounds awful when put like that, but... yeah).

For what I like to read, I'm mostly into adult-world fics, mostly romance, with some kind of interesting plot thing going on. Muggle world AUs have been fun recently too, I might actually write one soon.

I don't mind OCs, I find them necessary for most stories, as long as they aren't clearly overpowered Sues.
