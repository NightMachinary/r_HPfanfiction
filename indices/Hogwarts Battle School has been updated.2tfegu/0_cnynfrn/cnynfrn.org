Yes, so? Fanfiction.net has a "follow" function which causes the site to send you an email when the story updates. Anyone who wants to know when the story updates can follow the story themselves.

My thinking is that only new stories and story completion events should be posted to this sub.

That's not to say that you can't/shouldn't post discussions about new chapters, or even stories in progress. E.g. What do you think Hermione's little ritual / mark does? I didn't notice anything special from in so far in the second task. I did like how Harry defeated Krum, and how Harry stayed to save Krum from drowning. Do you think the portkey malfunction was intentional or an accident?

Thoughts?
