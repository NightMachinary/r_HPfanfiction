While there was no need to post an update about HBS (you know, because the author just updated 4 times in as many days), I don't think there's anything wrong with a update thread for a story that comes out with a new chapter every few months.

It gives people a place to discuss the new chapter, it lets new readers find the fic, and they're a nice break from the constant recommend threads that come up.
