I don't mind a post regarding an abandoned story (e.g. no post for more than a year) being picked up again (e.g. The Santi's HP and the Boy Who Lived).

But Hogwarts Battle School was only about 3.5 months later than his projected update time. Not enough time, IMO, to make it a big deal when he posted again. Plenty of authors appear to have several months between story updates.

If you want to know when a story is updated, then use the fanfiction.net "Follow Story" functionality.
