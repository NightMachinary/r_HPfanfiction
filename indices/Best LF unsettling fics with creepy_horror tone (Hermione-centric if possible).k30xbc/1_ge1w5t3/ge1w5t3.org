It's about the Black family, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663][Blackpool]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TheDivineComedian/pseuds/TheDivineComedian][TheDivineComedian]] is spooky as hell, with both a ghost and psychological horror. The horror really builds up fantastically in it. TheDivineComedian has a few other fics that are really creepy too, like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13719279][Still Life with Skull]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18456680][Styx]].

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19437019][Ten Tips to Tranquility]] by [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/bking4/pseuds/bking4][bking4]] isn't necessarily horror, but it's definitely creepy and enjoyable.
