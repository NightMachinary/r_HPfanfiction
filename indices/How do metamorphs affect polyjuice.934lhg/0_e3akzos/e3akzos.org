The potion transforms the drinker into the metamorphmagus' base form.

The potion transforms the drinker into whatever form was being held at the time. This would be easily exploitable to create unlimited amounts of polyjuice of a person without them ever knowing.

The potion totally fucks the drinker up in some unpredictable fashion. It wasn't designed for use on such a rare and unique magical being, it stands to reason that the potion simply wouldn't work correctly.

Who knows? There's no canon answer. I tend to think it would be the third option.
