Ah, but you must think magically. If an animagus is transformed, are they truly an animal, or merely impersonating one and still have the magical essence of a human (or other being)? Since animagi can (presumably? I'm not sure if this is canonical) be differentiated from true animals, then use of keratinous materials (such as hair, feathers, nails, or claws) from an animagus in Polyjuice potion may produce different results than those from a true animal---perhaps even transforming the user into the animagus's true form.
