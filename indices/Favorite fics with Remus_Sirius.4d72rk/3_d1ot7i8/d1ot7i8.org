Check out the [[http://rs-games.livejournal.com][RS Games]], a fest that goes on every year! They produce a lot of great stuff, and serve as a wonderful jumping-off point for finding new authors to read.

NeonDomino on ffn has good sets of AUs, most under 3k but collected as chapters. linkffn(Fifty Shades of Sirius Black) is a more recent collection, there's one for Remus as well, and there are a few sets of A-Z AUs.

LadyFaceElena is over on AO3, and has a lot of good stuff--mostly muggle AU oneshots, but a couple of chaptered fics as well and one long AU with no setting change. linkao3(Wholly Civilised) is a personal favourite, but there are 105 fics there to read!

Another person mentioned linkao3(Text Talk), and I'll add linkao3(Aesthetic: Trash Boys) to that. Similar concept, cowritten by the author of Text Talk, and with accompanying art!

picascribit and pommedeplume/potatoalchemist are both on AO3 as well, and I highly recommend all of their works. Fair warning: not all endings are happy.

Someone else linked linkao3(Stealing Harry) and I will second that rec (and the series afterwards) wholeheartedly. Copperbadge is an amazing writer, and all of his works are well worth reading.

linkao3(Song of Songs by mad_martha) is an old fic that was extended. It's part of a longer AU 'verse, but it stands well on its own. It was originally written before DH came out, so it doesn't hold to later canon. It is, however, one of my favourite fics of all time. Have tissues handy.

bluepeony is also on AO3 with a lot of AUs of varying lengths. linkao3(Finest in Fairford) is my favourite.
