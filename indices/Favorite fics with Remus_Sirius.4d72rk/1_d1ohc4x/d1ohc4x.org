I love Remus/Sirius, especially in the Marauder days.

linkffn(Casting Moonshadows) is great, probably my favourite Remus/Sirius out there. It's not completed, but it's also not abandoned, the author just takes six months to a year to post new chapters now.

linkffn(Once in a Blue Moon COMPLETE) it's been ages since I've read it, but it's a great AU of the Marauder years.

linkffn(Hairy Snout, Human Heart) another AU Marauder year, but don't bother with the sequel. It's not only abandoned it's also not that great (James pretends to be a werewolf to get the heat off of Remus, honestly!)

Keep in mind these are fairly old, so they may have a couple cliches in them, but over all I think they hold up great. They are also, by and large, 'focused' on the pairing. While they all have plenty of plot (and all of it quite good) they are primarily romance fics, and focus on the relationship of Remus/Sirius.
