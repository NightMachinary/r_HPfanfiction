I'd definitely give it a shot.

Since Sirius is de-aged (and Remus is very adamantly straight in this fic) it's not distracting at all.

The characterization is done really well in the sense that you actually /don't/ want Remus to end up with Sirius because of how Sirius is written. Remus grew up into a mature adult, and Sirius is still just a kid really.
