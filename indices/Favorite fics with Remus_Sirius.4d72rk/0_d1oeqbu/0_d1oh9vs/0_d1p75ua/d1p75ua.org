yeah it's beautifully written and the story telling is excellent. I've reread the whole series a bunch of times.

The ships in Cartographer's Craft are stopping me from giving it a try. I can definitely do Harry/Sirius, but just thinking of Remus with Tonks makes me heart hurt lol. It's like I can handle them with other people if there's only one of them in the story, but if both Remus and Sirius are in a story together it's tough for me to think of them with someone else.

Should I suck it up and try it anyway?
