It's a shame Stealing Harry has been abandoned.

copperbadge is a fantastic writer (look no further than Cartographer's Craft for proof), and it's too bad they decided to end the series.

It's nice they wrote out the outlines for where the series was heading though, so it's not like it's completely abandoned.
