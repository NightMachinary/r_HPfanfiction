Well, I remember the story [Unsung Hero]. It made me sad but in a bad way... there was just toooooo much injustice in the story. Could have been good, but the author must have been some masochist and turned it into a soul-wrecking piece of crap towards the end.

Spoiler:

-Hermione gets mind-controlled by Harry's brother at some point because he is jealous, he forced her to be his girlfriend and basically raped her during that period of time. She was rescued by Harry, but their relationship wasn't the same anymore. Harry's borther got away with it... (because he wrongly believed to be the bwl)\\
-In the end, Hermione dies for a very stupid reason (author forces it). Harry gets killed by his brother and... THE END. There was a sequel to the story where harry travels back in time after his death, but the author dropped the story for obvious reasons.\\
>! NO JUSTICE. NO VENGEANCE. wtf. There is more shit, but these two points are the major ones that turn the story into a piece of shit. !<
