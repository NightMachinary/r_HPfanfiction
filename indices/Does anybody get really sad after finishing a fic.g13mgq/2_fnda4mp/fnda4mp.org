There are three fics that made me sad for two different reasons.

Both /Honour Thy Blood/ and /Stepping Back/ by /TheBlack'sResurgence/ were really great and I would have loved if they had been a tad bit longer. Come to think of it, the first-ever long-fic I read, /A Cadmean Victory/ also left me sad after becoming greatly attached to a few of the Characters.

/Antitheses/ is the other kind of making me sad, as it had a really depressing story and end to it. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed reading it, but it was just really dark.

I dread the day when some of the still open-ended one's that I am reading get finished, there is nothing like looking into your inbox to see a notification that a new chapter has been posted.
