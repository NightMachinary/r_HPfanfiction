Turns out everything this particular Dark Lord wanted has already happened one way or another - Muggles using versions of "his" magical communication stones that he was persecuted for trying to translate to non-magic terms, a centralized school for magic so that every Wizard is taught the same, Magical integration into the government...

"Wait, you mean to say they have devices, kind of slab-looking, that let them communicate across the globe? That sounds an awful lot like... YES! My communication stones, Muggles are using them, like I always wanted!"

"Hog... Warts? Wait, there's a school where magic is taught? A single, centralized school? VINDICATION!"

"Take over the Ministry for Magic? Wait... Ministry for Magic? Magicals have integrated themselves into... Muggle... Government? And why, exactly, would I want to push for separation here? All my life's work... It's all come to pass!"
