I have enjoyed interweaving religious themes and commentary in my stories, in part because magic makes it more relevant to the characters involved. The original stories dodged any particular exploration of the meaning of faith in a world of magic, simply because the author wanted to write a mystery-adventure series.

As a fanfiction writer, I appreciate the opportunity to play with those structures and investigate some possible deeper meanings to the story.
