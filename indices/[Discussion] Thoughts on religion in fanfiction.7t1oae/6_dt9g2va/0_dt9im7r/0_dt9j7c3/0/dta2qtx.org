  Even if that wasn't a stretch on its own, mendicant orders arose out of changes in society across Europe, mainly increased urbanization. Erasing all evidence of the orders is insane in itself, particularly because this is the Roman Catholic Church we're talking about, but you'd also have to somehow downplay 300 years of urbanization in order to not have an odd gap in Christian activity during that time period.

  You're going to need a lot more to convince me that the civilization which produced men like Arthur also could completely rewrite history without anyone catching on.

First, orders of Friars have existed in documentation since the 1100's. There is also an Order called the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crutched_Friars][Crutched Friars]] that purports to have been founded in the 1st century and revived in the 4th. Obviously we can't rely on Wikipedia for authenticity of research, but the great thing about a fictional history with a known element of being revisionist is that any hint of evidence can be leveraged as a mis-interpreted truth rather than an outright fabrication.

As for Arthur Weasley's competence as a reflection of the effectiveness of the worldwide Ministries who implemented and enforce the Statute of Secrecy, I think you've insulted all involved. Arthur is wiser than he acts, the Ministries are more competent than their current leadership and the Statute has been ably sustained for centuries.
