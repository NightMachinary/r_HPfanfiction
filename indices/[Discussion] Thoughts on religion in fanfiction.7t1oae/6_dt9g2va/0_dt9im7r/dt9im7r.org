The thing with "historical accuracy" is that the whole premise of the HP universe is that Muggle historical knowledge is wrong. All sorts of pre-Statute events (and even some post-Statute ones) had magical involvement which has since been erased from Muggle knowledge.

So, with mendicant orders, it could simply be the case that they existed much earlier than Muggles currently believe, but that this knowledge has been lost to them.
