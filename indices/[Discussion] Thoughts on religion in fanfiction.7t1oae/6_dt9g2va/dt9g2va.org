It's worth mentioning that the Hufflepuff ghost, the Fat Friar, was /actually/ a friar. For those that don't know, a friar was essentially a Christian (primarily Catholic) missionary who was intended to live a humble life, if not outright poverty. They'd travel, live on charity, and preach. They weren't allowed to take work or own property. That's why the joke is that he's a fat friar - you didn't get fat in his time by being a beggar, even if you were backed by the Church.

Of course, Rowling didn't set the standard too high for religion in the series. The Friar was born sometime in the 900s, long before any of the mendicant orders formed, even the ones nobody cared about. It'd be another 300 years before you had friars. I suppose you could say that his nickname isn't accurate and he wasn't a friar, but Pottermore does directly state that he joined a mendicant order after he finished his education.

Supposedly, he's also salty that he wasn't made a cardinal, even though the Church executed him for witchcraft.

Point is, as long as you take the 15 minutes to double-check your religious content, at least where it aligns with historical accuracy, you could probably do better than Rowling did.
