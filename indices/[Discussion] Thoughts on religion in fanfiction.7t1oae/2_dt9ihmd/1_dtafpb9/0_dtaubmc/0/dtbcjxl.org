My take is, it's /possible/ to Transfigure gold (and rather easily too), /but/ the Untransfiguration charm that goes with it is also /really/ easy. If such manmade gold that can be produced in any quantities was allowed any market value, the Wizarding World's gold-based economy would collapse, so paying in Transfigured gold is considered forgery; Goblins (and the more business-savvy wizard merchants) will test any gold that comes in with the Untransfiguration spell, and, if the gold disappears, the witch or wizard will stand a very good chance of taking a vacation of a few weeks to Azkaban.
