To me, the most interesting angle to approach this is not to think about Christianity, witch-burning etc. (from that angle I think it's clear that wizards remain culturally Christian but unreligious in character).

Rather to me the more interesting element is to consider the religious implications of magic itself. Wizards know the soul exists and survives bodily death. They know that there is some form of afterlife. And they know that many rules of the universe are anthropocentric, such as it being a rule of magic that you cannot create food from nothing - "food", of course, being a concept that is defined relative to humanity. Another example is the impossibility of making gold without the philosopher's stone - gold's special status, again, being a quirk of human society/history, not a physical fact.

These facts of life would surely impact the way wizards view the world in a way that is much more fundamental than belonging to a social group ("Christians", "Muslims" etc). In real life, the vast majority of religious people compartmentalise their religion - they still fear death, even if they believe in an afterlife, and they don't give away all their belongings, even if this is what their religion tells them is correct. Presumably this is because they have doubts. But for wizards, regardless of whether they have formal religion or not, those doubts simply do not exist. They know, with all the certainty that I know if I jump, I will fall, that these things exist.
