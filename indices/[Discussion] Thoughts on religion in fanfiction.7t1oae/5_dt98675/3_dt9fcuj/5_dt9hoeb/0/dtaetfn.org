Eight words. "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live".

A more important couple of reasons for the authorities to persecute them would be that people who don't go to the state-approved church are hard to control, because the church is where propaganda was preached, and that it's useful to have a minority that you can point at and blame when bad things happen.
