I think it's far more likely in the context of a world where magic is real the authorities and populace were much more concerned with magic users abusing their power and killing or enslaving people. While the idea that magical power would compete with spiritual power has merit, if people like Herpo the Foul are murdering to create Horcruxes and unleashing basilisks the drive to ride yourself of all magic users isn't just based in blind hatred or zealotry.
