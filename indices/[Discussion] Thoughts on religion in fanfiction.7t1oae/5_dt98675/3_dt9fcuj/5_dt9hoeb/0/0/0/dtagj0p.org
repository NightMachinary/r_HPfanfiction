The secular authorities actually tend to be fairly rational, and I think they'd be aware that most magicals were basically decent people with no desire to enslave everyone or unleash monsters.

And I wasn't talking about magical power competing with spiritual power but magical power competing with secular power, which merely used the spiritual as a tool. The Church of England was set up quite deliberately to bolster the power of the secular authorities, and the secular authorities /frequently/ didn't just tell priests what to preach about, they sent them sermons that they had to preach. Similarly the Catholic church was set up partly in ways that would maintain the church's secular power - bishops and abbots had vast lands, large incomes, and the ear of kings; the Pope was effectively king of a large part of Italy. Objection to that secular power dressed up as religion is in fact what sparked the Reformation, and so literally sparked many /many/ burnings of filthy heretics who disagreed about who should be in power. Few in power actually cared what religious beliefs people had, provided that they went through the motions, didn't cause a fuss, and supported the secular power.

Yer village witch, unfortunately, undermines the secular power by performing "unlicensed miracles", so burns as an enemy of the state.
