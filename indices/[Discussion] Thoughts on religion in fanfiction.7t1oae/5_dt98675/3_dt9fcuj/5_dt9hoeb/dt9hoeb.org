I mean yeah, I was explicitly trying to underline that the healing power of Christ is the reason people celebrate Christmas. Ron picked up the praying from Harry because he saw his friend doing that as was mentioned earlier in the story.

The idea that Christian witch hunts happened in the HP universe for no reason bothers me. Why is there never any discussion that maybe a Dark Lord DID arise and tried to take over prior to the creation of the Statue? Maybe the Spaniards were so fearful of witches because one had been using magic to enslave and subdue them and they were terrified it could happen again. People have this idea that witches and wizards were always the victims, but it seems to me that if anyone actually was using magic to hurt or enslave muggles (and seeing as how two dark Wizards in Europe during the 20th century wanted to do just that it doesn't seem unreasonable that over the course of hundreds of years there was more than one incident where muggles were abused enmass) then the reaction that they needed to burn witches would be more than a little justified.

It's the mutant problem in the Marvel universe all over. Sure, most mutants just want to be left alone, but when super powered people keep killing thousands and trying to take over the world, people hating them and wanting to destroy them is sort of a reasonable reaction.
