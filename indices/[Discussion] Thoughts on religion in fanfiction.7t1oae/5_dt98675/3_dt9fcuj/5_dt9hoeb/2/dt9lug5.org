Not to mention, the person critiquing the fic is completely ignoring the context of /why/ the Weasleys are praying.

There was an attack at Hogwarts just days before, and Ron came /very/ close to dying, as close as he ever did in canon.

I found nothing wrong from a religious standpoint with that scene whatsoever.
