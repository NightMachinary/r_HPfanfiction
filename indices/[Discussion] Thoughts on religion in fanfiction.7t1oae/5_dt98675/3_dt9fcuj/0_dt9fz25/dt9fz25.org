That's an interesting example and thanks for sharing it. Now question--is there any other mention of religion or worship preceding this event or is it all walloped on at once? If this is the first mention of it, then that's pretty surprising and I can see where it would be off-putting for a reader.

Dumbledore's funeral doesn't make any mention of religion or prayers and neither did Bill and Fleur's wedding. Both are presided over by wizards. By these illustrations, JKR clearly shows that wizards aren't religious (and I think she's said as much in interviews). I think maybe the Dursleys go to church? Maybe at Christmas? And of course leave Harry behind. I would tend to agree that a religious wizard would be a bit out of place, especially in the UK where, despite the figurehead of the government being the head of the church, there's a pretty strict separation of church and state.

For myself, I tend to lean toward a more pagan approach to things. To use California Dreamin' as an example, Harry and Ginny perform a handfasting presided over by Mr Weasley and they receive little pagan tokens as gifts from the local witches and wizards. Still trying to figure out that "godfather" bit, though. In the church, the godparents are responsible for the religious education of the child, but it's also popularly used as "you will take care of my kid if I die", which seems to be the case with Harry and Teddy.
