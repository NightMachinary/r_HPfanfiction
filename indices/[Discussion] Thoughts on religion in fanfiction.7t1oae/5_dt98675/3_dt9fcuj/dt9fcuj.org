  I don't think I've read a fic where religion is mentioned at all
#+end_quote

I've read a few. It's much like slash. I have no problems with it, as long as it's done well. Which just about never happens.

  "Merry Christmas, everyone!" called mum, bustling into the room with her hair still in curlers. When she looked at Ron, her eyes filled with tears, and she hurried over to the tree and started fussing with the presents. Mum had been crying a lot, Ron noticed. He turned his own damp eyes away. He had been too, though he wouldn't admit it.

  "Before we start," dad said, standing next to the tree gazing around at everyone. "I want us to all take a moment." He cleared his throat and looked a little embarrassed. "I'm not normally a religious person, as you all know, but today, after everything that's happened, I think we should take a moment to say thanks, and meditate on the fact that we're all here. Healthy and whole, and how easily it could be otherwise."

  Mum sniffed a bit, wrapping her arms around her husband and bowing her head. Every one else did the same, hugging the family member next to them. Fred and George even sat on either side of Percy and embraced their older brother. Percy for his part put an arm around Fred and George, looking solemn. Ron hugged Ginny and Bill, Charlie put his arm around Bill and reached out to hug his father, and Ginny clung to Ron. The silence lasted a long time, but it was neither awkward nor unpleasant. The entire Weasley clan took delight in the closeness of family and their love for one another.

Awww, isn't that nice? Gives me that warm and fuzzy feeling despite Arthur being "religious" instead of "spiritual", which would mesh better with a magical society, IMO.

  "I think we should pray for Neville and Dean and Seamus," Ron blurted. He looked around earnestly, trying to fight back the tremble in his voice, but he noticed that his hands were shaking slightly. He wondered if he'd ever be able to really play quidditch now. The healers said the cursed nerve damage was permanent."

WTF Ron? Where did that come from? /Pray?/ Your dad wanted to /meditate/, and you just burst out into religion?

#+begin_quote
  "Why don't you do it, Ron," dad said quietly, looking at his youngest son with pride.

  Ron bowed his head. "Dear God, or magic, or whoever is listening. Thanks that I'm OK, and that my family is here. Thanks that Neville is OK too. Wherever Dean and Seamus are, let them know that we were mates, and I wish I could have saved them and that I tried. Keep us all safe, and don't let nothin' bad happen again, OK? Thanks."

Very odd, but non-denominational. Definitely religious, but not overly so. It's still very unexpected coming from Ron, who has "the emotional range of a teaspoon" and all.

  *"For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, forever and ever, amen,"* Charlie said quietly. The rest of the family looked at him in shock. He shrugged. "Well, I guess I found more than dragons in Romania. They're a bit keener on church there than we are here. Not going to make a big deal about it, but I'll be praying for all of us a bit harder now."

See, that's my problem, right there. From meditation, to general sort-of-but-not-really prayer, to straight out in-your-face promotion of Christianity. It's proselytisation. Way to go Charlie, embracing the faith that persecuted, tortured, and murdered your ancestors for centuries. How very [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome][Stockholm syndrome]] of you. Why don't you burn a witch while you're at it.

I wonder, is the author trying to tell us something here? I have the feeling that someone is trying to remind us that there's a "Christ" in the word "Christmas". I've seen plenty of Americanisms, and this fic has it's fair share of them, but this is the most egregious. Americans might not react to it, but it looks very out-of-character for a born and raised European.

There's more. It's unexpected, it's embarrassingly blatant, and it's wildly out of character for everyone involved. /It's no longer Harry Potter/.
