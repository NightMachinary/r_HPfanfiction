  WTF Ron? Where did that come from? Pray? Your dad wanted to meditate, and you just burst out into religion?

To a lot of religious people, including at least some Christians, they're very similar. Prayer is very much /not/ just "saying words to God". That can be the outward manifestation of it, and words out loud are used to draw peoples' attention to particular concepts that they should think about.
