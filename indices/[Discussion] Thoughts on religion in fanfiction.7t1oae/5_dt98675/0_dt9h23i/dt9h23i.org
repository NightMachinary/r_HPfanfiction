  In the books, religion isn't a big part of the Wizarding world.

To be fair, religion isn't a major part of British society in any event. It's not something that people really discuss and those who do believe don't advertise it (and often themselves do not actually attend church). As an example, I found out recently that a friend I have known for 3 years is a Roman Catholic.

The depiction of Christianity within Hogwarts more or less lines up with the presence of Christianity in the life of the average Brit - public holidays, a few traditions, but no real religious significance to any of them other than a historical association.
