Luna Lovegood is a Christian in "Learning to Love Good" by Lia Kada. This one has some mixed reviews, but the religious aspects are actually handled fairly well.

"Goldstein" by Laazov is terrific: probably the most theologically sophisticated /HP/ fic I've ever read. As the title implies, it focuses on Anthony Goldstein and his experience at Hogwarts as he struggles to connect the fact that he's a wizard with the tenets of Judaism. Be forewarned, though: this isn't the kind of fic that's going to hold your hand and explain all the different background religious concepts. It may be helpful to get some context from [[http://axforthefrozensea.tumblr.com/post/80134273913/on-anthony-goldstein-judaism-in-the-potterverse][this essay]] first.
