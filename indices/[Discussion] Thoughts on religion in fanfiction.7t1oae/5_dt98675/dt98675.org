In the books, religion isn't a big part of the Wizarding world. They do Christmas and Easter, but they don't seem to have a Christian connection at all. It could be thought that wizards celebrate these holidays more in the pagan tradition, but that's not shown, either. Are the Patils Sikh, Muslim or Hindu? Do they celebrate Diwali? Ramadan? Could there be a fic where they do? Of course. Seamus Finnegan is Irish. Is he Catholic as well? Harry is Teddy's godfather, but was Teddy christened? Doubtful.

I don't think I've read a fic where religion is mentioned at all, but I do kind of wonder what role it might play.
