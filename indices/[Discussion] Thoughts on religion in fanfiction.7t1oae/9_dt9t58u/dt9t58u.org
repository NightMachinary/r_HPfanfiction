I like having religious characters and religion. One of my side-characters in my long AU is a very devout Jew, who'll be a rabbi once he leaves Hogwarts. There's mention of this because it's a big part of his character, but Harry doesn't go to temple himself, so of course it's not too in-depth.

The thing about religion is that a lot of fanfic writers aren't religious themselves, and sometimes forget that not everyone is an atheist, so of course there's not going to be too much religious dialogue.

And then there's many people who think religious wizards wouldn't exist - to me, I admit, that sounds a little silly, I admit. I've had people say that no magical person would be able to have faith in miracles, but most faiths aren't built on miracles, really? Faith isn't really about various "proofs".

But hey. Any community is always going to have its diversities.
