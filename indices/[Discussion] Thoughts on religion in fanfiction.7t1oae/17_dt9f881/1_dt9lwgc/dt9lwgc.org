Well, in my story "Patron", the wizards "went back to our pagan roots" after splitting off from the muggles in 1692 and started worshipping pagan gods again. But that was mostly done to sneer at the witch-hunting Christians, and after 1000 years of Christianity, they didn't so much go back to their ancient faith, but went "back" to what people in the 18th century /thought/ was that faith. So, they have pagan rituals and holidays, but only a few - "The Faithful", a splinter group - actually do believe in them. The mainstream wizards just go through the motions. With magic being real, what many would consider a miracle can be explained as (accidental) magic anyway.
