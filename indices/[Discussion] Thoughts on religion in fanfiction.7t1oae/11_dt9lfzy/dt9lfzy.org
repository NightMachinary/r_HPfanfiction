Religion, especially if it's one of the Abrahamic religions, is a major turn-off for me. I have dropped stories where major characters were religious. I don't mind as much as long as it's just window-dressing - people go through the motions, but don't actually believe the god(s) are real - or, sometimes, if there are "gods" as in powerful but petty and dysfunctional forces like the old Greek gods pitted against each other.
