I've delved into it for a few fics of mine because the only thing weirder than Harry Potter with religions, is any society without it. So once you take a closer look at wizarding society, I for one expect to see some sort of spirituality to eventually come up. You could probably argue that "Magic = Religion", but for the political fic I wanted to write that was a bit too little (and in general I find that a bit lazy. Humans tend to just jump to the next best "unexplainable" thing once their god turns out to be just nature doing it's thing).

I ended up having the magical society versions of the monotheistic religions as well as the norse and celtic pantheons, as I would imagine they'd be in modern times. It gave me a bit more grip and conflict between people and the whole Wizengamot. [[https://imgur.com/a/fMy7v][I did overdo it a bit]], but I think that is really the only good application of religion in HP fanfiction - to create more conflict and drama, especially in more mature fics as well as to worldbuild.
