The population of England rather like the Church of England precisely because it is a "venal, secular power structure". Countries like America where politicians talk about their religious beliefs, where people are expected to attend services etc are considered quite barbaric in comparison to the undemanding, "have some cake" version of Christianity offered by the Church of England.

The Church is the way it is because that's how the people want it - there for special occasions, but otherwise not butting into their lives.
