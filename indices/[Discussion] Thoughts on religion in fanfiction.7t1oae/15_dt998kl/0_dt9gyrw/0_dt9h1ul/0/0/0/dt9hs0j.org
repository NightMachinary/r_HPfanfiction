Well, firstly, I should say your history is wrong. It was Elizabeth I who founded the modern-day, protestant Church of England via the Elizabethan Religious Settlement. Henry VIII's church separated from Rome but was still fundamentally Roman Catholic in character - Henry was not a protestant. Although his actions set the ball rolling, in no way does the doctrine of the Church of England reflect Henry VIII's religious beliefs or outlook.

In any case, returning to the present, I think you simply do not understand the religious character of the British people. They are not yearning for some religious provision which they currently lack - they are completely disinterested in religion. This is something which is completely divorced from belief in God, which splits roughly 50% atheist 50% theist (according to the [[http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/latest-report/british-social-attitudes-28/religion.aspx][British Social Attitudes survey]]).

But here's the rub: even among those who do believe, most do not want religion to be an active part of their lives. 56% of those who consider themselves religious never attend a single religious service or ceremony, and just 14% of people who consider themselves religious attend any kind of service on a weekly basis. British people, whether they believe in God or not, do not want religion to actually occupy a significant part of their life.

All this is of course a modern trend. There's no basis to suggest that it has its roots in the nature of the Church of England as a state religion, since the British people remained highly religious for hundreds of years with that system in place. And if they merely rejected the Church of England, there are plenty of other churches to attend, or other religions to convert to. But it's not the Church of England that the people reject, it's all formal religion. The only religion which the people still subscribe to is that of vague spiritual sentiment.

In short, you have cause and effect the wrong way round with the Church of England. For many years the CoE /was/ morally demanding, evangelist, etc. Hell, half of the justification for the British Empire was religious in nature - the need to bring civilising Christianity to the world - and the British people under the Church of England were active in missionary work throughout this period, as well as moral crusades such as stamping out slavery around the world.

It was the British people who changed first, and the Church of England has had to change to catch up. The current stance of the Church of England is an attempt to appeal to the views of the people, not the cause of those views.
