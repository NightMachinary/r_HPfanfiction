Right. I think you proved my point for me. In Catholicism it's a both/and deal; you need to have both faith and works. So you can't say, "no matter what good you did in your life," as that good is part of the equation. In the Catholic view, you need to both have faith and live out that faith by doing good things.

However, the protestant traditions that profess the /Sola Fide/ tenet maintain that your works, ie, the things you actually do in life, don't matter at all. This was all one of the big points of contestation in the protestant reformation.

As for mortal sin, yeah, you go to hell /if you die in a culpable state of mortal sin,/ but mortal sin itself is easily and simply absolved in the sacrament of confession.
