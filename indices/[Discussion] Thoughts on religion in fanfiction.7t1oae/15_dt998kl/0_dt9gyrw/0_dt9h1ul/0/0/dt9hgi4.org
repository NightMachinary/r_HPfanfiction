I disagree in the strongest possible terms. The population of England moved towards that because their religion already was that. The church was created by a venal, secular man who wanted a divorce. This means that from its very inception, the church was designed not to serve the needs of the people, but to act as a weapon and tool of kings and princes. When people saw how the church was a white washed tomb that looked nice on the outside but was full of death and corruption on the inside, they decided that there was no point in acting like the church had some deep spiritual meaning or had any reason to be a part of their lives.

Religion is supposed to provide for the needs of people by providing a moral center and an explanation to the questions of life that rational thought (IE scientific reasoning) cannot provide. When the Church of England fundamentally failed in this mission because it was far more concerned about answering political questions of how and by what means, the people found new moral centers and did as their leaders: they called on the church only to provide political power and justifications.

In America we expect our leaders to attend church because that is still our (supposed) moral center. By being religious, the politicians are demonstrating that they share the same moral grounding and views as we do. This means that we can trust them to make moral decisions being in government requires. This isn't something people usually are cognizant of, but it's at the root of it. Religion HAS to be demanding because morality is demanding. If the religion doesn't demand something of you, it means that it cannot provide something truly meaningful for you.

Of course that gets into the whole issue of how often politicians everywhere use religion and religious trappings to grab power without actually believing the underlying axioms, but this post is long enough already. Suffice to say that because religion in America is separated from the state, it is more real, and therefore has the ability to make real demands and command real respect. People who want to turn America into a theocracy do not realize that ultimately they will undermine their own goal by killing their own religious structure and crippling it forever.
