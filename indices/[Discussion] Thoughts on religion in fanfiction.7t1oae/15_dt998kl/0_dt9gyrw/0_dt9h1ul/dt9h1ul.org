I am very familiar with the Church of England and how it exemplifies how much separation of Church and State benefits churches by preventing them from becoming venal, secular power structures that exist to serve the needs of the inhuman state instead of the human populace. Since the population of England are not idiots, they recognize the church as a falsified religion and reject it as it does not serve their needs as human beings.
