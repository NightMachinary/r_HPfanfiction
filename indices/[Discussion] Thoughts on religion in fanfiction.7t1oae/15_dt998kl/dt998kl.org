Religion is a fundamental part of the human experience. It's a human universal and is the basis for every culture on earth in a major way. Naturally, it would be a part of the lives of wizards as well. Exploring what religion would mean to a group of people who went into hiding in large part because of religiously motivated persecution and also have supernatural powers is facinating. It's something I've included in a lot of my stories because I think it's important.

Now of course, religion as a plot element has to be done well like anything else, but if you do include it in your story, even if it is well done, you are going to catch some flack. Many people on the internet are pathologically opposed to religion in any form and even the slightest mention of it well set them off, especially if religion is portrayed positively. This isn't any different than including politics or certain romantic relationships in your story so don't let that bother you.
