I am a fanfic writer and an active member of my local church. I have never tried to bring religion into HP fics because in my view it doesn't really fit. Despite a few nods to the Christian faith, the HP universe, as written by JKR, is essentially godless. However, that doesn't mean that concepts or ideas stemming from my faith cannot be explored in fics. Its similar to anyone else's beliefs; don't try and preach it screws the story up. I'm working on what i would call a faith based urban fantasy. My first draft was a disaster because I forgot to tell the story first and interweave the faith based elements with that.
