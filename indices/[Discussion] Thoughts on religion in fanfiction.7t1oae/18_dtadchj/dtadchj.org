I too am not religious. I used to be, and I wish I still was because the sense of belonging and community can be wonderful, but I just don't believe any more. I'm one of those irreligious types who occasionally goes to church anyway for the art. I went to a Latin mass in the local Catholic cathedral last weekend because they had Palestrina on the menu :-) Anyway ...

The two stories that really stand out for me in this regard both have Snape as a religious character. I can't remember what either of them are called, unfortunately. One has him as a Christian, with some kind of Christian art in his private quarters which Harry (or was it Hermione?) sees and Snape explains. His faith is fairly important to his actions in the story. In the other Auror Harry goes to arrest Snape, who is a Moslem because (I paraphrase) Allah is merciful, but he doesn't think he deserves Christ's forgiveness. The story's author puts it much better than me. I especially enjoyed the latter story, where the religions and theological differences were at the core of the story but also well explained (without breaking the fourth wall) and without preaching.

Others have had passing mentions of religious people (there's one where Sirius is taken in and cared for by a priest immediately after his escape from Azkaban, for example) but none of them that I've seen have been the focus of the story. And of course there are the mentions of Thor/Zeus/Christ/whatever as having been wizards who got a bit up themselves, but again I can only remember them being mentioned in passing. Those make me sigh at the author for being too obvious and having poor taste but they don't really detract from the stories.

It's a topic I'm interested in, and I very much like when it's done well. Usually it's not done at all, which is fine too. The only instances I can remember where it's done badly are first one (again I forget the name) where Hermione's parents are weirdo evangelicals who take "thou shalt not suffer a witch to live" a bit more seriously than normal Christians do. While they are persuaded to let her go to Hogwarts and they aren't horribly abusive (they don't actually murder her) she is treated poorly and I vaguely remember an attempt at exorcism. The second of course is the gloriously awful linkffn(Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles).
