My explanation to this dilemma is that the Creator is indeed almighty and powerful, he just doesn't consider humans all that important when trillions other experiments (some of them far more promising) are running.

We have only been dabbling in scientific research for a few hundred Terran years, an almost negligible time in geological history, and already deduced that billions of Earth-like planets exist in our galaxy. There are at least 2 trillion galaxies alone in our OBSERVABLE universe.

Humans take themselves way too seriously.
