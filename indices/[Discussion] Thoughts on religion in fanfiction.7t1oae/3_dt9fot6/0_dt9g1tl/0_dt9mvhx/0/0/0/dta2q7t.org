Well, I would say we don't have enough information about that yet.

Humans have only started to explore the Universe and made some good progress, but it's IMHO only the very beginning.

Only a few years ago most of us thought the Earth was flat and everything in the universe revolved around us - how arrogant, egomaniac, ignorant, and stupid we were!

On the other hand, our mind, our maths, our science, and our engineering give us the ability to actually understand this universe and its laws. We are the first specie (known so far) on this planet that has a fighting chance of long term survival and interplanetary expansion. I think we can be a little proud of that.

The more we discover, at least I marvel more about this universe. Whoever created it and lay down its laws deserves respect.

As for Christianity and other monotheistic religions, when they first appeared on the scene, they represented a HUGE IMPROVEMENT over their predecessors. Just remember what a bunch of narcissistic psychopaths Greek and Roman gods was: Cronos, Zeus, Mars....
