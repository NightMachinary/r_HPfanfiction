I'm not a fan of religion in HP fanfiction, as all to often is seems like the author is trying to force there religious worldview on both the setting and the reader.

I think it could be interesting, but would take a /lot/ of worldbuilding. How many pre-Roman traditions survived, what influence did the Roman Cults have on roman wizarding traditions, how did wizards interact with the church before the witchhunts, and the repercussions of the SoS. Then there are contributing factors like the fact that wizards lived longer, were better traveled, and better educated than muggles at least until about a century ago.

That's not even including the problems inherent in magic being real. How many miracles can be debunked or replicated with magic, what articles of faith can be disproven with magic. Herpo the Foul, an Ancient Greek Dark Wizard, the first wizard known to successfully create a Horcrux proving that wizards have had proof that souls exist and are somewhat mutable for millennia.
