Not interested in looking up this anime but perhaps an anthropomorphic being givesit to him to level the playing field if demon or another ab gives it to Riddle?

Or he could find it while looking through a book shop for a gift for hermione. And when he turns back after leaving the shop, it's gone.

Or a family prophecy is relayed to him by remus or sirius or someone and he has to to on a minor quest to attain it.

Or, while looking for something to have Janet Jackson sign, he picks up a book in a give-away bin outside a muggle bookstore.

Or, one day Hedwig arrives with it. No other explanation given in story. Ever. Let people speculate madly.

Or he finds it during a canon event. The basilisk expels it while dying. Or the mirror shatters and it's what knocks him out, not the death of Quirrelmort.
