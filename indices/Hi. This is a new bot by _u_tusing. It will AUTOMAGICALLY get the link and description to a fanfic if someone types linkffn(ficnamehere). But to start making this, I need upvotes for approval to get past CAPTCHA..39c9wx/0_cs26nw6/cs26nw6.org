- Everything /almost/ works. Now I just need to figure out how to handle errors (404, subreddit down, etc...)

Guys, I can confirm this. To start developing this, though, I need manual upvotes, otherwise Reddit's API never lets bots through the CAPTCHA.

It's been a really long time since I've developed in Python, so it will take some time to develop, and iron out bugs.

Lately, I've seen everyone likes to link fics. Though, that can be tedious, especially if you are on mobile. You have to /go/ to fanfiction.net, and then you have to /copy/ the link, /hyperlink/ it, and then /format/ the description. This bot aims to simplify it all - all you'll have to type is

#+begin_example
  linkffn(Dagger and Rose)
#+end_example

to link Dagger and Rose.

 

* *OUTPUT*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: output
  :END:
Output for

#+begin_example
  linkffn(Magics of the Arcane)
#+end_example

will look like this:

    /Sometimes, all it takes for a man to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Amid giants, there is no choice but become one yourself. If you want to keep on living, that is. [GoF, Mentor!Albus]/

Once I have the basics outlined, I'll start adding in more providers, such as AO3 and DLP. For these, the commands will be

#+begin_example
  linkao3(D.S.S. Requirement)
#+end_example

or

#+begin_example
  linkdlp(Santi Boy Who Lived)
#+end_example

 

*/Thanks, everyone! I can start working on this for real now./*
