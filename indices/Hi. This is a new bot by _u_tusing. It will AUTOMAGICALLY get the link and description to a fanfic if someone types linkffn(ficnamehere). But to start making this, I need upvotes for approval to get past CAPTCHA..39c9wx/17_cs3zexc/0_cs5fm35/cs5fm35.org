Maybe, but sometimes it doesn't change much for a whole year.

Either way, the bot grabs new stats every time it's pulled, so if a story has very few reviews during one pull, and then it gets a lot of reviews, the bot will grab the brand-new stats next time someone references them.

Either way, no one really reads a story by the number of reviews or favs, because let's face it - those are not indicators of how good a fanfiction is, especially in this fandom. You have really good fanfics, like linkffn(By The Divining Light enembee), linkffn(Conlaodh's Song enembee), and then you have absolutely terrible fics - linkffn(Harry Crow). No one in their right mind would choose Harry Crow over the first two just because of the number of favs/reviews - they're just an indicator of how /popular/ the story is, not how /worthwhile/ they are as a read.
