To me, all the points you made at the end of your post are additional reasons to drop fetching those data. If no-one reads a story based on reviews or favs, and those metrics aren't worthwhile for judging a story, why have them cluttering up replies?

Although, maybe it's difficult to parse out useful info (pairing, genre, rating, chapter count, wip/completed, etc) from the favs/reviews.
