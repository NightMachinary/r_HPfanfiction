I'm happy to help! I only read Hermione-centric fics, so I know how it feels to not be interested in the ones you have right now. If you like SSHG, I recommend tackling Pride of Time. I also love The Last Maruader (RLHG, TT) and Roundabout Destiny (SBHG, TT), but most people have read those already.
