linkffn(unsphere the stars) is a WIP and is beautifully written. The way they write about magic and power is so interesting. It's at 160k right now so almost to 200k. In the author's bio on FFN they map out what they're trying to accomplish by writing this story, and it's these things that make this Tom/Hermione story stand out to me.

linkao3(Blood and Gold) This is far from the word count you want, but it definitely has the potential to get that high (basing this off of the other stories they are writing/how they pace things). The author is writing a lot of stories at once, so this is a WIP but it's totally worth it. It's already one of my favorite Tom/Hermione fics out there and it's nowhere near complete. Their first interaction is probably one of the best I've read for this pairing.
