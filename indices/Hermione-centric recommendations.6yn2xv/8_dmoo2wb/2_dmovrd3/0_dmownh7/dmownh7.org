Redemption isn't quite the right way to describe it, but it's the closest among those. I guess I would call it a portrayal of a more human Tom, and a Hermione coping with the mental baggage of a very different war.

If nothing else, I would give it a look for the generally faithful characterizations and a unique handling of the time travel aspect.
