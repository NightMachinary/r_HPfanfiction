linkffn(10772496) Loved it! I started the first chapter several times and just didn't finish. But I started it again this week and oh my god I love this story! Spent 3 days reading it, one night I stayed up to 4am reading and I don't regret a thing! I usually lose interest if it's over 200k wording but I couldn't put this down! I was legit giggling several times during the story.

I recommend this from the bottom of my heart
