Nice idea, but let's not turn it into an incest/cheating nonsense

Now to more serious suggestions:

- Epilogue compliant setting obviously
- The story should begin after Lily Luna graduated from Hogwarts, so late 2020s, and may include elements of near future science fiction.
- I'd like to see Harry doing some concrete activities that made him question himself, such as excessive force he employed, vindictive thoughts he had, and more authoritarian/controlling policies he pushed through.
- What begins as some simple broom trip could lead to more exciting adventures
- This prompt may to tie [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5vmj3t/requestany_romance_fics_with_hermioneyounger_man/de4a16u/][my other idea]], which is a total soap opera and ships Hermione with Albus Potter. Here, Ron died in a broom accident which Harry blames himself for. When he knows of Hermione's relationship with his son, he's utterly pissed and basically breaks with Hermione, who then resigns her Minister position and leaves the country. From there, Harry is on a downward spiral and finally after some nasty incident, he starts to questioning everything.
