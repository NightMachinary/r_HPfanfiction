The Amazon is burned to a crisp, but a small number of trees and other plants survive; those that can regrow from their roots deep underground, those with fruits and cones that protect new seeds from fire, and magical trees that thrive on fire or have some way of escaping the flames.\\
Even as the Fiendfyre exhausts the fuel to be found in the rainforest and moves on to burn more ground, the Amazon regrows, with a radically different ecology but nonetheless reborn.

The flame continues to burn, spreading through South America and Mexico, to consume the entire landmass. Billions of people and wild animals are forced to flee, making for the coastline or the polar reaches, to try and escape the flames.\\
At first, it seems like the massive Fiendfyre might remain trapped in the Americas and burn itself out...but true to its name, the fire forms into fiendish shapes, fiery dragons and burning missiles taking shape to migrate over the Atlantic. Most of the fire burns out and perishes in the attempt, but enough embers reach the west coast of Africa and Europe to begin anew.

All land on Earth is burned, the fiendfyre growing and growing until it forms a great wave, sweeping east around the world every few months, scorching newly regrown land each time it returns.\\
Magical plant life, resistant to the magical flames, provides shelter for animals and seeds of other species, ensuring that even with the sweeping infernos, the land is green and full of life.\\
Humankind has turned nomadic, constantly travelling East to keep ahead of the perpetual fires; with the Statute of Secrecy shattered by the Fiendfyre, mage and muggle are unified, magic being used to accelerate travel and douse fiendfyres that try to corner the nomads.\\
And, under the sea, muggle industry, magical enchantments, and merfolk knowledge are being put together to form great undersea colonies, sedentary settlements safe from the cyclical firestorm...
