Yet another chance to recommend one of my favorite fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5501817/1/Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes][Something Wicked This Way Comes]] by the Mad Mad Reviewer has Voldemort as smart and classy. He still loses, but that's more due to the AU circumstances of the fic than getting handed the idiot ball.
