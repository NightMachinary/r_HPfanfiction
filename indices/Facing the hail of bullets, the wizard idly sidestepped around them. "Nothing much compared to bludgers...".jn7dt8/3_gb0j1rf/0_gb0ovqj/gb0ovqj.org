Out of universe explanation: Rowling is bad at math and intentionally designed Quidditch to be stupid. As such, any attempt to understand Quidditch or create a realistic game should probably ignore most of canon.

In universe explanation if you really don't want to ignore canon: Just because the brooms can go that fast doesn't mean that they always do. A high top speed does not necessarily imply rapid acceleration. And players may choose not to fly at top speed for greater maneuverability, sharper turns, and to give themselves time to react. And we only know the canon speed of the Firebolt. Older brooms were definitely slower, but we don't know how much slower.
