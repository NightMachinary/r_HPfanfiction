And quite frankly even with "movie magic" the scenes that showed brooms flying and a stable background (building, seated fans, etc) did not show anyone moving that quickly. I'd be surprised if someone did a speed calculation whether they would reach 50mph/73fps (assuming a 2 ft wide seat (average chair is 18" so being generous here), that means for one second of "flight" the broom would go passed over 36 people in a row).
