I would imagine that only the seekers would ever get up to those sorts of speeds, and even then, only in controlled bursts. Which also explains why the Wronski Feint is such a tricky move. I can imagine that they have a sport like motorcycle racing except in 3d where those speeds are more commonly reached.
