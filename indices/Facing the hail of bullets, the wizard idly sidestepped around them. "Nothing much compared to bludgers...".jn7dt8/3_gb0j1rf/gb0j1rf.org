I always wondered about this, actually. Like, how easy would it be for a stands-level audience member (or whatever you call the people who aren't in high boxes) to follow a Quidditch Game like that? The actual specifics, I mean - player goes this way, bludger goes that way, oh he saw the snitch type stuff. Or do they wholly rely on the omniculars and the announcer to actually make sure they know what the hell is going on?
