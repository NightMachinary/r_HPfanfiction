150mph equates to 792,000 feet per hour which equates to 13,200 feet per minute which equates to 220 feet per second

The muzzle velocity of a standard hunting .30-06 (7.62x63mm) round is 2700 feet per second which is over 12 times faster than your nimbus broom.

The standard military round 5.56x45mm is 3165 feet per second which is over 14 times faster.

So if the Wizard did not already have some sort of viable defense in operation prior to the trigger being pulled it's doubtful he could avoid a bullet especially if he was attacked from a distance as both rounds travel over twice the speed of sound. So the wizard would be dead before he heard the bang.
