There was a comic I saw once that had a Werewolf and Vampire standing side by side and being shot by a couple of soldiers.

The Vamp is "You cannot kill that which does not live."

And the Were "Only a silver bullet could kill someone like me."

The soldiers look at each other and open up with chain guns, leaving the Vampire and Werewolf in many many little chunks.

Maybe still what passes for being 'not dead' for each of them, but in little chunks.
