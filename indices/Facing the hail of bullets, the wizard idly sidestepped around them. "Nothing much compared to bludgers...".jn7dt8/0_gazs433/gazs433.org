This might work if they were baton rounds or arrows. Which are significantly slower [[https://emj.bmj.com/content/22/2/111]] however given that the trademark crack of a bullet is because it breaks the speed of sound which is over 700mph at sea level [[https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/sound.html#:%7E:text=If%20we%20consider%20the%20atmosphere,%2C%20or%201100%20feet%2Fsecond][https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/sound.html#:~:text=If%20we%20consider%20the%20atmosphere,%2C%20or%201100%20feet%2Fsecond]].

It's much less feasible.

You then need to take into account the profile of the different projectiles into account. Bludgers are 6" balls of steel wrapped in leather. A bullet is 6mm of lead. One of those is significantly easier to see coming at you than the other.
