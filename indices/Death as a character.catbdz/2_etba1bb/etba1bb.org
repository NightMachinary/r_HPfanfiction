linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16594244/chapters/38889167]]) has the character Death raising a Harry Potter in a universe where history went just a bit different. It's very well done but relatively new.

In linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675435/chapters/36417321]]) Harry is Death. It's very interesting in that it skirts the line between him being the character we know from the books and the fact that this is someone who is very much Death, an ancient being who's own universe is dead and gone. It's a pretty long fic that still regularly updates.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15768411/chapters/36679557]]) is another Harry Potter is Death, but it's short and complete.
