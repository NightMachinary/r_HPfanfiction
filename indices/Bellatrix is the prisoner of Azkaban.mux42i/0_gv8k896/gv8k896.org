In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19770283/chapters/46800730][The Changeling]] Bellatrix and Sirius escape Azkaban together, but it is not really all that important, it is there just so Harry could get more people on her side. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6614155/chapters/15133504][Full Circle]] Bellatrix takes Sirius' place as the escaped convict and wants to kill Harry.
