Not at all. "Rules-abiding Hermione" is a fanon invention. Hermione broke every rule (and every law) as soon as it got in her way in first year. Lying to teachers after the troll? Check! Snape might be trying to curse Harry? Set him on fire! Hagrid has a dragon? Help smuggling it out after curfew! Neville tries to stop them from breaking curfew again? Petrificus Totalus!

Hermione never met a law or rule she wouldn't break if she thought it would be justified.
