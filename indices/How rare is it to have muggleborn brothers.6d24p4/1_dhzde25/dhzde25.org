To be fair, the books don't cover the lives of the other students very well. Or at all, really. They're almost entirely Harry-centric, and he doesn't seem to have very many friends outside Gryffindor.

If you assume that it happens at least one time in each house (minus, perhaps, Slytherin), you could say that it's 3 families per 7 years, at least. But that's an assumption with no facts to back it up.
