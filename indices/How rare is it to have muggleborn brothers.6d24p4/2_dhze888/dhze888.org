Rowling has said it's genetic, so assuming it's a recessive trait you'd need for both muggle parents to have the gene and then for both siblings to get it from both parents.

Genetics is terribly complex, but if I remember bio 101 the most simplistic Baseline would be each sibling would have a 1 in 4 chance to be magical, or 1 in 16 collectively.

I should also say I hate the idea of it being genetic, and it's never explicitly stated to be genetic in canon, but that explanation makes the most sense.
