I've read all of the Temeraire novels thus far - the last book, /League of Dragons/, is set to be released on June 22, 2016 - and /Island of Fire/ is barely a crossover. It takes place in the same universe, in the same time period, but that's about it. None of the main Temeraire characters actually appear in the work.
