Try the (Island of Fire)[[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/205025]]] series. It's technically a crossover, but you don't really need to know anything about the other universe(Temeraire series) going in other than the fact that intelligent dragons exist and it takes place during the Napoleonic Wars.
