I though it wad not the wand, but the successess he gets from it's use.

​

If the world judges you on reading, and you have bad eyes, having good eyeglassess will help bolster your confidence, a "Maybe I don0t suck".

​

Now, becoming the mmost confident in a week, or explosive growth without putting in effort are poor things to do writing wise, but a wand can be a catalist to growth in confidence.

As you said, the wand shoudn0t be the end all, but it can certainly help.
