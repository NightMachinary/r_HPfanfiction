I agree that Neville's confidence in canon came from finding supportive friends who helped him put in the work to successfully improve his magical abilities. He then survived the fight against Death Eaters where he showed his mettle. This got Augusta Longbottom off his case and she started vocalizing her pride in him.

However, we can't discount the significance of the wand - his father's wand. Neville's grandmother is not over the death of her son and is desperate for Neville to emulate the memory of her deceased son that she stunts Neville's development. The wand and Neville do not complement each other (square peg/round hole) and are symbolic of how Neville was raised. Neville would have likely developed his confidence and magical ability sooner had he been in a more nurturing and accepting environment (where he also got a wand that matched him at age 11).

The downside to my last paragraph is that we don't know if we would have gotten the type of hero Neville became in Deathly Hallows. Would Neville have been as caring, helpful, and open-minded of a person?
