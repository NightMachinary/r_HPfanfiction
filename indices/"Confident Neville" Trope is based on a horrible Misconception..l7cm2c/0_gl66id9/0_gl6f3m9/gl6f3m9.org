I'll add an extra point here on top of Harry being an inspiration and a rather good teacher to Neville. His Gran. It's not the wand or even Harry who is responsible for his change in confidence, though that provides the impetus, but Augusta's change in attitude towards Neville from DoM onwards. I believe that is the single most important factor here, especially since it's her opinion that matters most to him. It gives Neville pride in himself that rounds out with her letter in DH.
