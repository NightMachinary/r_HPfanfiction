Idk if this is what JKR was going for, but I've always seen DH Neville as 'Harry-lite.' Inspired, in large part, by Neville telling the trio he stood up to the Carrows because he noticed it gave people hope when Harry stood up to people.

Regardless, though, Harry's importance to Neville's development is pretty underrated and why I think Neville would ultimately fail if their roles were reversed. Harry, admittedly, doesn't think much of him until the end of OotP, but it's clear he inspired Neville starting with "I'm worth twelve of you, Malfoy."
