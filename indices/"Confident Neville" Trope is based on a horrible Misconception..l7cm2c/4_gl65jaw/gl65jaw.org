  Stop using the wand as a plot point.

Don't stop using that as a plot point, if you enjoy it. It's your story, don't let a random redditor tell you otherwise, because their headcanon is different.

While Neville in canon started to get more confident before getting a new wand, afterwards he leads a freakin' rebellion.

Additionally, if you constantly fail at something because you have bad tools, you do become less confident. Yes, you should not blame tooling for every little issue you have, but imagine trying to learn to play the piano when it's untuned. Nothing you ever do will sound good, so what's the point?
