It's not a headcanon. Neville's development with magic was slow from the get go, even before wands came into the picture.

Also use it as a plot point. It's your choice. I'm just stating that by reducing him and his growth as a character because of a change in a tool he uses, will inevitably harm you in a story where you're trying to build him up.
