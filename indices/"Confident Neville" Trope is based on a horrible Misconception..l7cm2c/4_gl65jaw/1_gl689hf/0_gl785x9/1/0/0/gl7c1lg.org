There is very little evidence to suggest the same. Many people use wands that aren't perfectly matched to them throughout the shiseries. Ron, Neville, Sirius, Harry, Voldemort, and on multiple occasions, Draco. Hell Harry won the war using Draco's wand.

It isn't the reason for them to become really bad or improve massively. While a perfectly matched wand would work better, it isn't the deciding factor.

Perform better in his OWLs? Now it's rather speculative. There's two portions in an OWL, written and practical, and there's nothing to suggest that he was particularly great with the theory either for him to get a better grade. Also his wand didn't have any say in fighting the death eaters. The problem in the DoM was that they were outnumbered and Death Eaters were stronger and more experienced. So again, baseless.
