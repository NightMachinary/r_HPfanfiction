  Many people use wands that aren't perfectly matched to them throughout the shiseries. Ron, Neville, Sirius, Harry, Voldemort, and on multiple occasions, Draco.
#+end_quote

Yeah, Ron struggled with his spells because his wand didn't choose him. Sirius may or may not have struggled with his wand. Harry definitely struggles with Hermione's wand and Voldemort spends the whole of book 7 on a quest for a better wand. Even after he gets the elder wand he is unsatisfied with his spells because the wand is not fully cooperative.

  Hell Harry won the war using Draco's wand.
#+end_quote

Yes, Harry who had won his wand's allegiance beat Voldemort whose wand was allied to Harry. Clearly wand matching is far, far more important than any degree of magical ability or control (in canon).

  there's nothing to suggest that he was particularly great with the theory either for him to get a better grade
#+end_quote

If Nev had a matching wand his practical magic would be better. Fact. Part of the OWLs tests practical magic. Fact. Hence a matched wand would have resulted in better OWL performance.

  Also his wand didn't have any say in fighting the death eaters.

I don't know why you latch onto this. They fought Death Eaters. So what? Just because they could do something doesn't mean you couldn't do it better with proper tools. I'm sure I could do some origami with cardboard Amazon boxes. I could do better origami with paper. That's why people generally us paper. You can uae a potato as a battery but proper batteries are still better.
