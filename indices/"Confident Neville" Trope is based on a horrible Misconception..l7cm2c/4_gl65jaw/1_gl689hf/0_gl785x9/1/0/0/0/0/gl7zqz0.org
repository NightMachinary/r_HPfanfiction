  Yeah, Ron struggled with his spells because his wand didn't choose him

Cite it. Show me in the books evidence where he performed worse because of his poorly matched wand and then improved because it was match.

  Voldemort spends the whole of book 7 on a quest for a better wand

Because his perfectly matched wand can't do the job job he needs to do.

  If Nev had a matching wand his practical magic would be better. Fact. Part of the OWLs tests practical magic. Fact. Hence a matched wand would have resulted in better OWL performance.

I've addressed this enough times.

  I don't know why you latch onto this. They fought Death Eaters. So what? Just because they could do something doesn't mean you couldn't do it better with proper tools. I'm sure I could do some origami with cardboard Amazon boxes. I could do better origami with paper. That's why people generally us paper. You can uae a potato as a battery but proper batteries are still better.

Fighting against terrorists is a so what..? Ok.

Your parallel inapplicable. With respect to origami paper/cardboard and potatoes, those are the sources which generate the end result. A wand is a focii or medium.

Yes using a proper focii would always be better. But my argument isn't that.

My argument is that the source i.e. Neville is great by himself and writing his success down to his focii discredits him greatly. The guy had one of the best arcs through the story. If you really believe that all he needed was a wand to develop as a character - you're gutting the character and hampering his development, which effects the quality of your writing, which is the point I'm trying to make.
