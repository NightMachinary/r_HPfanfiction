  It's not a headcanon. Neville's development with magic was slow from the get go, even before wands came into the picture.

His development was fine. There's no canon correlation between the number of incidents of accidental magic and the potency of the wizard's magic. His failings with magic come from having a bad tool. This impacts his confidence which further weakens his abilities. Give Nev a matched wand and he'd be awesome.
