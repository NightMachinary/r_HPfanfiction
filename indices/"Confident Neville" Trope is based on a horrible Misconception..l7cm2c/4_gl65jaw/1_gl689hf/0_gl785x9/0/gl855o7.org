The thing is, there seems to be no reference in canon outside of Ollivander's advertising spiel that wand 'matching' is in any way a big deal. Ron cheerfully states on the train in the Philosopher's Stone that he is disappointed in his wand because it is falling apart (the unicorn hair is literally poking out), not that it wasn't 'chosen for him'. He says that Charlie used it in Hogwarts before him, suggesting that for the Weasleys, and probably many others, using hand-me-down wands at school is normal without any problems. Ron's wand is literally broken for the entire of second year, but none of the teachers care and outside of a couple of specific incidents, doesn't seem to impact his work at all. I presume Crouch Jnr. spent the entirety of book 4 using Moody's wand. Voldemort was using Lucius' wand in book 7 and killed Moody with it, probably by far the most dangerous of all of his enemies.

The entire 'wand loyalty' mess in book seven also implies that all the stress fanfic puts on matching wand materials to its owners is utterly irrelevant, as long as the wand is 'yours' it will work for you.

Fanfiction writers are free to make wand matching important in their stories, as long as they don't make it just apply to Harry and Neville, but that isn't what happens in canon.
