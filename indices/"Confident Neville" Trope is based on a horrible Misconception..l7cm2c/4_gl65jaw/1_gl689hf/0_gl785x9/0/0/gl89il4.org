I'm not saying a wand is useless if it isn't matched to you but it seems pretty clear in canon that for optimal results you want a wand that chose you. Harry waves hundreds of wands in Ollivander's before he finds one that works properly for him.

I also think wand matching is pretty clear when Harry's spell overpowers Voldemort's because Harry has the loyalty of his wand and of Voldemort's.
