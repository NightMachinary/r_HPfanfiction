I think part of it is mental as well. Neville doesn't believe he's good enough to step into his father's wand and therefore not good enough for his dad's wand.

When he gets a new wand in fandom he is indebted to whomever tells him to get a new wand as well as the knowledge that this is fitted to him. If it's a crap wand then that stands to reason with him because he is a crappy wizard according to his thoughts.
