I think it depends in part when he gets the new wand. If his father's is holding him back (which I think is likely) and he gets a new one in say, 2nd or 3rd year, I can see how that would go a long way towards bolstering his self-esteem and we would see a jump in his skills as well. Probably not immediate but it wouldn't take long. Maybe end of term? But the one would feed into the other.

Post 5th year, after the battle at the Ministry, it is more of a better tool but he's already gotten a boost in self-esteem. After all, they held out against how many inner circle Death Eaters. He held his own. I like the concept that with the new wand at this point, he's overpowering his spells because he had to work so hard with the old one. So it helps, but he's already gotten proof that he's got the power/ability.

Edit to note that the mindset does not come overnight. He doesn't get a new wand and wake up the next morning all confident and a BAMF. I can accept him getting there /at a minimum/ after a summer's practice with the new wand. The seeds are there (Gryffindor, courage to stand up to 3 of his fellow students--one of whom definitely outweighs him magically, for example); a new wand will help bring out his confidence, but we're not talking Jack's beanstalk here.
