Not for nothing, but while he definitely gains confidence by training during /Order of the Pheonix/, I also have to point out that a new wand earlier would contribute to him being more confident.

Not all his issues stem from his wand, of course, but at least some of his self confidence issues were reinforced by it. His wand was horribly mismatched, and that made casting much more difficult for him than other students. This probably contributed to reinforcing him internalizing the idea that he was barely better than a squib.

A wand alone wouldn't have made him confident, but it would have been one less thing contributing to his negative self-image.

I mean, some goes from being dressed in rags to a proper outfit, and their self-confidence raises almost instantly. How much of an effect would a properly matched wand make?
