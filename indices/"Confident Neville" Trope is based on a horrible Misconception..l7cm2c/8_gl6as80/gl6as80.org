The only fics I've read with confident Neville are all about him just getting some confidence and/or guidance thanks to Harry. Only one I can think of had him get a new wand, and even then it wasn't the sole reason, it was still coupled with instilling him with confidence.

Maybe I've gotten lucky. What fics have you been reading if I may ask?
