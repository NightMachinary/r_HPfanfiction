Family Bonds by xXDesertRoseXx. It's a WBWL, Harry raised by Snape fic.

It was one of the first I read, so I remember it fondly but it's been a while since I've read it.

It's incomplete unfortunately, but it was nice to read.

I think I recall a few more but my memory is a bit murky. I'm not sure how Harry Crow or Partners went so I can't recommend those in good faith. Off the top of my head though, these are the three that come to mind. I'd recommend sticking to Family Bonds though because Neville in that story is pretty cool.
