Sure. I'm always open to new fic recommendations =)

Two that come to mind that were building confidence first were harry potter and the methods of rationality (I don't remember neville even getting a new wand there) and nightmares of future past, in which he did get a wand but he was already doing much better before that. Those also happen to be 2 of my favorite fics along with the psychic serpent trilogy. But yeah, I just haven't encountered that specific scenario when the trope is present so was wondering. You are right those are probably not worth reading.
