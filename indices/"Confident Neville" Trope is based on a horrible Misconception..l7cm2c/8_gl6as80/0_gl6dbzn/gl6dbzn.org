Misunderstanding here.

Not talking about specific Fics, but a common trope.

In these Fics, Harry always plays a key role. Usually the trope is Harry is a guy who learns politics and wizarding culture from books, is super dedicated to beating Voldemort, is grey, inherits a lot of things etc.

He finds out Neville, who is usually a replacement for Ron in these Fics, is using his dad's wand. May or may not have a rant on how that's bad. Gets him a new wand. Neville, gets confidence and starts becoming a prodigy in magic, second to Harry though, and voila. May or may not feature forays into wandless magic.

Can't really name the Fics. Generally these are the ones you close and put out of sight and out of mind. But it's pretty common as a trope. You'll find it littered in abundance in Fics where Neville plays the best friend, Harry inherits more than one vault, or grey Harry fics.

It's prevalent in a more subtle manner as well. You'll find Harry watching them practice in the RoR, (may or may not be related to the DA and Fifth year), and observing to himself "Ever since Neville received a new wand that matched him perfectly he had become a new person" or "changed overnight" or along those lines.

I don't keep track of Fics that leave a bad taste so I can't help you out with bad ones. However if you want recommendations of where I believe Neville was developed in a better manner, I can help there.
