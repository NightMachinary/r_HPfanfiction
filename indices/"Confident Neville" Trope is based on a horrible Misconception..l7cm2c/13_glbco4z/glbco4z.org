The way I see the new wand as a tool of Neville's development is because with it suddenly things he's been struggling with come easier. To me it makes sense I'm fics that only cover a year or two as a short cut to Nevilles confidence without the build up in cannon, however in stories that come anywhere close to the timeframe of the books yeah it's lazy and doesn't do justice to Neville.
