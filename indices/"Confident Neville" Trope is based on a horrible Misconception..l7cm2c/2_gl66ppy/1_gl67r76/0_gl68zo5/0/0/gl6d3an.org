I think there was a period in this fandom when people either used as reference some fics that picked parts of the books that favored their plot and ignored parts that were not compatible or they only watched the movies (hence tropes such as Lord Potter Whatever or Goddess Hermione)... but now I feel people are returning to the original series and, therefore, I think your point about Neville is agreeable for most.
