  Neville was just slow and grew up as a character

Yeah I agree. That's what the entire post is about. I'm trying to state that the character development of Neville in the books isn't because he changed his wand.

I don't personally like Neville as a character. However to reduce the development and growth of Neville to a change in an instrument that he uses, is just ruining the character and your own writing.

It wouldn't make sense unless you're writing something like "The Mask". Humans don't develop confidence because of something they use.

Neville became better through effort. He became more confident as a person through trials, time and ultimately growth. The wand wasn't that important.
