Well everyone can write their characters however you want and every reader is free to choose what they want to read.

Now in all seriousness, we all had that classmate who was a bit slow but was otherwise a functional human being. That's Neville for you. I agree that in DH he is forced to take charge and before that he is struggling to keep up/catch up, but since it doesn't go against what JK said, I believe that everything with regards to the situation presented by you is fair game.

Oh, and the theory with the wand was pretty popular both in Ron's and Neville's case and it's based on the fact that Harry didn't feel comfortable using a wand that he had for like a month (not for years like the two). Neville was just slow and grew up as a character and Ron was fucked over by the movies. The explanation is as simple as that.
