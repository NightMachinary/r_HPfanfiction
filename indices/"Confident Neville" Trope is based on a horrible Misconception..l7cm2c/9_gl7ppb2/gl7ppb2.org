Not sure why someone couldn't do both? His insecurity seems to come from the fact that he was thought to be squib (which is why his uncle or someone throws him out the window), and the fact that he's rather bad at magic (which should be at least in part caused by the fact that the wand he's using is not his).

We can assume that if he had a wand that did choose him, he would get slightly better results right off the bat, which should slowly build up his confidence.

I can agree that changing a wand shouldn't turn Neville into some master-magician right off the bat, but there's no reason why it shouldn't help him grow more confident, but-by-bit.
