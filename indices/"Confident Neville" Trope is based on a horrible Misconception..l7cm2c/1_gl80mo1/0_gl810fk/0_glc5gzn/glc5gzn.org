To be fair, Neville is one of the lesser issues when it comes to lacking character dimensions. Fanfiction often revolves around bashing of some sort or the whole hero vs evil thing, and to an extent all are fine. The problem is they are often overdone to caricaturize certain characters into their biggest flaws or benefits. Dumbledore, Ron, and Snape are 3 clear examples of it. All receive significant bashing and then there is the "Snape is the nicest, best guy ever" section which is equally bad. Rowling, for all her plot holes, did a good job of reflecting different dimensions of characters.

When I write, if I dislike a character, I will simply tend to minimize their role to avoid bashing but also avoid using them as central points.

That being said, it is ultimately up to the author to choose. If they want to bash or attribute Neville's wand as the sole confidence issue, they can. We can use this area to provide suggestions, but not complain, as it is their work.
