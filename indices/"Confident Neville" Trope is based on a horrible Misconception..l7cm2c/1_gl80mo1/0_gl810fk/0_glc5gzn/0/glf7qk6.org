To be fair, I said that in most instances, he get's a wand - his personality changes overnight. It's a trend that is extremely rampant.

One that is influencing younger and newer fanfic writers. The other day, a person I beta for, did this in their story. When I asked why, they said they wanted a confident Neville. I didn't care about that, their story. I asked them, why was the wand change that important and they honestly believed the wand was why Neville changed.

I've seen this trend happen with fanfic writers. After a point you forget certain canon details, and that's fine. It happens. Many can't even read canon again.

But when people start believing in fanon, and it affects their writing in a style that is detrimental to them, it is bad.

If you believe Neville's wand is the sole reason, go for it. But most often, whenever people go down that route, his character development is shot to bits because people don't care about it anymore, they don't focus on it or build it up. It's just a switch. Which from a writer's perspective, is very bad. Not only does it kill your word count. You lose interest, conflict, subplots and emotional connect from the reader.

You need character development.
