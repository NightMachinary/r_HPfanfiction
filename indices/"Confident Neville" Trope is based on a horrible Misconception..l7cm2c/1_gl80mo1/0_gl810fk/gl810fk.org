Thank-you! Exactly what I've been trying to communicate.

Everyone writes him off saying better wand, better Neville. They completely ignore that his parents were tortured, he wanted revenge, the pain and rage he felt within him.

They completely disregard the fact that after the breakout, he was singularly focused on improving and being able to fight and working hard towards it

They write all of that off by saying "got a wand, he can do magic now, he'll be great. " Which is horrible character depth because there isn't any dimension to the character if you do that.
