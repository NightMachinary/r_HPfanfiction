Wow that's a paragraph ._.

Ok, confident Neville, is just the term people use to refer to him in my experience. Neville who is bad ass etc etc. I'm not really focusing on the confidence part.

Regarding confidence and his development. I might have made a slight mistake through the course of my post. I used the term confidence in a lot of places where I should have used growth or development because that's what I meant. My bad if it caused confusion.

So what I'm trying to state is, the development of Neville in those Fics, in my experience, is often keyed to his wand. It's - get the right wand = become Harry's right hand man who is super confident and powerful in those Fics. They downplay the other factors, if they exist, and push the wand of Neville to be the key factor behind his development. Which I feel affects the quality of the writing, because you're essentially robbing the character of growth.

  o you take the fanon Neville trope and you have a boy who usually in first year is accepted and befriended by (according to the wizarding world at large) the most popular influential wizard who thanks to said wizard doesn't ever grow to think he is even magically weak because a properly matched wand shows that he is more than powerfully magicall

I couldn't exactly comprehend this bit. English isn't my first language and despite being reasonably fluent, I have a bit of difficulty sometimes.
