Lol It was poorly written. My apologies. I was basically saying that (from what I have observed) the trope is a little different. The trope as I see it is mainly: Become friends with Harry who then insures that Neville gets a properly fitted wand, this leads to Neville never lacking much confidence in the first place. Without that lack of confidence in his magic/ability and his friendship with Harry, Neville develops (or already has) the confidence to show his power from nearly the beginning. And I was basically saying that from what I have read (for the most part) it is Neville's friendship with Harry that makes him super confident. I totally agree that this is used to explain away all of his other issues though. Although to be fair being best friends with the most popular person in the wizarding world who accepts and values you would be a huge ego boost. And because in most of these fics since Neville replaces Ron, there is no impetus for Harry to slack off all the time. So they both live up to their potential from the beginning. It also tends to go along with the trope that Neville is the gateway for Harry to the wider wizarding world (learning about his inheritance and titles).
