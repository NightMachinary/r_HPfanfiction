I understand where you are coming from but I disagree. Our experiences make us who we are. Neville's experiences as far as I can tell are of what seems to be a seemingly magically weak, unpopular boy, who is constantly being made to feel like he isn't good enough while at home. So you take the fanon Neville trope and you have a boy who usually in first year is accepted and befriended by (according to the wizarding world at large) the most popular influential wizard who thanks to said wizard doesn't ever grow to think he is even magically weak because a properly matched wand shows that he is more than powerfully magically. If confidence is the major point in Neville's development in canon, in the common fanon he has that going for him in spades. And it all starts as soon as he is befriended by The Harry Potter. He now has the confidence to disclose their status as god brothers and recognizes his worth to Harry by being much more knowledgeable about wizarding society. It also should be noted that in a whole healing lot of these fics Neville is placed on a near equal level with Harry as far as power goes and more than a fair few wind up as (or near) Super Harry fics.

I get where you are coming from but yeah...
