[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5442672/0][The Truth]] a harem fic, where it's not illegal but the effects of multiple women having coinciding menstrual cycles is so dangerous that (smart) men won't do it. And not just, 'oh they're menstruating at the same time' but like, the "magic" creates a feedback loop of rage. It's mildly hilarious.
