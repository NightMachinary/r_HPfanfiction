I'm currently reading this story so thought I would put in my 2 cents.

I would say it's not the extra words so much, as I've read plenty of easier to read fics that padded as much if not more, as the word selection. If we go back to Word and paste this story in and check the writing level, I'm sure it would weigh in at 11th grade level at least; most fanfiction doesn't go beyond 7th or 9th probably.

It actually reminds me of some classical 18th or 19th century romances, decent writing but rather dry, which is what got me thinking about why it was so difficult to read.
