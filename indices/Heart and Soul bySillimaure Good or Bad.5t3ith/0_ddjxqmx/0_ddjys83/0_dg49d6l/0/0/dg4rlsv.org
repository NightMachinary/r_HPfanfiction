Yes, but the author might not be an expert writer, as fanfiction authors usually aren't. About 90% of the time they're young and just getting into writing, retired and taking it up for a hobby, or ESL and writing for the experience. By the author's previous pen name (Jedi Emeritus, which you can see in some of their author notes), I suspect they're retired. Given this, and the fact they're not getting paid and we get all this for free, I'm inclined to cut most of them some slack (while leaving constructive criticism where I can, of course).

For that matter, if it weren't for my inherent laziness, I suspect I would be the overly-wordy sort of author as well. /shrugs/
