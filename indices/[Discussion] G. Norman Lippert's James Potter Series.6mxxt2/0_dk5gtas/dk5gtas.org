I've read the first book of this some time ago. It was very good, and very well written. But I couldn't get myself to like it, and I don't know why exactly. The best I could come up with is that it's simply good. It's written professionally, and good writers have their own styles that makes the story theirs. And so, this series didn't feel like a "Harry Potter" story to me anymore. It's got it's own identity already, and it's not the world of J. K. Rowling anymore. Specially with the American cultural themes included, which clashed horribly with my internal Potter universe.

But that's just me. Like I said, it's a very well written series and I think most people would really enjoy this. I specially liked how book 1 ended. But it's not really for me. Just my two cents.
