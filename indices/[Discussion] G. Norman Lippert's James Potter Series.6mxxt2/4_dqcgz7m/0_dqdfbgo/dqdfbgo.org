Me kinda, too. [[/spoiler][I think it was supposed to feel sort of like a happy ending with the ghost but becoming a ghost was supposed to be a bad thing, i.e. unfinished business. No one who died for the greater good in Harry Potter became a ghost, they all moved on. Also it seems weird that James would be content, considering earlier in the book he says/thinks something along the lines of that his love for Petra would be the flame that never dies. Especially as we've seen in Books 2+4 there is clearly some existance beyond death so if Petra has to die I feel like it would make more sense for him to go with her.]]
