It's 5 books, so a summary is pretty difficult.

It's a coming of age tale for Harry's son James. It involves getting out from under his father's shadow, dealing with completely new evils, includes new types of magic, includes romance (which is a driving force, but it's far - far - from a fluff piece), and includes very imaginative story lines.
