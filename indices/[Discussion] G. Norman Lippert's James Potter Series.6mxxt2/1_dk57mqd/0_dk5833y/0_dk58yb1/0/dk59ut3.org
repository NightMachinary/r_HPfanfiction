- Well the stories include sorcerers/sorceresses who have different and more powerful magical abilities than wizards/witches. They have much greater control of the certain elements, particularly greens, oceans, and urban areas.

- A specific teacher (though it's in book 5) develops the ability to program spells into his wand which allows the wand to read the type of magic that is coming toward the holder of the wand.

- Fate plays a significant role, and while it's magic so plenty is left up to the imagination of the reader, in some ways Lippert does a better job of explaining the way things work than JKR did (at least, by the end of book). An example of this is the magic that goes into sacrificing oneself to save another, and the protections that follow. How that works is actually explained, at least in this author's opinion.

- Hand in hand with fate is the exploration of Seeing and predictions of that nature.

- Without going into too much detail, book 5 includes a completely new concept to me that tied specific powers and responsibilities to a lineage based on color. (e.g. the ancestral house of Black has a specific duty, benefits)

- There's also a lot of what is called "game magic" tied to a game like quidditch. This involves types of spells that can only be dodged to avoid the impacts of it, but also can't be used effectively outside of the game.

- One of main schools outside of Hogwarts features a boulder as a guardian, and it travels the people trying to get into the school to the school through time as opposed to through a gate.

I'm sure there are a bunch more I'm forgetting on top of my head, but seriously, the biggest pros of the story are the imagination of the author. He creates new magic, and uses old magic in new ways.
