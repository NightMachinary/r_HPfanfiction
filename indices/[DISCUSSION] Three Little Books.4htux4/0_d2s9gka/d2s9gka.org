I'd go with Lord of the Flies, because the wizarding world definitely needs to learn about the darkness of man's heart and how societies can collapse.

George Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London, which I think is better than Animal Farm and 1984 (though wizards should probably read them too).

Oh, and Matilda. Would possibly help them empathise with Muggleborns a bit more.
