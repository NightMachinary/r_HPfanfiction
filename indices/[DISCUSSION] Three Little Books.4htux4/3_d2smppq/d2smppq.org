[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Luck_of_Barry_Lyndon][The Luck of Barry Lyndon]], because I don't think that the magical world would pick up on the 'unreliable narrator' and that could provide for some funny misunderstandings about Muggle culture.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Branches_of_the_Mabinogi][The Mabinogi]] because it could provide some interesting discussions in magical academic circles in the fields of magical history and Muggle studies.

And just for the hell of it, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watership_Down][Watership Down]] because I think children of all backgrounds would love a story about talking rabbits with their own culture.
