/Macbeth/, a classic tale to teach Slytherins that maybe, just maybe, they should cool it with their ambition.

/A Scanner Darkly/, because it would be hilarious to see wizards and witches try to wrap their heads around dystopian sci-fi and drug culture. /Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?/ could be a suitable substitute, if not ASD.

/The Sun Also Rises/ would be great for the generation just coming out of the war with Voldemort, because of how it explores the themes of people coping with the trauma of war and living in a post-war society.
