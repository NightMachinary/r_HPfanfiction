For me, I'd probably throw in Les Miserables, for the way it comments on society, revolution and the split between the classes. Generally it's a book I think everyone should read, even wizards.

Then, Terry Pratchett's Soul Music. I think it brooks some interesting questions about the nature of magic, morality and death, and I'd quite like to see the wizarding world respond to not only a different idea of the magic they live with every day, but also a personification of death that's so much more flawed and almost human than the one they see in the Tale of The Three Brothers.

Then, for the Hell of it, Fifty Shades of Grey, because I just love the idea of it gaining the same cult popularity amongst Purebloods as it has among Muggles.
