If I was going to describe real court proceedings I'd need only one word: tedious.

Even if the subject matter is juicy as all get-out, it's tedious. I mean, sure, I could write an accurate court proceeding fic but no bugger'd want to read it. It's un-canonical anyway, all the court proceedings we see in the actual books are flat-out kangaroo courts. Which are much more fun, provided you're not the defendant.

Probate is even worse: I passed the exams in order to qualify, just like I did for conveyancing, but I'd have gnawed off my own leg to avoid doing either in actual practise. The eight months of it I had to endure as part of my traineeship was bad enough.
