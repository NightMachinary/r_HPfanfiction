I remember reading a fic in which he filed a petition to goblins for his financial records to be sent to him. He got a as McGonagall put it "a ten foot high pile of paper involving personal records delivered to the middle of the Great Hall fifteen minutes before class starts."

It's a gamer Harry fic and it was a quest and since the Goblins weren't required to send a summary he had to get all the records.
