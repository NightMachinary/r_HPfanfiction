All this demonstrates to me is how horrible bureaucracy is at handling inheritance. Having recently gone through this (five years and going for my mother --- and the will is completely equitable and unchallenged), I can only nod in agreement, that this is how the Ministry would do it.

It is also 98% unnecessary and, by the way, 0% tax should be due in a inheritance. That's not, and never has been the government's money, (and it's all been taxed at least once anyway). Fortunately in fiction, you CAN have the goblins do it. They'd certainly be more fair than any human government.

EDITING to say: it's only the truthfulness of this passage that gets my ire; i actually find it hilarious. Sorry that I didn't make that clear originally.
