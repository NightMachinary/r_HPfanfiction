  A treaty is a formal written agreement entered into by actors in international law, namely sovereign states and international organizations. A treaty may also be known as an international agreement, protocol, covenant, convention, pact, or exchange of letters, among other terms.

"Minted coins don't count as 'Goblin-Made items', as they are not unique and bulk casted."

That's how treaties work. Even if I entered Goblin jurisdiction, they would still have to follow that. According to treaty. Doesn't matter if I'm willingly in their jurisdiction.

And seriously, if any Goblin pulled that for Galleons? They would be laughed at. They are literally cheapening the real Goblin-Made artifacts that that whole spiel was really made for.
