Why would wizards ever make such a distinction, Wizard law doesn't even allow Goblins to claim any normal 'Goblin-Made items' after the death of the owner.

The point here is that a wizard willingly subjected himself to goblin rules without doing his research, the ministry has no motivation to intervene here.
