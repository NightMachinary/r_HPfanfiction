No, like any person can reach an agreement with anyone anywhere that their dealings will be governed by a set of rules that they mutually agree upon, in this case Goblin law.

In England I can agree with someone that our dealings will be dealt with under United States law and the courts will enforce that. In Singapore people can agree that their dealings with be governed by English law and the Singaporean courts will enforce that.

The idea that people can agree upon the rules governing their relationship is incredibly normal and would not "start a war".

The premise of the above snippet is that Gringotts is within wizarding jurisdiction and is governed by wizard law, not Goblin law (because the Goblins keep losing their rebellions). But that does not preclude an idiot from coming to a private agreement with the Goblins that their individual relationship will be governed by Goblin law rather than wizarding law. That has no impact on any treaty; it's a private agreement and the consequences are the individual's own fault. No precedent is set, and the consequences pose no threat to other wizards.
