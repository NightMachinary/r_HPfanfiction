The premise behind the snippet is that Goblins can only do so if the wizard willingly submits to Goblin jurisdiction - much like how in the Muggle world, you can submit to a sharia arbitration if you so wish.

In the absence of such submission, regular wizarding law would apply, which does not recognise the goblin concept of ownership.

No pure-blood would submit to Goblin jurisdiction, knowing what it would mean, and anyone who did would be considered so monumentally stupid that they had it coming.
