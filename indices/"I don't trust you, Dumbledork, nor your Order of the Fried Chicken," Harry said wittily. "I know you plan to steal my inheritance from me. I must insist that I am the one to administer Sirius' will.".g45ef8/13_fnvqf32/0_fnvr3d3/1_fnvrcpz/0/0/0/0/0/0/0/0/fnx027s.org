  Why would wizards ever make such a distinction, Wizard law doesn't even allow Goblins to claim any normal 'Goblin-Made items' after the death of the owner.

There's loads of difference between goblin-made items like a sword, or tiara and currency. The sword and tiara are products. Currency is exactly that, currency. And the currency is highly likely to be made *because of a treaty*. That distinction is highly probable to be made there.

  the ministry has no motivation to intervene here.

It could potentially cripple the economy? There's no way those coins are going back out into circulation. The coinage is literally the currency for the British Wizarding world. Why would you leave a loophole/black hole like that within your economy? You don't expect people to know, otherwise you have what happens in the prompt happening. And then the economy crashes. Or another war.
