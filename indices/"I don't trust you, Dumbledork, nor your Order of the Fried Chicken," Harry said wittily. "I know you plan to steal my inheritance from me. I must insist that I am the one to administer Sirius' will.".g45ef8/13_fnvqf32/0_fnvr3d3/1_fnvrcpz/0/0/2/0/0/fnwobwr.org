Yes, they would.

Here's an example that would 100% start a war. If the family is rich enough, that's a large chunk of gold that leaves the economy. Companies (owned by that person/family) would collapse, people would lose their jobs, products that family had a monopoly on wouldn't be produced.

Crap like this wouldn't be allowed anywhere near the treaty. They would settle for a coinage exception or nothing. Why allow something that would (not could. WOULD) 100% bite them in the ass in the future and cripple/end the economy? They wouldn't. They would rather keep fighting.
