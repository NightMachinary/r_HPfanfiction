Well, physical currency is usually considered to be owned by the state. Keeping money in circulation is probably a function of the treaties between the goblins and the Ministry. And since the goblins run the only bank, the money always passes back through their hands long enough to satisfy this cultural notion of ownership. But that's just my take on it.
