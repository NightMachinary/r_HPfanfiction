You can't pull the "Goblin coinage is considered Goblin Artifacts" shtick. Nobody would allow it anywhere near a treaty just for this reason.

Wizards are stupid, but they aren't totally braindead retarded. They wouldn't use a currency that can legally revert to goblin ownership when they die.

Of course, the first time this happens, Wizards would be at war with Goblins.
