  They'd certainly be more fair than any human government.

Hmm...

  "Mr Potter, as executor of Sirius Black's will, do you agree to hand the distribution of his estate to the jurisdiction of Gringotts Bank?"

  Harry smirked at Lucius Malfoy, who had been amusingly silenced by the goblins. "Absolutely," he said. "I'm sure Malfoy here has all sorts of plans to rob me of my inheritance, if I go through the Ministry. Far better to seek Goblin justice."

  Lucius Malfoy could only watch in horror as Harry signed the jurisdiction agreement with the goblins, no doubt thinking of all the schemes Harry had just foiled.

  "Excellent," Griphook said, looking at the signed contract. "Everything seems to be in order. Let us proceed to the distribution of Mr Black's assets."

  Harry nodded, already pleased with his decision. The Ministry would have taken months with this, but the Goblins were proceeding directly to distribute the cash. He'd be rolling in it by dinner.

  "Our records show that Mr Black's estate consists of five million galleons," Griphook continued, looking at a scroll full of numbers. "This gold, as you know, was minted by Gringotts for wizards to use. In accordance with goblin law, following the death of its wizard custodian, it will now revert to the ownership of its creator, Gringotts Bank." He paused, a cruel grin stretching across his lips as he looked at Harry's horrified face. "I believe that concludes our business."

  Harry stared in disbelief as the Goblins left. What had just happened?

  "Potter," Lucius growled, the charm which had been silencing him removed. "You're a fucking idiot."
