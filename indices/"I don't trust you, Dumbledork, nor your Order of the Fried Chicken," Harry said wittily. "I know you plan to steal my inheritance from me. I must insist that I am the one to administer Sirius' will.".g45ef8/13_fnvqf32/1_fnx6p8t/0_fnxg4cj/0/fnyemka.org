So I work for a lawyer that specializes in estate planning, probate, and trust admin and I am deeply sorry you have such a shitty lawyer, OR that someone is fucking with yall. So the federal estate tax exclusion is $11.58 million this year, and five years ago was still pretty large coming in just over $5 million, so anything that would qualify as meagre is gonna be under that and for an estate under that, an uncontested probate should take about a year tops. The things that drag out probate are things like arguments between heirs, missing heirs (though really, a competent lawyer should be able to handle those within the year anyway), creditors claims, or issues with how the inheritance interacts with disability benefits, stuff like that. If yall are fucking around five years in with none of that going on, yall need to ask the executor/personal representative/whatever your state calls the person handing the estate to fire the hell out of their lawyer and hire someone competent. AND, even if there are complications, a competent lawyer should still have kept yall informed of what the holdup is and unless it's literally something like waiting for a determination of disability where you're on the social security administration's timeline, there's no good reason for an uncontested probate to still be going.

Tl;dr Someone is being unethical, lazy, incompetent, or a combination thereof to have dragged this out like this. Get a new lawyer.
