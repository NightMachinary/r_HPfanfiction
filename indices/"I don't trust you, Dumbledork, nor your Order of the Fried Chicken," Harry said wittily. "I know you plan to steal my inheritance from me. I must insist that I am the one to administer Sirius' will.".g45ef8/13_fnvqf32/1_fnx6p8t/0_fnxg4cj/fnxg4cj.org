“Not everyone likes having the idea of massive inherited wealth, which an inheritance tax helps to curtail.”

What ideas everyone likes or dislikes are irrelevant. If I spend my life earning a fortune or building a business (big or small) and choose to leave it to my children, that is my right as a human being. The government taking even a portion of it is theft, plain and simple. No one will ever convince me otherwise. (And this is not the forum for debating it, as you alluded to.)

As to the “bureaucracy”, I think you mean the probate process. Although calling it bureaucratic in the very worst meaning of the term is not far off. In my case, I am one of seven children, and my mother had a very meager estate, left to the seven of us equally. We are a close family, and no one really argued about anything. And yet the entire process, as I said, has just passed the FIFTH anniversary of my mother's passing, and still isn't finished. There is no possible reason for it to take that long in an uncontested inheritance. I perfectly understand how it is the key to some sort of fairness in a contentious situation, and as you point out, in the case of Sirius's passing you couldn't get a more textbook case of “contentious and disputed”. But in our non-magical reality, it is dispiriting when it's not contentious and yet this long; it's just a case of lawyers getting their pound of flesh.
