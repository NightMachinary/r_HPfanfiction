This seems like an odd place to complain about the politics of having an estate/inheritance tax - but there are reasons to have such a tax such that saying "It's not the government's money" is a poor argument against it. Not everyone /likes/ having the idea of massive inherited wealth, which an inheritance tax helps to curtail.

For the bureaucracy, it's only a thing because it's been necessary. Sure, in the majority of cases where it's not a problem, it'll seem onerous - but in the cases where it does get disputed? Some families get /nasty/ over things like this. My mom won't speak to a quarter of her extended family partly because of the way that they cared solely about getting the maximum share of their inheritance as possible. I would see that being dialed up to 11 in certain pureblood families. And so you need a process to go through and resolve things in a fair manner, particularly when everyone has portable weapons (ie, wands).
