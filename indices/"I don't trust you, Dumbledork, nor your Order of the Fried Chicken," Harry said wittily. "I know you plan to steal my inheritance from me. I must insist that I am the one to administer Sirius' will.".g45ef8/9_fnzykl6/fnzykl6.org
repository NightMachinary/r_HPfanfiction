Look, that's why I always go with the part of the Will being made a magical contract that automagically accounts for the goods and properties under the purview of Gringotts(who are contractually and magically obligated to be fair, even if they do their best to get around stuff) due to intent and somatic components that go into magic.

I would love a Solicitor!Harry story, but bureaucratic legal stuff(especially in the UK who outright admits their system can be confusing) would take a long time to explain and would be utterly boring for most people, so the writer would have to focus only on that.

That's one easy way I don't blame a writer taking.

"But why Gringotts? They are /only/ a bank", Look in the milenar history of wizards, they have changed governments and names, but the bank is still the same, and if you can make the Goblins be minimally fair, they are your best hope for a neutral party that can't be bribed or influenced by your rivals.

About taxes, I sincerely doubt a society ruled by a millenary magical aristocracy would pass laws to severely tax their descendants, I see them taxing business and transactions much more while making sure certain parties get a reduction or outright exemption. Canon Ministry for me didn't look to me to have that much power by itself(as in without certain people's support)
