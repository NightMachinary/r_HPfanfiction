You know, I recently re-read that, and you can't really say that. You can argue that the particular people responsible deserved it, maybe, but hardly the billions of muggles who weren't involved. You can't even make an argument that the muggles were responsible because they tacitly approved, thus being vicariously responsible or responsible through inaction, they deserved it. One cannot approve of something of which one knows utterly nothing. And the general population, most of those killed, knew nothing of magic until immediately before they died.
