Hi :)

I'm currently working on a story, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23559502/chapters/56518936][Circinus]], which is set in an AU in which Walburga decides to work to free Sirius from Azkaban and secure him a trial - not that he wants one. It's main themes are Sirius coming to terms with what happened in 1981 and also around reconciling with his family. I'm currently nine chapters in, with a view to it being about 25. I also have a fair few other shorter stories centred around Sirius and his relationship with his family. I hope you enjoy :)

Alternatively, I highly recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14800721/chapters/34243049][In the Black]] and it's sequel, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15457248/chapters/35881359][Black Mask]], by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/izzythehutt/pseuds/izzythehutt][Izzythehutt]], which also centres around Sirius reconciling with his family and is absolutely the inspiration behind my own stories. It's a brilliant series :)
