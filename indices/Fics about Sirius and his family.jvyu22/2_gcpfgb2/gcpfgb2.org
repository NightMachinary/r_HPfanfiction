I quite enjoyed To Bow With Pride. Weird, inexplicably-in-the-past Harry semi-accidentally becomes tutor to the Black Family Sprogs. There's an attached One-Shot called 'Three Times Narcissa Tries To Match Make' that's quite fun as well, though it's less about Sirius and more about the rest of the fam. :D
