If you're a Naruto fan, Emerald Ashes wrote another great fic [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sasuke-uchiha-and-the-power-of-lies-naruto-comedy-au.472801/][Sasuke Uchiha and the Power of Lies]] on Space Battles. It has the same tone and a completely off the walls plot. One of my favorite Naruto fics.

​

There's also Itachi, is that a baby? linkffn(11634921) which is a HP/Naruto crossover with a similar absurdist tone and one of the best, if not the absolute best, Dumbledores in fanfiction.

​

Another Naruto/HP crossover with a similar tone would be A Sage Among Wizards, linkffn(7648998), which is Godlike Naruto reincarnating as Harry and using his powers to do petty things like tie Snape's shoes together when they didn't have shoelaces in the first place. It's the farthest in tone from Seventh Horcrux of the three, but still real funny.

​

For pure HP, the Harry the Hufflepuff series (book 1 linkffn(6466185)) has a Harry that makes it his goal to be as lazy as possible, and works insanely hard to do so.

​

That's all I got on my favorites list with a similar style.
