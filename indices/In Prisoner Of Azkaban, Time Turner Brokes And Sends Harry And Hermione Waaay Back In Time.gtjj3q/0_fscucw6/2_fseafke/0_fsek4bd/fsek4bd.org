Factorio is very simplistic in some regards, especially when it comes to metallurgy. And I'm aware of how that sentence sounds since Factorio isn't simplistic compared to most other games. But if you look at how things like armour plates or boilers are made, there are giant steelworks which turn "raw" steel into the necessary parts, a step which requires giant factories like the Krupp complex in Essen. As for why I'm using Krupp as an example, they developed the Krupp process, which was a leap forwards when it came to hardened steel by mixing other elements into the steel alloy, another step completely missing from Factorio.
