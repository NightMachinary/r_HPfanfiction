  You heat it up, it melts, you pour it somewhere. Yet cast bronze was a thing 2000 years before steel casting was feasible. Simply knowing that it is possible will only get you so far, you need people familiar with the process who then can teach other people.

Steel casting took so long to figure out because someone had to figure out how to create a fire hot enough do the "heat it up" part. Human instructors are nice, but people routinely figure out methods solely from cryptic publications. Give Roman metal casters the basic ideas of how to accomplish this task, maybe via magically translated textbooks, and they will have steel casting down within a few years.

  And you won't be able to accumulate capital, you'll have to be spending it as soon as it is available to invest in projects, most of which will not be financially profitable (eg water supply, schools and so on).

  And scale is another issue. In the 1950s, the West German railway needed some ~50000 tons of steel (and 100000t of coal to produce that) just for maintenance of their rail network. West Germany is also significantly smaller than any ancient empire. You could probably build a local railway between Athenes and Piraeus with the local steel industry, or a bridge. But if you want to expand more than that, you will run into the limits of your capacities very quickly.

Have you ever taken intermediate macroeconomics? I don't think you really understand my model or the neoclassical growth model is based on. The capacity of an economy is a function of its technology level.

In my model, the time travelers only inject ideas into the economy via dumps of books. Imagine what would happen if we suddenly discovered an alien library full of advance knowledge.
