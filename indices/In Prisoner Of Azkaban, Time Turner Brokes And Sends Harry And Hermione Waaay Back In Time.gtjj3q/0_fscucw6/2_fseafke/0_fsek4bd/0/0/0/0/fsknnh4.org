I get your general idea as for how to advance. And for some fields like medicine, it would undoubtedly work and allow rapid advances, especially when you apply the Greek or Roman genius to the matter.

But for others, well let's say that you want to introduce the Krupp process. On paper, it does not sound so difficult. Take nickel-steel, add 1-2% chromium and then carburize that with carbon gas before heating and quenching the cemented side. But where would Greeks or Romans get Acetylene from? Chromium in sufficient purity and quantity (the process was only discovered in 1797 and is unlikely to be in any book Harry or Hermione might have at hand)? The same goes for Nickel. And while the process itself might not be widespread outside of armour production, it makes for a good example for the difficulties of adapting technology.
