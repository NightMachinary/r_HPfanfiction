Wealth is meaningless when you lack the resources to invest it in or qualified workforce to do something. And you won't be able to accumulate capital, you'll have to be spending it as soon as it is available to invest in projects, most of which will not be financially profitable (eg water supply, schools and so on).

Workforce is not an issue in Rome generally speaking, especially since the Military has a tradition of public works. Slavery is also a thing. Qualified workers on the other hand... In theory, casting any metal is pretty much the same process. You heat it up, it melts, you pour it somewhere. Yet cast bronze was a thing 2000 years before steel casting was feasible. Simply knowing that it is possible will only get you so far, you need people familiar with the process who then can teach other people. And the Roman Empire is in a much better position than Greece.

And scale is another issue. In the 1950s, the West German railway needed some ~50000 tons of steel (and 100000t of coal to produce that) *just for maintenance* of their rail network. West Germany is also significantly smaller than any ancient empire. You could probably build a local railway between Athenes and Piraeus with the local steel industry, or a bridge. But if you want to expand more than that, you will run into the limits of your capacities very quickly.
