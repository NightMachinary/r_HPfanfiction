  No, they are foolhardy Gryffindors coming from a time both magicaly and scientificaly superior.

I actually outlined a "Harry and Hermione inserted into GoT at the end of Robert's rebellion" fic with uplift as the goal, even if I took them from the hunt rather than out of 3rd year. And even with magic, an uplift would not really be feasible, even with magic and Hermione's bag as Wikipedia substitute. And I was assuming that transfiguration could be exploited to hell and back. It is simply not doable. The pair can whip up a WWI destroyer or the like in a few days, or enough weapons to arm a regiment, but they do not have the ability to create a sustainable industry.

Let's say that you want to magic trains into existence. You need trains, which means that you need steel. So steelworks/ironworks, which require smaller steelworks for the machinery, which need raw iron. Raw iron means mines, mines need steam engines to pump water out and move stuff. To build steam engines, well, the circle begins anew. Then you need places which build machine tools and so on. Coal and coke, which means special bricks for the furnaces...

During the industrial revolution, that process was supplied by a mixture of small companies which specialised in making one of these, often by craftsmen who were already making things by hand and automated their work. Only slowly, the giants of industry came to be. Coke and its supply chain came to be ~200 years before trains were a thing, and almost a century before proper metal factories IIRC.

You can uplift a country in a lifetime, Japan being the prime example. There were people born during the Samurai age who witnessed nuclear weapons. However, Japan could buy stuff from the West. And while magic can substitute a lot of things, it cannot mirror every industrial and military mission, every large company like Yarrow or Krupp. Additionally, Japan had a pretty stable political landscape all things considered, unlike a smattering of cities loosely connected by religion and language with frequent invasions in the general neighbourhood.

I concluded that it would be infeasible to do that properly with a late medieval/renaissance tech base. You are suggesting to start with the bronze age. And while immortality could eventually overcome the issue, that would lead to the reader being pretty detached from every other character because they kept dying while Harry or Hermione invented stuff 24/7 for a few centuries.
