Not really. I don't see a way you could properly merge the universes due to the inherent power imbalance. Even if you nerf Harry Potter magic by 95%, that's still enough magic for a belt-fed machine gun with obisdian-tipped incendiary ammunition or ten. And in the political arena, either you use the imperius curse or any HP character is useless on their own. My attempt with the uplift was "fuck the balance, time for a good stomp."

I've written an oneshot where Jon is made king after the red wedding and finally got the follow-up almost completed. And a bunch of HP fics. Even a Clone Wars one. But no crossovers.
