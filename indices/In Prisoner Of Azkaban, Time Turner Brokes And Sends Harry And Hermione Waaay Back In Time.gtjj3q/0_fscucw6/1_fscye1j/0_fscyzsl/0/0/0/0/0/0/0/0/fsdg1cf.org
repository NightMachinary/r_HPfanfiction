If the magic is no longer "wave a wand and stuff happens", it is not HP anymore. Some spells working wonky, fine. But if, coincidentally, anything which would be useful for Harry is no longer an option due to some contrived reason (eg different stars), that feels like an asspull to create conflict where they should be none. Kinda like the "I can explain" trope, where a 2-hour drama is caused by someone randomly storming off after getting the wrong idea about something. And that is cheap, bad writing.

  There'd be a point where Harry would have to accept that he can't save everyone

But that would make Harry grossly OOC. Harry accepting that the Unsullied have to die because they have been brainwashed into infant-slaying murder machines is one thing. But we are talking about the guy who saved Malfoy after everything he did in HBP. Who ran straight into the DoM, despite the obvious trap, to save Sirius. That guy would never leave the people to die. Nor could anyone catch a competent wizard, which Harry undoubtedly is. Even the medieval witch hunts were pointless in canon.

That's why I consider at least a partial uplift inevitable. Maybe not trains connecting every big city, but at least some basics.
