Hermione is educated in magic. She's a witch. She'd be limited by that alone. She's book smart, but that doesn't necessarily translate to being good at the practical. That's a big facet of her character. The practical doesn't come as naturally as it would others. Though I'd imagine that compared to everyone else, she'd be the quickest to get her magic functioning.

Actually, she'd have to go South to Dorne. The North is highly patriarchal. Mormonts are an exception, not the rule. Otherwise Arya would have been allowed to pick up the sword as soon as she was able without resorting to secrecy, Lyanna Stark would have been free to pursue martial interests as well, and Alys Karstark would have been able to inherit peacefully without being ousted from her home and forced to marry the leader of the Thenns. If she hadn't married the Thenn, her uncle would've forced her into a marriage with her cousin as his right as guardian and regent, and she would've lost the inheritance to her uncle's son because he too was of Karstark blood. The only reason Lady Maege is in charge of Bear Island is because Jeor took the black after Jorah fled in exile for selling poachers into slavery. Contrast all of this to Dorne; where the Sand Snakes are allowed to openly wield weapons, absolute primogeniture (inheritance is determined by birth order and gender is irrelevant) is practiced, female rule is respected and being usurped is unlikely with or without marriage, and bastards are treated better; and Dorne appears like a more egalitarian choice in comparison.

You do realize that there are other mysteries out there in the World of Ice and Fire, right? The ruins of Sothoros, Stygai, Sonore, Valyria, Rhoyne, and the Leng underground. There's Asshai, K'Dath, Carcosa, and the City of the Winged Men to visit and plenty more to see. As for the Others, fire may work on Wights, and obsidian may work on White Walkers, but for all we know, the White Walkers could absorb any magic thrown at them. That could increase their strength, and Hermione isn't a melee fighter. The White Walkers could just keep throwing bodies at her till she tires and keep doing so as she's forced to give ground. They're also able to control weather as a range tactic, so it's not a stretch to say they could freeze ranged fighters from afar. The show did a great disservice to the Others.
