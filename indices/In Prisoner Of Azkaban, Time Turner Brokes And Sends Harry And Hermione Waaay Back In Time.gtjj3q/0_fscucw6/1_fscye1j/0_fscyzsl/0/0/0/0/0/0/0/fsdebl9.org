Hence why I said fused mechanics and a better understanding of a World of Ice and Fire is required. I think you don't understand what a fused fic is exactly. It's not your everyday crossover where you just dump characters from one reality to the other.

Besides, whose to say the spells made in one world will work in the other? For example, with potions in the HP world it's known that more complex potions may require keeping track of celestial bodies. It's not known what exactly goes into spell craft beyond arthimancy and incantations, but perhaps being under a foreign sky and stars might effect the numerology fuel that goes into them. In A World of Ice and Fire something magical is causing the imbalance in seasons. That could also very well effect Wizarding magic like it is every other type of sorcery on that planet.

As for Harry helping people... he could try, but I doubt they'd listen to him. Septon Barth had similar concepts and almost nothing remains of his work. They got put to the torch by Baelor the Blessed. There'd be a point where Harry would have to accept that he can't save everyone, and there's a reason Wizards hid from muggles.
