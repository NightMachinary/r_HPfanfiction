It isn't an asspull. We're talking about Planetos, the World of Ice and Fire. A world that's so magically damaged to the point seasons are imbalanced because of celestial magical phenomenon. A world that has experienced several magical apocalypses(the Fall of the Great Empire of the Dawn and Asshai, the scourge of Ghiscar and Sanore, the Doom of Valyria, and the Long Night extc.) to the point magic has died out in several places. It stands to reason that any spells designed to work on Earth won't work properly on Planetos. Might even backfire in extreme ways. Spells would have to be reworked from the ground up. Hell, they could take longer to cast.

As for bad writing... bad writing is a soulless piece of work where there is no conflict, tension, or journey.

An uplift would not work. The moment Harry leaves or dies the society would collapse because it's heavily relying on one person. Harry also isn't knowledgeable in the different fields necessary to keep a society running or uplift it. Daenerys's entire arc is exactly that. Even with her dragons keeping the peace everything still fell apart for her in Meereen. That's why she decides she'll head to Westoros in the books.

Also, it's quite clear to me you don't know enough about ASOIAF. Else you would understand that, when I mentioned Septon Barth and his works, I meant that Harry could share all the knowledge in the world, but people would not follow just because he saids so. I also wasn't referencing witch hunts. It just isn't feasible for Wizards to help everyone. That may have played a factor in why they hid among other things.
