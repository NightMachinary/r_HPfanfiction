Septon Barth wasn't just some random cleric. For nearly on a century his works were valued by those of scholarly pursuit until Baelor the Blessed came around and ordered them banned and burnt. Maesters would immediately try and have Harry killed as quickly and as quietly as possible, and it would almost certainly include some fast acting poison. I don't think Harry would go with some obvert display of magic seeing as it's a medieval setting. Any witch or wizard worth their salt would know to exercise caution should they find themselves in said setting. Additionally, I doubt Harry knows how to make a microscope or a steam engine. He's a Wizard not a scientist or engineer.

If you're aware, then why are we even arguing about this? You don't need a tech uplift to make a HP crossover work. I think a witch or wizard, should they find themselves in the World of Ice and Fire, would concentrate more on solving the higher mysteries of said world should they ever get a handle of making their magic functional again. And for as much as Hermione is a better option for tech uplift, though equally as dubious since her specialty is of a magical pursuit, we'd be back at square one. Just because someone saids so and proves so doesn't mean people will listen, follow, or believe it. That goes double here, because she'd be a woman in a setting that doesn't lend itself to being egalitarian
