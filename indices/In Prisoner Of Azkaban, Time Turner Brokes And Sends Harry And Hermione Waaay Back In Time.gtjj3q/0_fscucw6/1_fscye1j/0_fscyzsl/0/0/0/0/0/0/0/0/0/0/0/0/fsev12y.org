Hermione would definitely be better suited, for her handbag alone. And she grew up a Muggle in the birthplace of the industrial revolution. There are a lot of well preserved old factories, steelworks and the like turned museum. Nevermind stuff like the IWM or RAF Edgware.

Additionally, the first book (GoT) came out in 1996. Hermione could have read it if you take them from the hunt as I intended.

And the obvious solution is to go north, where there is no organised religion (the old gods have no clergy) and women can earn the respect of their peers. No one really bats an eye on warrior women from the Mormonts, hell no one cares that they have bastards carrying the name and using bestiality as an excuse. Worst case, build a city state north of the wall.

Those aren't particularly interesting tbh. Especially if you have magic. Fire takes care of the undead and from what little we see of the white walkers, they fight meele. So bring a gun to a knife fight, or a crossbow to be more period accurate. Obsidian tipped bolts make quick work of the Others, especially if you'd take the show version. As for the books, trying to guess an ending or their capabilities is difficult with what we have after 5 books. I'd rate the Long Night more dangerous than the walkers. But farming and starving in the dark isn't particularly interesting.

There's a reason why a lot of fans would prefer if there were no supernatural events at all and simply good ol' backstabbing politics. That's the prevalent opinion on other sites at least.
