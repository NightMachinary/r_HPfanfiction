Septon Barth is a bad example since any wizard worth his name would immediately find employ with anyone but the most devout lords. The very first transfiguration, wood to (stainless) steel, alone would guarantee that. Harry would not only be some random cleric but could actually prove his theories (compared to even basic animals, a microscope or even a steam engine is utterly simple).

And I am aware that it would not be sustainable, hence me dropping the idea. Hermione might have a better shot if you use her handbag to include a complete encyclopedia Britannica or some other relevant works, but even then it will not be as fast as "a Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court".
