I think the issue here is that you're both confused as to when, exactly, the bronze age was in relation to Ancient Greece. Or at least one of you is. Yes, the Trojan War occurred during the bronze age, and no, they didn't have steel. But the bronze age ended about 1200 BCE, while the civilization we think of as ancient Greece lasted until they were conquered by the Romans over a thousand years later (146 BCE). In fact, Ancient Greece is generally considered to have begun around or just after the Trojan War. The Classical and Hellenistic periods, which are generally what one is picturing when they think of Ancient greece were at the very end of that time frame. And they (and other ancient cultures, cough cough rome) did have fairly advanced technology (though I won't speak to the steam engine thing, I'm an art historian, I don't follow engine developments) relative to the medieval period. But by the time the greeks had that kind of stuff, it was no longer the bronze age by any stretch of the imagination.

I would also like to point out that this is a closed loop time travel prompt where history as we know it remains exactly the same but has been secretly influenced by Harry and Hermione's presence. It's a "magic people from the future game the system" concept, so the existence of heavy industry is moot. They're not changing what tech is available, they're just pretending to be mythological figures and gods. Although your point about guilds existing during medieval times is spot on.
