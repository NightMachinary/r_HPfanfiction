I know about the historical periods, I passed ancient history just a few months ago. That's why the whole trojan war thing confused me somewhat since the title mentions ancient Greece, generally starting around 800-600 BC, depending on your exact definition.

Closed loop makes even less sense. I've read my share of uplifts, and generally speaking, there's a bunch of technologies basically anyone can realistically whip up in a few days. Stuff like hot air balloons, germ theory or optical telegraphy (with signal lamps akin to those used on ships which use Morse code). And let's just say that if someone introduced Morse code in 500 BC, it would not be named that. Same with medicine. Greek and Roman texts would mention it. And even printing presses are not that difficult, something Hermione would definitely prioritise.

If you have a pair of immortal time travellers, they will have steam power by the year 0. Working steam power. If they join in with Greece, well Macedon would probably not rise to power, so no Alexander the Great and no Hellenism. Probably no Roman Empire, or one more akin to west rome rather than conquests in the east. Hermione has been in London after all, she has seen HMS Belfast so she can whip up some cannons with transfiguration (wood to steel is the first thing they learn), which would end any Roman conquests which enslaved a good chunk of Greece (aka her people if she's a traveller). And if not Greece, then Gaul or wherever else she happens to be. Do you think the Romans could land if the Dover battery was operational, even a cheap knockoff made from 4" guns like the secondary battery aboard a town class cruiser (small enough to use a regular log as match substitute and to be moved by foot/horse if need be)?
