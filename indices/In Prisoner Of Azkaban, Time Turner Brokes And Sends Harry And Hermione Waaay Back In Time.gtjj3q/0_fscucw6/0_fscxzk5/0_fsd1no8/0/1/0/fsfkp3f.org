The point is that this isn't an uplift though. It's not about making the technology of the time better. And I'm not so sure about the whole "will definitely have a steam engine by year whenever". Keep in mind that Harry and Hermione are thirteen and fourteen here, and haven't been involved in muggle schooling since they were 10. Even being a genius, I don't think it's unreasonable for Hermione's grasp on how modern tech works to be too theoretical/child friendly to be entirely actionable. Why would she have studied it when she could be studying magic? Add to that her assertion that "bad things happen to wizards who meddle with time" and I could definitely see them not making any sweeping changes to history.
