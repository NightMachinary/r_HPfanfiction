  I would also like to point out that this is a closed loop time travel prompt where history as we know it remains exactly the same but has been secretly influenced by Harry and Hermione's presence. It's a "magic people from the future game the system" concept, so the existence of heavy industry is moot. They're not changing what tech is available, they're just pretending to be mythological figures and gods. Although your point about guilds existing during medieval times is spot on.
