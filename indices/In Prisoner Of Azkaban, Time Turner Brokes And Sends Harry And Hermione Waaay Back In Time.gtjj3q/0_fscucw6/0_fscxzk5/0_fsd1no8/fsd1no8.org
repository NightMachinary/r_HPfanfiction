I want some of what you are smoking there. The renaissance was after all the result of gradual progress from medieval times. Medieval Europe had steel and cannons, the bronze age as the name said had bronze.

The steam engine was actually not an engine as it did not power anything, it was a fancy trinket and building a working one would require metallurgical advances from early-modern times (mainly quality steel).

And a small population is not to your advantage. In order to sustain heavy industry, you need demand for their goods. Britain became an economic powerhouse because they had access to half of the world, could draw resources from their empire, which created demand by its very existence (you needed ships to bring the goods, a navy to protect them, trains to move goods and so on).

And Medieval times had merchant guilds as well, even entire merchant nations (eg Venice, Genoa) and a merchant proto EEG (the Hansa).
