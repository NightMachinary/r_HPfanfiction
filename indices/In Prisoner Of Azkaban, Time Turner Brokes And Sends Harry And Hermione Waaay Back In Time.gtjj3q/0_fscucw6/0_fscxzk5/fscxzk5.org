You make some very good points. I wasnt thinking about our characters uplifting technology of ancient near east when i wrote this prompt though. I was thinking our characters building new lives for themselves while lost in time and influencing the greek mythology of today(i was thinking on them becoming something like the doctor from doctor who, or sirius and harry from a fanfic i read long ago and couldnt remember the name of.)

There is someone named Hermione in the legend of troy after all, and many myhological characters and gods have names starting with the letter H, so i rolled on from there.

Also bronze age near east was technologically closer to renaissance levels of technology than medieval europe. They did invent a steam engine and a mechanical calculator that calculated astronomical events after all( if you dont believe me google it :)). There was also merchant guilds similar to proto corporations if i am not mistaken(i can be it is late at night and i need sleep.)not just in greece, but also in Mesopotamia. Furthermore, population of the world was much smaller back then (less than 300 million) and thus needed less resources.
