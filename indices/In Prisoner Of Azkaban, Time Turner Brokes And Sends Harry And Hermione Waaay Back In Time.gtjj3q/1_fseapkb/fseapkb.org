I've read a fic like this (for a different fandom though) where the mc becomes known as Sisyphus among many other things. He goes on to play many of the famous roles of history, while only slightly changing the present so it remains intact.

I actually had a lot of fun reading that fic. Although his exploits in the past had been largely skimmed over, and even left vague due to the mysterious nature of his character in the fic, it was still very interesting. Especially when they got back to the present and we got to see mc interacting with the main cast with his new found experience and thousands of years under his belt.

I hope theres a fic out there for HP.
