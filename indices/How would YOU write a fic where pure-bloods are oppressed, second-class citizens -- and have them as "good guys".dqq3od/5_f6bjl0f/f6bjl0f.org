Easy, just have the winners go too far post-war in making things "fair" and "equal".

Let's say the Ministry's top positions are usually taken by pure-bloods. So they implement a 50% Muggleborn quota. Except there aren't enough talented Muggleborn around to fill them, so they lower the requirements. Now a pure-blood might need an "O" in DADA to become an Auror, but a Muggleborn would scrape by with an "A".

They make it a hate crime to insult someone's heritage. "Adventures of Mad Muggle" are banned. Pure-bloods become the only group that's safe to mock in media & entertainment.

Representation on Wizgengamot is offered to centaurs, goblins, etc. who gleefully take it, but have no intention to actually follow human laws.

Old rituals & traditions are forbidden under the guise of them being discriminatory, without truly understanding their purpose.
