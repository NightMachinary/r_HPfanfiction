I would basically tweak Out of the Night (by RainingInk). Which already has the presence of Dark Wizards (almost inherently pure-blood), their connection to and use of magic being distinct (the magic is from without rather than within, and has a sacrificial nature). Compared to wizards who use dark magic/curses, these Dark Wizards have been purged for centuries, and any that are caught face an automatic death sentence.

If Harry centric an easy in would be after Sirius dies, he inherits Grimmauld place and as the owner finds himself suddenly the victim of targeted "justice"/harassment by a specific Ministry office or the Ministry in general.

Then you could have him look into things and see the system is corrupt, and the history and facts that he thought he knew are one very biased side of a coin. The Ministry says Harry is a leader of an insurrectionist army, an inheritor and purveyor of Dark Magic, parselmouth. If they say that about him, what about the pure-bloods? What's true, what isn't? And so soon he finds the pure-bloods as a whole are more boogeyman than the root of all of wizarding societies ills.

You could even have Ron's family in on this. Arthur gets shunted aside, because of pure blood and independent thinking. Percy is passed over again and again as less qualified but more fervent and loyal muggleborns get the job, or alternatively he pushes father out of a job as he is more fanatical.

Personally I would nix the magical creature angle and focus on wizards.\\
1) Pure-bloods (as Dark Wizards) hide their natures, but some few extremists fight to upend system. 2) The Ministry propagandizes and most wizards believe, but most won't fight and die for their cause. 3)Dumbledore/Order is only there to stop Voldemort led extremists. And 4) Harry is trying to break the back of the Ministry's power, but simultaneously defeat Voldemort. Finding allies wherever he can and working with other factions in turns by necessity.
