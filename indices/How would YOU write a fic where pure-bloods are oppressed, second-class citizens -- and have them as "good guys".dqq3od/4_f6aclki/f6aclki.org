after world war ii and grindelwald's war, a few things happen. firstly, the muggle population increases rapidly as the economy booms, increasing the number of muggle-born and half-blood magicals. secondly, dumbledore uses his power as chief warlock and supreme mugwump to implement highly progressive policies which make magical creatures and muggle-borns basically equal to pureblood wizards in the eyes of the law. with this comes the inevitable backlash against wizarding tradition, something which the purebloods definitely don't want. perhaps dumbledore bans old magical rites/rituals or something similar, maybe the power in magical britain is shifted away from the old families, but whatever it is it angers the purebloods, who don't actually hate muggle-borns (in this world), but just want to be able to keep practicing their traditions.

bang. purebloods have an actual ideology that makes sense and isn't founded upon racism and violence.
