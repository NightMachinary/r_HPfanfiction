Slight meme warning but here's how I would do it.

The muggle population of the UK has a population boom, the likes of which are almost completely unprecedented in British history.

Ignoring the real world ramifications, the main side effect of this boom is that for about the next decade, the majority of witches and wizards that go through Hogwarts are muggleborns.

Combine this with the war(which ever war you want to use, Grindlewald, VW I or VW II) and now there are almost no pureblood students.

During this time of pure muggleborn growth in the wizarding community progressive movements are made. Werewolves are given pack land, Vampires are given the run of the wizarding blood donations in the way Goblins are allowed to run the banks (Under oaths that keep them from being able to use the blood for any magic rituals). Etc.

But against purebloods these laws are heavily biased. Pack lands are aquired by the government taking ancestrial homes away from families. Family Grimoires are confiscated because magic should be shared as a community. Of course purebloods fight back against these things but for once the wizarding world is changing too fast and the old familes can't react well enough. The families that try and fight for traditionalist values are seen as backwards and want to stop progress.
