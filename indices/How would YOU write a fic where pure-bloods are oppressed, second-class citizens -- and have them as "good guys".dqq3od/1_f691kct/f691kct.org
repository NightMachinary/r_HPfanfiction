Post-war seems likely the best time. There would be a huge shift in temperament with pro-muggle heroes guiding Ministry policy. Within a generation I could see much of the magical world being very regulated and the keeping of secrets from other wizards being almost a heresy.

Imagine a world where everyone has the Trace on them their whole lives. Every spell is logged, evaluated, judged. It might kill the wondrous nature of magic in the effort to keep muggles 'unvictimized'. Many magical species might be hunted to near extinction for the safety of muggles, the rare survivors kept in highly-restrictive zoos.
