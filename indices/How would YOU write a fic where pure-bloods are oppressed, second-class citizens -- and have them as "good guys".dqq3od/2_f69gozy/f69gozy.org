After the war, there is a clean-up and a lot of the old elite (rightfully) end up in prison. As a reaction to that, there is an attack by some Death Eater remenants which kills Harry and Hermione. Whoever is in charge uses this to crack down hard on the purebloods, gets himself emergency powers and so on.

Basically a Palpatine-like Minister who abuses Harry's and Hermione's deaths to gain more power, claiming that his actions are what they would have wanted, to continue their work and so on. It starts with economic restrictions, then escalates further towards the inmates in Azkaban, who are executed (even if their sentences were supposed to be only for a few years). There is the occasional act of resistance by some pureblood, which only leads to a harsher treatment for them.

By the time you get to next-gen time, the purebloods are forced to wear badges, can't own more than X property, can't marry anyone but other purebloods, are forced to register with the Ministry and so on.

This wouldn't trivialise the atrocities under Voldemort nor make the entire "light side" bad, as they were played masterfully by the new Minister. Maybe the Minister even orchestrates some of these attacks as false flag operations to make the situation seem worse and present himself as the only path out of the crisis.
