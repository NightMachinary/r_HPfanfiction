I think it would be better to have the discussion/announcement of a fic within the same post. Rather than announcing a fic on 1st of October but not discussing it until a post on 1st November; I think it would be better to have it announced on 1st October and have discussion about it within that thread.

​

Allows people who start reading it when it is announced to discuss it immediately, and may generate more discussion than if they are required to wait until next month, when they might have forgotten some of the points they wanted to make.

​

This increases the likelihood of people coming upon spoilers, but I think it would increase discussion. For those who prefer to read it and then start discussing it when the next fic is announced; the thread will still be open but there should already be comments and discussion for which they can participate in, instead of feeling like they are posting in a thread with no discussion.
