I'm shamelessly stealing this idea from SIYE, but we could make it a "buried gems" sort of thing instead of a book club. It feels a bit unnecessary to discuss fics that already get recommended from time to time on this subreddit. They are already being discussed. And there are hundreds of fics that are pretty good, if not miles better than the status quo in hpfanfic, but that will not get a lot of exposure.

Alternatively, if you want to make it really fun, make it a 50/50 sort of thing, where you allow both excellent as well as terrible fics into the club. That way you never know what it's going to be like, but now you can share the joys of slogging through Hadrian Potter-Black's 20k words long Diagon Alley shopping trip with other members of this subreddit.
