Of course he has good qualities but he was still a cruel, vindictive person who got off on being mean to teenagers.

Snape is one of my favorite characters, but it's BECAUSE he's complex that I like him. He hates bullying but is a bully. He loves Lily but mistreats her son. He works for the good guys while not being a good person. He was at some point a racist, despite his own half-blood status and his love being muggle-born. It's great. It makes him interesting.

A lot of the time travel fics turn the Marauders into caricatures and handwave Snape using mudblood as "he was angry and trying to hurt her." People generally don't throw out racial slurs when they're angry, unless a part of them believes it. And a part of Snape did, because of his father and being in Slytherin and his fascination with Voldemort. I've read maybe three fanfics where Lily calls him out on this. Every fanfic should do so.

I want to read about complex, struggling Snape, not fanfic!Snape who continues to be a jerk but it all stays very superficial while everyone around him is somehow 10x worse than before.

I have been reading The Peace Not Promised, but thanks for recommending it anyway!
