  "So all that. Everything that I saw. It happened? To you?" Disbelief still did not touch her eyes.

  "All of it," he confirmed, feeling the slow heavy thudding of his heart, "because of me."

  Tears. He felt it then, sliding down his sallow cheek, sliding slowly down his angular chin and falling away. He made no motion to stem this shameful display of emotions; he could not stop himself even if he tried.

  "My fault. I'm sorry," he gasped, his voice catching. "I killed you Lily."

  He could not stop himself as the words poured from his mouth. Confessions of the sort of man he truly was.

  "You died because I sold your son to the Dark Lord. Because I overheard a prophecy. I hadn't known who it spoke of, but had it affected anyone but you I would not have done a single thing to stop it. I would not have cared."

  He was babbling, he knew. His words were not reassuring, he knew. She could not derive any comfort from them, he knew.

  "I was a Death Eater! I killed so many. Committed many terrible acts on behalf of the Dark Lord."

  The worst of himself poured freely from his mouth. He could not stop himself. Why couldn't he stop himself?

  "When I knew it was you, when I realised what I had done, I had asked the Dark Lord to spare you. I did not care if he took Potter, or your son. I did not care one whit!"

  He felt disgust at his own words. The truth about himself he hid from the world, that he himself was unwilling to face, laid bare for the only person in his life that ever mattered.

  He could not even meet her eyes.

  "I was evil. I was truly evil."
