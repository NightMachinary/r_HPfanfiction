  And she herself realises that being in a relationship with him is challenging; at one point, when he's being spectacularly socially awkward,

How does awkwardness even register as a flaw or difficulty in their relationship when he canonically was hoping to join a fascistic, genocidal terrorist organisation that specifically targeted muggleborns (like Lily) and muggles (like all of her family and basically every person (apart from Snape) she ever knew for the first eleven years of her life)?

And, like, yeah, he does protect Harry in the sense that he keeps him from dying, but he also goes out of his way to make him miserable, bullies and outright abuses him, and refuses to acknowledge Harry as his own person rather than an echo of his dead parents, in whose deaths Snape played a major role.

Like, I'm not looking to start a Great Snape Debate, here, but I strongly feel that any fic in which Snape and Lily interact after he's spent years horribly mistreating the son for whom she gave her life needs to acknowledge how utterly contemptible and inexcusable that is.
