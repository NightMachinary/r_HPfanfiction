Sorry, can't help with the specific request, although my favourite time travel one is quite aware of Severus' faults (and he himself is very aware of them, too). The thing about time travel fics is, he has long experience in sublimating his self-loathing into a conviction that his life is owed in service.

That said, canon does make plain that he has good qualities. He had the strength of character to protect Lily's legacy for so many years despite having nothing personally to gain from it; Lily was forever out of his reach and he didn't even like Harry. He's clearly intelligent, organised, and careful. The Peace Not Promised has Lily choosing to date him while all her friends are asking each other, and asking her, what she sees in him. And she herself realises that being in a relationship with him is challenging; at one point, when he's being spectacularly socially awkward, she tells him that he can be adorable sometimes, "not in the puppies and kittens kind of way, of course. More like if a Boggart decided to give up its day job and try its hand at being human." But she sees potential in him, and she knows he's loyal and devoted to her, and her presence softens him.
