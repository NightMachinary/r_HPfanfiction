linkao3(If Someone Cared Enough by Aishling)

This fic becomes canon divergent from SWM and everybody's bs is called out here so it's very satisfying to read this lmao and there is no time travel in this. There are a few OCs and they are all well-developed and super cool I really loved the OCs

linkao3(A Dream Carved in Stone by diadelphous)

This one also has no time travel, and Snape does turn his life around but he does still join the DEs before the change occurs but the writing is solid in this fic and I enjoyed it very much, you can give it a try
