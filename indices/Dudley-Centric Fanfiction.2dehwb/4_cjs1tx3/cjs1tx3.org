This somehow still manages to be Harry-centric even though it's from Dudley's POV, and it's also really sad. "...Signifies a new beginning. Harry dies in the Final Battle. Dudley attends his cousin's funeral, quickly discovering that there was much more to Harry's life than he ever dreamed. Can regret give way to a fresh start? Canon, aside from Harry's death."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7099115/1/Business-Trip][Business Trip]] by Remasa. "Dudley Dursley is sent on a business trip to New York City. On the plane, he meets a certain arrogant wizard. Can each survive without killing the other? No pairings. One-shot."

"Five years after the defeat of Voldemort, a chance encounter on a London street opens new possibilities for friendship and shows just how much one man can change. Written after HBP and is not DH compliant. Now completed!"
