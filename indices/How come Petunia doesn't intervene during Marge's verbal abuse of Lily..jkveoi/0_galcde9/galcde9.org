I expect that Petunia considered pleasing Vernon to be her number one duty in life, and keeping the peace with his sister was more important than anything else. It seems she didn't like Marge to begin with, not least for bringing dogs into the house, so biting her tongue where Marge was concerned in honor of marital peace may have been ingrained long before that incident.

Add onto that that her feelings about Lily were a tangled mess. She loved Lily, but thought her parents preferred Lily to her. She loved Lily, but she was deeply jealous of the doors that were open to Lily but not Petunia. She loved Lily, but she had the magic from Lily's world turned on her in a painful way from time to time, whether it was little Sev from the neighborhood dropping a branch on her or a giant giving her son a pig's tail that needed surgical removal. She loved Lily, but she was given no real choice in raising Lily's child, regardless of what sort of family she and Vernon might have planned for themselves. Her mind was too full of too much unresolved pain to confront anyone over Lily-- least of all Vernon's sister. Vernon got to keep his sometimes-awful sister, and Petunia lost her sometimes-awful sister.

The decision not to defend Lily might look simple to Harry, but I doubt it was simple to Petunia.
