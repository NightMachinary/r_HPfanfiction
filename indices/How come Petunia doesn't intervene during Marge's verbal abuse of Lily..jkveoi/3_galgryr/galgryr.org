As far as anyone in the muggle world knows, Lily and James were drunks that got into a car crash with their one year old, died, and left him with a scar. Even if the actual Lily is someone she still loved, I imagine the character Lily she created in her hate for Harry is not someone she wanted to defend, which is what it would appear to Marge or any other muggle.
