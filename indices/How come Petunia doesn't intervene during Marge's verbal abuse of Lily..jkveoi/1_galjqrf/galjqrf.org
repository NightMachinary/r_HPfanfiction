honestly Marge is terrifying, and it looks like when he's with his sister, Vernon and her get quite sloshed and enter a very belligerent feedback loop that would be incredibly uncomfortable and possibly dangerous to get between.

No matter how bad a person Petunia is, I can understand if she didn't have it in her to speak up. she has so much shame attached to any and all memories of Lily, and she had to have at least some guilt with how she treated Harry, and so I feel like she'd stall out just gulp her white wine or whatever and stay out of it.

Family and in laws are fucking hard and complicated at the best of times, and I honestly cannot see Marge not being one of those sisters that gives their brother's wife criticisms at every opportunity while not distracted by terrorising said sister in law's orphaned nephew
