If you reread the very first chapter of the books. The very first chapter from Vernon's perspective very strongly suggests that all the dislike towards magic and the Potters was from Petunia. Vernon might well be an unreliable narrator but he states that bringing up the Potters is a sure way to annoy Petunia.
