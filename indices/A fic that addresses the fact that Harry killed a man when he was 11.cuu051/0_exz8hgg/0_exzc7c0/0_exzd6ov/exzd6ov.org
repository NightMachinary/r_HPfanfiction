Harry wakes up to a Dumbledore who tells him that he (Dumbledore) arrived in time to prevent Quirrel from taking the stone, though Harry was "doing very well on [his] own". Dumbledore "arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off [Harry]."

Then Riddle left him and he died. Given that Quirrel was already dying from the possession, it was probably Riddle's departure that killed the injured Quirrel.
