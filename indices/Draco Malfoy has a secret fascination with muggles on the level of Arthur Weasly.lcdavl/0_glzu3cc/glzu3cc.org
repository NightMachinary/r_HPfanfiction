A very nervous Draco Malfoy paced the Auror-guarded room waiting for his father to be brought for his secure visit. Draco would have never been able to share this part of himself with his family while Voldemort was alive.

Lucius Malfoy was at last brought into the visitation room at Azkaban and Draco immediately began unburdening himself. "Father, I have a confession to make now that the war is over. I've secretly been visiting and working in the Muggle world since your first imprisonment at the end of 5th year and have been hiding my fascination of Muggles since 2nd year. Mother already knows and has been encouraging me to continue. I'm telling you because I have to be true to myself."

"You what?!?" Lucius bellowed. "How can you have lied to me all these years? It's like I don't even know you!"

"Father, FATHER, please listen. I think you will appreciate the news after you hear more. Through the course of my expanding curiosity I found out that Muggles really like magic, but it isn't the type of magic we know. It is not real magic and more performative with focused on misdirection. The most famous magicians - that is what Muggles call them - have performances all over the world to audiences of thousands of people and make millions of Galleons annually from these performances."

Though intrigued by the amount of money, Lucius remained stonefaced and coldly said, "Why are you telling me this? What does it matter what these Mud - Muggles do? What does it have to do with you?"

Draco halted for a moment, collected himself, and with conviction said, "I have become one of them and quite clever with my 'magic tricks'. I take polyjuice to disguise myself as an American man in his 20s. My fame is growing and I have even been on television, which is a Muggle box that has moving pictures that Muggles put in their sitting rooms. But I digress. I will continue pursuing my career as a Muggle magician. I love it and there is nothing you can do about it. You can console yourself knowing that the family wealth will grow quite a bit through my ambition and cunning, even though you don't approve. Good-bye, Father."

Lucius was dumbfounded. There was nothing he could do about the situation from prison now that his influence was broken and his business associates were all in a similar situation as he. Draco was now of age at 18 and able to make his own decisions. Lucius was powerless and resigned himself to the situation. "Draco, wait."

Draco turned slowly with his hand still on the door handle. "Yes, Father?"

Lucius looked at his son in the eyes. "Draco, you have my consent. Not that you need it". Draco turned to leave and Lucius yelled out, "What name do you go by in the Muggle world?"

Draco looked over his shoulder with a smirk and said, "Blaine. David Blaine." Then he left without another word.
