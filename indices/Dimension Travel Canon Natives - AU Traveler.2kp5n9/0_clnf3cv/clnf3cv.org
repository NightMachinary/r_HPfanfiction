[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2595818/1/Rectifier][Rectifier]] is the fic you mentioned where Professor Riddle *journies to the canon universe.

I can't, off of the top of my head, think of any more where X joins Canon without it being a time travel, or a dimension hopping like chapter 17 of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging][The Merging]]

Actually, I can: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4118383/20/Harry-Potter-And-The-Elemental-s-Power][HP and the Elemental's Power]] chapter 20, which I've linked to, onwards for a couple of chapters.
