1. D&D wizard character operating by D&D rules attempting to survive in HP world that operates by HP rules. If you know D&D ruleset - that is already somewhat of a challenge because in D&D wizards get a limited number of specific spells which they can acquire by means mostly not available in HP world. More importantly they are much more limited in use of these spells compared to wizards of HP. In D&D they need to select these spells ahead of time, planning out possible needs for next day, and are than limited in both types of spells and the number of casts they have chosen to prepare. So much weaker overall compared to HP wizards that are only limited by their knowledge and skill. On top of that, MC must not only fit in and be competitive (story is pretty action heavy), but also hide his abnormality from school officials and authority as much as possible.

2. MC in this case did not just step over from a D&D setting - he is in fact an agglomeration of a D&D player character (in terms of his abilities/limitations) and a pretty common mindset of D&D players. So there is a pretty interesting and often funny interpretation of one world with a bent (but not broken) fourth wall. As the story develops the differences and limitations of that mindset are made fun off, explored and slowly evolved. So not only does the story feature/examine and makes fun of a lot of tropes of the game itself and those who play it - there is also a gradual but somewhat deep character development of an original character. That's quite rare in this fandom.

3. Above mentioned mindset is hellbent on exploitation of an absolute ruleset of D&D game in order to achieve whatever goals it needs to. Often in imaginative and amusing ways.

4. The story itself is pretty good in pacing and has a very nice mix of action/humor/relationships (not yet big on romantic side). That's again rare in this fandom where most stories choose to focus on only one of these aspects.
