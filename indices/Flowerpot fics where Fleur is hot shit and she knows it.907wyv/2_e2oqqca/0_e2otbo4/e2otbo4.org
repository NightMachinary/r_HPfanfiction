I lost a ton of respect for the Weasley women and Hermione when dealing with Fleur. Fleur, who was known as the top student in a large school pulling from Western Europe and could charm a dragon, would have wrecked the women in that household. The Weasley women in the books is crazily written, anytime someone disagrees with Molly, she just glares at them and they become frightened and submissive. Or Ginny with her ferocious temper hexes them and then yells at them. I was rooting to Fleur to turn them into the teapot set in Beauty and the Beast.
