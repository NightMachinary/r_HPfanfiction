My dude, I agree with your whole post. The Ginny bit has always stuck in my craw, even when pairings were a non-issue for me. I read "monster in his chest" and younger me was utterly baffled about what was happening to Harry. A heart attack, maybe. Perhaps Cho came on strong and Harry couldn't resist. Guess it was just true love that had built up over the course of... oh, nope.

The Hermione bit is also spot on. I mean, I could see her becoming Minister (or finagling things so some committee or other she was on had power to enact the policy changes she wanted. But the leader of the country? Never rang true as fitting her character.
