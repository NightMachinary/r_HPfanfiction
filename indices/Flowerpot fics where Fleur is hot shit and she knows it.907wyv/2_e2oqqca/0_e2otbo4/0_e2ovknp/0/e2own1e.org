I think there are only a handful of characters that didn't need everyone around them dead or crippled. Fleur, Bill, Charlie, Arthur, Flitwick, Sprout (I can't remember if McGonagall losing her family is fanon or not).

TBH we really don't know how any of them will be as they grow up. In canon Hermione has the charisma of a flubberworm. She has few leadership skills and it completely baffles me that she became Minister of Magic in the play. To me she reeks of professional bureaucrat.

Ginny is strange because one moment she is irrelevant and the next she is the best quidditch player and the most beautiful girl in the school and everybody loves her. Just straight out of left field.

It was just hard to follow character development in the series. So much in the last 2 books was just wishfulfillment. No development in the characters or world especially outside of Hogwarts.
