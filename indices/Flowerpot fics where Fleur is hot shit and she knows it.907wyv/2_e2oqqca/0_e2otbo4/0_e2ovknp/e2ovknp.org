I agree with you with Molly. Less so with Hermione and Ginny, because even though they were wrong to dislike Fleur so much, they were also teenage girls, and teenagers are absolutely brutal to people they don't like, and both grew out of it.

But Fleur was one of the few people in Harry Potter who was brilliant, talented, and had depth of character without needing everyone she ever loved to die, and for that she what, gets to be shat on by both the other characters in the series until she "proves herself" to really love Bill, and then gets shat on by the general community because being attractive apparently means your character is worthless.
