This is only tangentially related, and definitely more discussion oriented.

I think the thing that irritates me about people's perception of Fleur is that she's attractive, so she either needs to suffer for it so that we can care about her, or she needs to be a bitch about so that we can all hate her without having to feel bad about it.

Like, fuck if someone is attractive and is also a person who has emotions that matter, right? God forbid she enjoy her dates and be secure in her appearance, that's just too much for Harry Potter fans to handle.

Out of everyone, I think Fleur's treatment by the Weasley women and Hermione was the most uncalled for. I lost some respect for Molly Weasley after seeing how she treated Fleur, for daring to be attracted to love her son, and Fleur snatching the scar ointment from her and shutting her down at the end of HBP was extremely satisfying.
