  Harry, as a hormonal 14-year-old teenager, just happening to be "allure immune" and unaffected by her looks is also unbelievable.

I mean, canon Harry isn't really affected by her. At least not to any higher degree than you see with any teen boy and an extremely beautiful woman. He doesn't actually have any notable reaction to her in the books. Her beauty isn't even noted outside of Ron's reaction, and he looks to Cho fairly quickly after.

From the book:

  It was the girl from Beauxbatons who had laughed during Dumbledore's speech. She had finally removed her muffler. A long sheet of silvery-blonde hair fell almost to her waist. She had large, deep blue eyes, and very white, even teeth.

  Ron went purple. He stared up at her, opened his mouth to reply, but nothing came out except a faint gurgling noise.

  “Yeah, have it,” said Harry, pushing the dish toward the girl.

Chapter 16, Goblet of Fire.

  "I'm drop-dead gorgeous and can make men fall for me with a look, boohoo my life is so hard." How many women would kill to switch places with her?

Grass is always greener on the other side. Attractive people can have their own problems too. At the risk of sounding vain, I understand what it's like to have problems stem from one's own appearance. I'm certainly no Fleur, but if I was, I imagine I'd find it fairly annoying. It's often overdone in fanfics, but I get it to an extent.

That said, I also get what you mean. A lot of fanfics do it. I think I might be guilty of it as well (I honestly don't remember). A Fleur with your description does seem closer to canon. She does flirt with Cedric, make out (or more) with her Yule Ball date, and generally doesn't come across as a person that's unhappy with herself. I think linkffn(Half-Blood Romantic) might have Fleur be like that to a degree? I'm not entirely sure.

I'm not sure if the bot is working, so here's a direct link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12627473/1/The-Half-Blood-Romantic]]
