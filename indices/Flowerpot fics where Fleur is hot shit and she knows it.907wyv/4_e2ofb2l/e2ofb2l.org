  Are there any fics where she knows she's hot and owns it? Where she loves having a power over men and isn't afraid to use it, even if it's just for her own amusement?

I think that writing Veela similar to Asari from Mass Effect works well. An attractive species who embrace their sexuality and own it. Like, Fleur knows that she can seduce most guys (and girls), has done so a couple times, it's not a big deal in her culture, and there are quite a few of her year mates who resent her because they are jealous. Some people see Veela as nothing but sex objects.

Yet at the same time, Fleur has friends and is generally easy going, takes a mentor role for the younger students at Beauxbaton and only uses the "bitch" persona to keep the most superficial suitors away.
