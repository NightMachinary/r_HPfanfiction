Choices by random-fruitcake04 Linkffn(7467796). Everyone always amps up the Red Knight, but Choices is actually a far better example of a Slytherin!Ron story. The fanfic's canon divergence actually doesn't originate from his sorting, but rather Ron's Seer abilities. Being sorted into Slytherin is just a natural progression from how his priorities shifted after experiencing several visions in his childhood, most notably seeing his brother's death. Ron is determined to prevent that from happening. He is still very much the hot tempered and stubborn Ron we know from the books though. Draco and Ron hate each other even more if possible, and instead he develops friendship of a sort with Theo and Daphne. It's still a WIP, but does not appear to be abandoned.
