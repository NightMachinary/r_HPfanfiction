There are quite a few fics out there that I think folks know are amazing, and yet they rarely get recommended because they are also abandoned or unfinished and many people hate that. I know I hesitate to read things that are abandoned or unfinished and usually ask for completed fics. And yet, I have come across unfinished ones that are so incredibly good.
