I don't really know a lot about Vekin's series, I just looked it up to check cause I did think it was the older series, but I do know that there was a break between his 6th and 7th, maybe NP's inspired him to get back into it and finish it off? Not really sure.

I've only read NP's at this point just because it was the first one I came across, and I did really enjoy it, but I've been meaning to read Vekin's as well at some point so if they're similar then I'm sure I'll enjoy it, thanks! :)
