It's my headcanon, too! Besides, the OCs are believable. I love Aidan and Alec and Helio Wilcox is a favorite. I'm midway through Hourglass Empire and I hope the author doesn't push Alec and Aidan aside like in the third sequel. I also have a feeling that Gallen and Adelina will appear again. Maybe Wes Westeling is alive?
