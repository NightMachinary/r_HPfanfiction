  Ronald Weasley follows in his father's footsteps, pushing the envelope of magical application to muggle science. As the forerunner of his new magical art, Ron is forced to make a universe-altering choice-one that spits in the face of magic, science, and logic. With a magic-generated Tipler cylinder and a dash of exotic matter, the world's first Technomancer travels back in time.
