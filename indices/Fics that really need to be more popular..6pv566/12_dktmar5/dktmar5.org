I found this one yesterday in another thread. It's a bit weird and is a WIP, but it seems to have potential. It has an original premise if you like Evil!Ron/MorallyGreyRon with a dash of time travel.

I think it'll gain more popularity as it updates, since its a new fanfic (at least on fanfiction.net, but I can't find it anywhere else).
