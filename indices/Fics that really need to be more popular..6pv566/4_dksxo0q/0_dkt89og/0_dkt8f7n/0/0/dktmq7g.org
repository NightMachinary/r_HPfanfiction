Which segways into my only problem with the story.

The Dumbledore in this story has no ability to think outside the box. Dumbledore himself mentally identified the fact that Harrison had identical eyes to Lily Potter, yet still completely discarded the fact that Harrison is Voldemort's son. I can't explain this further without spoiling though.

A real pity the author has been having problems in real life, and thus can't update the story. The story really has no equal.
