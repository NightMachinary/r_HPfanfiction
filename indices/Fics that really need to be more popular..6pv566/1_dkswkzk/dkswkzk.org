I'm very fond of "Nocturnal" by Red Garden Gnome, and have recommended it several times on here. It's a Charlie/Hermione romance/adventure story, in which I think truly captures the symmetry Charlie and Hermione could possibly have if they ever were to encounter one another, thereby starting a relationship after. It's well-written, long, and completed, which is bonus points towards the fic. The author clearly has an incredible imagination when it comes to the dragon reserve set in Wales (which is where the second half of the story is located) but the author also includes little wisps of magic here and there, and interweaves it within the characters and story, akin to what JK Rowling did within her books. The dialogue is probably the author's strongest suit, and it's both funny and readable and not cringe-worthy. Sadly, the fic has 127 "favs" and 187 follows (according to this posting) with 74 reviews. It's most certainly a gem hidden within the rocks.
