Blood and Chocolate by Lady Lemon Drop is /amazing/. It's uncompleted, sadly, but it is, by far, one of the better fics I've ever read, despite her mixing up dates occasionally. I also like it because it's one of the few H/G fics that shows Ginny's friends outside of Luna, Hermione, Neville, and Harry.
