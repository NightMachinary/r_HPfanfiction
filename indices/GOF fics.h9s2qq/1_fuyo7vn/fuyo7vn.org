This one definitely fits the criteria of being an AU. The canon divergence being that Remus remembers to take his Wolfsbane potion, so no time-turner, Buckbeak dies, and Pettigrew goes to Azkaban. Harry isn't a Triwizard champion, so that means the Tournament doesn't get much air time. So no Voldemort or graveyard resurrection either. It /does/ feature plenty of magical theory, Harry taking his studies seriously, and Black family lore. So if any of those things interest you, I'd recommend giving it a try.
