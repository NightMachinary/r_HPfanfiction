That author makes such likeable OCs and is a great writer, but i had to give up the story. He allows so much to happen 'off screen', while chapter after chapter Harry reads, studies, is tutored, etc. At first, I thought 'okay, maybe writing action isn't his forte', but then there was that epic battle with the acromantula, and I realized he was capable of amazing action scenes and choosing not to show them.

Had to drop it, because it was too frustrating to read how Harry comes out of the Chamber every day to get updated about all the exciting things that happened while he was jerking off with his mini-dragon... ðŸ™„
