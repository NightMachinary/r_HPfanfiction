Now that's an interesting question. Assuming the bubble-head charm just simulates earth-atmosphere what you would essentially have is a copy of that everywhere, and while we don't notice that it weighs quite a bit.

But yeah there would probably be loads of unforeseen consequences, for one it probably only simulates atmosphere close to earth-surface, since it needs to be breathable by humans, so there wouldn't be an ozone-layer, although maybe one would form?

You're right, it seems like the field of magical tarraforming might be in need of a little more detail than "stick a bubble-head charm on it and Bob's you uncle" after all.
