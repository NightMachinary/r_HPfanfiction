Um. Radiation (light) carries heat very slowly. solar-system atmosphere means that now sun's heat is carried by convection. we cook to death quickly.

Also Even assuming at creation of bubble, the air created is moving at the correct orbital velocity at each point... you're gonna get all kinds of fun drag. death spiral into the sun, anyone?
