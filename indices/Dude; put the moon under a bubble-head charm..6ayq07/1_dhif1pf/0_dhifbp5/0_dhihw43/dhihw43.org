Assuming it's possible to magically give the entire solar system an atmosphere ex nihilo it might not be a good idea. That's a, a, I actually don't have a word for how much mass that would be adding to the system. I have no idea what impact that would have on orbits, or if the sun would just combust all of it immediately. Terraforming should have as far reaching of consequences though.
