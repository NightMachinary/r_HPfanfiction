This is a really intriguing idea-- What might be even more fun to add on is if Draco does exclusively ballroom & Luna exclusively contemporary. They're paired up by circumstance or accident, and at first it hella does not work. His style is more rigid & structured, and Luna's is more emotional & interpretive. Then, as the story progresses, they become better dancers together because they have things to learn from each other, both as people and as performers.
