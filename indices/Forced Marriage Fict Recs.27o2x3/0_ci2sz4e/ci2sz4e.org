The sort of thing you're looking for is written badly 99.9% of the time for a very good reason. Your best bet is going to be to take 1 or 2 of these criteria and look for that. The Marriage Stone is the only remotely tolerably written on stories in this style and even that has its fair share of issues.

Long story short good luck, you'll reaaaaaally need it.
