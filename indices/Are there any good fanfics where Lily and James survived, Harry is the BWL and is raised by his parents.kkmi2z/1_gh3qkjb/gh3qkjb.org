linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) has most of that, except that there is no prophecy and no boy-who-lived. Tom Riddle went into politics instead of war, so less people died but non-Purebloods are officially banned from Hogwarts and from many types of employment.

But all the Marauders survived, as you say; Sirius even has a son. And Harry is indeed powerful, except that that's both blessing and curse; it draws more attention to her than she can really afford.

The author has done an excellent job of weaving canon elements into a really original story.
