I've had my share of pretty harsh criticism. I hated it at first, I wondered what the point of writing even was. I would get petty--I'd check out stories by whoever it was that had criticised me, and think to myself that they weren't any better.

It's only when you start trying to use the criticism that I think it starts to make sense. I analyzed it, I asked myself how I would write a story that would not be subject to that criticism, while still being the story I wanted to tell. I'm still far from great, but I've improved.

Ultimately, as you said, we're not getting paid. We (or at least I) write for our own enjoyment, and there's some strange sense of joy in things that are just done really well. I could write out a hundred thousand words in a month, but I would much rather write half of that and make sure that it's done well, that I can read it back and go: "I want to know what happens next."

Of course, it's my story. I do know what happens next: I keep writing.

Edit: of course, this refers to /constructive/ criticsm. The one I got was: "cut out at least half your adjectives. Nothing happens in this chapter, it's just useless description." If someone reviews your story and they go: "This story is stupid, you're stupid and you look stupid," they're not worth your time.
