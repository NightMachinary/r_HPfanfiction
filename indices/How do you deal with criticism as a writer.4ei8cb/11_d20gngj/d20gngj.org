There's been times I've wanted to delete everything, especially after a nasty anon review, but then I tell myself that I was having fun before and why let another person ruin my fun? 9 times out of 10, they're either anon or from a throwaway account with no bio or stories on it so they're probably a troll or bully. At least I have the guts to post my work and review under my penname.

As for concrit reviews, I've learned to accept them more gracefully. I've also learned to stand by my work. The thing is, not all concrit is good advice. I receive a lot through review games / review trades, and some of it can be very contradictory to each other. One person might thing a scene is very emotional and well-done, another might call it over-dramatic. It's one thing to correct grammar or plot holes or weak characterization, but then there comes a point where it's very subjective and sometimes you're going to disagree.
