I've gotten a bit of good criticism in my time, which mainly amounted to, "add more description to your scenes." I can agree with that, too. When I read my own work, most of the time it feels really dry and sparse, but the problem is that adding good description is /really/ hard. And when one of my friends tried to give me advice on this topic, I disagreed with her advice. I don't think adding dialogue tags like, "the green-eyed Gryffindor retorted" is good writing. It's redundant and unnecessarily hard to follow.

Any advice on this? I think it would really help me write faster if I knew how to tackle descriptions.
