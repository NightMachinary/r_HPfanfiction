To me, criticism is a big bonus of fanfiction. At this point, only friends and family read my original stuff, fanfiction allows me to test my writing and storytelling skills on a bigger audience than I could ever reach otherwise. Reviews that offer constructive criticism are by far my favourites, and sometimes even lead to interesting conversations and new insights into characters, or the HP world in general. Sometimes they also inspire ideas I wouldn't have thought of otherwise.

Negative criticism can be a downer for a short while, especially if I put a lot of work into the chapter in question, but in the end I either agree and try to do better, or it turns out I prefer my version of things anyway. Especially in the beginning, contradictory criticism was quite confusing. I have a scene in my story from Hermione's POV, and some people like it, some say I didn't do her justice, and others simply despise her character and dislike the scene on principal. So with time I've learned to take criticism concerning certain canon characters with a grain of salt.

About really rude reviews... somebody once told me I'm a loser (and a mudblood :D ) because my characterisation of Harry didn't fulfil their expectations. It was more entertaining than anything else. Not worth getting angry about, in any way, especially as it was written by an anonymous reviewer.

So my advice would be to concentrate on the opportunities the review function offers to you as a writer. There are actually people out there reading your story, who are invested enough to give you feedback for free. They might point out weaknesses, but that gives you the chance to work on that. Someone criticises your grammar and spelling? - You know to double check that before you post the next chapter. Someone doesn't understand why a character is acting a certain way? - Go back and take a look at what motivated your character, written down, things can look quite different than they did in your mind.

Of course that's easier said than done, and not every reviewer should be taken seriously, but I think a positive and open attitude on the writers side can help.
