I don't think there /is/ much useful advice. In the end, it boils down to 'be a different person'. Be rational, not emotional, and be self-assured, not self-concious.

If you are, you realise words on the internet can't hurt you, and you can take criticism of whatever form, filter out the useful parts, apply it to you, and improve. The last part goes for criticism anywhere in life.

So the question then is, probably, how to improve confidence and how to act rationally, and eh ... I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all solution.

The funny thing is that the less you'd mind really harsh criticisms, the less you seem to get, at least in my experience. Possibly because confidence is based on competence, so there simply /is/ less to criticise.
