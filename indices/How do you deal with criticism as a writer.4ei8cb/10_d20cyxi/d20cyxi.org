I wish I'd get more real criticism. I'm quite a perfectionist, and I don't think any of my stories (all one-shots so far except from an Albus/Gellert multichapter about their summer together) so far are up to the standard I'd have as a reader, but I was posting them anyway hoping for some real criticism.

Instead, I've often received praise even in review tag games, but I always think people who praise my stories are either too polite or not looking hard enough. My stories don't really get that many views, so I guess those reviewers are just too polite...

I don't need people telling me something is perfect if I'm well aware it isn't. Many fanfiction.net readers are too easily pleased. I really love constructive criticism, especially on my writing style. I don't like reviewers demanding to change the plot though, like "please make this Dumbledore bashing" or "just send Ariana to St. Mungo's".
