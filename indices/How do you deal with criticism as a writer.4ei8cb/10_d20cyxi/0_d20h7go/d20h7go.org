Hey I took a look at your story. I read the first chapter. I liked the friendship between Elphias and Albus. There were a few typos in the chapter which distracted me a bit. Typos sometimes cause me to stop reading a fic. If you want specifics of all the typos I caught, send me a PM and I can go into more detail. Overall, I did like the opening and it set up the story well.
