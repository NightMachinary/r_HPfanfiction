I'd rather have one comment outlining exactly why the reader thinks my story is terrible and needs extensive reworking than 100 "love it please write more"s, not going to lie.

If someone's taken the time out to write those things down, think about them. You don't even necessarily have to agree with what the person's said, but if they've actually given criticism, they're trying to help you improve.

Be driven to improve - even if it hurts, what that person has said is extremely valuable, and they've handed you a tool to improve your writing, your characterization, your worldbuilding. Try and ignore any sarcastic tone to it, just break the comment down to the bones and see how you can approach using them constructively.

Sure, it hurts. If it really hurts, go have a cup of tea or a yoghurt, have a nice long shower, read for a bit, distance yourself a little, and then go back and read it again. Try and view the comment and your work objectively if it helps.

And if you have a cry, don't worry about it. I have had many a cry over things that don't matter, and writing is a pretty sensitive hobby. You have to put yourself in your characters' shoes, and a criticism can feel like a personal attack sometimes - but just remember, it's not. You're you, and it's all cool.
