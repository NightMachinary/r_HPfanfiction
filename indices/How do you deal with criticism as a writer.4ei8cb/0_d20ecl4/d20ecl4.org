I may be a minority opinion, but I love harsh constructive criticism. My favorite type of reviews are those that tell me how much I need to improve in my writing. I especially think harsh reviews are needed sometimes to deflate the ego I get from FFN reviews. I think what's important is realizing that when people give concrit, they actually cared about your story. They've spent enough time and effort to come up with a review when they could have easily ignored it and moved on. I think realizing that was what made me truly thankful for those who are giving harsh feedback. Worst case, they were invested enough in your story to feel disappointed.

As for inflammatory/trolling reviews, I generally don't care. I mean, I've probably heard worse things in the internet. Besides, it helps if you think that it increases your review count at the end XD
