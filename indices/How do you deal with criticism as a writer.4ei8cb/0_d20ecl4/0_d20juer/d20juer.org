In posting poetry online, I find that harsh and very critical (but constructive) comments motivate me just as much as really positive reviews, sometimes even more so.

Especially those comments that are really good at pointing out exactly what they think could be improved. It just makes me so excited, because I'll be able to use those tips for all the new stuff that I write. It helps so much.
