It depends what is getting criticized, and how.

If the criticism is insulting, or mocking, then I ignore it. Those people don't want to offer constructive criticism, they are posting for their own audience.

If the criticism boils down to "I don't like this story, write a story I like", or "this is not canon, write canon!" then I ignore it.

If the criticism is constructive, I'll check it out, and may change stuff or not.
