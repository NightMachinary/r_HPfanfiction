As someone working in the creative industry I'm somewhat "battle-hardened", I'd say. Its one thing to receive criticism, its another thing if that criticism could cost you your monthly paycheck.

I think its important to understand something crucial before you read criticism. /Nobody/ is objective and there are as many opinions out there as there are humans. With that realization another comes right around the corner: You cannot please everybody. Period. As a matter of fact, if you please everybody, you please no one, least of all yourself. And for a last point: You share much of your taste with others. Use your own sense of whats good and whats bad to build something /you/ like. Others will like it as well, I promise. But if you don't like what you do, why should others?

When it comes to dealing with criticism, I always try to remain professional and pragmatic. I don't do it for my fics, but for my other work I make it a point to ask for the Ws. Why didn't you like this development? What would you've done? Where would you place this? and so on and so on. Dealing with criticism is a lot like dealing with fear (Depending on whom you ask it may even be the same thing). Understanding it is the crucial part of using it for your own gain.

Then of course, try to read criticism while giving the critics the benefit of the doubt. Especially online you have people from all around the world. Often enough, many of them and a lot of native speakers do not find the right words. What they end up writing may sound insulting, but key here is to remind yourself that very few actually want to do that. Use their input, evaluate it and take from it what you can.

The only thing you'll just have to weather for yourself is the demotivation. Making Art is a brutal business. Creative processes bring forth something from deep within us. You have a love for the HP universe, so you use it to tell a story. That speaks of a passion for this source material. Publishing it... that takes courage. You're offering the world something that started within you and that came not just from your mind, but from your heart and soul. People not liking it hurts - a lot. Dealing with it is not something people on here can help you a great deal with. But heed this advice: Remind yourself of your passion, your drive. And maybe print out some good criticism - that helps too.
