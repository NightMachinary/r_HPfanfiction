If a stranger on the internet offers valid complaints about my work, most of the time, I already know about the problem and agree. (And I publish anyway because what else can I do? I'm not going to rewrite it over and over until it's good; I have to get things finished eventually.)

I don't trust positive reviews, and I rather expect reviews to be targeted toward other potential readers, not me.
