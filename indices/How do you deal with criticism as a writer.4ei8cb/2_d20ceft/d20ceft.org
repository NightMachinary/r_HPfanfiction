I had my first proper criticism recently, and it hurt. It wasn't something I could fix, it was just someone not liking my new story as much as my old one. I had a little cry (my reaction to anything, unfortunately), reminded myself that I'm writing for me, not anyone else, and moved on. Of course I was demotivated at first, and I can be sensitive.

But, you said it yourself, we're not being paid here. We don't owe anyone anything. If it's something you can fix, or work on (i.e, if the criticism is constructive), then great! Definitely try to take it on board because it's satisfying watching your writing improve. But if you can't, or don't want to... At the end of the day, it's fanfic, and we do this because we love the source material. So if you feel like you've lost your motivation, go back to where you got it in the first place, and read the books again!
