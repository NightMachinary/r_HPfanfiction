It depends.

Is someone objectively pointing out plot holes and weak characterizations? Then I welcome it with open arms, no matter how harshly the feedback is worded.

Is the reviewer simply butthurt that I'm not catering to their subjective personal tastes? Even if it's respectfully rendered, I do my best to tear the reviewer to shreds.
