linkffn(Kicking Gotham) and it's sequel linkffn(Toppling Heroes) - DC Crossovers with Head Auror Harry, but who plays the game very well and some unique concepts described without them being an info dump.

Chapter 5 and 6 of Toppling Heroes has very unique and very realistic interaction with the Goblins, it shows their frosty relationship, but Goblins can't do anything to him, but sure show their displeasure, but that is only just a scene.
