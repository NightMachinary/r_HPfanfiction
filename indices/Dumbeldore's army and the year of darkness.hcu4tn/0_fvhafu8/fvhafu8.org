I'm fairly sure it's complete. I think it might have been taken down - it used to be easily searchable on ffn. It also had a facebook fan group only a couple of years ago. I think you can download it in pdf format?

As I understand it, the writer had a habit of deleting all evidence of his account and moving onto another. There was also a big scandal about an attached cult.
