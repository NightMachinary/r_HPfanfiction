  Hermione Granger is special. She has always known it, really, even before she received her letter. It was too bad that she had never met anyone as special as her, but she was hoping that would change now that she was going to Hogwarts. And she wasn't wrong, because the moment she laid eyes on Harry Potter she just knew he was very special indeed. Obsessive!Hr, Slytherin!HHr
