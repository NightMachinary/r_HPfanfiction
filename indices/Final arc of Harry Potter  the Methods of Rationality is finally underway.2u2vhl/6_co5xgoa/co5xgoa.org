This is the best fanfiction news I've heard in a long time.

No, really. I hate the story and think the author comes off as complete douche. It's just that I can't wait for him to leave the fandom and then we can all stop having to tolerate his legion of fanboys pimping this story at literally /every/ opportunity.
