I started reading HPMOR about a year ago. I finished it within a week(well to the then current in progress point). I've been waiting for several months for EY to publish the Final Arc and I can't wait for it to be done. For me, this is the best HP fanfiction I've read. It is as good as Rowling's books, which almost feels blasphemous to say. The next few months should be fun.
