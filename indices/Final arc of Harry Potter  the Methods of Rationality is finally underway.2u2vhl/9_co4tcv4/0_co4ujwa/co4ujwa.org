It's not just that it's propaganda or the guy goes against the fundamental principle of fanfiction, it being free, or that he's a smug dick.

It's that it's just a bit shit.

Yeah it's well written but the pacing is horrific, the characters unrealistic and the plot is everywhere but the difference between say Animal Farm and MoR is that AF works as a story with no deeper meaning. MoR is just a vessel to push his views, the actual story is terrible. That's why it isn't good, it's basically a series of poorly written scientific papers put into the HP universe with a vague attempt at linking them together.
