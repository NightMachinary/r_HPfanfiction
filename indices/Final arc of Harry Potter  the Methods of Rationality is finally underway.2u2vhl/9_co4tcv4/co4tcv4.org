I'm not sure why so many people seem to hate this story. Sure, it's propaganda--but propaganda can be entertaining! /Atlas Shrugged/ is propaganda--/Animal Farm/ is propaganda--/The Shape of Things to Come/ is propaganda--but they're still great books. I don't agree with the philosophy of /Atlas Shrugged,/ but the story's awesomeness still brings tears to my eyes every time I read it, even if it's absurdly exaggerated.
