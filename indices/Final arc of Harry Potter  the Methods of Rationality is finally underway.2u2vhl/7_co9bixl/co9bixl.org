You know, I used to really love /Atlas Shrugged/ - but with one thing or another didn't read it again for several years. (My old copy had been read so many times the spine broke, poor thing) I picked it up again, and despite the nostalgia and the excellent writing, I couldn't look past how thick the propaganda was.

MoR struck me much the same way, except that I hate the writing style, and there's no joy in the reading of it. The author writes like he intends it to be an academic work, and that makes it such a pain for me to slog through!

Also, the fact that he's a bit of a douchecanoe sealed the deal on my finally dropping the fanfic off of my notifications list and writing it off as a bad job.
