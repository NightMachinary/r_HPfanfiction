be careful -- this subreddit has a general bizarre hatred of hpmor and most of the criticisms don't make a whole lot of sense (or are flat incorrect)

there was a solid thread from just a couple of months ago, "what's the deal with hpmor" or some such, which i was active in and unfortunately can't find. [[/u/taure]] and a couple of other people leveled some very good points about things hpmor could do better. it was a good conversation.

anyway, read the last 60 chapters for yourself. don't take my or anyone else's word for it.
