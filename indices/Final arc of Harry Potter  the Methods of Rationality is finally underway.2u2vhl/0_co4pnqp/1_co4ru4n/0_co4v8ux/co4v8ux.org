  but what the heck happened?

The author started withholding chapters to milk the story to its maximum for attention and financial donations towards the NPO he's associated with.

His ego got too much out of control and made him lose any self-awareness about the whole thing.

The community started developing an unpleasant whiff that was reminiscent of a fledgling philosophical or political sect (e.g. the level of its members' susceptibility to Roko's Basilisk as a memetic virus was concerning).

Most importantly though, while the story's initial promise was to develop a /smart/ hero who would be solving his problems /rationally/, halfway through this stopped being the case. MoR!Harry was still spewing various psychological and epistemological concepts and facts to keep his “smart” image but the decisions he was making were in fact very stupid in their nature. The story wasn't being properly used for introducing tools of rational thinking either anymore. This made the story into just another crackfic with an OPed self-insert as the protagonist.
