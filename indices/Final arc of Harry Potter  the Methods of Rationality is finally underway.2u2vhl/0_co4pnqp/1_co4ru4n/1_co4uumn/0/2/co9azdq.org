I want to say that as far as readability goes, that would be the verbal equivalent of a run-on. It's not wrong, but it also is horribly not right.

In this instance, he is grammatically correct. However, grammar isn't as important as being able to read a sentence out loud without getting out of breath. Now, that can be a perfect way to show a character is worked up when they're speaking, but...

Why on earth would the narrator ever need to be gasping for breath at the end of a sentence? He shouldn't, unless it is first person narration.

Also, I've just realised, I feel like this is an excellent example of "telling" instead of "showing".
