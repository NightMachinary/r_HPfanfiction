The usage is correct. An editor would probably have them rewrite the sentence because it reads strangely. You can tell its correct by removing anything enclosed with commas and getting

"The debtor's meeting which Lord Malfoy had demanded from Harry Potter was held within the Gringotts Central Bank."

So its right, but it reads oddly.
