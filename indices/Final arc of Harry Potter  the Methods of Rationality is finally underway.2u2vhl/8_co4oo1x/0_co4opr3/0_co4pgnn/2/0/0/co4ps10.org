  He's using a popular medium to bring attention to something he thinks is important.

Fine. I've no issue with him doing that. My issue comes when he says he'll write more if his company gets more money and apparently gets paid to take time off to write it.

  he's not some 'vile' devil stealing money from readers and jkr to fund his maniacal plans like this sub likes to say
#+end_quote

I don't think anyone says that. I'm saying he's a vile person for charging for something he has essentially stolen and bastardised. There's a reason you aren't allowed to be paid for fanfiction and he's doing that in an indirect manner.

He's not stealing /money/ from JK or anyone else, he's just getting money in an immoral way.
