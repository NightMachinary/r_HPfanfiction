He got paid leave from his employer, that doesn't mean the money came directly from HPMOR donors.

Do you actually know how much money was given from people reading HPMOR and due to the writing?

I don't really see a problem with his organization giving him time off because he was successful in fundraising, nor with him mentioning them for donations.

He would publish it all even if nobody donated, it would just take more time to write. He has a job, and to take off costs.
