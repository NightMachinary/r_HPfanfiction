  Do you have a problem with that? The quotes had nothing to do with Harry Potter.

Yes! That's absolutely to do with HP, it's a fucking HP fanfiction! If he's not giving money to JK under a license agreement then he's breaking copyright law.

There's a reason you have to have a disclaimer on all of your fanfiction and frankly JK owns everything written in that universe and he shouldn't be profiting from it.
