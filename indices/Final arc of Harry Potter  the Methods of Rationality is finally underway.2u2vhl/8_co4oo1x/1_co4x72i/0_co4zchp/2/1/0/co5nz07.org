Those disclaimers actually don't do anything from a legal standpoint (in fact, a case can be made that they do more harm than good from the standpoint of protecting the fanfiction author).

While I think LW is an unrepentant asshat and I find his stories unpleasant to read, he's not the first to sell T-shirts off his fanfiction. Abraxan (or one of her fans) did for awhile, selling jerseys for the fictitious Quidditch team from her /Refiners Fire/ series. That stopped quickly after a CAD.
