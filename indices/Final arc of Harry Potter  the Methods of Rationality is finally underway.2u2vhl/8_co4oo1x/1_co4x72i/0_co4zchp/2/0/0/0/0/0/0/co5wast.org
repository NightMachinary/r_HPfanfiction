but if you are not accusing him of infringing, why do you have problem with him making money of Rowling's work? Money is not always part of licensing deals. He may in fact have had permission free of charge.... or maybe he didn't, but Rowling decided that his use of her property is fine with her.

The only thing known with relative certainty is that: (1) he made some sales of those tshirts (2) Rowling or whoever on her staff handles licensing is definitely aware of it and (3) they chose to ignore it for one reason or another.

So if Rowling doesn't have a problem with what he did, why should anyone else have a problem on her behalf.

  Would it then suddenly be okay for me to have a problem with it?

well yes... that's exactly how it should work in my opinion. You wait for potentially aggrieved party to decide if they are in fact aggrieved - and only if they do so, you start posting on forums about what a shit LW is for violating Rowling's rights.
