Obviously it is not up to me to accuse someone on infringing on someone else's copyright. I don't see why saying I have a problem with it is an issue... I'm not threatening to sue or to go to JK Rowling and advise her to sue I'm simply saying it is wrong to make money from material that is based on the Harry Potter books. Imagine that somehow this has gotten past JK's staff and she finds out about it tomorrow and sues. Would it then suddenly be okay for me to have a problem with it?

By the comment about him giving some of the proceeds to JK Rowling I hoped to get across that he was doing so with permission from her and therefore would probably be sharing the profits.

I don't like how copyright law works in the US but I do understand it. I know little of how it works in Britain.
