not disputing that. It wouldn't matter at this point though even if LW printed pages from HP books on TShirts and sold them.

My point it is that since HP is copyrighted to Rowling, it is up to her to accuse LessWrong or anyone else of infringing on her copyright. Not you. Just as it is not for you to decide if there is money owed to Rowling or how much of it

I could understand your condemnation of LW's conduct, if it was done in *support* of an existing effort by the actual copyright holder who have decided that their copyright was infringed upon.

However without such an effort, it simply looks like a bunch of ardent fans are taking it upon themselves to make decisions that aren't up to them to make, and trying to inspire public condemnation themselves.

For all you know, she might be a fan of his, or just liking that particular endeavor and be in tacit approval of LW's use of her work.

edit: also in regard to this statement

  I have a problem with that unless he is giving some of that money to JK.

just in case you are unaware - if Rowling did decide that LessWrong's sale of said TShirts is infringement, him giving her part of the proceeds, or even all proceeds wouldn't make that infringement any *less wrong*. Since it's not up to him either to unilaterally decide the license pricing or permission of use of intellectual property someone else owns. It's quite common for copyright/trademark owners to refuse use of them entirely if they feel that use might reflect badly on the trademark overall. For example it's likely that Rowling wouldn't appreciate a porn shop marketing one of their dildos as "Harry Potter's Wand", even if the shop choose to send her a cheque for 100% of sales revenue - seeing as the HP trademarks and copyrights are mostly marketed to children and young teens.
