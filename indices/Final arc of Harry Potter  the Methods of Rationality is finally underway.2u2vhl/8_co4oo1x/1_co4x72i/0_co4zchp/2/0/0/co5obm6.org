if JKR had a problem with it, there would be a CAD letter and/or lawsuit ongoing. It's not like she doesn't have enough staff working for her that they would be completely ignorant of HPMOR's existence.

It's kind of weird that you have problem over secondary use of JKR's intellectual property in a case where she apparently doesn't.

One could actually say you seem to be spreading false impressions of disapproval in her name, while she herself hasn't bothered at all.
