Just to be clear I haven't insulted LW in any way.

Secondly, while I'm sure JK and more likely the other people holding a copyright have a staff dedicated to finding infringement cases, It is not obvious that they would catch every single case or that they are definitely aware of this one.

I disagree with how you think my opinion should work but again I never even saw the t-shirts and can't even say for sure if they are objectionable.
