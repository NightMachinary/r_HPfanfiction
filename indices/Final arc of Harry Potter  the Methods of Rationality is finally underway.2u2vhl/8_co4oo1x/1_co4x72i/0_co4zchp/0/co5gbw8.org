there's quite a bit of misinformation in this thread (as usual when it comes to this topic) -- he occasionally is given time off of his work with a rationality/ai nonprofit because part of the reason he began the story in the first place was to spread awareness. i don't know if it's paid time or not, probably paid. in any case, his writings over the years have almost certainly brought more attention to his nonprofit than anything else they've done.

he has never to my knowledge withheld chapters intentionally for donations. you'll see that complaint a lot. when writing pace is slow, it's because he's busy doing non-writing work.

anyway, don't believe everything you read. if you like the story, sink some time into finishing it. if you don't, don't.
