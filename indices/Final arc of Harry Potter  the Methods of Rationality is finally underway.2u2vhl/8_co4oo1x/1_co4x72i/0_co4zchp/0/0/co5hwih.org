I have to say reading through this thread and seeing those claims my first reaction is to ask for evidence. I've read most author's notes and never once saw one where it felt like he was asking for money before posting a story. He gives reasons for why he isn't writing as much as we all wish he was, but that is not nearly the same as asking for money since even if MIRI(Machine Intelligence Research Institute) got more funding, that would more than likely mean more work for him to be able to do for them. I doubt any organization like that would pay someone to not work for them. If I'm wrong, someone provide evidence.
