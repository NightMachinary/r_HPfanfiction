I've read a fanfic where Lily survives but is put into a coma and Remus takes care of her. After she wakes up Remus goes to get Harry, and upon finding out what Petunia did to her son Lily pretends to be a ghost and haunts Petunia until she goes nuts. Not exactly what you had in mind but it might work.
