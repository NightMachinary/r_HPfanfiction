It never sounded like that to me.

In the story the brothers 's gf's spirit was sad because he was holding her in the living world. I don't think she ever told him to join her, it just was to much for him to see her but never be able to truly be with her (to me it sounded like it was torture for both of them).

I also think JKR treated the spirits Harry saw in the woods as a true comforting presence, which makes me suspect they were supposed to be the spirits of the actual people.

It seems what makes the ring dangerous (pre Horcrux) is not the magic itself, but people being unable to let go of the past and those they lost.
