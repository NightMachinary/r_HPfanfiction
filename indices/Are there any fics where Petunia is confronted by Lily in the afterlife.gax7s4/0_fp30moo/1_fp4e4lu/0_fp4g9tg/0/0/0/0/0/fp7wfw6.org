The graves have Christian quotes here because it's just "something people do". Likewise, people go to Church just long enough to be Christened to get married in the scenery of a church, then are barely seen again. Similarly, parents get their children Christened just so their children could get married in a church without that rigmarole.

Generally speaking, we do know what people's religion's are. Most people here are not very religious. We're now up above 50% of people having 'no religion' and a vast majority of Christians being non-practising. In addition, many parents (from a research perspective, not anecdotal) report only attending Church to get their children in particular schools. Some people put Christian on the census because it's 'how they were raised' or because they feel it's the proper thing to put down.

The books, of course, were not set 'now'. So, the 1980s - when the Potters died.

1980 - 11.1% of the population attend Church on a given Sunday. (Data from Christian Research)

1983 - 31% of people describe themselves as having 'no religion' and 65% described themselves as Christian. (British Social Attitudes Survey)

Also, the rates for Church attendance and religiousness has been falling so it's not that there was an increase, it's that literally there were plenty of people who called themselves Christian despite not practising or otherwise engaging with it outside of weddings, funerals and christenings. There are some who pop in for Christmas and Easter, of course.

So, in short - it shouldn't be obvious most characters are Christian, because 9/10 of them wouldn't have been doing anything particularly Christian beyond opening presents for Christmas.
