Ooh, another take could use Norse mythology: those who do not have an honourable death and die in battle go to Hel (one L, also called Helheim, located in the realm of frozen mists). If James fought back before he died, he probably didn't go there. I find James's last minutes very honourable and I'm sure the Norns or whoever decides whether the death was honourable or not would agree.

Some say not only does the person have to die in battle but they also have to die with a weapon in hand (Rick Riordan is adamant about that detail in his Magnus Chase series). A potential author could use that detail and say Lily was too busy blocking Harry with her body to think about lifting a wand, Petunia died in a car crash and therefore they both ended up in the same place. I've seen some authors say James left his wand on a side table in his rush to confront Voldemort so maybe the author has him spend eternity with Lily too giving Petunia Hell.
