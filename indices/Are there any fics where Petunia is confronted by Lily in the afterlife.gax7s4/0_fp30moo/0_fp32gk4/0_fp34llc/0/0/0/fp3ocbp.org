  I've seen some authors say James left his wand on a side table in his rush to confront Voldemor

Oddly enough, this is actually canon. From DH, when Harry is seeing Voldemort's memory of that night:

#+begin_quote
  He was over the threshold as James came sprinting into the hall. It was easy, too easy, he had not even picked up his wand ...

  "Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off!"

  Hold him off, without a wand in his hand! ... He laughed before casting the curse ...
