I mean I definitely enjoy Harry-centric stories too, but I do enjoy to read about everyone doing awesome stuff (in sympathetic properties he's the central character, but the author is purposefully running as many story threads as they can)

I think the issue is that Harry's a cardboard cutout Everyman in a lot of stories which doesn't really make for rich characterisation! So for his particular question I don't think you'd find many Harry-centric fics that have that depth
