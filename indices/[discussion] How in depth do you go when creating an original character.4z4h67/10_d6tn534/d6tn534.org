I base all my OCs off other characters in other media. I rarely mention their basis unless they're basically throwaway characters like the Archer characters in Darkness Ascendant. I did mention in A Trek to the Stars that T'ryl is named after Teryl Rothery and looks like Rachel Riley.

Edit: just realized my edit didn't take. I basically take a dnd chara sheet and use that to expand on all characters so i know what they have, what they act like, and what they look like
