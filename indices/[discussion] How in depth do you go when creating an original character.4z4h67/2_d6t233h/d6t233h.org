Hmm ... well, I'm not writing actual fanfiction so every single character I create is an original one, but when I do it my approach depends on whether the character is a major one or a one-scene-wonder.

In the latter case it is simple: I treat them as tools to advance the plot so I just write the scene with the character in question when I need it and leave it in if it feels right to me.

In the former case I put in a bit more effort: I write down the list of noteworthy traits of that character, and then for each trait I write a short scene (that wouldn't be seen by anyone) that showcases the trait in question. If I cannot write the scene then the trait simply will not be there as that means it doesn't fit the character as a whole (and indeed, it had happened on a few occasions). I finish it off by writing a scene that is narrated by the character, to show how they think. It takes quite a bit of work with each added character that way, but it does give me a bit of consistency to begin with and a frame of reference if I ever think I lost the character's image and something I wrote might have caused them to become OoC. I do note that if the character changes throughout the story there will be scenes in the story proper that will show the change, and I copy those into the characters' notes too to have an easier time finding them; and if the change is not visible to the readers at first then the scene will still be written but not shown.
