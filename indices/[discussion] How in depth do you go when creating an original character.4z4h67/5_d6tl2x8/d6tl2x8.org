If the Original Character is not very important to the plot (e.g. it will only appear in one or two scenes and won't say many lines), I won't put much thought on them. The maximum I will do at these cases is making sure I have cohesive physical description of these particular OCs.

However, if it plays an important role (let's say, an OC who is pairing one of the main Characters and/or definitely plays a role in the story), I think it is very important to give some nice background story to them.

Where did this Character came from?, Who are the OC parents and grandparents? What did they do for living? Does he/she has any siblings? Who are their best friends? What are they good/bad at?, What are your OC hobbies? What does your OC really love/hate? What are their dreams, ambitions, fears? What is the most important thing in the world for them? What would your OC risk their life for? And the list of questions goes on and on...

I believe that in order to a character feels like a real person, they need to have a real story behind them. Of course, you can always expand the story if you feel the need. You might never end up using the details... or you might go back to your OC family tree when you need to write that 'it was Uncle Johnny - who works at the knockturn alley - who sent your OC that rare ingredient that he/she needed to brew that illegal potion'.
