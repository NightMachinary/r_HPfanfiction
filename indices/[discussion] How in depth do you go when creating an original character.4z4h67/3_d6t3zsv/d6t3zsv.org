For OC's or canon characters that are just a name or a few lines of text, I try to think of what good and/or bad personality trait the character stands for and which 'archetype' they represent and what function they have in the story. Then later I will think of the individual details that make them more real and less of a caricature, and their relationships with others. For some characters I had already a strong feeling of 'who they are' based on loose images. But I'm not really good at original characters, not at all.
