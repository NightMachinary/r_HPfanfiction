Well, I don't do it this way.

I play out a scene from my story in my head and imagine as if it were happening in real life. I'd play that scene back from all the characters in that scene -- portraits in Hogwarts, witch, wizard, maybe even a door or window -- and then I write the scene pulling in different unique points from each character or object.

The reason I do this, is because I believe that a story is so much more than just exchanging dialogues. Everything about a scene (like how a characters hand moves while talking to someone -- say his enemy --) will give the readers more clues to what might unfold in the future and helps by being an aid to the readers' imagination.

As for my characters, I generally stick to canon behaviour, but if I'm writing AU, then I like to look at the motives or events that led to him acting so OOC and then put myself in those shoes and enact a couple of scenes to ascertain how the character will feel.

I picked these up from my friend and guru -- Ann Charles. That's what she did when she wrote the Deadwood series.
