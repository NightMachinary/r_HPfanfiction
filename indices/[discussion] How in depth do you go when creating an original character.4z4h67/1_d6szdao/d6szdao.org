I use character forms that go into their backgrounds, their positive and negative traits, their ways of viewing the world, their habits and quirks, etc... It's on Mugglenet Fanfiction Beta Forums if anyone wants it.

I actually don't go into too much detail describing the physical appearance of my characters, even though I have a very clear idea of them in my head. I usually pick two or three defining features and use them to say something about their personality. If you go into too much depth you end up focusing too much on trying to get the reader to imagine it exactly as you do, and it's not necessary.
