I keep it pretty basic. I'll define characteristics such as age, eye color, hair color, family name, etc. For personality, I'll usually use a combination of other known characters. For example, in the fic I'm currently working on, I have an older wizard that I describe as "magical version of Tywin Lannister entering their twilight years, dismayed by the fact that their body is betraying them in old age, but hides it well."

I try to keep things pretty lose, because I can write a character before I even write a word of the actual story, but 50,000 words later, things may have worked out different than what you originally plan, and it's important to let a story flow naturally.
