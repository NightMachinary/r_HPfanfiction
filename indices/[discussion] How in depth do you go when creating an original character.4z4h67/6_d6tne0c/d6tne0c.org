I don't. I let them develop themselves. If I need a complicated backstory I might make notes I suppose.

I have used two major OCs - OCs whose POV is used to tell the story or part of it - and I have concentrated on their personality and thought processes. Physical appearance is only mentioned if the story switches to another POV and they are being observed by someone else. So what is described is what the other person notices. No more, no less. I use a lot of minor OCs but there I only work out the details I need to know. How old they are; marital status, occupation, general social demographic. Everything else happens naturally.

I wrote a multi chapter story where I never described the OC's appearance - because the whole story was from her POV and she is not vain enough to spend a lot of time looking in mirrors. And it was a deliberate decision to leave her appearance in the mind of the reader. I had one reviewer say they would like to know what she looked like, and another who thought she was beautiful :) When I wrote the same plot but from another POV I had to decide what she looked like. Until that point I hadn't really considered it because it didn't matter.

I tend not to decribe clothes unless they make an important point - in a historical story, say. But designer clothes or how tight and black someones trousers are (a la Janet Evanovitch) no, no definitely not.
