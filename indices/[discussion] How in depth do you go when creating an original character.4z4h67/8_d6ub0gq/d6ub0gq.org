I pick a couple of really defining physical features, and tend to use those when describing them vs. going into massive depth. Though I have a clear picture of how they look in my head, I think it's really important to allow the reader to build up their own image of the character in order to identify with them better. I focus a lot more on who they are as a person -- what their strengths and weaknesses are, and how they might react within a particular situation. I find it really helps to come up with certain defining points in their background as well, to illuminate what has shaped them into who they are today!
