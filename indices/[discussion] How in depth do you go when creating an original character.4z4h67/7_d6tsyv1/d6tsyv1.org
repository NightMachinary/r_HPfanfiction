Depends on how major/minor I intend the character to be. Some of the more major ones I'll write up a little few-paragraph bio, I like to know a little about their family history, their personality type (usually Myers Briggs or something just to get a more general sense if they're feeler vs thinker, introvert vs extrovert etc), what motivates them, some strengths, weaknesses, hobbies, friends/love interests/enemies, what happens to them after the story ends so I know where their arc is going. I'm also vaguely aware of what they look like but tend to give a few details and leave it up to reader imagination.

Minor characters I don't really develop outside the role in the story although for some of them I may know more because the back story got cut or the characters role got reduced.
