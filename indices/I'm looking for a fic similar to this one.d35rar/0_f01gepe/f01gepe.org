There aren't any fics like that, from what I know. There are some that are fairly similar.

The one I would recommend is: Accidental Hero (aka The Absentminded Revenclaw) linkffn(4669348)

Which is more of a collection of one-shots, rather than a story. But has fairly similar themes, just humour not drama.
