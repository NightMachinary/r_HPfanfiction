Great! I came to this site to post a Fic search, and stumble on this thread. I remember reading a story with this, and it was recently aswell, so I went back to Fanfiction.net looked at my favourites, and followings, went through ALL of 2017 and still cant find it, I mass clicked next chapter> Ctrl+F> wiggle for like 30 minutes, and Im giving up! All that I remember clearly about this story is that it was 100k+ words, most likely 200k+ (I tend to read them more) I also remember that the people who start using the term did so almost automatically really, some were quite shocked that it even came out of their mouth the first time. OH and Mcgonagall really didnt like it!
