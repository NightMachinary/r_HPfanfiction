The two of them bond, and grow to be good friends (along with Hedwig, who for some random reason doesn't eat the Snake), leading to Harry repeatedly bringing the snake to Gringotts each year when he's doing his shopping.

He tries to talk to the snake in English, since people get all 'creeped out' by the Parsel-thing, so when he tells Venomfang how helpful he's been and how much he appreciates his company and how much he cares, other people can understand him and gossip about it.
