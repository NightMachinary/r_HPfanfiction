  The adder is the UK's only venomous snake, but its poison is generally of little danger to humans: an adder bite can be very painful and cause a nasty inflammation, but is really only dangerous to the very young, ill or old.

British snakes are small and weak. They're not suitable for intimidating big angry blokes like Vernon. Even Petunia would probably just smash it with a shovel.
