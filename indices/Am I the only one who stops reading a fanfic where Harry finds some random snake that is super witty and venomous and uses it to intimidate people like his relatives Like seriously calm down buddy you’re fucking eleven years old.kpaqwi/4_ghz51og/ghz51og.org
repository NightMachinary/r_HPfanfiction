The thing about this 'find a snake and keep it' idea is that it doesn't fit in with the British climate. Many of these stories have the snake showing up in the Dursley's garden, as if Harry lives in some tropical jungle country or something. You might find a frog in a British garden or a hedgehog, but a snake is highly unlikely unless it was kept as a pet and escaped - which would be fine, but that's not usually what happens in these types of stories. I still read them though, because snake fics are often interesting!
