I think this is pretty in line with canon Harry.

At the top of CoS, Harry tells us the Dursleys don't lock him in the cupboard because they're afraid he'll do something to them. He even goes as far as to mumble under his breath to scare Dudley away from him. He's barely 13 when he tries this again with Marge, Hogsmeade, and St. Brutus' and is successful the next summer with Sirius.
