As far as I'm concerned, diagnosis spells don't exist. I always found it a bit ridiculous how the healer would cast a spell, and then all your health history would be written on a parchment, just like I always found the Tempus spell ridiculous (especially in a world setting where it's custom for every one to get a watch when they reach their majority).

Magical doctors do their job the same ways muggle ones do, they look at the symptoms of their patient and use it to determine a diagnosis. I guess some spells could be used to help them, but they should not be accurate at all. A healer diagnosis should be more along the lines of "Thanks to a spell I used, I could confirm your injury was caused by Dark Magic, but I have no idea what was the precise spell" rather than "Thanks to the diagnosis spell, I know this injury was caused by a spell "Sectumsempra" used by a Severus Snape the 12 of March at 22:17").
