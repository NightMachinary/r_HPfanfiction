This sums it up for me. I always thought it a bit ridiculous when authors use the fanon (afaik) charm Tempus and floating numbers appear to tell the exact time, or with the revealing charm, which makes the silhouette of the person or object or whatever appear (this last one could be canon, but it's been at least 5 years since i read DH and i can't be bothered to check). My actual headcanon is that it creates an awareness of some kind, where you cannot tell time precisely to the minutes, but some very rough estimate of when you are, time-wise. Of course, this could be extrapolated to other kind of magics, like diagnostics and detection, and could be even treated like an extra sense (which it kinda is), and be trained to be more accurate.

Edit: what really bothers me is that some people make magic which is to me so metaphysical sometimes, to be something so concrete as floating numbers that tell you the time, or a glowing red silhouette that tells you that there is someone sneaking about.
