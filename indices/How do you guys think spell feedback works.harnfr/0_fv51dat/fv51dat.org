I've always thought that magic must have some sort of mental feedback. Dumbledore (and possibly Harry himself) act upon that mental feedback.

HBP page 557:

  Dumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave, his wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot, examining the walls and ceiling.

  “Yes, this is the place,” said Dumbledore.

  “How can you tell?” Harry spoke in a whisper.

  “It has known magic,” said Dumbledore simply.

  Harry could not tell whether the shivers he was experiencing were due to his spine-deep coldness or to the same awareness of enchantments. He watched as Dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot, evidently concentrating on things Harry could not see.

  ...

  Dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips, murmuring words in a strange tongue that Harry did not understand. Twice Dumbledore walked right around the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as he could, occasionally pausing, running his fingers backward and forward over a particular spot, until finally he stopped, his hand pressed flat against the wall.

  “Here,” he said. “We go on through here. The entrance is concealed.”

  Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.

Plus, seers, for all the disbelief Hermione has in the subject, gain insight into the world via magic. Centaurs can look at the stars and glean meaning that muggles could never get. Even for non-seers, there are ways to gain information from magic itself, rather than through an abstract interpretation; legilimency, for instance.

Also, given how spells are influenced by emotions, require study and focus, and can do incredibly complex things even with a single (optional) incantation, I am utterly convinced that wizards /must/ have a sense of magical proprioception, a feeling of where their magic is and what it's doing.
