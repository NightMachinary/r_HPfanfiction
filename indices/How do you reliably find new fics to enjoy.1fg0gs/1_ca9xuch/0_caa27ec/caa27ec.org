This! If I read something I like, I check the author's other stories, then I check the author's favourites. Chances are they'll have something similar to their own style (which made me like their story in the first place) or something I'll enjoy in that list.

*Edit: Another thing I do is look for recs on google. Various results for that one, but I do find some. Not all ff is on ffNet, so that way I can find works that are on other websites as well.
