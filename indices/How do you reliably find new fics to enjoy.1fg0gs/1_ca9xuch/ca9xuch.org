Hunting through favorites is my go-to fic fix! For the long term, I think it's important to be an active part of a community and see what's happening firsthand, especially ones that have writers that are still contributing new content. I used to fandom-hop all the time simply because I'd go through everything I was interested in in a matter of months and then I'd be bored. But when I started writing for HP, I also stopped lurking, and I met other authors on forums, and from their discussions, I got a feel of authors I liked, whose tastes I liked, who I might have never noticed from a story summary. You see new writers come in too, and you can tell when they're going to write amazing things, but with the glut of this fandom, they might never get noticed because few review anymore (and in this late era of HP fandom, review numbers are more an indication of age rather than quality).

Peek in a promising story whenever you can, and if it's a good one, promote the hell out of it. Start the chain. One of the best feelings is when I see other people recommend fics that I've recommended here previously.
