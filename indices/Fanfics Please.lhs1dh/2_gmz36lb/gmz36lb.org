Laocoon's Children - copperbadge

It's a Harry in Slytherin AU, but he's written as pretty likeable. Unfinished series, but there's two and a half longfics and all the background “Stealing Harry” AU to get into.

I have a hard time with Hermione. Mostly on the grounds that “smart” is a single trait and not a whole personality. (I'm currently writing a Hogwarts Yr 8 longfic, and I've had to send her and Ron to Australia to rescue her obliviated parents because I just can't enjoy writing either of them!)
