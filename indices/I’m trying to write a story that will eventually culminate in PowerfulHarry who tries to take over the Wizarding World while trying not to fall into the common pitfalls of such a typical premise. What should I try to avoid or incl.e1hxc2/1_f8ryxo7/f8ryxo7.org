Be careful about your protagonist being too clever in finding previously unexploited loopholes and power-ups. A good rule of thumb when using magic or some magical law to obtain a power-up, solve a problem without difficulty, or in general when introducing new magic, one should ask several questions:

1. Keeping in mind that canon characters know more about magic than you do (even if you might know some factoids that they don't), why didn't the characters do that thing under similar circumstances in canon? (Remember, 1 in 4 wizards is very interested in obtaining power with low effort. They are called "Slytherins".)
2. How would society be different if others could do what the protagonists are about to do? Is it (whether in canon or in your fic)? If not, why not?
3. Would the antagonists be in the position to anticipate it, and what countermeasures would they take?
4. If others can't do it and/or can't anticipate it, why not?

One should not proceed one has found satisfactory answers to all of these questions.

For example, much of conflict and adversity in canon is concerned with whom to trust and to believe, both for the protagonists and for the general public. If it could be solved with a "Wizarding Oath", why didn't everyone use it?
