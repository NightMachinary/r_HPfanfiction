While this is generally a great writing advice, I think at least #2 needs some modifications or leniency when applied to potterverse. If you tried, for instance, to apply it to the canon itself, the entire setting would fall apart. Almost all magical spells and abilities carry plot-hole inducing implications if you dig too dip.
