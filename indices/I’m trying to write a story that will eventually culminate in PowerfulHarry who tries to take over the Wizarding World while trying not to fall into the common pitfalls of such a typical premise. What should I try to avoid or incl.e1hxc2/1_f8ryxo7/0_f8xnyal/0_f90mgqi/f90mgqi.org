That's where #1 comes in: canon characters know more about magic than you do. In particular, they know more about its limitations and/or costs---and their own limitations in applying it---than you do.

So, if it looks to you that some magical spell or ability carries a plot-hole inducing implication, that's not because it actually does. If it did, some canon characters would have exploited it, and then the world would be different. Therefore, the spell or ability in question must have limitations and/or costs of which you, a Muggle, are not aware.
