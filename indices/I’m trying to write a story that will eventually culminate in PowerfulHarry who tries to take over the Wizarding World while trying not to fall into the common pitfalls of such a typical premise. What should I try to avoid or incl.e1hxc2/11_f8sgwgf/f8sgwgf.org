Harry is a national hero and famous, use that to make connections and acquiring favours.

Avoid Pureblood lords trope.

Most important thing in any take over fic is you should have loyal people in every department. Harry using his fame to install his upper class students in good jobs was a great way to infiltrate government.

Harry must have one friend with morals, who can keep him from going extreme to acquire his goals. Hermione/Luna fits in to this perfectly.

Money was important for any campaign to be successful. Create a legal/semi legal way business to earn money.

Powerful reason/beliefs/ideals/cause that can rally people with little effort. Voldemort promised great power to dark pureblood families who then rallied for his cause. Fear of Voldemort drove many people towards Dumbledore.

He must standout in every conflict either he wins or not.
