Or choose a more covert way where Harry vanishes (eg after the war) and trains/plots in seclusion or carries out stuff under a fake identity. It does not have to be the regular "slowly work your way to the top" path, be it for skill, power or influence.

Let's say that the Order is to depleted to force changes after the war. So Harry disappears from the general public. One or two years later, Ministry collaborators start to disappear. At first, it seems random, an accident here, a pub brawl gone wrong there, but slowly a pattern becomes apparent. And Harry moves from the simple enforcers and easy plans to more elaborate plots and more difficult targets. And then he returns to the public, promising to bring that killer to justice while using his powers for more and more elaborate actions until Umbridge (or whoever else you choose to turn into the leader) and everyone serving her is defeated. Or even just use the general feeling of dread to get popular support and then begin the "work to the top" arc.

The rise to power does not have to be linear. It can stagnate followed by a rapid rise or a good start followed by stagnation afterwards. That even translates to the training montage, as Harry seems rather adept at defensive magic compared to his contemporaries.
