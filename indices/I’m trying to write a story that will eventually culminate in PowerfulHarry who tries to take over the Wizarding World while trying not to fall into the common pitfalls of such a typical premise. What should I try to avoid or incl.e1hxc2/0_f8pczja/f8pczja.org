One basic advice I can give is to make Harry have to work really hard for things. Don't have him start off as super-rich, or politically/magically powerful, force him to start from a very precarious position within wizarding society (i.e. one wrong move could destroy his ability to get what he wants done within certain groups for a long time) and let us see him struggle and fail sometimes, so that big accomplishments actually have weight.
