- no hypocrisy --- the MC shouldn't judge different groups of people by different standards, especially when one of these groups includes himself or he's the only member in that second group.

  - the MC can be incorrect and develop incorrect notions and opinions, but he should be confronted with criticism from other characters and / or be facing setbacks because of them until he's forced to readjust his views
  - however, also strive to avoid making the story into a political soapbox for your own opinions (no matter which way they're leaning). One good (if difficult) way of doing this is by making all characters grey instead of black and white. If the reader has to pause and think why what a particular character in your story is doing is wrong or counterproductive, then you're doing a good job of not depicting cartoon villains and heroes. It's difficult because stories like this will also tend to be less enjoyable / more difficult to read, so it's a tight balance to juggle.

- no intuitively accessible answers to hard problems. E.g. if the MC is trying to solve some mystery or develop some scientific theory, he has to actually work through the steps of logical reasoning and trial and error to arrive at the right answer instead of somehow getting it "because his intuition was telling him so"
- no sadism --- the MC can blackmail, torture, kill, etc, --- but only if there really is a valid reason for him to be doing so. One thing that's definitely not a valid reason is for their own gratification. See also: no false justification and no hypocrisy.

  - no torture falsely justified as punishment (e.g. when instead of just killing a DE the MC decides to first torture them as some kind of supposed punishment for DE's past crimes)
  - generally no justification of MC's actions by acting like the crimes of the victim somehow serve as a valid excuse and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence][indulgence.]] E.g. if the MC has to sacrifice someone for a ritual, he has to be cognizant and aware of what they are doing, instead of, for instance, finding a muggle serial killer and then acting like their moral high ground is somehow making their own committed murder better. Many fanfiction stories that fail this point also tend to make the MC "play with their victim" (taunting, informing them that this is happening because of the victim's past crimes, etc) before torturing / killing them.

- no canon stations repetition --- Quirrel siccing a troll, the MC ending in the mirror room despite their intentions, people learning about MC's snek-speak during Lockhart's duel, the basilisk petrifying a bunch of people without killing anyone, Lupin being an idiot with his potions, and so on. If no /actual/ changes are happening throughout your MC's school years when you compare them to canon, then you need to revamp your entire plot design.

  - also please try to avoid prophecies determining conflict outcomes and character actions
  - this one can be a demotivating advice, so maybe just ignore it. Try to design your entire plot from beginning to the end before commencing with chapter 1. Otherwise you'll be more likely to write the relatively easy part and then get a writer's block when you reach sections that are difficult to write or continue the global plotline from.

  keep the level of complexity that Snape and Dumbledore's have to their characters without bashing anyone

You'll probably have to give the MC some unique and powerful ability or artefact to make it possible for him to become a Wizarding emperor in a setting that has a competent set of characters (including VD and Dumbledore).
