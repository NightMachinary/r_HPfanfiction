Don‘t go the Indy!Harry path, if you start chapter1 with Harry entering gringotts and finding out he is actually Hadrian Potter-Black-Peverell-Griffindor-Slytherin-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Lestrange, rightful heir to the magical british throne, with a billion galleons and majority shares in the prophet, hogwarts and the ministry, there isnt really anything left to be done in chapter2 (except assembling the harem, because obviously he has dozens of marriage/consort/concubine contracts waiting for him in his vault, too.. ugh).

He should start with very little, so that there is room for conflict as he conquers britain, not just him walking over everyone.

He also needs a realistic motivation as to why he his driven to do this, the general incompetence of everyone in the books lends plenty material there.

Now the next part is maybe just me, but I really dislike it when:

The goblins have magic that takes care of all the horcruxes and heal Harry from malnutrition and magical blocks, and kill all death eaters without any problem.

The houseelves can be invisible spies that rampage across britain unhindered because noone except Harry knows they can do that.

The RoR gives Harry access to books written by Grindelwald or Ravenclaw and he is suddenly completely overpowered.

He finds portaits of his parents/other relatives, I just don‘t like that. Either limit them to some kind of echo or just don‘t include them, I can‘t put it to word right now, but its creepy and weird.

He has magic blocks on him that he gets removed and kazaam he is Merlins.

He is a parselmouth, so a pet snake or a variety of snakes for venom or stuff are perfectly reasonable. Please don‘t give him a magic viper that for some reason can fly, turn invisible, speak telepathically, teleport and sing opera. No way that god of a snake is just chilling in privet drive/diagon alley.

Magical trunks with 7 compartments, with enough room inside for a small country. Magical trunks are cool, but if you put everything that anyone could ever want inside, why bother leaving? Big nono for me if overdone. Library is ok. A big ass mansion with fields to grow wheat and cattle, and a quidditch pitch is not.

What else.. Ahh yes.

I absolutely hate the trope that magical britain is this backwater place in the magical world that noone actually cares about or takes seriously, and any other country is just so much better.

I hate even more so the idea that muggles are superior to magicals, the atom bomb is a thing yes, but wizards can apparate into any and all government buildings, read all the important info from your head before turning you into a traitor/mole/sleeper agent with a spell or potion. I also don‘t believe for a second that a capable wizard wouldnt be able to shield against bullets.

I think I went slightly off topic in my little rant here, sorry. (._.)
