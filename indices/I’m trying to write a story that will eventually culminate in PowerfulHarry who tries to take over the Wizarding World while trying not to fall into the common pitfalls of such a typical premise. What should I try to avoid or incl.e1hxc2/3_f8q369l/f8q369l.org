To write Ron as a good freind, you might want to list bad and good traits of his.

I'kll try, but I'm quite bad at this:

Strengths

Freindly

Funny

Doesn't jump to conclusions (Which seems to be a huge trait in HP as pretty much all the characters do that)

Willing to stand up to ANYONE who is against Harry

He makes Harry very happy, and without him Harry may have remained quite timid, like neville used to be.

Weaknesses

Poor manners

Inability to think of others emotions

Kind of mean at times

Lazy

Reminder - I don't remember a time Ron was really arrogant. Why try to put the traits of MALFOY on an opposite, a WEASLEY?
