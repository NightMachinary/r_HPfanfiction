This might not be a good suggestion, but what about if sirius died in year 3 instead of living and that puts Harry on track to take over the wizarding wrold.

It will probably start like this - Harry is very VERY angry, but he is still quite optimistic and childlike compared to his future self, and he is working to revolutionise the wizarding law.

His revolution (he's only doing things like protests and gaining awareness at this point) seems to be gaining traction. He starts working towards his goal.

But several tragedies/ big eevents happen along the way which changes his view a bit like this

1st tragedy / big event . Not only the wizard justice system is flawed, the entire ministry of magic is

2nd tragedy / big event - The society and pretty much everything in the wizarding world is quite flawed

3rd T/BE - Probably after he starts expanding into a different country, and visiting them, probably after a while he realizes that this is in other countries, and slowly he will begin to think this of the whole world

4rd T/BE - He can't trust anyone anymore. He realizes he'll have to be careful with his secrets. Of course, he'll have very close freinds like Hermione and Ron who he has already, but he will be wary of making more

5T/BE - Something enormously big happens, which makes him feel incredibly alone in the world for a while. It seems like the whole world's against him

6T/BE - Even more things happen, Harry starts to slowly lose his grip on reality, but he is still clever and won't lose his sanity. He might seem a bit cracky but can get serious when he wants to be. He starts to take on even more extreme views

7T/BE - He goes full on 'The Nightmare Man' mode.

This story probably might be filled with absolute pain and suffering. Be careful - be sue to balance it out with happy normal days as well. Maybe something like a spectacular school festival that the golden trio sets up with the help of their freinds brightens up the story. The story might slowly get darker and less happy, or it could go abruptly dark with a huge turn of events, or anygthing in between. There are so many different choices!

These tragedies could be anything - Someone close dying, a plague, finding a muggle and muggleborn children rapecamp for purebloods, anything. They just need to be well thought out on how they will impact the story, Harry, his thinking, and several other factors. Note these are just guidelines, not rules. They can be bended and molded and modified to fit what you make and can be made better. I may be even wrong.

You can also shuffle these events around, but in an order that make sense. Also, a character's death in two different circumstances will be very different, e.g a close character who dies at the hand of a traitor will make him realize he can't trust many more people, and if that close character died in different circumstances, e.g lucius malfoy, he will realize something different.
