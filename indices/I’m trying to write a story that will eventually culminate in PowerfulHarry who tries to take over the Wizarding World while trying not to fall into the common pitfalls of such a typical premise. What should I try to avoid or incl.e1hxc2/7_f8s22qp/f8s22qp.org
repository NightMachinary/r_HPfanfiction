Here's the big secret to writing. As long as your prose is good and your characters are compelling, you can get away with literally whatever bullshit you want in the plot and worldbuilding departments and people will still read it. Someone once challenged Jim Butcher to write a story about the most ridiculous concept they could think of, a crossover between a lost Roman legion and Pokemon, which resulted in the bestselling [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Alera][Codex Alera]] series. See also Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, or Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, which are two of the most commonly recommended fics on this sub while still absolutely indulging in all the tropes that people claim to hate.
