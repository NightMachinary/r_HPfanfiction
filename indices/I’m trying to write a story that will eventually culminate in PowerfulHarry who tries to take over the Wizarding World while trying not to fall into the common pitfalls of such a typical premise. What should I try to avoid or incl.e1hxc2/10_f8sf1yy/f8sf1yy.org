Something interesting to see if how Harry struggles with being lonely. Every single powerful Harry somehow finds Fluer, Daphne, or Hermione, who just so happens to be super strong and align with his ideals perfectly. I think he shouldnt find anyone at all, and it would be very interesting how he deals with this by himself instead of the fake love most portray.
