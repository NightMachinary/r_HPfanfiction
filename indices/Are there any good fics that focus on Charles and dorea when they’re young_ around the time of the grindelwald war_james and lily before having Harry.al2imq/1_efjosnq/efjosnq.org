*/Honour thy Blood/*, by /TheBlack'sResurgence/

This story creates a lot of family backstory for both the Potters and Blacks, focusing on Harry's Grandparents' generation. Lots of flashbacks to Charlus Potter and Dorea Black and how they got together.

It is still, ultimately, a Harry Potter story. But "growing up to be like his Grandfather Charlus" really becomes Harry focus and inspiration in this fic.
