  In Canon, Septimus Weasley and Cedrella Weasley nee Black were either dead or played no real part in events.What if they had? What if they had made different choices, made different stands? What if they stood between the Light and the Dark and did everything in their power to see the Dark defeated? What would have changed?This is that story. A story of a man and a woman from completely different sides of the fence politically and socially. A man and a woman who joined forces and changed the fate of the Wizarding world in general - and of more than one person in particular.
