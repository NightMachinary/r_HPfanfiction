  /Snape's probably going to accuse me of being an attention-seeking brat for this but it's worth it/, Harry thought grimly as he entered the Great Hall for dinner.

  “If I could have everyone's attention please,” Harry called out, standing up on the bench to ensure the other students could see him. The teachers looked particularly startled, but he hurried on before anyone could say anything.

  “As most of you saw, at the Gryffindor-Slytherin match, my arm was broken by a bludger. According to Madam Pomfrey, that would have been a simple injury to fix. However, while I was still lying on the ground, Gilderoy Lockhart took it upon himself to cast a spell at me, vanishing the bones in my arm. While I have since recovered, the fact remains that if that spell had hit somewhere else, it could have vanished my ribs, my spine, or even my skull, likely resulting in my death. I have contacted the Headmaster and the Board of Governors, but none of them have acted. So, I'm going to have to take matters into my own hands.” He turned his attention to the foppish professor, who had an expression on his face somewhere between a grimace and a sympathetic smile. “Gilderoy Lockhart. You're a fraud, and I challenge you to a duel.”
