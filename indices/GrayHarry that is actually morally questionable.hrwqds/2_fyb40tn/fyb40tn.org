Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts) and it's sequel Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Physical Adept) have a Harry practically raised as a shadowrunner, very pragmatic and very grey. Also has a take on a Harry who uses quite a different form of magic too, if that's your cup of tea. Both are complete with the author getting a head start on third year before they start posting.
