  I won't read Harry/Draco where they're anywhere close to canon personalities. That pairing is way to implausible for me to suspend any disbelief. I could accept as plausible Harry/Neville, Harry/Ron, Draco/Theo Nott, Draco/Blaise, etc. Those pairs don't seem like they'd want to strangle each other in their sleep.

I find Harry/Draco much more plausible than Harry/Ron. I have the same reaction to Harry/Ron that some people have to Harry/Hermione. It seems borderline incestuous.

Though I've also only read Drarry that's either massively AU like Sacrifices or set post-Hogwarts where the characters aren't exactly the same people they were in school.
