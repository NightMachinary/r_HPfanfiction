Plausible. How much I enjoy reading them depends on how well they're executed, i.e. usually very badly.

Falling for an attractive person because they're hot, then realising that you're completely incompatible with that person once you're already emotionally invested in the relationship... that's a pretty common situation to find yourself in. It can be a great source of conflict and drama.

Unfortunately, almost all fanfic writers use a relationship as an end, not a means. They establish the relationship then just leave it as more or less "achieved", they don't treat it as an ongoing process.
