  Petunia redemption fic. Sort of the same with Narcissa, really. Vernon is the monstrous abusive one, Petunia only enables him while subtly trying to support Harry, reminiscing remorsefully on her shattered relationship with Lily. I sincerely believe Petunia and Narcissa actually love their garbage husbands. Maybe they actually chose them, knowing they suck, because they, themselves, suck. It just really annoys me when they're portrayed as passively being pulled onto the path of evil by their tyrant husbands.

It's worth noting that in the Prologue to PS, Vernon is depicted as only really being so negative about the magical world because he follows Petunia's lead. He thinks wizards are weird and not his sort of people all on his own, but he doesn't really /hate/ them -- that's Petunia.

Regarding the pairings, I have no problems believing any pairing involving characters described as attractive.
