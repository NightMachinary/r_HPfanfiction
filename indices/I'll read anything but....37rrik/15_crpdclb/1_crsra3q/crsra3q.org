  Riddle being portrayed as not really bigoted, but using the ideology to acquire a following. Tomione.

  Hermione/any relationship people justify using the line 'they're intellectual equals'.

I like Tomione, but even within the pairing, not all Tomione writers portray Hermione Granger and Tom Riddle as 'intellectual equals'. Tom Riddle clearly is somewhat of a prodigy, as acknowledged by Dumbledore in the books; Hermione is merely a smart student who happens to be at the top of her class. I don't think anyone would argue that, if Tom Riddle and Hermione Granger went to school together, they would be 'equals'. In academics, /maybe/, but as Tom Riddle is clearly a far more powerful wizard than Hermione is a witch...

"Haven't I already told you," said Riddle, "that killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me any more? For many months now, my new target has been---you." - Tom Riddle to Harry Potter, /Chamber of Secrets/

"I guess you have little more than a minute to live. You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry." - Tom Riddle to Harry Potter, /Chamber of Secrets/ [film]

He may use the word 'Mudblood', but here, Riddle clearly only cares about killing Harry Potter. I would use that as an example of him pretending to be bigoted, especially if by using the word 'Mudblood', he can mess with Harry's head. /Especially/ considering the implications of the word 'Mudblood' to Harry, as Harry has two loved ones that are 'Mudbloods'.

- Lily Evans Potter, his mother
- Hermione Granger, his friend

Not to mention all of the Muggle-borns who got petrified by the Basilisk, many of whom Harry had known or met first-hand. Riddle is using bigotry as a tactic in order to try and break Harry's morale.

It's also quite likely that, even with Hermione being a 'Mudblood', Riddle ordered the Basilisk to attack her because she was getting too close to the truth. Many clues hint to this in the book itself, including Hermione being wary of the Diary, and practically connecting the dots (and guessing the truth) correctly on her first try. In the end, she guessed too much. Riddle saw her as a threat, which no other 'Mudblood' had done before - not since perhaps Moaning Myrtle - and decided to try to eliminate her.
