Harry/Narcissa. Or anything that uses some iteration of 'Lucius doesn't respect/love me/is abusive, (said fiercely to Draco)' as the background to the ship she's about go in. Or mental gymnastics to prove she isn't really a shitty person. Narcissa is 100% a bigot, so much so that she lets it put a strain on her relationship with her grandson.

Harry/Bella, Harry/Tonks, Harry/Fleur, Draco/Hermione.

Petunia redemption fic. Sort of the same with Narcissa, really. Vernon is the monstrous abusive one, Petunia only enables him while subtly trying to support Harry, reminiscing remorsefully on her shattered relationship with Lily. I sincerely believe Petunia and Narcissa actually /love/ their garbage spouses. Maybe they actually chose them, knowing they suck, because they, themselves, suck. It just really annoys me when they're portrayed as passively being pulled onto the path of evil by their tyrant husbands.

Fic. where people try to emphasize the exact opposite of how Wormtail is popularly perceived i.e. pathetic, sniveling and just end up going into overkill. He's now the creative one, the great listener, loved and respected by all. All instances of people condescending to him are exceptional. There's also a clear hierarchy within the marauders; they're not a group of equals.

Riddle being portrayed as not really bigoted, but using the ideology to acquire a following. Tomione.

Hermione/any relationship people justify using the line 'they're intellectual equals'.
