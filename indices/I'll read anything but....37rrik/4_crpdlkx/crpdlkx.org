I tend to avoid any teenHermione/male adult (Snape, Sirius, Remus, etc) just because of the whole massive age gap. And they tend to make me feel icky.

I also avoid incest romance fics, like Fred/George or Ron/Ginny. I am just not a fan. I do LOVE good friendship/hurt & comfort Fred and George fics because some can be so beautifully bittersweet.

I also rather dislike Mary-Sue self-inserts. They may work for others, but I love reading about and working with the Universe JK has given us. Mary-Sue characters always tend to be OP, gothic in some way or depressed, obscenely beautiful and perfect, and they just annoy me. I love seeing character flaws and working with them, these flaws make the characters feel realistic and human. Perfect Mary-Sues tend to obliterate that.

Overall, though, I'm rather flexible. So long as it is a well-written fic that has a strong plot, pulls at my emotions, and draws me in, I am happy.

Edit: forgot to add mpreg and realized this after seeing other posts! Whoops. It just biologically makes ZERO sense, magic or not.
