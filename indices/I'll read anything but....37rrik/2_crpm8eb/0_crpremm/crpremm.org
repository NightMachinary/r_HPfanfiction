I'm convinced mpreg wouldn't be a problem in HP.

Transforming your head into a shark to breath underwater? Cool.

Conjure intelligent/magical/mammal life? No problem!

Actually transform into another human? You have to let it stew a few weeks, but sure!

That said, I haven't read one, yet. It's probably hard to make it work in a fic.
