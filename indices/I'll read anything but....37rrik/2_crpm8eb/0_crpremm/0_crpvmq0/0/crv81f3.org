[[http://page-de-reve.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/excentrykemuse-enchantment-series-8-ivy.html][Ivy Kissed]] (Harry/Krum) is the only fic I've ever seen do this in a way that approaches logical. [[/spoiler][Harry's hidden under polyjuice and becomes pregnant whilst on it--and fails to change back. He can't. Then, because he's been stuck as a girl for so long, he will always remain that way. Also, there is some talk about whether the child would be biologically his, or that of the muggle girl he's polyjuiced into.]]

Other than that fic (which, to be honest, I hadn't realised was mpreg when I began reading) I've never found a decent fic that employs it. It's a shame, really, because it could open the doorway to all sorts of emotional and ethical questions, but instead people use it as some kind of gimmick, without even thinking about what male pregnancy could truly mean for a person and a society, and it's possible long-term effects.
