How many people would actually try to justify it? If one of them took Polyjuice, which right now is the best canon explanation I could think of without creating some spell, and drank it repeatedly throughout the pregnancy, I guess it could work. But then would the child be the person's who took the Polyjuice or the person whose hair sample they put in the Polyjuice. I am thinking way too far into this. But the Mpreg that I've come across, two guys are usually just fucking around and then a few days later one of them gets morning sickness and they're so confused.
