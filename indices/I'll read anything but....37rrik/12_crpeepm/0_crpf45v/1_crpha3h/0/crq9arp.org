  The best example that I can think of isn't even a slash fic, but it proves my point quite nicely: Prince of the Dark kingdom or whatever the title is, it seems often enough that every character in that story is gay. It's really gratuitous.

As far as I can remember, there's only one male couple (the pair that wanted to adapt Harry) and one female couple (Natalie's parents). I don't see where you're coming from.
