Honestly, I'll read anything. But here are a few things that bother me What does dumbedore really do with warm wooly socks? I don't know but I know what my twelve year old cousin does with me. Why not? I'll ship dumbedore/socks. it's not worse than reading the molestations of hermione by all the slytherin sex gods (Draco, Blaise, Snape, Lucius, rodolphus). Because being called a mudblood during seduction is so hot. /s next time I'll just have a girl call me nigger before she kisses me. Harry/Snape because it's weird to me. Anything where Luna is just a sex kitten. No thanks, and fuck you. You will not ruin one of the best characters in canon. I have no problem with Luna expressing her sexuality progressively but she is much more than that. Also hate dad/daughter or dad/son incest. Sorry it just bothers me too much.
