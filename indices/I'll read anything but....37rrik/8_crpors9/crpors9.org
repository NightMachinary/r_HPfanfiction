Hermione-Ron pairing, main character slash (other characters can have all the fun they want), multi/harem. I generally prefer monogamous relationships, but I have found recently that I like triads with 2 guys in them too (it's a nice little fantasy and makes for fun fluff and fancy lemons).

I have a strong preference for stories with the main character being female, but I do occasionally ready others.

I think the main issue is that I'm mostly using HP fanfics as romance novels (with magic!), which means I want a main character I identify with, instead of just read about.

Edit: Guns! I hate them and I am not reading hp fanfiction to learn about how to reload a gun, or what range some random rifle has. Why write HP fanfiction if you're going to leave all this cool magic behind and go around shooting people with guns?!
