  I truly don't think your opinion is any less right than mine. It's a different perspective.
#+end_quote

I think the veracity Snape's morality is objectively verifiable and not entirely subjective. Different perspective yes, but that doesn't mean both are correct.

  I thought we were having a conversation. I asked your opinion, you gave it, and then I gave mine.
#+end_quote

If you don't want to argue that's fine, but saying you didn't put forth an argument is incorrect, because you did.

  ar·gu·ment ˈärɡyəmənt/ noun an exchange of diverging or opposite views, typically a heated or angry one.
#+end_quote

Our conversation was an argument. It didn't happen to be an a heated or angry one, but that's not a necessary precondition for an argument. You are saying that if I want an argument to ask somebody else, but my point is that we've already had one, even if you refuse to admit it, and in fact we are having an argument right now about whether or not this is an argument. Seems to me that you are ok with having an argument, you just don't want o argue about Snape's morality.

  I don't think it's odd to respect someone's opinion
#+end_quote

Yes, we both respect each others opinions, but arguing against somebody else's opinion doesn't mean you don't respect that opinion.

  I'm also too lazy to bother

Fair enough
