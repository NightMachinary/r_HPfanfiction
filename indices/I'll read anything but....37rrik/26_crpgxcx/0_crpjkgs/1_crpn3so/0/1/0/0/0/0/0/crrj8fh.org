I truly don't think your opinion is any less right than mine. It's a different perspective. I thought we were having a conversation. I asked your opinion, you gave it, and then I gave mine. If you want an argument you need to ask someone else. I don't need or want to argue my opinion (which isn't what you think it is). I don't think it's odd to respect someone's opinion and I'm also too lazy to bother. So, no, I'm not playing a game, taking the high road, or whatever you're accusing me of.
