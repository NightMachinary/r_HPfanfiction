I'm sorry, I guess I operate under a different definition of arguing! To me, someone is arguing when they're trying to change someone's opinion. It's about intent and purpose to me. To me, I was just chatting with you-I didn't care to convince you, I was just sharing. Whew, hope that clears it up! Hopefully, I used enough "to me" and "I"s. Feel free to think whatever about Snape and the meaning of argument!
