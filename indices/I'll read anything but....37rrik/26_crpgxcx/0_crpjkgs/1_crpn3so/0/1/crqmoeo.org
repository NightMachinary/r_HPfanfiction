  For a long time, we didn't like him. Then we learned he was a complex butthole with some redeeming qualities. Harry forgives him (as is his prerogative).
#+end_quote

I don't see any redeeming qualities. Braveness? Maybe, but only because his selfishness overruled his cowardice.

#+begin_quote
  not sure how that's Snape's fault.
#+end_quote

Obviously nothing here is Snape's fault because he's a fictional character. It's JK Rowling's fault, and I think the way she used Snape in the last book undermined the plot and lessons taught in the first 5 books. You're right though. I concede Harry's lack of magical skill and strength are unrelated to Snape.

  I thought the point of Snape was the redemption you mentioned earlier and that he found morality, not lost it?
#+end_quote

He didn't lose morality, because he never had any (even until the day he died). Please describe the morally correct choices he made, and why those choices were made in order too satisfy morality as opposed to his creepy obsession with Lily? He didn't switch to the light side because he saw the light. He did it because DD used him and his obsession with Lily to force him to do the right thing.

  to a more mature perspective
#+end_quote

I don't see how naming your child after that man who is responsible for your parents death is mature. Seems more like idiotic to me.

#+begin_quote
  His parents didn't die because of Snape. The Potters died because Snape... ...oversimplification
#+end_quote

I feel like I don't even have to address this but I will. Yes it was an oversimplification, but Snape doesn't deserve redemption just because he didn't directly kill James and Lily. It's not like he was tricked, he knew what was going to happen to the prophecy child.

#+begin_quote
  Throughout the series, we do see him grow and mature like you said! And the change in Harry's understanding of Snape is an example of that.
#+end_quote

We see him grow and mature from a young child with potential into an idiot who got lucky.

#+begin_quote
  I'm not trying to argue, change your mind
#+end_quote

Funny, seems like your whole post was trying to do that.

#+begin_quote
  thought it was funny how our perspectives differ!
#+end_quote

The main difference seems to be that you believe Snape changed to the light side for the right reasons, and I feel he changed to the light side for selfish reasons and because Dumbledore basically blackmailed him, and even after he changed to the light side he was still an evil person.
