It's funny how different our takes are on this character! I don't know why it's making me laugh, well it's probably the beer, but let me give you my take on what you said.

#+begin_quote
  Rowling spent 6 books making us hate him, and then she makes the entire seventh book about his redemption, culminating in Harry Potter endorsing his actions by naming his child after him.
#+end_quote

For a long time, we didn't like him. Then we learned he was a complex butthole with some redeeming qualities. Harry forgives him (as is his prerogative).

#+begin_quote
  Throughout the series you see him grow along with you as he matures and becomes more powerful. Then, the last book completely halts Harry's magic progress and she use mcguffins and deus ex machina to basically bypass Harry's development just so she can spent the other half of the book teaching you a lesson.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure what this has to do with Snape, it seems that you're upset Harry didn't reach his full potential and learn awesome ways to kick butt? It seems as if you don't like the direction the final book took, but again, not sure how that's Snape's fault.

#+begin_quote
  The lesson is that even if someone is a vile, bitter, creepy, evil human being, if the betray their morals and switch to the other side for all wrong reasons then they are worthy of respect and reverence.
#+end_quote

I thought the point of Snape was the redemption you mentioned earlier and that he found morality, not lost it? That even a bad person can have three dimensions and do good things. We go from viewing Snape from a child's POV (evil, greasy bat) to a more mature perspective (people are complex and their actions may have motivations unknown to you, as well as the fact that you can dislike someone, but still appreciate their actions).

#+begin_quote
  Harry just ignores the fact that his parents died because of Snape and the man hated and resented him. Who gives a shit if he was brave.
#+end_quote

His parents didn't die because of Snape. The Potters died because Snape relayed the information, they trusted a friend instead of Dumbledore, Sirius suggested Peter, Peter betrayed them, and Voldemort killed them. Saying they died because of Snape is an oversimplification.

Throughout the series, we /do/ see him grow and mature like you said! And the change in Harry's understanding of Snape is an example of that.

I'm not trying to argue, change your mind, or force to think about Snape, just thought it was funny how our perspectives differ!
