The whole nerf!Harry/Snape redemption is only tangentially related, but I can somewhat empathise. We watched Harry's gradual transformation into a magical force to be reckoned with, and then poof: the potential was hand-waved. But it was HBP that killed it - not DH - and the coup de grace was Snape's ass-whooping of Harry towards the end. Yes, we know, Snape is a genius etc, but Harry got a couple of shots in against Dolohov in the year prior to that. People blame Snape because he's there. Low-hanging fruit and all that. Plus he's an arse.
