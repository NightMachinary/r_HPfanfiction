  But it was HBP that killed it - not DH - and the coup de grace was Snape's ass-whooping of Harry towards the end.

Yeah, that was the fight that really bothered me, still does to this day. Harry never really lost a duel to anyone till then, and then, Snape kills Dumbledore, and we're all waiting for retribution, but Snape completely destroys Harry without even trying. It was the only time in the series Harry was made to look completely inept.

DH actually does a decent job of building back Harry's reputation as a dueler, but the stink of HBP remains.
