Wait, are you saying some people don't like Snape because he handed Harry his own ass to him in a fight? That's...odd. He's an older wizard known to be a great duelist. Even though Harry shows a natural aptitude for Defense Against the Dark Arts and has held his own against older wizards, it always seemed to me that it was stressed that he was lucky and had help as well.
