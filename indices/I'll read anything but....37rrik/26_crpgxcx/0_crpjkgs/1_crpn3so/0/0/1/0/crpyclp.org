That's exactly what I'm saying, lol! Don't get me wrong; Harry should have lost. Badly. But with his struggles in classes throughout that book and the fact that Snape is such an arse (especially where Harry's concerned) it pissed more than a few people off. I was too, for a while, and Snape was the perfect scapegoat. I still don't like him at all, but he's not at fault for HBP being so... meh.
