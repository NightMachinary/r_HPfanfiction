Rowling spent 6 books making us hate him, and then she makes the entire seventh book about his redemption, culminating in Harry Potter endorsing his actions by naming his child after him.

I grew up reading Harry Potter. Throughout the series you see him grow along with you as he matures and becomes more powerful.

Then, the last book completely halts Harry's magic progress and she use mcguffins and deus ex machina to basically bypass Harry's development just so she can spent the other half of the book teaching you a lesson.

The lesson is that even if someone is a vile, bitter, creepy, evil human being, if the betray their morals and switch to the other side for all wrong reasons then they are worthy of respect and reverence.

Fuck no. Snape's whole storyline is insulting to morality, and it teaches kids the completely wrong message.

Harry just ignores the fact that his parents died because of Snape and the man hated and resented him. Who gives a shit if he was brave.
