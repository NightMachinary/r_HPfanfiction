I guess that's whats great about fan fiction. :) Everybody finds something they can immerse themselves in.

I've known my partner IRL since i was 10, we pretty much grew up together then at 19 we got together and we've been together for 4 years now. From a personal point of view i can't see how other people don't understand. :)
