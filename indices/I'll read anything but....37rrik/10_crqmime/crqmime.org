I haven't found anything I won't read just yet. The only thing that will majorly put me off is poor grammar/spelling/formatting.

I do feel apprehensive about certain things (Dobby/Sock) but I merely haven't read it yet. The only rule I have is that you have to sell it to me, especially if it's something I've never read before or am uncertain about. Some things have an easier time just because I'm so used to it by now I hardly bat an eye at it.

Harry/Draco? Cool, lets do this.

Fred/George? Let's go.

Fred/George Mpreg in which one was a female at time of conception and the pregnancy carried over? /Blinks slowly and shakes it off; its magic, why not.

Veela inheritance? Lets go.

Male Veela inheritance? Sure, whatever.

James/Lily/Severus? /Squints hard at it; Prove it.

On that note: always taking recs.
