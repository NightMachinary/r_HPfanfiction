Well, by definition, it is out of character for Hermione to like Harry and vice versa. We see Hermione like Ron, date him, and marry him. We never see anything to suggest that she may be attracted to Harry's qualities, personality, or appearance. And for Harry, the same is true in regards to her. They seem to be attracted to very different types of people. Neither Harry and Ron nor Ginny and Hermione are interchangeable.

That's not to say people can't write H/Hr of course! But it's canonically "wrong" and out of character to have them attracted to each other.
