  Harry/Hermione is guilty of this a lot. I mean, you want to write that pairing, go for it, make it awesome. But a fic that's nothing but a thinly-disguised essay about how it was actually canon if you read between the lines enough (and take psychotropic drugs) just has no appeal for me.

I think this is the case for all fics written by shippers. They're less interested in writing an interesting romance (which should have narrative structure and conflict) and more interested in justifying their favourite pairing to the reader, i.e. "here are the reasons why I think this pairing is the best/most correct".
