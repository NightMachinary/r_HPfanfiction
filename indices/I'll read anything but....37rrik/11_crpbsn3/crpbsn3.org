Generally I'll give anything a shot if the writing is good enough. Obviously my "good enough" thresholds are different for different things, but if Alice Munro wrote Harry/Draco slash, I'd read it, even if I find that idea ludicrous.

My most disliked trope of the moment is kind of a general thing - basically, the author has a tinfoil hat and a magnifying glass and writes an entire story devoted to this tunnel vision of canon where certain lines are ludicrously read into.

Harry/Hermione is guilty of this a lot. I mean, you want to write that pairing, go for it, make it awesome. But a fic that's nothing but a thinly-disguised essay about how it was actually canon if you read between the lines enough (and take psychotropic drugs) just has no appeal for me.
