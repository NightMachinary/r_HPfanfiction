I cannot read anything that has Harry/Anyone else than Ginny and Ginny/Anyone else than Harry as a main pairing. Nope nope nope. There may be a few exceptions, but I'll stray far away from it in general. Which does limit the good stories which I read because most H/G on ff are horrible wish fulfilmenty stories... well, that's pretty much the same with any other pairing.
