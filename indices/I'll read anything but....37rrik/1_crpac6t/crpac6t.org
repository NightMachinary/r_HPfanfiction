I can't read angst or anything with gratuitous, misplaced, useless violence. Especially since the violence is often a means to angst. If I see Vernon raping and beating Harry, I'm out and the author is lazy.

I also can't read Harry/Tonks because I don't see why a 20 something would be interested in a teenage boy. Plus, she canonically is into older men.
