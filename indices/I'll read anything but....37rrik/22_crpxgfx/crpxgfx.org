Well, here's the short list.

*I can't read anything Severus Snape centric because I find too many people glamorize that dark brooding thing and/or become Snape apologists for all the nasty shit he's done cause he 'loved Lily'.

*Character Bashing

*Anything that seems to just pile on the torture just to give the main character something to angst about, and then get cuddles from their to-be lover to get over it. You know, Harry getting beaten and raped daily by the Dursleys or other things.

*Torture porn in general. I've just become numb to it because people just try to think 'what's the worst that can happen to my main, ooh lets do that to make this dark!!' and it just feels flat.

*Anything too AU or too far removed from the series.

*Anything before the Marauder's Era, I just have no interest in it. Along with anything past the next-gen. I'm not interested in reading about the grandchildren or great-grandchildren of Harry Potter. I don't mind if they feature as children (say Harry's in his fifties/sixties since that's young for a wizard, and his children now have children), but not as the main cast.

*Anything that feels like sexism. So if the female characters are never involved in the fighting, need to be 'protected' by the men, are only there to prop their male lover up, have no consistent personality (sometimes writers like to give them a couple traits and say they're 'smart' or 'strong' but never actually demonstrate it in the story) are usually the Damsel in Distress, get raped/killed to cause their male lover angst or there's one token 'I'm not like the other girls, I can keep up with the guys, I'm a badass, strong woman' character then I'm out.

*Anything with the words 'mpreg', 'creature-fic' 'veela-inheirtance' 'harem'.
