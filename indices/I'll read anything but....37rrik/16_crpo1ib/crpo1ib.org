I feel an Angry Walter coming on...

*Am I the only one around here*

*Who would read anything?*

Seriously, I fell in love with two pairings I previously didn't 'get' after just reading a good fic featuring them.

I guess to answer the question, I won't read crack or overly humorous fics but I'll read any pairing at least once or twice to see what they're like.
