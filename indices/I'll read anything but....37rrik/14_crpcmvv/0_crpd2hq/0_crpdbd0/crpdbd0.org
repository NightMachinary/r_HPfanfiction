When I do read them, I tend to ignore that and parts of 6 and 7. I just feel some of it was deliberately included to further the canon relationships despite that never having been important to the series and was merely wish fulfillment.

I haven't read the books in quite a long time though, except for references when I am writing. I usually read fanfic or non-fiction books.
