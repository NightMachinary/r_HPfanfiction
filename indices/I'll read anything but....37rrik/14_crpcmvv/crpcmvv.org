Anything Ron/Hermione. I have nothing against either character but I don't think they would work well in a relationship.

Its really just a matter of opinion though, I just prefer pairings which work easier in my head. I could see Neville/Hermione for example, post OoTP once he grows a backbone. Harry/Hermione is my preference but I think after books 3 and 4 the idea of them being together dies a slow death unless the author puts in some serious OOC stuff.
