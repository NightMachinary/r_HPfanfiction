In my experience, most Harry/Hermione and Harry/Ginny stories are written by shippers. I don't read H/Hr stories because of their tendency to bash Weasleys and a variety of other reasons, but I have read quite a bit of HG, and there are plenty of good authors who /are/ shippers -- Deadwoodpecker, Northumbrian, Arabella, Andi. They're all very good authors in my opinion, so I don't see shipping as a problem.
