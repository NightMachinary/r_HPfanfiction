I'm not sure about the guns > wizards part of canon. AFAIK the only part where Muggle guns are mentioned is in the Daily Prophet when a reporter is explaining what a gun is to their magical audience: "a type of metal wand Muggles use to kill each other." I could definitely be wrong, though.

DH's inclusion of the Deathstick is often derided by fans as having thrown out the entire panoply of wand lore for the sake of giving Harry another half-used plot device, but I don't know if that piece of fanon is accurate. I don't know what you mean by 'Luna's Wand.'

Harry /does/ inherit money in the original books, but I'm quite grateful to JKR for not quantifying it down to the last Knut. It would make Harry just another boring yob. Besides, focusing on money is more of Ron's thing anyway.

I have no idea why someone would downvote you for this, though. Seems petty.
