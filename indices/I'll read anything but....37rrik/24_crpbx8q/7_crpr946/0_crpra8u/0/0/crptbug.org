  Muggles winning a possible war is Word of God
#+end_quote

No it's not. JKR has said one thing to the effect that bullets have the same effect on wizards that they do on Muggles i.e. they're not going to automatically bounce off wizards because magic. But that's far from saying wizards are defenceless from bullets, nor does it tell you that bullets are even relevant to the matter.

  Luna's Wand

Is an Ollivander wand same as everyone else's, not made of unobtanium with a core of geisha tears.

  Harry's heaps of Gold
#+end_quote

Harry is moderately wealthy in canon. We know from PoA, for example, that he could buy a Firebolt, but doing so would more or less empty his vault. This is a far cry from the Harry "Billions of Galleons" Potter of fanon.
