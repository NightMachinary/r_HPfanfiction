I'll read anything but...

... fics which bash any characters (especially Dumbledore).

... fics written by people with pairing preferences (aka shippers).

... fics where Harry is gay.

... fics where wizards get exhausted from using magic.

... fics which present Draco Malfoy or Severus Snape as non-antagonistic towards Harry.

... fics with emotional melodrama or angst, including so-called "dark romance" or "forbidden romance".

... fics which state or imply Muggle technology/weaponry could overcome magic.

... fics where Harry isn't the focus (with rare exceptions).

... fics with Dursley abuse (see above: angst/melodrama).

... fics where Harry inherits a ton of money and/or titles.

... fics where goblins are helpful and can easily solve every problem.

... fics where Harry's parents left letters to him.

... fics featuring the following words: "occlumency shields", "magical core", "runic ward", "wandless magic", "soul bond", "technomagic".

... fics which exploit an apparent loophole in canon rather than assume it has sensible limits.

... fics where Harry is too weak/stupid.

... fics where Harry is too powerful too easily.

... fics that treat magic solely as a kind of gun.

... fics that have custom wands.

... fics where Harry abandons Ron and Hermione.

... fics where the horcrux in Harry's scar can be removed by some relatively conventional magical procedure.

... fics with more prophecies beyond those in canon.

... fics which rehash canon plotlines too closely.
