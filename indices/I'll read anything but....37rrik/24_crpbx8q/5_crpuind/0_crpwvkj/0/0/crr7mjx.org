1. It's acquired too easily.

2. It's the same spells as magic with a wand, only without a wand, so has no originality to it (nor does it have any point, since you might as well just keep the wands and avoid an unnecessary subplot).

3. It usually results in Harry throwing spells around at people like balls of energy, making the fight scenes anime-like.

4. It doesn't come with any significant handicaps or disadvantages.

5. It loses the eccentric charm of the HP magic system.

6. It's usually far too powerful.

7. It's normally justified on the basis of the transparently fallacious logic of wands being a vulnerability.
