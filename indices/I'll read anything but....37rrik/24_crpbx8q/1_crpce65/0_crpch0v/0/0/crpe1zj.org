Yeah usually the thing with stuff like custom wands isn't that they're necessarily a bad thing (I'm sure a good writer could take the concept in interesting directions) but more that they are almost always a indicator of an extremely bad story and a bad writer. Whenever they're used you can bet your bottom dollar that its just an easy way to have Harry become an awesome, powerful wizard without any real justification.
