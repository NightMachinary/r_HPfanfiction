  Is it hard to find fics that avoid all of those?
#+end_quote

Yes. Some fics even manage to include all of these things XD

But yeah, finding new fics is very hard for me. On the plus side, I don't have to spend much time looking for fics: a very quick scan of FF.net summaries will normally be enough to tell me that there's nothing new to try.
