Why the hate for "occlumency shields"? Anti "occlumency landscapes" i get. But shields? Isnt that one of the things that occlumency allows? All depending on how much thought the author puts into mind magic? I mean if the author just wants to prevent mind reading, saying Harry has occlumency shields is sufficent.
