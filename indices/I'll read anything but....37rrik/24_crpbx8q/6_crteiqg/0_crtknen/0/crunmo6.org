Thank-you for your explanation. You do have a good point, although I'm not sure I fully agree. Unless occlumency is purely a mental discipline (thus making it non-magical), it seems like your point about shielding a memory (i.e. that shielding always allows legilimens access) will always apply to occlumency. I suspect you might argue the conceptual difference between a shield (i.e. bouncing attacks off of it), versus a hidden item (thus unobserved). But I would then argue that a skilled legilimens would be able to detect that magic doing the hiding. For example, if a thought about X is hidden, and a legilimens is looking for X, then "hiding" occlumency magic would still have to activate. A skilled legilimens would be able to detect this magic and follow it.

I think that HPMOR's "perfect occlumens" might be the best example of your way of thinking. Are there other examples that you would recommend?

One subtle thing to note, I think is that there are two separate issues: shielding a secret, and shielding the fact that there is a secret. (Although one should note that the existence of a "shield" in this sense doesn't necessarily imply the existence of a secret.) Thus people who only care about people seeing /any/ of their thoughts would have a shield. People who want to hide the fact that there might be a secret, would need to do the thought-specific hiding.
