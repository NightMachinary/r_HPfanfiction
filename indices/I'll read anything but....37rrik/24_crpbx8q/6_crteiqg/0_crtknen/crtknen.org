Because that isn't how occlumency works. Occlumency isn't about erecting barriers, it's about hiding things. It's right there in the name: to occlude, i.e. hide.

A barrier, or any kind of active attempt at defence, would be counter-productive. We know that the key to occlumency is clearing your mind of both thoughts and emotions; an active defence is a thought, and likely comes with emotion too, and thus is an opening for the legilimens. By trying to defend yourself, you in fact allow yourself to be attacked. Instead, you clamp down on those things you want to hide, and by doing so deny the legilimens access to those memories and feelings. You cannot enter something that isn't there.

Snape in OotP:

  "The Dark Lord, for instance, almost always knows when somebody is lying to him. Only those skilled at Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie, and so can utter falsehoods in his presence without detection.”

That, combined with Harry's lessons in general, is the best insight into occlumency we get. Stage one of occlumency is clearing your whole mind of all thought and emotion, thus denying access to all of your thoughts. This more or less has the effect of the fanon shield, but works by almost the reverse mechanism. It's also rather useless, as the legilimens will immediately know you're hiding something. No one's mind is that empty.

But the next stage, the more advanced level, is that of clearing your mind of specific thoughts and feelings while keeping the rest going. This is true occlumency, in that it can effectively fool legilimens and shows true mastery of the mind.

To take all of this and replace it with shields is like saying "No, I don't want that original, subtle idea. Instead I want to replace it with the most clichéd and simplistic fantasy trope I can find."
