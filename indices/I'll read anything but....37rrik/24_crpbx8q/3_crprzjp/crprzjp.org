I'll bite. How do you know if an author has pairing preferences? Are you looking for a thirty thousand word ff.net profile that lists two thousand reasons why Snape/Winky is supported by the original series 'if you just look hard enough?' Do you scan through the author's previously published works to see if there are dozens of examples with only one particular pairing? This seems like a very broad exclusionary mechanism that would be quite difficult to enforce with any consistency.

Your post says "anything but," so I assume that's a pretty ironclad rule.
