I don't refuse to read slash, I just never seek it out. If I'm reading a fic and slash occurs then I'll continue, even if it gets a bit uncomfortable as long as the story is good. I consider slash to be a pairing that I don't like, but can tolerate.

Obviously there's plenty of people who do refuse to read slash, but I figured I'd give my input.
