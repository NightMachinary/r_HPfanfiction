  I'm surprised by the amount of people refusing to read slash. It's like everyone's obsessed with genitalia or something.

When I'm reading a fic, I become Harry. Like role-playing. As part of the role-play, I adopt Harry's characteristics, but there is a limit. Any actions taken by Harry that I would absolutely not do, therefore, destroy my interest in the fic. These include ranting at adults, torturing people, and sexual preferences different to my own.

  The Smurfette Principle isn't trivial to shoehorn onto Harry Potter fan fiction, but authors tend to try. You get Harry's love interest and maybe one other female character who averages even one line per chapter.

Heh. I tend to find the opposite. You have far too many fics where Harry surrounds himself with female friends (unrealistic for a boy that age) and the author plays them all as potential love interests. See, for example, The Merging.
