I actually don't find the Harry surrounding himself with girls implausible. As far as we're aware, the only experience Harry canonically has with children his own age are Dudley and his gang, which apparently consisted of bullying and then further bullying involving mostly Draco, once he enter Hogwarts. Therefore, imo, its perfectly acceptable that he'd develop a tendency towards female friends.

The every girl is a love interest thing, on the other hand, not so much. Also, Harry himself is one of the last characters I'd consider realistically portrayed for their age.
