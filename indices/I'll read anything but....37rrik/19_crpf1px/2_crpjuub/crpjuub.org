I never understood writers who minimise the role of women in the HP universe because as we've seen from canon that is simply not the case. Some of the most bad-ass characters are women. Molly Weasley took out Bellatrix Lestrange. Tonks. Minerva McGonagall. Hermione. Ginny, who was a powerful witch. Hermione was an extremely competent witch, the best in her entire year at school. Magic isn't all about *knowing* things, it's about *doing* them as well.
