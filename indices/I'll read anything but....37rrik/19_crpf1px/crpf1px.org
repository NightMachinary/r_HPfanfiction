I'm surprised by the amount of people refusing to read slash. It's like everyone's obsessed with genitalia or something.

I will stop reading a fic if I notice sufficient sexism.

- The Smurfette Principle isn't trivial to shoehorn onto Harry Potter fan fiction, but authors tend to try. You get Harry's love interest and maybe one other female character who averages even one line per chapter.
- Just because you're a woman in love doesn't mean you abandon all your other priorities to devote your entire existence to helping a guy out. Even if you're saving his life, you're going to have downtime.
- A lot of fics tend to insist that women can't fight anywhere near as well as men. They offer no justification.
- It's rare to find a female character whom the author allows to be as competent as a male character at anything.
- Hermione is usually allowed to be a competent scholar and better than named male characters within that domain. However, she's likely to be Worf Effected.
- The use of rape as a way to indicate that someone is evil is crude, overdone, and just not appreciated.

In entirely unrelated news, I haven't finished a fic in a while.
