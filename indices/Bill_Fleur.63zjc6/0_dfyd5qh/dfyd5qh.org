A Boon for Bill is centered around Bill/Fleur and Harry/Hermione. The plot can be summarized with:

Potion Queen Molly is being ridiculously prude and annoys the shit out of Harry and Hermione as they are starting a relationship. Bill and Fleur help them and need Harrys help to get engaged due to Veela life debts being in the way.

It belongs mainly into the humour genre and despite being marked as inclomplete (with around 200k words) can be seen as complete because it provides closure to the main plot.
