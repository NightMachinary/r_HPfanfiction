I did the same thing when reading a fic that paired Harry with Mandy Brocklehurst back when marriage contracts were slightly less annoying. Watching Skins (the UK version) at the same time made for quite the experience.

It's stuck as well, because I keep picturing Michelle, JJ and other characters when reading fics that feature the OCs-in-all-but-name.
