Harry may feel some guilt over killing her, though he'll probably suppress or rationalize it.

Dumbledore will be disappointed in him.

Harry will probably fight more ruthlessly during the war, and people will take him much more seriously as a threat.

He may be sent to Azkaban- if he kills Bellatrix before Voldemort shows, the Ministry doesn't see proof of Voldemort's return, and he's a trespasser in the Ministry even if they're unlikely to prosecute him for killing a wanted Death Eater in a duel.
