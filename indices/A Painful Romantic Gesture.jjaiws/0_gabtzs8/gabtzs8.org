“So...” Hermione said, slowly. “This is a thing.”

“Yes,” Parvati answered. “This is a thing.”

Hermione didn't really plan on sitting in the Common Room with Parvati and discussing romance of all things. Normally, there'd be a lot of other things she'd rather be doing... but this latest trend was too much, even for the Wizarding world.

“The appropriate way for a witch to ask a wizard out... is to kick him between his legs.”

“It is.”

“And the teachers aren't going to do something like... I don't know... immediately prohibiting something like this?”

“Well, the demographic situation in the Magical Britain is so dire that romance followed by early marriage and childbirth has to be encouraged by any means necessary...”

Hermione just stared at her.

“Or, at least, that's what Sis would say,” Parvati shrugged. “I think Professor Dumbledore calls it “the power of love”, or something like that?”

“Right,” Hermione said, still looking somewhat dumbstruck. “But still, our screwed up demographic situation aside -- and for the record, I /really/ can't see this having any kind of positive effect on demographics -- don't you, personally, find this at least a little bit weird?”

The other girl laughed.

“Oh, that's nothing! You should've heard my parents talk about how it was when they went to Hogwarts... actually, I think Dad still has the scars from all the canaries...”

“I see...”

For a while, Hermione was silent, contemplating what she just heard. The Gryffindor really thought the Wizarding world couldn't get any more ridiculous -- and then, something like this just had to happen. Of course, it /also/ had to do with Harry, and she accepted the fact that weird things just /happened/ when he was involved, but still... after ghost teachers, moving staircases, giant homicidal snakes, soul-sucking monstrosities, not to mention all the bigoted pureblood pricks...

Wait a second.

“Where are you going, Hermione?” Parvati asked as the brown-haired girl suddenly stood up and turned to leave the Common Room.

Hermione's smile made the Indian girl shudder.

“Oh, I have a boy to confess my /true/ and /honest/ feelings to... maybe even more than once.”

And, still with a smile that made first years sweat drop and try to remember if they had any unfinished homework left, Hermione Granger left the Gryffindor Tower.

***

Only when she approached the dungeon did Hermione realize her mistake.

The entrance to the Slytherin dorms was positively crowded with witches. It looked like at least half of female Gryffindors in years four to seven were present, and there were girls from other Houses as well -- most of them, as far as Hermione knew, from Muggle families.

“Oh hi, Hermione!” the /Ravenclaw prefect/ waved to her. “We were wondering when you were going to show up.”

“So,” Hermione blinked. “You're all here for... Malfoy?”

“Who else?” the Ravenclaw snorted. “Don't you know how popular this ferret is among us Muggleborns? We're just /dying/ to tell dear Draco how we /really/ feel about him. And do you know what it means?”

“What?” Hermione asked.

The prefect waggled her finger at her, smiling slyly.

“Get in line, Granger.”

“Um... boss?” Goyle asked, sticking his head in the doorway of Draco's room. “The class starts in ten minutes.”

“Go ahead,” Draco grumbled, looking away. “I'll just stay here.”

“But it's Potions.”

“And?”

“Won't Professor Snape be like... really mad... if you skip his class?”

“Goyle,” the Malfoy scion winced. “How many girls are outside our Common Room, exactly?”

“Uh... a dozen? Two dozen?.. A lot?”

Draco shuddered.

“Never thought I'd say this, Goyle... but I'd rather take Snape.”
