  Tony Stark has secrets. Despite riches and fame, he has few true friends and little life outside of Iron Man. Which is who everyone seems to want, except Pepper. Pepper hates Iron Man, but he can't change what he is. Harry Potter has no idea what life after death holds, but he can't go back, can't undo what has been done. The only way is forward, for both of them (SLASH) Harry/Tony
