GenkaiFan has great work. If you haven't read it, go read linkffn(Poison Pen)

A long, well-written one is linkffn(Angry Harry and the Seven) but beware that it feels /horribly/ clich√© at times. If you can look past that, you have 400k+ words of well-crafted story.

Another good one is linkffn(Harry Potter: Junior Inquisitor), though its warning of an Evil!Dumbledore is certainly warranted.

An oldie, but goldie, is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Summer of Change), though an age warning is appropriate here. It's still well-written (especially the romantic development), but it hasn't aged gracefully.

linkffn(The Greatest Prank) is a hilarious crossover with the comic /Looking for Group/. It's not very long at 43k words over 17 chapters and still a WIP, but it's good.

There's more, obviously, but I don't know how many links the ffbot can handle before it gets parsing errors :p
