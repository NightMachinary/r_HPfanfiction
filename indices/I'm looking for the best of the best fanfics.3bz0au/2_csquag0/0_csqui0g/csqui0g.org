I try to avoid a couple of tropes like Evil!Dumbledore which always seems to be awful, bashing fics (Ron is pretty meh, but the bashing gets ridiculous), and such and while I do like romance in fics, I'd prefer it not be the only focus if you know what I mean, especially if it starts mid-series and unfortunately that makes it hard to look for fics with certain pairings as Hermione ones tend to be that type for instance.

I haven't read most of these either, though I was looking at Summer of Change earlier today as a possible read. I appreciate the help and if you're willing I'd always like to hear about more. I'm a really fast reader so I go through fics rather fast.
