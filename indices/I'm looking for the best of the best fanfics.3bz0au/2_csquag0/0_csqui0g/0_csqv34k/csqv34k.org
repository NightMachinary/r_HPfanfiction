I know your pain with reading fast. I read the multi-million word behemoth that is Myetel's Spirit of Redemption in two weeks, while also attending uni.

While I share your distaste for Evil!Dumbledore, I found the one in Junior Inquisitor to be a well-written one, though admittedly I haven't read the fic in more than a month.

The Summer of Change's romance with Tonks builds from practically the first paragraph, and it progresses really naturally as far as I can remember, nor is it the main focus of the tale. It's about Harry finding a place in his life, and a girlfriend is just one aspect of it.
