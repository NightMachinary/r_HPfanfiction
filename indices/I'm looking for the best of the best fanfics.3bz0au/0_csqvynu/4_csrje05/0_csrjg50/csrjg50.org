  First year fem!Harry AU. Alexandra Potter has finally come to Hogwarts, where she will meet new friends and discover a world of magic. But will an escalating rivalry threaten all that she's built? Character-driven story, lots of world building. No canon rehash, no bashing.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  He remembered being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a creature borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the 2nd son of the King, a spare, but that changes when things rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming... but magic is might.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
