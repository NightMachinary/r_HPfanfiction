Great post and I haven't read most of them either (though I've heard of almost all of them). I started on Bungle in the Jungle and had issues with the 2nd person POV, I hear it gets good, but I think I'll wait on it for now and try some of the other ones. I generally don't do 1st person either, but I'm willing to make exceptions for that like Seventh Horcrux, which had me laughing non-stop for the first half of the story.

I don't mind WIPs either, but of course I'd prefer there'd be an ending or just more updates. I've read some really special fanfics that just stop, but that doesn't make them less special (a Naruto fic called "Naze?" always comes to mind when I think about that).
