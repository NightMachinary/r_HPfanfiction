Yeah, I know you're right about WIPs, I've just had a few great fics cut off at terrible times recently, in a row. I suppose my frustration may be a tiny bit evident in my post, lol.

I forgot about that 2nd person POV thing in BitJ, that is definitely annoying at first but I think I stopped noticing it at all a few chapters in.

Glad to help, posts like this are what lead me to some of my all-time favorite stories, let alone fanfics, so I'm happy to do the same for you and anyone else that sees this.
