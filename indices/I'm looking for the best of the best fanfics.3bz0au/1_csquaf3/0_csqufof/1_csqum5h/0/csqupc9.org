2nd person is definitely something to get used to it as I'm utterly unfamiliar with it and it was bizarre decision to use it, but people seem to like the fic regardless which speaks of how good it must be.

I agree, I should have made this post a while ago, it's much better than going through other recent posts which generally don't have stories at quite the level or just the kind that I want in general and since reddit is what it is it'll just help whomever needs it in the future which is really nice.
