No, that's all pretty accurate IMO. I just loved the story anyway. The action was great, the magic was fascinating, the humor was good without taking over everything, and the whole plot was just original and fresh in a lot of great ways that really drew me into the story.

Still, 2nd person perspective. Really, Jbern?
