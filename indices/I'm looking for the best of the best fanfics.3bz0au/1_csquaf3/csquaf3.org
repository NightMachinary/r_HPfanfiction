Check out anything by Jbern. Seriously, linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle) was absolutely amazing and has a completed sequel that's just as good. Also, linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) is great, and his other stuff is good too.

Other great reads include linkffn(A Black Comedy) and linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes) by Nonjon, each having hilarious comedy and interesting plots.

I really enjoyed The Psychic Serpent trilogy by Barb, sometimes called The Triangle Prophecy trilogy. Not quite on the same level as the above stories, but it had me captivated throughout and the ending was satisfying and heartbreaking all at once. It is three books, years 5-7, written before HBP came out, and gloriously complete. Not on the usual sites, I don't think, but google should work fine.

Oh, and I almost forgot linkffn(Backwards With Purpose: Always and Always). Best time travel fic around.

linkffn(Delenda Est) kicks some serious ass as well. Harry and young Bellatrix Lestrange wage war on Voldemort across time. Their relationship does not stay platonic forever, but it actually makes sense. The really good stuff is the politics and magic they use/are involved with.

One last one, I almost forgot my favorite Jbern story, linkffn(To Fight the Coming Darkness) is so freaking cool in so many ways.

All these stories are complete, because WIPs drive me crazy no matter how good they are.

Oops, seriously this is the last one, linkffn(Aspirations by megamatt09) is a pretty good story made awesome by the comic book style vigilante arc.

Read all that, OP. Now. Go ahead, I'll wait. I can't wait to see what other people recommend, it's been too long since I found a fic I really loved.

Sorry Mr. Bot, I hope you can parse all these links. I didn't plan on including so many, but I just kept remembering more of my favorites as I went.

P.S. Best crossover I've seen is called linkffn(Wand and Shield) and has HP in the Avenger's universe from the movies. This one is, woefully, regretfully, /frustratingly/ incomplete and likely to stay that way. Despite that, I will grudgingly admit that this story is very well written and fun.
