Except he does, in Canon. One of Draco's primary motivations is his family, and their expectations of him. In the final battle, after the RoR gets blitzed, and Harry is revealed to be alive Draco and his family split. They're not going and joining the order, but they are deciding that being with voldemort will get them killed. So when Lucius and Narcissa want to go leave and get away and not fight for Voldemort anymore, he goes with them. Draco's 2 primary dedications in life are protecting himself, and doing what is expected of his by his family and caste. And that, in the end, is what motivates him to leave, because his dedication to his family is overriding his dedication to his caste, and because staying with his caste and fighting will get him killed. But the only reason his family leaves in the first place is because Lucius is a coward and doesn't want to be out on the battlefield with Bellatrix and Cole, and Narcissa's only goal is to protect her family. So they leave, and take Draco with them.
