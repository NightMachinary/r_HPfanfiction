It could be that Draco comes to his senses when he realizes just how much suffering Voldemort is actually causing. Even as a bully, Malfoy usually tended to use his words or tricks rather than spells or fists.

Suppose the Death Eaters have some fresh meat, say a little ten-year-old Muggle or Muggleborn girl, and they use the Cruciatus Curse on her.

There's a big difference between reading /The Cruciatus Curse was declared Unforgivable. The use of it on another human being will earn the caster a life sentence in Azkaban/ and actually seeing it being used.

And it could fit your new timeline nicely. In the fifth book, Malfoy joked about the Long-term Spell Damage Ward in St. Mungo's and he almost certainly knows what happened to Neville's parents.
