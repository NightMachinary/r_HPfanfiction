We saw Draco laugh at the first act of Muggle Baiting he saw at the Quidditch World Cup, when Death Eaters levitated the helpless Roberts family into the air, but one wonders whether they intended lasting harm on the family. Or at least any harm that would be hard to get away with.

But if the little ten-year-old and her parents are captured by Death Eaters, maybe to use as practice for Draco.

The Death Eaters could kill the parents in front the ten-year-old (I'm on the fence as to whether or not the girl should be a Muggleborn witch or a Muggle outright).

And then Bellatrix could instruct Draco on how to cast the Cruciatus Curse (/You have to/ */mean/* /it Draco!/)...

And there's more ways to torture in the Wizarding World than just Cruciatus. Threatening to feed the ten-year-old to a werewolf would be terrifying.

That could certainly be enough to make Draco very uneasy...
