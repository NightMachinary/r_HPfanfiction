Arguments to be used by Draco in case of Hermione-perfectness:

- She's cheating!

- Dumbledore must be giving her answers to make us purebloods look bad!

- She's probably an orphan from the war adopted by muggles.

- Her parents are squibs, so she's not a mudblood anyway.

- She's one of "the good ones".
