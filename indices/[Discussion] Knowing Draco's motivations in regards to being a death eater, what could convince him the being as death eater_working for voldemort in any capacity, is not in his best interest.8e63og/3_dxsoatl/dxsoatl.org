Him noticing early (2nd year the latest) that pureblood supremacy is bullshit because Hermione keeps trashing the purebloods in all exams and/or that the Dark Lord was defeated by a half-blood toddler and his Muggleborn mother. He doesn't necessarily has to become best friends with 20 Muggles or crawl into Dumbledore's arse, but some realisation at that time would be necessary to have a believable timeframe for his change of heart (and without too much water under the bridge). This, coincidentally, is pretty much the only way how I can see a Harry/Draco friendship or Draco/Hermione work.
