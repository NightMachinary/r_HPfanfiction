Malfoy Sr would still be marked and he was a quite loyal supporter (he had a Horcrux). There is no way Voldemort would let him slip away that easily, especially considering the Horcrux. It would be far more realistic if Draco would jump ship, maybe together with his mother...

Actually, Narcissa could be the driving factor here. Pettigrew gets arrested, during his trial he mentions that he believes the Dark Lord in Albania, Lucius wants to follow that lead but Narcissa is against him. It could boil down to Narcissa and Draco vs Lucius. Because unless you want to give Draco a realisation he would have never had in canon, that's pretty much the only semi-believable way I can think of.
