I perceived it as Draco defining himself by his family, by his blood status, by his caste, and then later on by his status as a death eater. This is even from the moment he introduces himself.

"Malfoy. Draco Malfoy." - somewhere in PS

I don't think he once defines himself just as Draco. His sense of extroverted feeling, how he perceives himself in relation to his status, I don't think he once stops to consider just who /Draco/ is, not Malfoy, in the first 5 books.

And then the sixth book happens. He is given a task. A task that feels impossible a task that, Iirc, is /meant/ to be impossible. As I remember, it was Voldemort's intention to punish Lucius for his failings by giving his son a task where failure meant his death. But to Draco, he is being given a reward, a chance to prove himself. To live up to the status of being a death eater. Get rid of Dumbledore, and you will be one of us. Draco regularly spends time in the CoS bathroom crying like a baby because he's under so much stress.

And then he has to go back to the home that has been taken over by voldemort, spending his summer obeying the every whim of a mad man with a fetishist for the cruciate curs Draco is a bigot with awful views, but even he can tell that voldemort is batshit. He had joined this group, thinking it could give him everything he ever wanted, and now realized that it's a dictatorship lead by a raging lunatic. So when his parents say Draco, come, and they leave, he goes with them. Because he's not that big of an idiot, to stay loyal to a man like voldemort.
