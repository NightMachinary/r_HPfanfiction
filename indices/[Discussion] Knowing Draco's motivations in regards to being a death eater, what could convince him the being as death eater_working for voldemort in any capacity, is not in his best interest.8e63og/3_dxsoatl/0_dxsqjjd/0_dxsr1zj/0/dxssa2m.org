I'm trying to give him a realization that he /did/ have in Canon, in book 7, just a book or two earlier. I don't have an issue having a family conflict come up, or an outside event happening differently, as you suggested, as long as I can believably say that said conflict or outside event had something to do with scabbers getting discovered, such as your idea that he let slip information at his trial, causing a family conflict. Come to think of it, I feel rather stupid for not assuming Peter would be spilling his guts with information to get a lighter sentence, and what I could do with the information spilled. Idea is very appreciated.
