The pivotal turning point of my AU is Remus recognizing scabbers on the HE in third year, causing sirius get aquitted. I'm working on the motto of 'Why bother changing anything, if you don't change anything' and 'A stone making ripples making waves making floods making tsunamis.' One ripple I'm trying to make is Draco and possibly his family leaving the death eaters early/never joining the death eaters in the first place. I'm pretty flexible about how it could happen, my only limit I'm setting for myself is that everyone has to stay in character. Any change I make to his actions has to some way be able to lead back to the original change. If it's a very convoluted and distant connection that's okay, as long as I can prove there is one. To put it simply, nobody is going to be making decisions or actions they did not make in Canon, unless I can prove that it was influenced by my Scene 0.

And as for why I'm determined to find a motivation for draco to leave the DE, as I said, why would I bother changing anything (remus recognizing scabbers), if I don't plan on changing anything (the wide reaching effects such a change would have, such as draco not making quite such terrible decisions as in Canon.)?
