You are totally right that it is lame that we don't have something like that for HP. My guess is that the divisiveness of the different ships since the very beginning made everything really decentralized. I think Ao3 has really good searchability, but it is up to authors to properly tag their work and some barely tag at all. Also there is no one "curating" it for good writing (at a minimum spelling and readable grammar/formatting). And I know a lot of people are FFN loyalists, but imo it is almost unusable to find fics I want to read. Anything I read that is hosted on FFN is because it was recommended somewhere else and linked.

I would definitely help with making a site similar to the twilight one, but I think it is a huge undertaking! But still, I would be happy to help out however needed.
