These are some really good points. If we were to make a list, we would have to be sure we keep adding to it and that we do a good job explaining what kind of story it is. Maybe there could be some form of a "recommended by people who love HPMOR" tag alongside the everything else, but that might be a little too clunky. I'm thinking we would almost need a tumblr blog or something where you can make a huge rec list and explain who would like each story and stuff. Would be a lot of work, but I think that's along the lines of what OP is looking to make.
