It's a good list, but not that many people contribute, and I don't think it would scale well. I've contributed some stories to it, and seconded recommendations of others, but it would take a lot of maintenance. At the moment, it's more of a 'start here' list. It's also useful for pointing people to when they ask for a list of good recs.

It's definitely useful to have, and a similar thing on this subreddit would be good, but I think there's some problems that haven't become apparent on [[/r/narutofanfiction]]'s list that would immediately crop up here.

For example, would HPMOR be on the list? A lot of people like it, including some people on this subreddit, but in general people don't. And what about robst/Perfect Lionheart? Stuff considered generally bad but still popular? The naruto subreddit is small enough that I could list the ten or so main contributors, and we all get along fairly well, whereas this sub is too big.

Don't take this as an argument against it, consider it as some starting points for improving on it. A list like that is a good idea, but could be expanded or changed to fit this sub better.
