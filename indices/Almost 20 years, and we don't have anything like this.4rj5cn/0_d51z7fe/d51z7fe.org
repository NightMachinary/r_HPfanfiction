[[/r/narutofanfiction]] has a list on the side bar that you can add to or access. It's got who recommended it, the summary, whether or not it's completed and when it was last updated, how many words, and finally, a link to the story or its author. It would be cool if we could incorporate that into this subreddit. I'd love a nice long list in one place instead of multiple different rec lists on multiple different websites. We could probably sort them based off of the genre (time travel, non-BWL, magical creature!Harry, etc).
