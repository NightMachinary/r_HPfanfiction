I think the benefit of something like this is that it would be fandom-specific (tags, themes, etc). But the key is to offer something that the other sites simply can't give, which may just be the ability to really drill down into the tags to get (or at least request) what a person really wants. I think you could also include a small and well-regulated request/commission function - one that can help potential writers gauge what people are interested in seeing. For example, I have a huge project I want to undertake but I keep putting it off because I don't sense much enthusiasm for the topic.\\
My question is how do you determine what is guaranteed "well-written" and who makes those determinations?
