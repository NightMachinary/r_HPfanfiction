I would love a source like that. I really love Dean fics, but I honestly don't think I've ever been able to find one that fits all my criteria (aka, not that interested in romances, slash or otherwise, but when I remove "romance" from the criteria, it's still only Dean/Seamus fics - but I'd said no romance!! It seems romance is such a standard in fanfics that they don't need to be specified or something?
