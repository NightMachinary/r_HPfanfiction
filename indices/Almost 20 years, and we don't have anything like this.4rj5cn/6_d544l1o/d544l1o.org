Well, there's sites for specific kinds of HP-FanFiction, still a better organized and searchable ressource would be great!

ps: What's the appeal of "all-human" Twilight stuff? I don't get it! I would have NEVER read Twilight if it wasn't about Vampires (and I only finished it because I needed to - for school (I did a report/presentation comparing Bram Stocker's Dracula with contemporary vampire-literature (and used Twilight as one example...did a comparison of the Count and Edward for example)) - otherwise I probably would have done what I did with the last HP-Book: Put the books in a dark corner and sticking to fanfiction (love the Twilight universe, but I HATE certain characters...Edward comes to mind and original Bella))

So again: What makes this a thing? It takes away everything that makes the setting good IMHO! (Turns it from a mystery/fantasy story into a damned sitcom -.-)
