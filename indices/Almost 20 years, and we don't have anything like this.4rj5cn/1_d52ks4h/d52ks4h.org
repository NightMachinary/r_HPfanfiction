It'd be useful to have a resource that one could sort according to a wide variety of preferences, unlike FFN's godawful search function that is pitifully limited in its search terms. AO3 tries, but has only a fraction of the fics that are on FFN, and unfortunately tends to fall prey to tagging issues with enormous drabble collections spewing character tags across the page like drunken lechers. Your rec archive seems to avoid this issue largely by being focused on a single pairing, but if one were to size up to the entire Potter fandom, the tag list will become utterly monstrous and bizantine in its meaning. This needs to be accounted for, if possible, by either culling exotic tags or using some very 'plain meaning' tags for common concepts, otherwise it's going to be a giant list of euphemisms that probably meant something to someone once.
