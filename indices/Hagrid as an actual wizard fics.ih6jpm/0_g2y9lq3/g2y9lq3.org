He's a side character at best, but in my AU story "Patron", Hagrid was rehabilitated early on and is the Care of Magical Creatures Professor - and one of the foremost experts on magical creatures in Magical Europe. He mostly makes appearances during the Tournament and later on, when breeding creatures and fighting in the war.
