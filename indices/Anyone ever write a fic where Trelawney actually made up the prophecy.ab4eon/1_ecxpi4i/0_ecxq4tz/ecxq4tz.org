  I remember reading one where Harry talks to Trewlaney and she mentions that Snape interrupted her and Dumbledore and Harry realizes she shouldn't be able to remember that since it happens partway through. The author either uses this to show the prophecy was fake or that Snape knew the whole thing. I'll look into it later.

If it's the one I'm thinking of, it's linkffn(Faery Heroes by Silently Watches) in which Harry goes over a few memories and realises that the story Trelawney and Dumbledore tell about the prophecy in canon literally cannot have happened the way it did, but that Trelawney's story, at least, is consistent with the presenting symptoms of the Imperius curse. And concludes that, if the prophecy /was/ genuine, it was given /much/ earlier than Trelawney's interview and the scene in the Hog's Head was a Dumbledore set-up. (I forget why, but Silently Watches also has Harry find out that it didn't even happen at the Hog's Head, but Dumbledore had rewritten a few key memories so everyone material to events thought so.)
