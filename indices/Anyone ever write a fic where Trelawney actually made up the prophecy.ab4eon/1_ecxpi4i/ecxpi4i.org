Remindme! 16 hours

I remember reading one where Harry talks to Trewlaney and she mentions that Snape interrupted her and Dumbledore and Harry realizes she shouldn't be able to remember that since it happens partway through. The author either uses this to show the prophecy was fake or that Snape knew the whole thing. I'll look into it later.

I've also seen a couple where Harry gets upset that his parents' deaths occurred due to the words of a known fraud, but those ones don't really push the fake!prophecy angle.
