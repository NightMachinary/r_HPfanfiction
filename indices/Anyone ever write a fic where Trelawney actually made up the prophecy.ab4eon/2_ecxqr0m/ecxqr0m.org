There's actually a fair number of them, usually on the basis of why would Dumbledore hold an interview at the Hogs Head unless it was to deliberately leak the prophecy (sometimes the prophecy is real, other times Trelawney makes it up for the job and Dumbledore takes it and runs with it).

If I remember the titles I'll link them here, but it's not too uncommon in manipulative Dumbledore fics.
