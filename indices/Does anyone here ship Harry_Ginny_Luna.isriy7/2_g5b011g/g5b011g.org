That could be a cute pairing, so long as the relationship is done well and it's not just a 'harry and his two girlfriends' thing

It could easily be a good poly relationship. I always shipped Luna with harry when I was a kid since they are just very similar and yet different enough to enjoy spending time together

And Ginny if sone well could fit right in.
