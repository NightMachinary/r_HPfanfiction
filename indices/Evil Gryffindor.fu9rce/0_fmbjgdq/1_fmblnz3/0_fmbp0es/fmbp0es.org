  Does he try to change the past when he goes?
#+end_quote

No. He doesn't go out of his way to not change the past either. The fic is a stable time loop story, so it's not a concern.

  Does he hang out with his mom and Marauders or avoid them?
#+end_quote

Yes. He didn't time travel voluntarily. He just hangs in the past with his parents while he waits to go back.
