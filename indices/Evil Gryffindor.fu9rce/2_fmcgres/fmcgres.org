Kinda fudging your requirements, but The Sinister Man's /Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin/ ( linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]) ) features what I'd consider fanon's best competent!Peter. His rise/descent from string-along Marauder to budding dark lord in his own right is exceptionally well done.
