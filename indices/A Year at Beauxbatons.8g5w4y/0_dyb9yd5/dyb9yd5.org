I like the premise but I've noticed some issues.

After reading the first chapter, all I could think about was the lack of drama. It's like you're dodging around it. Let's go through some of that.

You burn through a lot of words rewriting lines from canon. You're treating us as if we've never read the books. Some people dig this but I think most just scroll right past it.

In canon, the build-up to Harry and Marge's confrontation is drawn out, which gives us time to really hate Marge. We know she's a cow and we know that Harry must be passive if he wishes to get his Hogsmeade letter signed. We know Vernon can sense how close to snapping Harry is.

So each time Marge insults Harry we know what's at stake. Your story doesn't currently allow for any of this.

On top of that, the confrontation is interrupted by /'a light metallic sound'/ which undermines the severity of the situation. If they were really going at it, nothing short of physical intervention would stop them.

Why not just have your OC professor show up in person and embrace that drama? Why not emulate the Dumbledore/Dursley scene from Book 6?

You cut from a fight, directly to later that night anyway. you're not doing anything with that time, so why have the letter arrive early?

Why is Harry supposed to trust this adult stranger who shows up at his house? Especially given the fact that most the adults in his life have failed him at best and tried to kill him at worst.

Where is Dumbledore or Fudge during this french abduction? If it's supposed to be a secret, then let us see the Frenchman checking his watch constantly.

Does Harry leave without Hedwig? Does he leave without his wand? Because that's what you've written.

All probably add some more as they come to mind.

Good Luck.
