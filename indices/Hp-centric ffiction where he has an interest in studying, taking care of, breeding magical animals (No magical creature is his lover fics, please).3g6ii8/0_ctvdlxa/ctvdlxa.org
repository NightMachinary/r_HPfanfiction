I have nothing to recommend, but I would like to read something like this as well.

Care of Magical Creatures is treated very much in the same way as Hufflepuff. Nothing turns me off a fic faster than when a character says something like, 'Hufflepuff? You mean the house for average people?'. As if Hufflepuff is the place for non-achievers and the forgettable. Give me a break. The reason I bring it up is because Care of Magical Creatures is disregarded in a similar war.

I think it would be really interesting to read about a Harry that focuses on magical creatures. There's definitely a plot there for that.
