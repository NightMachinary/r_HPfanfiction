[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3750393/1/Harry-Potter-s-Life-Lessons][Life'S Lessons]] Short, but absolutely delicious. Amorally logical throughout. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes' I am Harry's Brother.]] Ok, I don't think Harry is the evil one here, but it's quite unique. Don't get scared by the premise, the writing and progression is good.
