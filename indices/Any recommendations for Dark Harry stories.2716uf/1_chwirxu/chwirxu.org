[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] has a sort of morally ambiguous Harry who [[/spoiler][helps Voldemort regain his sanity, and it's eventual LV/HP slash]]. It is abandoned, as far as I know, but at 226,768 words it's still quite worth it. It's a time travel fic of a sorts [[/spoiler][(Harry is reborn into baby Harry, July 31 1980, every time he dies)]] but very well done.
