Two I usually recommend are;

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9315209/1/Out-of-the-Night][Out of the Night]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Descent-into-Darkness][Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness]]

Descent into Darkness is finished with an abandoned sequel but has been picked up by another author on AFF which is updated regularly. It's a gradual HP/LV with some smut later on.

Out of the Night is a personal favourite of mine. Harry learns what it really means to be a dark wizard and decides that the dark is for him. I don't want to say too much but the paths that Harry takes and the personal reflection that he goes through when becoming a dark wizard are wonderfully written and makes the story seem so believable.
