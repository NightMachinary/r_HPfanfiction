[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of a Dark Kingdom]] by Mizuni-sama is hella awesome. It's long as hell, ongoing and the best Harry/Voldie non-slash I have seen in a while. 1,000,000+ words!

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1176279/chapters/2397109][The Black Bunny]] is more neutral!Harry but he's married to Voldemort so he occasionally get's his hands dirty. It get's very slice-of-life like after the first arc or so. 400k plus and complete...sorta.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/451855/chapters/774989][Counting Bodies Like Sheep]] is a pretty dark Zombie AU. It's Tom/Harry with a smaller age gap but very good.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/517540/chapters/913785][The Rise of A Dark Lord]] is also pretty damn good though the writing style isn't completely to my tastes but it's regularly updated so that's alright. A very dark slytherin!Harry and slow burn Harrymort but updated often. About 100k words.

I hesitate to rec [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3762636/1/The%20Black%20Heir][The Black Heir]] since it's Harry by another name and backstory [he's Sirius Black's son named Orion] but going past it, it's a pretty damn good story. 600k in the first story and over 100k in the sequel that is ongoing. Multiple pairings but Harrymort is the big one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today][Death of Today]] is a big Harrymort one with a Voldemort wins!AU though it's not smut heavy. It's also another one with Harry being someone else's son, Regulus in this version and he was raised in an orphanage. 71 chapters, over 500,000 words.

[[http://www.intertexius.com/_index-harry-potter-fanfiction-and-art.html][A Bittersweet Potion]] series is a story that starts out with a cute premise [Harry changes into a cat and Snape adopts him] and grows really dark really damn quickly. It get's hellishly depraved towards the end and hasn't got updated in a hell of a long time but it's pretty long and solid.

Those are the bigs ones I can garner that fit...though there is this one Lucius/Harry one but it's not that long and I haven't read it in a while. Whatever, message me if you need more!
