Hypothetically, your best friend confesses to you he molested his underage niece for years and blackmailed her to keep her quiet. Explain to me how this “completely unjustifiable” principle works again.

I realize you might say that this is totally different from this hypothetical situation, but I am just parroting your words. You really ought to be careful about making statements like that since someone can always present a counter that will, at best, weaken your point or, at worst, make you sound like an belligerent idiot. I say this from the experience of stating things that have bitten me in the ass before.

Also, Harry is, from what we've seen in canon, enough of an idiot when it comes to Quidditch that he is willing to play a game even when he knows/suspects that someone is actively trying to kill him (Book 1), doesn't quit the team even after some jackass fucking vanished the bones in his arm after yet another assassination attempt (Book 2), and is more upset that his broom was destroyed than the fact that he almost had his fucking soul ripped out of him (Book 3), and he still doesn't quit the school sport that has brought him just as close to death as his DADA professors. Hermione may have broken trust, but broken trust is fixable, brain damage and death are not, just look at Neville's parents or Lockhart in Book 5 if you doubt that.

It should also really be emphasized that Harry has a history of cursed brooms, which was only interrupted when Hermione had to literally set a teacher on fire. As far as justifications go, not wanting to have to do something as equally fucked up as setting someone on fire to save your friend just because said friend is too stubborn to very easily avoid that by double checking a gift with a professor is a pretty good one in my opinion.
