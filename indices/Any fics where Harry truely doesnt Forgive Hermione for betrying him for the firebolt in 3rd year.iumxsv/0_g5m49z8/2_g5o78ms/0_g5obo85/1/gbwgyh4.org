I'd argue that Harry's past record isn't the point. Its that she is making a choice for Harry without notifying him or even trying. She didn't even try to discuss it with him even though it directly involves him. That is a very hurtful thing for a friend to do to you. Not even bother consulting you about choices they make on your behalf. Because they know better why bother letting you muck it up.

Now if she tried to convince them failed then went that would be different but she owes him that discussion first.
