I'm not denying being a suck-up is annoying, and the way she did it I also have a problem with, but realistically, if she did bring it up and her friends still said no, she would have had to do bring in her professors anyways.

These teens know, relatively speaking, very little about magic, so they probably don't even know about diagnostic charms, not to mention that they likely would have a difficult time performing them. I suppose if she got Fred, George, and/or Percy involved before talking to the teachers, they might have been able to do something, but still, these are students and severely lacking in magical know-how, a fact that Harry is aware of at the end of Book 2 when he realizes that he is informed that end of year exams are still taking place and doesn't see how useful knowing how to turn bunnies into slippers are.

Also, if you intentionally broke an extremely expensive gift (the Firebolt's price was only available on request, which suggests it was pretty damn expensive, even if is was likely done because JKR didn't know how to price it) over going behind my back for a quick examination for my safety, I would be a lot more pissed, but that might just be me personally. There a certainly things about Hermione's personality and actions that I am not a fan of, but I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree on this particular subject.
