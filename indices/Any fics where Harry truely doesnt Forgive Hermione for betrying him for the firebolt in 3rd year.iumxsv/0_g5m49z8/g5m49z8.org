I've never really understood why that is brought up, especially during bashing. Hermione had a very legitimate reason for informing the professors considering: 1. Harry's broom actually had been cursed in the past 2. It is known, or at least heavily suspected, that Sirius Black is out to kill Harry 3. Harry has a history of Quidditch injuries, the most recent involved nearly having his soul sucked out for the sake of a stupid game (from Hermione's perspective) 4. Hermione was under a massive amount of stress, self-induced though it may be, on top of hearing an authority figure foretell Harry's death 5. The trio have a history of rule-breaking, good intentioned though it may have been 6. The fact that Hermione really was right as Sirius really did send Harry the broom, and with what they knew of his intentions when she reported the Firebolt, it was the right thing to do.

Also, it is such a minor thing. I get if the bashing is due to Hermione whatever she believes is right, since that is condescending and arrogant and Dumbledore-esque, but this shouldn't be something huge, especially since the professors did plan on giving it back, they just wanted to make sure that it wouldn't end up killing Harry because it was cursed.
