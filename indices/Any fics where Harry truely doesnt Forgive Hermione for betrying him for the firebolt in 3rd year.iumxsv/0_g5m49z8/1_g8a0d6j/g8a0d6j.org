i wouldn't say that she deserves to be bashed or necessarily that her thought process was wrong. But they are pretty young at this age. She disagreed with them about something and instead of talking to them or even really trying she went to the teacher. Which can feel like a prety big betrayal at 13 despite her logic.

And even if she is right the "I know whsts best so I won't even talk to you about choices I will make on your behalf regaurding you" mentality, would cause friction with her and her friends even if she is right.

People skills arent Hermione's strong suit but she truly cares for her friends so I think she'd struggle with things like this. It would be a really interesting arc for her I think if they did take longer to forgive her.
