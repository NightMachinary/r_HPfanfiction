The only person i called a piece of shit was the guy who comments on every non-canon story bashing the author.

You do understand I am not a Harmony shipper, right? I mean, when you compare her to Ron, she's a stand-up pal, but my fav character is Luna.

I just don't like people that excuse bad behavior bc they think with what's between their legs instead of what's between their ears. Like the people that defend Snape as "misunderstood", or Ron as "loyal".
