Dimensional Travels in which Harry enters a world without his counterpart

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052): After falling through the Veil, both Harry and Sirius end up in another world and begin wreaking havoc there. Often recommended here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/A-Riddled-Universe][A Riddled Universe]], linkffn(8678567): After falling through the Veil, both Harry and Sirius end up in another world and meet a good Tom Riddle. There is no Harry Potter in this world, period.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6989327): 4 years after the Battle of Hogwarts, a Hermione from another dimension asks for assistance. The Trio and Ginny enter the breach once more.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3751748/1/Harry-Potter-and-Merlin-s-Reaper][Harry Potter and Merlin's Reaper]], linkffn(3751748): Super!Harry transplanted to a world where Voldemort had won and killed off most of the Muggle population. Evil Weasley kids.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): My favorite dimensional travel perhaps. Badly traumatized Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville are accidentally thrown into a new dimension during a mission. Things are rather different there, and Harry Potter has never existed.
