wasn't this the story with a seemingly super gay sirius/remus with tons of alpha/beta/pack interactions then the author posted a authors note complaining how all the reviewers thought srius and remus were gay? despite having them literarily sleep together in a pile? also wasn't the story abruptly abandonded in the middle of a dueling tournament in a forgiegn country (think france?)

what's your thoughts on empror or circular reasoning? i think both those did a better dark/indy hary than this
