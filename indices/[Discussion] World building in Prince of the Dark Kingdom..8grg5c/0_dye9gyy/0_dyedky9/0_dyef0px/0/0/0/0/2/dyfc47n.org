Hm, now that I think about it I am not entirely sure what it means for Harry to be "Indy" so I can't say for sure if he is Indy or not in that fic. Isn't that when he is independent, powerful, doesn't care about authority, does what he wants, travels, etc?

Harry is very much not that way in the fic. Snape is a kind of an asshole, but Harry still recognizes his authority as his guardian and listens to him and gets saved/protected by him on occasion. He thinks Voldemort is immoral, but he still considers him a friend and learns magic from him and goes on trips or whatever he tells him. He knows that Voldemort is a powerful dictator that you can't exactly say no to and goes along with his plans. Harry is not really portrayed as being super powerful or all knowing. He is willing to break the rules to help his friends or people who can't stand up for themselves, but he doesn't usually initiate craziness (it just sort of happens around him because he attracts trouble).

He does end up in France a few times and visits Remus and Sirius at the werewolf colonies but he is still in enrolled in school throughout the fic. He is not involved in the vampire subplot, Victor Krum is the one who does. There is a significant amount of description of school life and Hogwarts. Occasionally he gets kidnapped and ends up in different places or he gets taken by Voldemort to various places. Then he spends time gets back to Hogwarts which is often the setting of battles and conflicts within the fic.

There are also a few stations of canon, but the details are entirely original. The basilisk storyline is still present, so is the triwizard tournament. A dragon and a lake are still part of it even if the actual tasks are way different.
