There are some weird references to beta and alpha, but it never actually seemed gay to me. Nothing actually happens between them so as long as you can ignore the references it's easy to ignore. The cliffhanger at the end was quite bad though.

I wouldn't call Harry dark or indy though so I am not sure why you would compare it to a fic like Circular Reasoning. I recall attempting to read that fic, but I just remember that it was way too dark, depressing and serious for me so I stopped reading it. They are very different in tone and writing.

One thing I love about POTDK is that while Voldemort won, the world is still a fairly normal place with regular people and reasonable rules. The school is still a school and no one is teaching students to torture or kill anyone.

The writing is often fun and humorous. The dialogue and various situations are occasionally hilarious and make me laugh. Despite having Voldemort as his "mentor", Harry is still a good person at heart. He is considerate, empathetic, wants to help people in need and never actually does anything dark. He isn't the edgy! or independent! or tortured! Harry that is often found in these types of fics. It's a nice change of pace and it makes the fic enjoyable to read.
