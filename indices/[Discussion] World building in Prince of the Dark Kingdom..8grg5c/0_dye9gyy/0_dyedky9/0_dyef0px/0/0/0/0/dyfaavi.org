wasn't comparing it to those stories per say just think those are 2 of the best "serious" fics in the fandom so wanted to hear OPs thoughts on them cuz he claimed PotDK

  It's probably the best story in the fandom.

haven't read it in several years so my bad on assuming it was dark harry I recall Voldemort training/living with harry and kinda assumed/misremebered; but how is it not an indy harry fic? doesn't he leave school early and goes on adventures in werewolf preserve / (works as ward setter?)/(vampire subplot in france?) /other stuff that I don't remember is all far removed from typical hogwarts life/stations of cannon.
