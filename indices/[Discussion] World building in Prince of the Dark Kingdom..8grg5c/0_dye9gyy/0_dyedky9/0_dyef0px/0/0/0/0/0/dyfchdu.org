[[/u/dehue][u/dehue]] already explained the most important topics, but let me add a few things.

The werewolf subplot is about Greyback making a deal with Voldemort which basically created werewolf enclaves, separate from the rest of Britain. There werewolves can live however they want. That's why Sirius and Remus are there, they were sentenced to live there as a punishment. And they are not homosexual, although it was hinted at in the earlier books the idea was mostly abandoned.

It's most definitely not an INDY Harry fic. It doesn't have a manipulative Dumbledore, OP Harry (though he's pretty bad-ass with time), best friend betrayals, secretly good OWL scores etc.

It's a Harry Potter story that was written with a lot of forethought, but it's obvious that some aspects of it only came out later.
