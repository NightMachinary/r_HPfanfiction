  With Voldemort being a Pagan and indoctrinating Harry.

Whats with the weird obsession with brainwashing and indoctrination in parts of this fandom? The cool part about brainwashing stories is when the brainwashed person breaks out of it (like when Harry realizes that his parents were good people and loved him in canon), not the indoctrination itself, but they rarely get to that part.

I can sorta understand it as a sexual fetish (creating your very own sex slave). Is prince of a dark kingdom slash? What's the non-sexual appeal of fantasizing about someone's mind being warped? Is it for sociopaths?
