Prince of the dark kingdom is not slash. There is very brief mention of 2 OC same sex couples in the background, but nothing other than that.

And "sexual slavery" fetish? I have read some of those types of fics before and this fic is completely outside of that concept that it would be ridiculous to even put it in similar category. There is nothing close to slavery in this fic, it actually goes against all typical tropes of Voldemort torturing and enslaving people mindlessly. Unlike canon where I am not sure why anyone actually follows the guy, Voldemort in this fic is quite a clever, charismatic leader.

I would not say that Voldemort indoctrinated Harry into anything in this fic. Unlike almost all fics with a similar premise, Harry remains entirely good/light at heart and Voldemort does not torture/brainwash or do anything to him. Harry's parents fled to Europe, but died during Harry's late childhood in a robbery so Harry still very much cares for them and knows that they were good people. Even Voldemorts wizarding world is more or less a normal place. A few somewhat questionable laws and rules, but daily life for most people is normal and good.

Some characters like Sirius, even Harry actually are better off in this place. Sirius is part of a werewolf community with Remus where he is respected and rises as a potential clan leader. Harry even visits him occasionally. Much more pleasant than being tortured by dementors in a prison.

Harry does recognize that Voldemort is a sociopath and does not agree with majority of his methods at all. Voldemort mentoring is mostly hands off. He teaches Harry pagan and earth magic and rituals. He sets him up as his protege and gets him into the public eye, but a lot of it is to improve relations with other wizarding communities and his citizens (since Harry is a likable, compassionate guy who becomes known for his saving people thing and for promoting werewolf welfare).

A good quote:

  Help you? Help you what? Turn him into another one of you?"

  "Of course not. There can only be one of me, but I see so much potential for him. He can fulfill the roles I can't... do as easily. I am a conqueror, he is a defender. I lead by the lash, he leads by example. He might yet become my equal, but we shall never be the same."
