Haha, I didn't even notice the similarity. But he isn't like Batman after that. He gets sent to his aunt and uncle where he pretends not know english, but still ends up in similar situation as in canon. Then he does accidental magic and gets taken to the wizarding world. One of the more immoral practices in the fic is that magical children get taken from muggles at early age, have their memory changed and get adopted out into wizarding families.

Voldemort is very different from canon, but his character is very consistent with the background that the author presents for him. I don't think I would call him an OC though. Plenty of other popular fics change Harry/main characters to the point where they are nothing like their canon selves and they are not called OC's so I would say that this is similar. I consider it more of a take on what would it be like if he was saner, smarter and more like Tom Riddle than in canon. Also, he has now been ruling for a good 10 years so he could have changed in that time as well.

There is a diary horcrux Tom Riddle around who thinks and acts just like his canon counterpart so the author does seem to understand his character very well.
