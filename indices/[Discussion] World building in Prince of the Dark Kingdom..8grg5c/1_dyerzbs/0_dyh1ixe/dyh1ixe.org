That is true for most of harry potter fanfic though. Very few can actually write 12 year olds. I settle for not having 12 year olds lusting after each other and call it a day.

I mean it's a valid critique, but you can hit almost the whole fandom with it. If that's the only issue with a story, it's a very good story!

Your issues with characterization might be something else, but you don't really give much detail.
