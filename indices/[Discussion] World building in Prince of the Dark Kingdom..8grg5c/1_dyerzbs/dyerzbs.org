It's got good world building, but honestly I think that's really the only thing the story has going for it. Huge parts of it are just such a drag, like pretty much the majority of year 2. And, I found a lot of the characterizations to be outright awful, and the lasting impression I got is that the author just didn't know how to write 12 year olds.
