I gotta disagree with you about the quality. I recently finished PotDK and restarted Sacrifices grom the 4th book and I feel like the writing quality is much higher in Sacrifices. PotDK has core nuanced/complete(?) characters might be a better way to say it but even though Sacrifices goes in hard against Dumbledore and Lily the fact that it was that way from the beginning and is an AU made it acceptable for me at least.
