I'm not dishing Sacrifices out. It's still a staple in the HP fanfic world. But I think that PotDK is just better. It doesn't have as much drama as Sacrifices and the earlier books are way way better.

Also Sacrifices, while extremely detailed, was matched by PotDK in that area while also being less cliched and had more original ideas.
