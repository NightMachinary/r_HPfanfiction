I like PoTDK a lot but it jumped the gun when Dumbledore kidnapped Harry. Author missed a golden opportunity there, by speeding up Harry's retrieval so much. It would have made for some great drama for Voldemort to be unable to retrieve him and Harry to slowly be seduced by Dumbledore's ideas (Stockholm syndrome and so on) and for him to start believing that maybe Voldemort was fucking up Britain instead of fixing it.

Instead Harry was kidnapped and rescued in a period of... two weeks? And basically nothing resulted off it.
