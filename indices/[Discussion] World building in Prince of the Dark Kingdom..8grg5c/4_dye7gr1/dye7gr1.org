Yes, I agree. A sort of controlled world created by Voldemort, not a dystopian world everyone expects him to create, but not a utopia either. And Harry is a Parcelmouth, I have not read this in full, is it explained in later chapters about how he got that ability ? Whether Lily is really descendant of Slytherin. Its very interesting how Harry got into center stage, without he even knowing it, he is a major piece of their plans and one of the most protected one, from all sides.
