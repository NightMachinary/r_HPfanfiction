I don't think it would be the parents choice in that matter, what with wandless magic and obscureals being issues, plus the potential to become a hedge witch/wizard (especially with hermione being an insatiable learner). Likely the issue with the troll was not shared with the parents, partly because hermione isn't the type to share things like that for the good of her parents, but also because the incident is probably part and parcel with the magic world.
