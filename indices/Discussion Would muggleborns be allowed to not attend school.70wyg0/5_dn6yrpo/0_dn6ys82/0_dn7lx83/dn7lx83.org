It was actually linkffn(Harry Potter Without Harry Potter by Nim-the-Lesser) although Hermione ends up tricking her parents into thinking Durmstrang was a muggle boarding school (and tricking Durmstrang into thinking she's a pureblood) so she got an education anyway. If it was up to her parents (and as far as the Ministry knew) she wasn't getting one at all though so it still made me think of the possible consequences.
