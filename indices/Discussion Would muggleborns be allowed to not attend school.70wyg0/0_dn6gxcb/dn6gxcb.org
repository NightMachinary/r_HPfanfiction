That's an interesting question. I know that attending Hogwarts isn't compulsory--Draco's parents were considering Durmstrang--but as to whether a magical child would be able to skip all magical education is a good one. Certainly the Dursleys were going to deny Harry magical education, even though his untrained magic was manifesting all over the place and he was becoming a hazard to them.

I would posit that in the face of possible violation of the statute, a ministry person or Hogwarts official would make attempts to persuade the parents (or the child) to attend Hogwarts (or the magical school of their choice) and if they absolutely chose not to, then the appropriate steps would need to be taken. It's not clear what these steps would be as there is no case in canon for separating a witch or wizard from their magical abilities and simply Obliviating the child from the knowledge that they are magical could cause all sorts of trouble.

I wonder if this situation would be dire enough to use the Imperius curse on the parents--could DD have just Imperiused the Durselys to force them to allow Harry to attend Hogwarts and then Obliviate the knowledge of the curse from them?

Good question!
