There was always the question (Based on the lack of info in cannon HP) of whether Muggleborns who chose not to enter the Magical world would be obliviated and somehow have their magic bound or controlled.

My guess is that school would not be required, however, if you wished to remain in the magical world then some sort of training would be required, either via private tutors or schooling. They simply would not let muggleborns who are untrained magic users run around loose (although I am sure mistakes or lack of oversight could happen).
