If magic could be bounded, why would they use something like Azkaban as a prison?

I would think that some sort of magical education is compulsory, as untrained magic is unpredictable and dangerous, and the statute of secrecy depends on it.

Also, obliviating the Muggleborns who refuse to enter the magical world would do nothing to hide their accidental magic.

My guess is that muggle parents who don't want their child in Hogwarts recieve the visit of someone from the ministry and suddenly change their mind.
