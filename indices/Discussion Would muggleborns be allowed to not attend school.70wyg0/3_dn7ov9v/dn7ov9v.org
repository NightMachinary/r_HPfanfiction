The MoM is technically a Ministry of the British government, so I can imagine part of their purview would include jurisdiction over children who display magical ability. They could say that, for the safety of the child, their family and the SoS, a magical child cannot go untrained and parents refusing to allow their child to attend a school (which doesn't even require school fees to be paid) would be seen as both child neglect and a danger to society.

Imagine a muggle parent saying their kid isn't going to school and they aren't teaching them at home. We don't even let people do that and uneducated muggles can't even blow up their aunts.

As such, rather than the nefarious use of Imperius or Confundus, they may be able to just take the child into child services. At that point they'd have to judge whether it's necessary to use memory charms on the parents in order to maintain the SoS.
