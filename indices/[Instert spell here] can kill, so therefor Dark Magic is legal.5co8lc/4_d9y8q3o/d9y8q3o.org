This reminds me of Harry in my dark Harry fic. He initially jumped on the wagon that anything could kill and therefore Dark Magic is a farce, but he's growing now. (he's pretty much talking about the unforgivables, but same deal) In the future, he's gonna explain it like this:

“Studying and performing the Dark Arts is borderline illegal. Killing with a dark curse or a ‘light' curse has the same effect, but the ‘light' curse could have consequences that we don't see. Maybe it was a Cutting Curse gone astray, maybe it was self-defence. In order to cast the Dark Arts, you have to hate. If I want to kill you, I want to envision you dead -- I have to want to dance on your grave after digging it up and defiling it. Do you understand my point? Death by the Dark Arts instantly convicts you because you cannot fake hatred. In order to cast the Imperius Curse, you must want to control your victim, make them submit to you. To cast the Cruciatus Curse, you must want them to suffer, to scream, and thrash about. To cast the Killing Curse, you must want them dead. None of this can be done half-assed. You must want. Them. Dead.”
