And as for canon, yes for the latter, a tentative yes for the former although people generally don't use the word “Light” to talk about them.

Honestly though, I'm of the belief that for as long as it's consistent and makes sense within the story, any author is free to classify spells however they want; just don't aspire to canon-compliance if you do and it's all fine. Because with much of the lore of the HP world being based on the fact that there's a gaping hole that anyone chooses to fill in a way that makes sense for them, well, AU is probably the way to go (and it is easier to avoid repeating the stations of the canon verbatim if you go AU, since you can instead focus on the different mechanics of magic).
