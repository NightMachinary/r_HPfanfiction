For all we know, it may or may not also be a thing in canon. It's just that nobody ever uses the word “Light” to refer to it, possibly because it's not that but also possibly because it'd simply sound pretentious. I mean, in order to know whether “Light” magic is actually a thing, we'd have to know what is the exact way of classifying a spell as “Dark”, or as a hex, jinx, curse, charm, or whatever. Because it may be that the answer lie there, or it may be that there is no answer whatsoever.

I mean, we know that the classification is not based exclusively on the feelings required to cast, as Sectumsempra does not seem to have that component and yet it's dark as ... something dark.
