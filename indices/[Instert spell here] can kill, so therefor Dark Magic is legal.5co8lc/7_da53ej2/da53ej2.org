Not really and yes, a knife can also kill - yet we allow those (everybody owns at least kitchen knives!)...so yeah, legalize machine guns (it's not like the US had more problems with crime when everybody could buy one!)!

Same for the magic, I can bash someone's head in by levitating them and smashing their head into stuff (don't tell me I don't have to hate them to do it because yes: You have to hate somebody to kill them...unless it's an accident or you are forced to do it!) like the floor or pointy objects....hell you can transfigure somebody into a fish and immobilize them (they would die from drying out and that's worse than Avada Kedavra!)...none of that is dark magic, so yeah legalize it (and teach it to everybody, so that knowing it doesn't give anybody an advantage!)
