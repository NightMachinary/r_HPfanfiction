It's also about the use of a spell.

I can kill someone with a well-aimed diffindo, but I can also save lives, rescue people, or just mess around with it without endangering people. What other use does a spell like Crucio or Avada Kedavra have beside maiming, torturing or killing? We could argue the morality of the Avada Kedavra, or of the Imperius given certain circumstances, but it doesn't take away the fact that these spells cannot be given any other use than harm people.
