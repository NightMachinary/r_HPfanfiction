From how I understand it you don't. It's just that using Petrificus Totalus or Aguamenti on someone (whether or not you succeeded in killing them) isn't illegal. Using one of the three Unforgivables (the only 3 we know are "dark" in canon) on another person is a crime.

It's never stated in the books but I would assume (and I have no evidence to the contrary) that killing with anything would be a life sentece, but casting Avada Kedavra literally can't be used for anything else (on a human anyway), so it's taken as the same as if you succeeded.

Basically: Killing someone, no matter the spell, would probably get you a life sentence.
