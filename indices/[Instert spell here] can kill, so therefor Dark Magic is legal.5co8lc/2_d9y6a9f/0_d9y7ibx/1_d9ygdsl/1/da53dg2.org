Hermione is always getting special treatment. If somebody else would have punched Draco they'd have been in detention and if somebody else would delete his or her parents' memories they'd be thought to be monsters, but it's Hermione, so it's ok :(

Same for her prying into other people's private business (other people would get told "non of your business" but it's Hermione and people don't get to tell her off!)
