No way - Draco Malfoy was not "a good person" (no way in hell!) and he got a great life (except for that short period with the dark lord in power) and he's mean, a bully, an asshole! So it might not be only her (it's just that the fandom seems to think she can do no wrong), but it's only a few characters that can literally get away with murder (more or less)...but in Harry's case you could argue that he was right to cut up Draco (the guy was about to attack him and he wasn't going to use a stunner (wasn't he intoning the killing-curse?)) and in war (after 6th year) the imperius and the cruciatus are OK IMHO (when fighting for your life/way of life against an oppressor then you should use all means at your disposal!)
