  Would you try to talk if your school nemesis points a loaded gun at you? I wouldn't, I'd blast him or her ASAP!

I'd probably freeze. If I were being less panicky, I would run. If I were being heroic, and the gun-pointing came immediately after the person was expounding to themselves about how their leader who wants me dead will shortly want them dead -- well, in that case, I'd at least try to talk.

You'd do no better.
