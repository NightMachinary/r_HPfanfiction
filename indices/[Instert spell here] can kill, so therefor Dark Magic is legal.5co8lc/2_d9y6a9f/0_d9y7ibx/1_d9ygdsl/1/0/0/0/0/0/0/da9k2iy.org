Not really - all of them MAKE DRACO LOOK BAD :) but in war at least the Killing Curse is "only" lethal (and painless as far as we know!)...sorry, I misspoke: The Killing Curse and the Imperius are ok - the Cruciatus is harder (much harder) to justify!

I wouldn't freeze (probably - it could happen, but it's unlikely IMHO)...running from a bullet? Not a great idea, it's always faster than you are!

I might try to talk - or slap the gun away if I am close enough...:(

Would I be a great hero in that situation? No, I might very well end up dead (unless I also had a gun (or a wand if you make this about Harry and Draco) and was willing to shoot first!)
