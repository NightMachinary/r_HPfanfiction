  The Killing Curse and the Imperius are ok - the Cruciatus is harder (much harder) to justify!
#+end_quote

The Cruciatus disables one person for the duration of the casting. It goes through all shields. That is a valuable spell to have on hand in a combat situation, especially in groups: the first person uses the Cruciatus to break the person's shields, and the second uses a stunner to disable them. It should be an option whenever you have a combatant that you might need to capture alive, and you should by default want to capture all combatants alive.

I would be much happier with Aurors who painfully disable combative people than Aurors who kill them. For one thing, if the people they use those spells on live through it, they can testify in court about what happened, so if Aurors overreach, there's a better chance they'll be caught and punished.

So back to the case at hand, Draco is panicking about his service to the Dark Lord -- certain that he'd fail, certain that the Dark Lord would kill him. For a hero, this would have been a perfect time to extend an offer of protection. Harry attacks Draco instead. Draco attempts a nonlethal spell, albeit a highly illegal one. Harry responds with a spell whose function he doesn't know and whose effect would have been lethal had Severus Snape not been on hand to counter it.

They should probably both have been expelled. I'm not sure I would trust someone with magic if they're testing out unknown spells on live humans, and had Draco completed his incantation, the law says he would have gotten a life sentence to Azkaban.

But Draco's response makes sense in context, and it's not a context of "Draco is e-ville!" It's not a /smart/ response, granted, but he was panicking.

As for the gun analogy -- wands are not like guns. Wands can do almost anything. They can block spells. They can create water. They can cause nuisance effects on other students. A person with a wand looking at you in school is nowhere near as threatening as a person with a gun looking at you in school. If you shot first, you would be attacking another student unprovoked.
