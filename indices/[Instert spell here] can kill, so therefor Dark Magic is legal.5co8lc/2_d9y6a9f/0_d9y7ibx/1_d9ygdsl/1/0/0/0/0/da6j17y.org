Even worse, at least the killing curse is QUICK - the cruciatus needs serious hatred and you have to want to cause pain (so yeah: Right there Draco is not a good person - Yes, Harry tried to use it, too but it DIDN'T WORK!)

Would you try to talk if your school nemesis points a loaded gun at you? I wouldn't, I'd blast him or her ASAP!

Still no reason not to fire first (I admit that he could have stunned Draco or used a disarming charm (his fucking signature move and IMHO a damned boring spell!), so it was excessive use of force, but they were at war, so it's not like you need to treat enemy soldiers well (at least not until they have SURRENDERED!))

ps: I don't like Harry either (IMHO he's too lazy and not curious enough - in a world of magic I'd be like Hermione, you bet and I wasn't the best student (I wasn't the worst either!))...I like the IDEA of Harry, not the canon character :) (that's why I love fanfictions where Harry isn't just a damned puppet with the Headmaster pulling the strings...btw. I hate Dumbledore, hell I'd rather live with Grindelwald in charge because at least he's honest about wanting power and not caring about muggles etc.!)
