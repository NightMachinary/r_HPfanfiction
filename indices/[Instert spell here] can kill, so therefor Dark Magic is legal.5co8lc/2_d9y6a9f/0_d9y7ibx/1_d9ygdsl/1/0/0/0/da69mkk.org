  Draco Malfoy was not "a good person"
#+end_quote

Anyone who gets a redemption scene is a good person in Rowling's book, right?

#+begin_quote
  he's mean, a bully, an asshole!
#+end_quote

He's even worse than Harry.

#+begin_quote
  in Harry's case you could argue that he was right to cut up Draco
#+end_quote

Harry fired first. He didn't even try to talk. Also, /nearly killing/ another student should count something.

#+begin_quote
  wasn't he intoning the killing-curse?
#+end_quote

Cruciatus.

  when fighting for your life/way of life against an oppressor then you should use all means at your disposal!

He admitted (in private, he thought) that he couldn't do what Voldemort asked. Once Voldemort thought so as well, he would be dead. Harry overheard. Draco panicked -- if word got out, he would be dead by the end of the week, instead of several weeks or the end of term, for failing the Dark Lord.

Arguably counts as fighting for your life.
