Although that gives us a silly hypothetical question: if someone only cast Avada Kedavra on someone once in their life, it hit and worked but for some bizarre reason the victim is not dead, what would actually be the sentence to the caster?

Because, you know, logic says that they deserve a life sentence because they cast the killing curse at someone, which is evidenced by the dead body ... wait, there's no dead body. I assume it would still result in the same sentence but with a lot of confusion in court, but I think it's something that could be explored for fun (I mean, writing that, not casting the killing curse on people; after all, my name is not Tom).
