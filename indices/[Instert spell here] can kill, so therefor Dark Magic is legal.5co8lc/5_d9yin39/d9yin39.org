  The argument is literally the same argument as "A screwdriver can kill, so let's make machine guns legal."
#+end_quote

Actually, the argument is "Why does it matter if someone was killed by a screwdriver or by a machine gun?". The end result is the same. Similarly, why would it make a difference is someone was murdered by being stabbed with a pen or by being stabbed with a knife? Murder is murder, after all. *The fanfiction argument of "X can kill, so Dark Magic is legal" is so common because its objectively true within canon in literally any situation that doesn't involve the Unforgivables.*

Whether a murder was committed by Fiendfyre or by Incendio is irrelevant. Whether it was Sectumsempra or Diffindo is irrelevant. Whether it is Stupefy or the purple spell Dolohov used in OOTP on Hermione is irrelevant. In canon, all that matters is the end result (the Unforgivable Curses are an exception to the rule). We even see this when Hermione reminds Harry and Ron (and the reader) that Levicorpus was used in GoF to humiliate and horrify muggles. The fact that Levicorpus can be used benevolently doesn't change the fact that the Death Eaters used it maliciously. Scourgify being a regular cleaning spell doesn't change the fact that it was used maliciously against Snape in SWM. Petrificus Totalus (Full Body-Bind Curse) is considered a curse (a term reserved for the worst types of Dark Magic, by JKR's own words), yet when Hermione used it in PS it isn't considered a dark spell but when Draco used it in HBP it is used maliciously. The Ministry uses Obliviate to uphold the Statute of Secrecy yet it doesn't change the fact that Lockhart used it to commit fraud and almost used maliciously against Harry and Ron. If Voldemort killed people using Stupefy (Madam Pomprey was surprised McGonagall was still alive after being hit with several Stupefy so we know it can kill if enough are used or if one Stupefy is strong enough) instead of the Killing Curse, it wouldn't make the murders any less dark.

In fact, the only reason that the three Unforgivable Curses are considered Unforgivable is because they are the ONLY Dark Magic that is outright illegal to use against a human being regardless of the context. There are only three Unforgivable Curses because there are only three spells that are illegal. Fiendfyre and Sectumsempra are not illegal because they are not Unforgivable. Committing murder with Fiendfyre and Sectumsempra is illegal because murder is illegal (and is easily the worst crime both in the HP verse and in reality). If Incendio and Diffindo were used to commit those murders, it would be equally as illegal. Dark Magic is not illegal, however they are (usually) the most efficient tool to commit crimes.

The reason that the Unforgivable Curses are illegal to use against a human being (but are perfectly legal to use against non-humans of decent intelligence like Goblins and Centaurs, as well as being legal to use against any animal or inanimate object) is because in order to cast an Unforgivable, you cannot use righteous emotions. Crucio requires the caster to not just want to hurt the victim, but to take pleasure in making them suffer. Following how the Cruciatus Curse worked, Imperio would require the caster to want to brainwash/enslave the victim while Avada Kedavra would requires the caster to want to commit murder. You can't argue "self-defense" when an Unforgivable Curse is used against another person because in order to cast the spell, the caster must have wanted to torturing, enslaving, murder. You can't accidentally perform a successful casting of an Unforgivable Curse, just like you can't accidentally perform a Patronus.

Horcruxes aren't Unforgivable simply because they are ALREADY illegal. I must emphasize that Horcruxes being illegal is NOT the same as "some Dark Magic is illegal" because in order to even have a Horcrux, the creator needed to murder someone and intentionally create it. So making Horcruxes illegal is literally redundant since murder is already illegal. Murder being illegal basically makes Horcruxes illegal.

Fiendfyre and Sectumsempra aren't illegal because you can use them without requiring dark motives and they can be used in self-defense. Making Fiendfyre an Unforgivable but not every single other fire-based spell too would be hypocritical.

*TL;DR: The three Unforgivable Curses are the ONLY Dark Magic in canon that are illegal. Horcruxes aren't illegal for being Dark Magic, they are illegal because they cannot exist without the creator having murdered someone. All other Dark Magic in canon aside from the Unforgivables are perfectly legal to use in any non-criminal context (i.e. using Incendio to kill someone is murder and thus a crime, but using Incendio to light a fire to cook food is perfectly acceptable).*
