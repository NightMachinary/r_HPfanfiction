I agree with everything except that murder is the worst crime... there are worse things than death. Its why I think the Imperious curse is worse than even the Cruciatus or AK. Imagine, I imperio you to rape your family. Then I imperio you to murder everyone who says a certain phrase. If I am caught, you will have to live with the fact that your family will never want to be around you. You will live with the fact that you murdered hundreds, if not thousands. All because my imperious was strong enough to force you do these things.

It is this I think of when I comprehend Dumbledore's words "There are things worse than death Tom" in OOTP. I can't think of anything worse than what I described... nothing.
