I'm still fond of the idea that magic is all about intent. in linkffn(Amalgum) Harry/Lockhart explain that you could fling an Avada Kedavra at someone, but if you don't want them dead, nothings gonna happen. Same with a Stupor, which can kill if you really want it to (as seen in the Battle of Hogwarts). I really liked that idea.

Therefore a classification for dark magic could be "magic that does nothing if one doesn't intent to do harm". Crucio works only if you hate enough. Being able to cast it effectively is defacto evidence of deep-rooted hatred for a person. One could go along that lane and say that being able to cast an Avada Kedavra (even if it misses) is defacto evidence of your wish to see the person dead.

On the same vein I once looked at Sectumsempra. What exactly is different with this spell compared to a normal Cutter? I fanon-ed that Snape made this curse specifically for his service under the Dark Lord. He didn't really have the wish to kill, so whenever he would try to do so with a Cutter or other spell, he would fail. He knew that and designed a spell that works without intent - which would make Sectumsempra from a simple Cutting Curse into a stroke of genius.
