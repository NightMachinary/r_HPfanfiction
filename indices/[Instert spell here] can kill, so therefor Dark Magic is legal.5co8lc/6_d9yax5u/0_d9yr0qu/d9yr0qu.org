Sectumpsempra for me, was created because Snape wanted a spell that did not need intent but was empowered by it, something that could counter the transfiguration of James Potter, something that if enough intent was pushed into the spell, it would cut through anything. I have a scene in my work, that is Harry reading a journal from James who admits to firing Fiendfyre at Snape, who cuts it in half with a Sectumpsempra.

I think of the Sectumsempra as more than a cutter. In Naruto the Chidori when overcharged can pierce much of anything. Yet the Raikiri is still better. Why? its the same concept. Sectumsempra is capable of doing EVERYTHING that a cutter can, but does it better.
