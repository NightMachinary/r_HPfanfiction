Is it? Tales of Beedle the Bard mention use in general.

  The Cruciatus, Imperius and Avada Kedavra Curses were first classified as Unforgivable in 1717, with the strictest penalties attached to their use.

And while Goblet of Fire mentions only using them against humans, but only with regards to getting life sentence.

â€˜Now ... those three curses -- Avada Kedavra, Imperius and Cruciatus -- are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban.
