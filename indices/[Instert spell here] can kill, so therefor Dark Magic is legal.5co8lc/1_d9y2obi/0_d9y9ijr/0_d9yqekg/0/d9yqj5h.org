You're making a circular argument. You're assuming that a curse being an unforgiveable makes it illegal in general. Except that's the very thing you're trying to prove.

No one is disputing that those three curses constitute a grouping known as "the unforgiveable curses". The issue in question is what the legal status of unforgiveable curses is. And the only information on that legal status is apparently that use on a human is illegal.
