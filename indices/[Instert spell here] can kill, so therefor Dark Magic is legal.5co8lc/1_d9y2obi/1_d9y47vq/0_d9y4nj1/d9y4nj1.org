I think I remember a fanfic where fiendfyre (and other spells like it) was specifically mentioned as not being illegal, under the theory that such spells were self-regulating: if you were able to control using it there wasn't a problem, and if you couldn't control it the fiendfyre would kill you. Not to mention that no one really wants to be the one to arrest the guy playing with fiendfyre...
