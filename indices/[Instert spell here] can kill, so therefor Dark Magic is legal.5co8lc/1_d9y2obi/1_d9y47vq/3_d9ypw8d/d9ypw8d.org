  It isn't stated, but I think there is plenty to suggest it. We only know of three spells that are illegal, but they aren't just illegal they have a special classification. With there being precedent for banning magic I doubt they'd stop at 3 spells when we know things like fiendfyre exist.

That's far reaching interpretation. It's certainly quite possible that there are more banned spells, but we have nothing to support this directly, and even less to support theory about banning wide field of magic.
