The best explanation why dark magic shouldn't be used under any circumstances that I found is that it makes you used to very dark emotions in order to be cast properly. For example, you need to really want to hurt a person to cast a successful Cruciatus, and it can't be righteous anger (as evidenced by OotP when Harry wanted to Crucio Bella). Regularly invoking such dark emotions to use dark magic makes you desensitized to other people's hurts. And that's literally the definition of corrupting your own soul.

Tripping jinks can kill a person, if they stay at the top of the stairs, but the main intention behind the casting would be "to trip" (as well as to kill probably, but it won't help to cast the spell). Therefore people can safely use it for fun in non-lethal circumstances.

That is to say, the only times I've seen this justification in fanfiction, it was used by Voldemort to make Harry go dark and join his side. It is a flimsy defence, but little kids can be impressionable, especially those who don't know a lot about magic or never thought about how different emotions would affect a person, so can't recognize it as a lie.

It can be a good argument if you are trying to convince an 11-year old, but not an older person.
