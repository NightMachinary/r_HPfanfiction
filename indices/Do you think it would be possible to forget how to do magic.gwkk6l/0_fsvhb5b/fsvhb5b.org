Yes, According to Rowling thats what happened to Lockhart.

#+begin_quote
  By the time that he arrived at school, Lockhart's magical skills (once rather good) had become rusty almost beyond repair. The only spell for which he had real ability was the Memory Charm, which he had been using repeatedly for years. His classes quickly became a charade, as he was revealed to be completely inept at everything in which he claimed, in his books, to be expert.
