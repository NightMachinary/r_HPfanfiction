This is what I remember right now. I also loved the Merging, btw.

ABL - Every scene where he goes off Hogwarts with Dumbledore, pretty much.

Realignment - There's this quote, that I'm paraphrasing, where he says to Grindewald mid 3-way duel against him and Dumbledore (all on their own sides) "I've killed immortals before" and it just chills the bones. Also, fantastic fight scenes and new spells, Hell, the first chapter is bonkers.

NMG - Parts of the TWT were nice, and I loved how the 3-war duel between Harry, Dumbledore and Voldemort near the latest chapters went.

HTB - Harry was in France chasing Wormtail and found like 8 DE trying to rape/kidnap a Veela Coven, and lets just say, this scene earns the bloody/gore warning. Also, the final battle between Harry and Tom is really really cool. So is the battle against the giants with Sirius.

HBC - My favourite complete-AU fic combined with elements of one of my favourite book series, Ender's Game. There's 2 scenes that I found to be fucking awesome, one is near the end of the first year (its actually the third school year, but first of the story) during a competition inside the Forest. Also, every single battle is awesome, and there's a lot of them. The other scene is the second Task of the TWT.

TOBWL - Pretty much everything after the halfway mark, where the war begins in earnest for Harry. It has a sad ending though, if you don't want that, don't read.

EOS - Well, this is just a clusterfuck of battles. The ones that I found awesome that come to mind are: The Hogsmead Battle, all Horcruxes battles except the Tree one, which is sad. (they are completely different from canon, both in quantity and defenses and what they are, they are also complete bad-asses) The Battle in Grimwauld Place; both battles in the Forbidden Forest, one after Hogsmead and the other in the 3 latest chapters, the battle in Dublin... Hmm, that all I can remember. Complete with this, it has one of my favourite OC characters and I love the way the romance goes in this fic, and it is quite the focus for it. Remus and Tonks are adorably crazy and funny too.

The Legacy - Harry's wedding day(cmon, you can't say its a spoiler when the description states its a marriage contract fic, which is completely different than the fanon trope, don't think its that usual shebang) and the fight against the Notts, which is Harry against 6 people. It has a lot of innovative magics that Harry and Hermione develop, and cool applications of common magics.

Guess thats it.
