This is pretty damn good. Harry has a lot of power(more than even Voldemort, or Dumbledore), but he would straight up lose to Dumbledore in seconds, because of how experienced he is in the many types of magic. I'm in the middle of it right now, and there was this awesome fight scene between Harry and Dumbledore involving lightning, the cursed fire(I can never spell it right), water, and all sorts. I know from the beginning tone it sounds like a bashing story, but remember this is through the eyes of an angry teenager. It gets so much better by the half way point(sooner maybe) to the point where Harry, and Dumbledore are friendly(actual friendly, not putting up with you friendly) with each other. I don't want to ruin it, but i'd suggest reading it.
