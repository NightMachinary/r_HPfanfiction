Oh yeah, as a note, here's one of my favorite scenes. This comes from The Merging by Shaydrall. Something about this scene always gets me excited lol

Begin Quote:

He walked over to the end of the table and leaned on it, staring down its length. The Ravenclaws nearest to him, who looked to be in one of the younger years, fell silent at once, watching him warily. But he wasn't paying attention to them. Instead, his eyes were focused on the High Table, where the professors were sitting. Most of them were absorbed in their meals, but Professor Dumbledore was watching him closely. Their eyes met, and Harry tilted his head ever so slightly to the side, his expression cold. Dumbledore's eyes narrowed, but he did nothing back, his only action being to place his fork beside his plate and interlock his fingers in front of his face.

"Well, how about that," said Harry to himself, finishing his scan of the staff table. "No Umbridge."

"Of course not, Potter, no one's seen her all day," said one of the older students who was closer to him.

"Brilliant, now I won't get expelled for what I'm about to do," he said cheerfully, pulling out his wand. "Well, I hope not. Exolesco!"

The yellow spell hit the table and spread rapidly, making its way to the other end in less than a second, causing the Ravenclaws to make sounds of surprise. Moments later, the table began creaking ominously, causing quite a few students to jump up from their seats in apprehension. In less than ten seconds, every single Ravenclaw was standing well back from their table, having followed the lead of the others. The table, finally unable to support the weight of all the food and dishes, split down the center lengthwise, dropping every single thing onto the floor on either side of the table with a deafening crash. People all over jumped away to avoid the mess but not all of them were so lucky.

"Harry Potter!" came the astonished shout from Professor McGonagall as she looked on in complete shock. Her voice stilled the shouting that had started among the students around the hall. The crash had brought half the professors to their feet, including his Head of House. "What do you---" But she cut off as Dumbledore held up a hand to silence her, motioning her to sit down. She threw him an incredulous look but obeyed nonetheless. The other professors also sat back down, watching him with varied expressions. Harry made a mental note to thank the Headmaster later. And to stop giving him so much hell.

"Well, now that I've got your attention," began Harry, twirling his wand a few times, "Who took the butterbeer cap necklace?"

There were a few small gasps from his right, most likely his own table, but he kept his attention on the Ravenclaws. His friends from that House were looking at him in utter shock.

"Harry, what's the meaning of this?" came a voice from halfway down the ruined table. Roger Davies. "Why did you just destroy my House's table?"

"A table that seats a bunch of petty thieves really isn't much of a table at all," he said with a scowl, drawing a number of angry retorts from the group of students before him. "SHUT UP!" he shouted, his voice booming out over them, enhanced by his wand. "You all shut the fuck up! I'm done with Ravenclaw right now. I'm not here to talk, just make threats that you'll all bloody well listen to. Now, I'll say it again... Who took the necklace?"

People were looking back at the professors, but they were all focused on Harry and the Ravenclaws, who were becoming even more unsettled now that Flitwick and the other professors weren't defending them at all.

Slowly, a girl stepped out of the crowd about midway down the ruined table. The area around him had long been vacated of Ravenclaws. They were now all at least a third of the way down the hall.

"I---I did," she said in a timid voice.

Harry pointed at the doors. "Go get it," he snapped at her coldly, pointing at the door. "Bring it to me here. Now." The girl quickly ran from the hall, without a second glance.

"So," he continued, as if he hadn't just destroyed a House table and practically held them all at wand point. "I don't know how deep this runs, but it's going to stop now. I'm disgusted by the lot of you. The ones who have been actually taking her things, her homework, her clothing, her personal things... don't let me find out who you are. The rest of you are just as bad. I know you all know what I'm talking about, and the fact that it's still happening means you just let it go. Fucking ridiculous. This is our home!" he spat at them.

Silence followed this. Ravenclaw was being crushed under the collective intense stares from everyone else in the hall, not a single one made a sound. The Houses at Hogwarts were more than just names to a handful of groups of kids. Each House was a self contained family that failed and succeeded as one. Like any family there they all had their internal problems, but it was base treachery to go against one another like that. Well, sure there were the bad eggs like Malfoy who would back stab his own mother, but for an entire House to let one of its own suffer like that was just flat out cruelty, and not something easily forgiven. To him it was purely unacceptable.

One of the reasons he'd never forgotten how Gryffindor had taken to his being a Parselmouth.

Just then the girl from earlier re-entered the Great Hall, completely out of breath, a familiar necklace clutched in her hand.

"Sorry," she mumbled, aware that all eyes were now on her. She pushed the necklace into his hands and ran back into the group.

Harry merely turned and walked back to the doors, stopping before he crossed the threshold.

"Every single thing that's been taken. Return it tonight, or else. If this ever happens again, I'll personally remove Ravenclaw Tower from this castle. See if I won't."

The doors closed behind him sharply, causing many to let go of the breaths they had been holding. What on earth---

"And five fucking thousand points from Ravenclaw!"

Which was followed by an explosion of metal, wood, and glass that could be felt through their seats.
