I want to be the very best, Like no one ever was. To catch them is my real test, To find them is my cause.

I will travel across the land, Searching far and wide. Each Horcrux-mort to understand The power that's inside

It's you and me I know it's my destiny

Voldemort!

You're my best friend And a world we must defend Voldemort!

A heart so true Our magic will pull us through You teach me and I'll teach you Voldemort...
