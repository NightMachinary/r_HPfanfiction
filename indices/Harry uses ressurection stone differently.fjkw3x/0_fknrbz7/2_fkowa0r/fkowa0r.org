I like the original prompt, but I would read the poo out of this one! Or over time ghostie Voldemort (Ghostemort?) is affected by the non-tainted soul it's attached to and over time he wants Potter to do better for personal development, that is the power he knows not. By the time he and Harry can create a body, that soul piece is on the 'light' side so Ghostemort helps Harry with the horcruxes and battle Voldemort. With Ghostemort being the last remaining piece, but good, he lives his life out as a normal auror or something and dies of normal causes like blowing up a potion or something at the age of 89.
