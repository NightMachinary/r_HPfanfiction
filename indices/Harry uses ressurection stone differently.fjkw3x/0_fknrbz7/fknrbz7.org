Ooohh that is really cool. I never thought of it. Or alternatively imagine Harry getting his hands on the stone without Dumbledores knowledge and Harry plays with it and accidentally summons the soul piece of his head thus gaining a confused (The-night-I-wanted-to-kill-Harry-Potter) Voldemort as a ghostly companion. Just imagine this Voldemort trying to get Harry to be really good in school and stuff after he notices no one but Harry can see him, so that he can manipulate Harry into building him a body or so.
