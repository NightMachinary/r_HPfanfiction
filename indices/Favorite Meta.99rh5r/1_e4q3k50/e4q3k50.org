I honestly tried, but it doesn't matter if in support of a ship I like ( Harry/Hermione) or one I dislike (Ron/Hermione), I don't find them very enjoyable to read. Usually the author makes one or two good points but then goes off the deep end and pulls out some absurd argumentation which reflects badly on the whole thing. Usually that point revolves around bashing someone instead of just calmly laying out the facts.

It's even worse in the A song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones fandom, where every blade of grass is used as base for absurd theories like time traveling unborn children.

Don't get me wrong, I like a good discussion about any work, but those ten page long walls of text aren't really my thing. I prefer a discussion centered approach like in this sub.
