I enjoy [[http://www.sugarquill.net/index.php?action=gringotts&st=hglovered][this essay]] on Harry and Ginny.

I'm pretty sure I read the Fred and George one as well. It was really good. I always see George as the inventor and Fred as the funny man that came up with the ideas. I see Ron as filling this role after Fred's death when working in the joke shop.

Edit: Pretty sure [[https://hp-companion.com/essays/fredgeorge/][this]] is it, it's a great analysis
