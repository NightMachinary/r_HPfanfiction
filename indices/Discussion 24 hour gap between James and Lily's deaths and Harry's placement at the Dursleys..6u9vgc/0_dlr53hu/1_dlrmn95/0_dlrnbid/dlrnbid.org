So are Dumbledore, Hagrid and McGonagall. This all happened on Halloween, which is a big party night at the school when there isn't a war on. Albus sends Pomfrey to her home with instructions to receive Hagrid and treat whomever is with him, leaving any others outside and telling no one of their location. He does this because keeping a secret at Hogwarts is an exercise in futility, so bringing Harry there wouldn't be safe.
