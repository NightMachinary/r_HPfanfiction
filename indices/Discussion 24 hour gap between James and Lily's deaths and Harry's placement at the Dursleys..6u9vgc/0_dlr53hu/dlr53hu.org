It's a hole but it's easily filled.

In my head-canon, Dumbledore detected the situation at the Potter's house in Godric's Hollow mere minutes after Voldemort killed Lily. Albus sent Hagrid to the Dumbledore family house in the village via the Floo with orders to sneak over and see what's what.

Hagrid did so, found Harry and then encountered Sirius, who had come when his own tricks revealed that his friends were exposed and/or dead. Sirius gave over his bike to Hagrid and then changed into Padfoot so that he could track down Wormtail.

Hagrid returned to Dumbledore's house and floo-called to tell him who survived, and he was directed to fly Harry to Madame Pomfrey's house in Swansea. Dumbledore then sent Pomfrey home from Hogwarts to check Harry over (as they couldn't trust St. Mungos to be safe and bringing Harry to Hogwarts would take hours since sending him through the Floo or Apparating might harm him) while Dumbledore headed to the scene to investigate. Barely an hour had passed since the Potters died.

Hagrid, bored at Pomfreys but ordered to stay at hand with the cycle, starts chatting with other Order members via the Floo. Pomfrey is called by Dumbledore from his house, because he has detected an unusual protection from around the remains of Harry's crib. Pomfrey is ordered to keep him safe for the day while Dumbledore figures out how to leverage this.

Hagrid, still bored and listening in, called back his gossip friends to update them about Dumbledore's findings- 'Harry killed Voldemort, uh huh!'

Albus came up with a possible solution, but found that there weren't many Evans' left alive for some reason. He ordered McGonagall to Surrey to check out his best prospect.

About here is when Albus started getting inundated with Floo calls from various and sundry, asking for info on Harry vs. Voldemort. He spent what time he wasn't researching blood-based protections doing spin control over everything that Hagrid was heard to say (and given Hagrid's accent, much misinterpretation was at play).

That evening Albus arranged for Hagrid to deliver Harry to the Dursleys, meeting McGonagall there to confirm that they are Lily's family and not cannibal serial-killers. The letter was the keystone of sustaining Harry's protection, and it relied on Petunia accepting the role of substitute parent and host. She did, and the rest is history.
