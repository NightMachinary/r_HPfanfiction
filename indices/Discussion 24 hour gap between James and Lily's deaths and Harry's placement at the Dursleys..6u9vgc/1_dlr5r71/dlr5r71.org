I've thought about this recently, as I actually just reread book 1 this week. This is pretty much the oldest and most well-known plothole. There's no way it should take ~24 hours for Hagrid to fly 300 miles with a flying motorbike. Similar, it's implied that Dumbledore /walked/ to Privet drive, as he mentions that he passed by "dozens of feasts and parties on his way there", which doesn't make sense.

I mean, I can imagine it taking some time for Dumbledore to get whatever paperwork is necessary to place Harry at the Dursley's, as much as is necessary for the Ministry, because the Ministry does know that Harry is living there, judging by Fudge's reaction in book 3.

Explaining the travel times is a lot harder. Perhaps Hagrid flying in the air for a whole day was done on purpose - Hagrid being mobile while Dumbledore sets up the magical protection at the Dursleys so it would be harder for Death Eaters to get revenge on Harrys. It's better to keep moving.

As for Dumbledore, that one's a bit harder to explain. You'd have to interpret his words in some oblique manner. We know that when someone floos, you pass by other stop-off points. So, Dumbledore has never been to Surrey before, and you can't really apparate to somewhere you've never been. So perhaps Dumbledore does whatever business he does during the day, and when he floo's over to the nearest floo near Surrey, he passes by a bunch of grates that all have wizards and witch's celebrating on the other side. That would assume that you actually have enough time to see what is on the other side of the floo as you're passing by, which is a possibility I guess.

The other option is that Dumbledore rode a broom over. Perhaps there were no floos nearby, which is a possibility. But if there were no floos, would there really be the opportunity for Dumbledore to pass by dozens of feasts and parties? We have to assume that those are witches and wizards holding parties, because muggles were clueless about anything going down.

We also have to factor in the possibility that Dumbledore followed a similar path to Hagrid. If we assume Hagrid was simply buying time, waiting for Dumbledore, then perhaps when Dumbledore said that he "passed dozens of feasts and parties on his way here", that he didn't go there in a straight line. Being the immediate aftermath of Voldemort's disappearance, Dumbledore would no doubt be extremely busy. Perhaps that meant he was going all over the countryside, so perhaps you can't actually interpret "on the way here" as a straight line, and that he just saw feasts and parties on every stop he made, wherever it was he was going. Perhaps he would be personally dealing with a lot of immediate fallout, and getting Harry settled wouldn't necessarily be priority number one.

Anyways, I like I said, I have reread book 1 within the last three days, and it's made clear more than ever that numbers is not JKR's strong point. The point that stuck out most to me is when Percy is offended that Dumbledore didn't tell "us prefects" about the forbidden third floor corridor, when Percy is a new prefect and there was really no actual opportunity for Dumbledore to have told them that doesn't involve Dumbledore writing about it in a letter to 24 different people, or making an appearance on the Hogwarts Express before the sorting feast. Both of which seem highly unlikely.
