No, Dumbledore still sends Harry to Petunia. This is a post-war story and Harry finds out that he had an Aunt he never knew about who died leaving two small babies behind. He wants to claim them as they are FAMILY but to do that he has to be married as child services won't give them to an unmarried young male.
