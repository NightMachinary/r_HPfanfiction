True enough with your second point, it just rubbed me the wrong way with all the other bullshit that had happened.

And then later on she has the nerve to go to him for advice and talks to him about her sex life with Scorpius and I'm just like "WHAT."

I don't think she's a complex character. In this story, I think she's truly just a bitch. She doesn't care what she's done to the family, what she's done to Harry, all she cares about is how she's the laughingstock of the wizarding world and how everyone in her life hates her. She's not taking responsibility in the slightest, but just wants to be comforted by the man she betrayed.

what the fuck
