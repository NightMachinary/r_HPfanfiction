I'm a big H/G shipper so plots like this are just something I'll never enjoy. But the basic premise is pretty damn unrealistic to begin with. While I believe the couple work very well together, I could easily see a scenario or story where Ginny leaves Harry because she is an independent woman who speaks her mind and wouldn't put up with whatever Harry would do the make her want to leave. But Ginny wouldn't cheat. If we assume there is dissatisfaction in her marriage (which is a common reason people cheat), she would let Harry know and if nothing changes, then leave. She wouldn't betray Harry, the guy who has had a really crappy life before finding Ginny. There are a handful of characters that I just cannot for the life of me imagining cheating, and Harry and Ginny are both at the top of that list. For nothing else, cheating is a cowardly thing to do and neither are cowards. Remember Ginny didn't even cheat on Dean when she clearly started to realize Harry liked her in her 6th year.
