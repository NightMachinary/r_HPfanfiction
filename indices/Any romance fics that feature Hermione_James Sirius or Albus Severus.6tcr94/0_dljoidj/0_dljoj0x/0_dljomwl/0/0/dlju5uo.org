Yeah, that was a bit weird and when Harry's a little hard on Scorpius during Auror training when in all honesty Scorpius deserved worse, she's all "Can you please try to be an adult?" as if they both didn't hurt virtually everyone in their lives with their relationship and here she's calling out someone else for being unreasonable. O.o

  Then she insists on a divorce even when Harry says he's willing to work it out.

I can't really fault her for this. I mean she had fallen in love with Scorpius and staying in that marriage would have been a lie. She was willing to take responsibility for it by divorcing. It did feel weird that she was forgiven so quickly but overall I liked the story. It would have been too easy to make Ginny some kind of pedophilic pervert but she was more complex than that, still wrong, but not a total bitch.
