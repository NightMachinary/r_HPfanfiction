This fic almost produced a visceral reaction me, goddamn. I haven't read one that's made me nearly as pissed off in a long time. Ginny cheats on Harry, gets mad at Harry when he finds out and says "Don't patronize me" and then Harry basically takes it like a spineless idiot.

Not only did she cheat on him, which is one of the worst things you can do in a marriage, but she cheated on him with her son's best friend. That's like a double whammy. Not only did she betray her husband, she betrayed her son. Then she insists on a divorce even when Harry says he's willing to work it out.

And everything turns out happy in the end with her still in the family smiling in a family photo. Fucking bullshit.
