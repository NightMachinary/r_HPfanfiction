I enjoyed a few Snape/Hermione ones. Google "Chaos is Come Again" (it's own site), "Cloak of Courage", "Chasing the Sun"

These are pretty good - unfortunately back when I was really into that genre, I didn't think to back up and save the ones that I really loved and can't even remember what they were.

Also - not a marriage law fic, but a heavy focus on Hermione/Draco without getting mushy - "Parade of the Sun".

Edit: found more in my archives, these should all be on FFN
