A couple involving Harry are a bit tongue-in-cheek:

Luan Mao's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9076277/1/Unfortunately-Unbreakable][Unfortunately Unbreakable]] involves a forced marriage on Harry and Pansy. It has a bit of a crackfic tone (like many marriage law stories).

Another is Draco664's [[http://draco664.fanficauthors.net/The_Widower_Maker/The_Widower_Maker/][The Widower Maker]], in which Harry is forced to marry (and marry, and marry...)

Edit: S'TarKan (of /Nightmares of Futures Past/ fame) also wrote on titled [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2612901/1/There-s-Always-a-Way][There's Always a Way]], but it's been ages since I read it and I don't recall if it's very good.
