I'd probably throw in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series as well, because the lack of a war has changed the whole political landscape. Even though there are some plot elements that are recognisably inspired by canon, they're just that: a recognisable canon element incorporated into a world that is very different at its core. Tom Riddle is alive and well and has quite different (albeit still villainous) goals, but no Horcruxes. Harry was raised by her parents; all the Marauders are alive, and both James Potter and Sirius Black are (necessarily) active in politics. There's quite a bit of exploration of class consciousness and the treatment of the slums. It's really a whole new story.
