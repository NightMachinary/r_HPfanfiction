I mean if you want to write *massively AU* fics, you may want to get rid of MOST canon stations, including the PS shenanigan.

Here are some examples that I consider *massively AU*:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]]: James and Potter got Voldemort that night with a nasty trap. They burnt down their own house, faked their deaths, and fled Britain altogether. As a result, Harry was raised by his loving parents and never went to Hogwarts. But that doesn't mean he turns out to be a nice guy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]]: Lucius Malfoy won through a daring maneuver after Halloween 1981, and Dumbledore had to flee for France with his remaining followers. Harry was raised by Sirius there and went to Beauxbaton with the Weasleys. But they would have their revenge 18 years later.

[[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/1087368][There is Nothing to Fear series]] features a Gryffindor Tom Riddle. Needless to say, things are SIGNIFICANTLY different in this universe.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]]: Harry is blind and can't go to Hogwarts. He's soon joined by a badly crippled Hermione in his special education school. PS and CoS events do still happen in this fic, but nothing after Year 3 is the same. Similarly, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]] still let PS and CoS happen with significant changes. But it's Petunia, Sirius, Bill, and Fleur who did the heavy lifting against Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate]] features a better Gilderoy Lockhart who gets to raise Harry. PS and CoS happened with significant alterations, and the plot is mostly resolved by then.
