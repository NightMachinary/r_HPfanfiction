I did think it was quite short. I have a lot of free time on my hands, so I wouldn't be adverse to spending a lot more time on the individual chapters.

How much of a word count would you like for each chapter? I was thinking maybe 5-10k, as I think anything above that may be above my ability to detail. Never been very good with the detail.
