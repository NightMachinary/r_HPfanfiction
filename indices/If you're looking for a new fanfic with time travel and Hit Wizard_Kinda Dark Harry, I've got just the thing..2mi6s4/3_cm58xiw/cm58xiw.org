I don't like the immoral, apolitical, only-guided-by-money henchmen/mercenary/assassin archetype. It's too cliche because either they don't grow as a character at all, or they grow towards the good, law abiding side. It's pretty much guaranteed, and the fact that it's overdone in professional fiction makes me not want to read it in an amateur fic. That's not to say that this isn't a good story, because it looks well written, but I just can't enjoy reading it.
