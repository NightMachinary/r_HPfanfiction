The Hufflepuff conspiracy is actually a recurring joke in many stories, I remember one in which Harry went into Hufflepuff (while being the archetypal baby dark lord -the type that becomes “evil” because he thinks it's sounds cool and ends just coming off as sort of cute) and asked Quirrel for help in buying Ron's soul in exchange for a card, from there Voldemort ran off with the fact and came to the conclusion that Hufflepuff alumni were the power behind the throne.
