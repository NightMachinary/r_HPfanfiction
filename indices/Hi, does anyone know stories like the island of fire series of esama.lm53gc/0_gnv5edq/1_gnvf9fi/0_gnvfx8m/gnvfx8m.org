Enjoy. I think there's a couple more, but I haven't been able to find them - one is a time travel fic about the 'Nightshade Family' where Harry runs a village (I think with Bellatrix?). The other had Harry accidentally creating a place to go (either an Island or something with the Indy!Harry Trunk-Spaces) and getting half of Hogwarts wanting to go with him and helping out.
