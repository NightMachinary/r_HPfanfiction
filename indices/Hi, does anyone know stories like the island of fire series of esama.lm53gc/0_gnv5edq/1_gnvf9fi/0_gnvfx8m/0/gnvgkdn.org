Sounds cool, will search for those eventually, the second one seems familiar though, is it the one where Susan and Hannah (easily) convince Harry to create his own island nation and everyone around loves the non-interference politic idea so they jump on the boat the second the third task ends? If I am not mistaken there was also a bit of miscommunication with Dumbledore thinking he is teaching Harry to eventually make his island under his supervision after the tournament while Harry thinks he figured out he was already making his own nation and just gave him the spells to help.
