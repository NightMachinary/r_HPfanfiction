  In which I attempt to write the screenplay into a full short story. I have no rights over the characters, plot, or dialogue of this story, which was published as a screenplay based off of an original short story by JK Rowling. I sincerely hope JK Rowling releases Cursed Child as a full story, in which case I shall retire this fan-made version.
