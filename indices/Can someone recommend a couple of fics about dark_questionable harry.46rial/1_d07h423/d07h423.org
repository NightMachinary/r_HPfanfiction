I like dark/grey Harry stories.

*Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(10677106): it's really Harrymort, and he managed to corrupt both Hermione and Ginny. But the story itself is already a classic!

*Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005): H/Hr. Hermione is really the ruthless one here, but Harry nevertheless supports her 100%.

*Hail Odysseus*, linkffn(10645463): Slytherin Harry and Ginny fight against almost everyone, very unconventional ending.

*Emperor*, linkffn(5904185): Harry is pretty much a dark lord here as he is willing to sacrifice countless lives to achieve his ambition.

Time traveling Harry is often much darker than in canon, usually as a result of suffering a lot more:

In *Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always*, linkffn(4101650), the Azkaban execution scene was quite memorable.

In *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), he threw fiendfyre and imperious curse at will.

In *Returning to Start*, linkffn(10687059), he killed so many that it took several years for Hermione to love him again.

Then there is the *Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650). The author has done some thing very audacious, and the story has taken an extremely dark turn. It's still WIP, and I'm very curious in knowing How Harry will respond to this new development.
