I'm going to include Descent into Darkness by Athey.

Sorry - I don't know how to do spoiler blocks so...

It's well written but... It has one really, really horrible scene where dark magic is used to torture and kill someone, and then a little later Voldemort's philosophy is explained as being the solution to /saving/ muggles.

The cognitive dissonance is unbelievable. Plus there's totally unnecessary slash.

But it's still worth reading.
