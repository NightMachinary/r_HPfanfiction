I dive in, after stewing on it for a few days, move the starting point several times, then eventually get overwhelmed with all the ideas going on in my head and start making notes, then they make no sense, so I start writing a proper timeline outline, and then I pants it from there. I'm definitely more of a pantser than a planner, but I will eventually plan and I tend to write out character profiles with important information that I probably should not forget.. then I lose my character profiles and randomly find them one day a year later, covered in dust, hiding under my bed in the exact spot I looked originally.
