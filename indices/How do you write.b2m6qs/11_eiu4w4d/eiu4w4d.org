I generally get an idea I think would be cool, search for it, promptly find that nobody has done what I was thinking of, and decide to do it myself. This leads to a basic summary of said idea.

I then spend the next five months writing random bits of world-building down before actually getting anywhere.

I am not a particularly great writer.
