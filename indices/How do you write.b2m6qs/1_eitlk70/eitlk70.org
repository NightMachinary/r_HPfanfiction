Generally, I come up with a concept, then I chose a character who I feel would be the best view point for that concept. If that character isn't someone I've written before, I take a bit of time to do some research on either their direct history according to canon (I basically only write historical fiction so...) or literature they would be most likely exposed to so I have a strong voice in which to cast the story I want to convey. (Narrative voice, tone and immersion are hugely important to me as a reader so I prioritize those facets as a writer

Then I write until I come to a point where I need to do more research or I hit a snag. When I hit a snag, I usually go back and read through all the work I've amassed, edit, revise and come back at it for another pass.

I tend to spend a lot of time going back to research materials, checking dates, and looking into cultural studies of the time/place of the setting to keep both my narrative voice and my details consistent and historically accurate and I never finished with the first draft. Even if I post it looking for feed back/to keep it all in one place. I also tend to bounce a lot of ideas off my wife, who's the only beta patient enough to work with me lmao.
