Personally, I work out a rough list-of-things-I-want-to-happen-at-some-point, decide on an ending, and then just start writing. Having anything more detailed than that depresses me and stifles my creativity. But I know there are some people who are the exact reverse; I'm afraid you're just going to have to try both ways and see what works best for /you/.
