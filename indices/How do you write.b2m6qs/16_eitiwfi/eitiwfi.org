I think it's probably better to outline things first.

It doesn't have to be overly detailed, but having a good idea of where you want your story to end up will prevent word bloat or writing yourself into a corner and then abandoning.

Also be aware that the first thing your write will probably suck. The first ten things you right might suck. That's how it feels for me, at least.

Getting down to the technical details: I usually will jot down ideas/plot outlines with pen and paper in a journal. Then when I'm home, I will type the actual story into a google doc.
