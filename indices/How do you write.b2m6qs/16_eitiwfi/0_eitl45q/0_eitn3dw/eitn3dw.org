I don't think you have to have the final scene explicitely planned out, but I do believe that you should have an idea about the climactic moment in the story. Not fully formed -- that will come when you actually sit down to write it -- but you should know what you're building towards.

So whether the story ends up with a big battle or some confrontation between Harry and Professor Sprout or whatever it is, I think you should know what your characters are working towards.
