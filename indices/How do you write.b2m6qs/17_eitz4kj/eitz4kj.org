I get random bursts of inspirations for random OC characters (like the daughter of Queenie and Jacob, without taking Crimes of Grindelwald in account). I write as much as I can then lose interest, Then I drop that story and focus on something easier like a story about an OC that ends up with Charlie Weasley or something similar.

I also find post Hogwarts stories easier to write than Hogwarts stories.
