First off, research from pottermore and other things from the books,just the movies or both. Write the facts down, making sure those facts that you are using can go in your story. Some people like to see some facts from the resources.

Make a page or more what kind of character you are using or making a character. Make a list of the character biography, skills, power, family and other things. To help understand more of the character background. Like a example: the character is a pureblood....

Make a pro/con list to help out.

Then make a rough draft of your story. Make notes on it also to help out to add more or cross some things off.

Then make the story.

That's how I do it.

Just my pet peeve: a lot of people whom make a story, that they don't care about the facts from pottermore or other resources. That make their story no sense.
