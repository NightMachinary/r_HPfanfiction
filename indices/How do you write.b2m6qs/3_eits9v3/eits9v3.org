Honestly, the best way for me is a conversation with my co-writer or even a friend willing to let me ramble for a few hours. Then that becomes a planning document. After a while, that planning document evolves into a folder. I find myself scribbling notes to myself to add to the folder.

If the fic gets big enough (not unlike ren, my big labour of love), then you can end up with a folder with several sub folders which have folders. If you were to look in there, you'd find our canons for each order member, death eater and death adjacent person, the black family along with solidified dates and circumstances, notes on relationships and sexuality, half written snippets, several plot documents and one-shot ideas, a couple of maps I've drawn and a canon timeline vs our timeline.

Then I stick on a characters playlist (depends whose pov it is) on spotify, open up the pertinent docs (i.e. if we're at Lucretia's house, where does she live?), open up the books to check on speech patterns if I'm uneasy about the characterisation or if I need to fact check something is canon not fanon and start.

Usually, a doc with c-whatever-the-number-is is set up, I check the plot doc for the next set of scenes that either go together (like a single event) or just the next 3-6 depending on what needs to be covered and set up dividers between each scene with a bullet point at the top saying what the goal of the scene is, sometimes with notes like 'then sirius can just react like the drama queen you know he'll be and everything will be terrible'. If it's a chapter following on, I usually also read the previous chapter to regain momentum and read the comments over for a nice pick-me-up when motivation is a struggle.
