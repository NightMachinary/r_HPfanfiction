That's always nice to hear! The folders look ridiculous (the timeline goes up to July and we're in November, for example) but we have a shared instrumental list which is good background for writing in general, no accidental lyric inputs.

Otherwise, the music is just what I think the characters would listen to (Sirius has Clash, the Jam, Queen, some Bowie and Bolan, maybe some Stones vs Emmeline is the Carpenters, the New Seekers, Dusty Springfield, some Beautiful South vs Remus who's more Kinks, Animals, Troggs, Who) which just really centres the mindset. Writing different POVs was never the plan, so having something to help stimulate the shift in viewpoint that feels tangible helps with the thinking pattern/vocal shift for me.
