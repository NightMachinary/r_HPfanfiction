I start with a bunch of fragmented ideas written down at random times and try to figure out, at least in general terms, of what I want to happen and in what order. Makes it easier to have some kind of an outline to follow. Nothing detailed, though, just bullet points.

Then I write the scenes I have a clear picture of in my mind, regardless of order, and figure out (or not) how to connect them later. Beats struggling to come up with what feels like filler when writing strictly chronologically.
