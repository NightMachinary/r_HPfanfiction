I used to have a great idea and start writing everything right away. I'd handwrite the story on looseleaf and have a nebulous idea for how everything would run down, but I currently have a graveyard of abandoned stories to testify how that panned out.

Nowadays, I have started to make drafts and documents setting up the characters, the chapter by chapter summaries, plot, and other ideas I may have. It's best for me this way, so that I wouldn't forget to bring up subtle and important plot points and I keep the characters in character. It also will help if you ever hit a writer's block as well. You'll have everything set up so you can pick up where you left off. That's not to say it has to be permanent (leave yourself room for growth and change) but it should have a place on the drawing board.

I'd also suggest writing up multiple chapters at a time. if possible, complete your story a quarter or halfway through before posting. It'll help you stay on schedule and take the edge off staying on top of everything.

Good luck!
