For me, things I need to write a story are the characters I want to write, a beginning, an ending, a certain kind of mood/feel I want the entire story to have, and it goes on from there. I usually spend a while developing the story through a chapter-by-chapter outline, while making lots of notes on backstory/worldbuilding/etc., and then I alternate between writing the scenes for the chapters and thinking about the plot/changing the outline. The mood/feel is very important to me, because it helps me figure out how plot events should happen, and what kind of journey it should take to reach the end.

An example of a 'mood/feel' would be 'exhausted and uncertain but fighting for happiness'. Maybe someone would call it an 'emotional theme'? Anyway, it has to be an inspirational feeling, because chasing after this feeling and seeing it through to the ending is a long process, and anything short of inspirational and important to me means I write a story and abandon it halfway. Thought I'd chime in with a slightly different process.
