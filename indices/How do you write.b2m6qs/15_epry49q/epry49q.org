I like to think about my characters first. What would I like to see the characters transform into/be in certain situations ? Do I want Hermione to be a badass mf or Harry to pick up smoking etc etc. Then I bulk up my stories with 'why?'

I wrote a whole post-Hogwarts story about war trauma/ptsd that came from the idea of wanting a three way in a story ðŸ˜‚ The first thing I asked myself was 'how would they end up in this situation?' 'what are believable circumstances that a normal non-wizard could find themselves here?'

I also find making notes about the characters very helpful to refer to if I want them in a new situation.

For example:

Hermione: - strong, independent - started S.P.E.W. at the Ministry at 23 (driven) - working on getting over her fear of flying (flying lessons with Harry on Tuesdays/Thursdays) - xx years old (Sept 19 1979) - close with Harry - Molly pushed her away after she and Ron broke up

Then I write the fun stuff first, like action, confrontation or sex scenes first. Let it rest for a bit then add filler chapters between the good stuff. I also have a friend and my husband who will proof read it. Then I'll read it about 10 times. If by the end, I want to read another story like it, I find that a success and upload! (I also write it all before releasing it, not chapter by chapter so my readers have the enjoyment of getting one new chapter per day and I don't feel pressured to throw something together)

I hope this helps a bit! :)
