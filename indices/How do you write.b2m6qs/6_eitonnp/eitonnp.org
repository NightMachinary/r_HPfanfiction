I write on scrivner, which allows me to write out of order and piece together down the line. I need that, because I can write internal monologue for days but cannot write action to save my life. So I do what comes easy, plan the rest, and hope one day it actually flows.

For each WIP, I use a Google doc to store snippets of dialogue, ideas, concepts, timeline notes, character points, revisions I need to make, etc., and keep a second reference doc for character notes that I pull from canon; things like tics (e.g., tends to drop things when surprised) and Rowling's dialogue tags, queen abuser of adverbs that she is.

When I have an idea for something, I also read the hell out of actual novels from the relevant genre and highlight like there's no tomorrow. Couple weeks back, my brain decided 2 AM was a good time to drop a horror story into place, and by the next day, I'd downloaded everything from Haunting of Hill House to The Turning of the Screw. I think it helps your writing and you'd be surprised what you can pick up from osmosis, hah.
