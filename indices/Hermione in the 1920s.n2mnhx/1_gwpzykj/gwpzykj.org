Time travel has easily become my favourite genre this past year, so the more the merrier! I would highly recommend you read Birds of a Feather by babylonsheep. Not strictly a time travel one, but one in which Hermione is born back in Tom Riddle's day and they grow up together. It absolutely takes the cake in historial accuracy (even the dialogue is era appropriate!!) so would highly recommend you check that out to see how to pull off such a historical setting well.
