That pretty much sums up /By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept./ Petunia unleashes her inner Karen, gets free of Vernon, and takes the wizarding world by storm.

I resisted it for a while, because I didn't think I liked Petunia stories. But I was wrong. It hasn't been updated in a while, but it's such a fun read that I didn't mind. And the author has returned after previous long gaps, so I wouldn't be shocked if it resumes.
