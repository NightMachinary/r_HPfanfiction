I absolutely agree. When the author does a good job writing hermione she can be an awesome character, but most just go full out hermione Addict mode and write her so poorly and then get upset when someone says something bad about the writing of her character,r even when given as constructive criticism in the comments.

I adore well written fics where hermione is as interesting a character as she has the potential to be, but as you said, most just don't get it right
