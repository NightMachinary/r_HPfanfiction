In fanfiction, Hermione is regarded as the smartest witch, the most loyal, the only one to figure things out, the one that all the guys want, and someone who never seems to face consequences when she breaks the rules/law, because it is for 'the greater good' I love book Hermione but fanfiction has raised her on an unattainable pedestal that she doesnt deserve. Book Hermione had real flaws that made her a well rounded character.
