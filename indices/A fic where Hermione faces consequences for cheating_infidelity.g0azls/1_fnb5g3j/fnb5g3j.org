All right, I sort of understand where you're coming from. However, in basically every fic of this kind I've seen, her relationship with Ron is over by the time she's dating someone else. I've personally never been a fan of Dramione, and my feelings on both HPHG and SSHG are "eh, I guess they can work sometimes". But my issues aren't the infidelity, because there usually isn't any.

IMO a much better target for something like this is Lily, who usually gets a pass for the occasional infidelity with Severus (in Severitus fics) for typically very weak reasons.

However, while fics basically never portray Hermione as unfaithful, she does get a pass for dubious activities -- take the Avis+Oppungo combination in HBP, for example.
