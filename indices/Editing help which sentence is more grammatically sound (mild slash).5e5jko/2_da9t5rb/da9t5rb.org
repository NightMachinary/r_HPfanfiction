I personally would take out the sentence after "stood" in the first one. "as they stood entwined on the balcony".

Does that make sense?

Alternately, in the second one, I would move "entwined" after stood. So it would read "they stood entwined on the balcony."

But, that might be more stylistic than grammatically correct.
