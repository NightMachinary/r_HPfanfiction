#+begin_quote
  Snape pulled Palpatine into his arms, kissing him gently as they stood, entwined on the balcony.
#+end_quote

This sort of formation lets you remove the phrase between commas while keeping the meaning of the sentence the same:

#+begin_quote
  Snape pulled Palpatine into his arms, entwined on the balcony.
#+end_quote

Snape is entwined on the balcony while he pulls Palpatine into his arms. Not what you were going for.

Omit the second comma and you have:

#+begin_quote
  Snape pulled Palpatine into his arms, kissing him gently as they stood entwined on the balcony
#+end_quote

That's conveying the meaning you want. The 'entwined on the balcony' specifies how they were standing, not how Snape was pulling.

Compare to the second version:

#+begin_quote
  Snape pulled Palpatine into his arms and kissed him gently. They stood on the balcony, entwined.
#+end_quote

In narration, your readers will typically insert a silent 'and then' between sentences: Snape kissed Palpatine, and then they stood on the balcony. That's not really what you're after.

Also, it makes the "stood" part more important and the "entwined" part an afterthought. You want to emphasize that they are clinging to each other like strands on a rope.
