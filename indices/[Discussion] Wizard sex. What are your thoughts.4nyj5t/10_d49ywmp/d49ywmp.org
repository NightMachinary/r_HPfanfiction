+The Elder Wand looks like it would make for a fun night ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)‎+

Unless it's something done in the later years of Hogwarts and they had bigger things to worry about than sex ed (due to Voldemort coming back), then there doesn't seem to be any form of sex ed at Hogwarts. Unless it's something that's taught to the fifth years, but Umbridge banned it...

As for contraceptive methods, I'm sure there are spells or magical condoms or something to prevent pregnancy in young wizards. Perhaps Hogwarts has an anti-pregnancy spell.
