For starters there is of course a charm/potion to prevent unwanted pregnancies. This even has some historical background, given that mixtures preventing pregnancies were called witchcraft in medieval times. There also got to be some kind of masturbation spell(s). Animation charms come to mind.

Sex toys is a subject deserving of its own fic. Just with the aforementioned Animation charm, there is so much potential. Literally anything you can think of, its possible, from the mundane to the bizzare. Just go onto an online shop for this and imagine all of its products on magic-steroids. Paraphenalia is just the same.

For spells I can see some hypersensitivity spells, the already mentioned prevention-spells, Levitation charms, Transfigurations,...................... Crucio for Bellatrix (thats got to be her kink).

Pornography however, is a topic where I think the wizards are a bit behind. I can imagine some sort of Playboy magazine, but nothing more. However, I imagine prostitution to be a huge market. Starting with non-human prostitutes and ending with polyjuice drinking ones - bring a hair and you can fuck whomever you want (I think there was one fem!Harry fic where she finds out that there is a business at Hogwarts involving her hair and an establishment offering "The Girl Who Lived" as a polyjuice prostitute).

When it comes to sex culturally, I can see the wizards historically being very open with sex used for magic. Its kind of my headcanon that lesbianism is alright, while a gay wizard is discriminated against. This has its roots in the Covens. While Sorcerer circles were academic only, I imagine Covens to have been a tight knit group as they were the more hunted and the more "working class" of the two (once again, headcanon). I can also see the ideological side of Dumbledore to be against homosexuality (as they moved closer to muggle ideology.), while the more traditional magicals still accept lesbianism to a degree. Dumbledores side would also be more prude, while I have it in my head that the traditional wizards and witches are very open with their bodies due to Fertility rituals and the like. Its also my bit of headcanon that the lack of children from the purebloods is caused to a big degree by these rituals being outlawed.

Sex Ed, I imagine, is practically non-existent. Due to the casual way in which some spells are used, I can totally see Hogwarts just dosing the children with a bit of potion to prevent pregnancy throughout the seven years and then leaving them to their own devices. I would imagine that its a bit of a mouth-to-mouth thing in the houses, the older years telling the younger and so on. A lot of experiments. I could also see the girls having a session with Pomfrey in second or third year where they learn the prevention charm. Because its obviously the girls-only responsibility to prevent consequences. We're still just in the middle of second wave feminism, and I'm sure that not even first wave feminism completely hit the wizarding world.

Oh, EDIT, before I forget: "Holy shit, can you imagine sex with Tonks?" isn't a much asked question in fanfiction for nothing.
