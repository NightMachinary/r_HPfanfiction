  We're still just in the middle of second wave feminism, and I'm sure that not even first wave feminism completely hit the wizarding world.

I disagree. The wizarding world culturally diverged from the muggle world with the creation of the statute of secrecy (and possibly even before that). They are behind the muggle world only in a technological sense. Culturally, they are just as advanced, merely different. They have their own prejudices and cultural practices. You touched on this with your theory about covens, but then contradicted yourself at the end of your post by assuming they adopted feminism from muggles.

When you consider the origins of feminism in the muggle world where greater involvement in the workforce led to greater demands for rights and equal treatment and compare this to the wizarding world it becomes clear that the wizarding world has likely never discriminated by gender. Going back to the founding of Hogwarts, witches have held an equal place with wizards, learning the same skills for the same jobs, very few of which would be affected by physical differences between the sexes due to the nature of magic. Not to mention, I don't really see a society being capable of oppressing half their population when said half carries around a lethal weapon with just as much ability to use it as the other half. The only reason muggleborns are effectively discriminated against is that they are a small minority with distinct disadvantages in terms of magical knowledge and economic power.
