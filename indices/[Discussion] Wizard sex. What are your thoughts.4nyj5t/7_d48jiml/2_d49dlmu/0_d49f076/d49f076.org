I doubt that muggleborn witches were able to shrug off the first ten years of living in a man's world at any time in history, so inequality would have to be unlearned, but it certainly would have been well known.

I agree that the wizarding world adopted equality more readily and earlier than the muggle world. As to 'how to oppress a gender when they carry weapons' the obvious answer is 'don't allow them the weapons'.

As a tangential thought: perhaps the long history of magic in Europe being associated with witches in muggle literature relates to the idea that the wizards disappeared to enclaves to be trained while the witches were left in the muggle world to their own devices, but without wands. This is why hedge witches were associated with herbalism and extensive rites and rituals; they couldn't whip out the speedy spells.

In such a world it would make a certain sense if the adoption of the Statute of Secrecy was the endgame of a witch uprising, wherein they insisted that enough pissed-off girls with stolen wands [or wands smuggled to them by sympathetic pureblood witches] could make everyone's lives miserable, so they should all get to disappear from the world.

Or not. It's just a notion.
