  I doubt that muggleborn witches were able to shrug off the first ten years of living in a man's world at any time in history, so inequality would have to be unlearned, but it certainly would have been well known.

Indeed. However, I was talking about the wizarding world's attitude as a whole, not the attitudes of that small minority that is muggleborn witches.

  As to 'how to oppress a gender when they carry weapons' the obvious answer is 'don't allow them the weapons'.

True, but I wasn't really asking that. In any case, they have them and I reckon taking them would be bitch. Not to mention you don't strictly need a wand to do magic what with potions, enchanted objects, rituals, etc. all of which are powerful in their own way if not necessarily in a duel but in a more strategic application.

  long history of magic in Europe being associated with witches in muggle literature
#+end_quote

This is more a result of the attitudes held by the authors of such works. Most literature of the time was commissioned or created by the church or nobles with deeply held beliefs on the subject. Take Shakespeare's Macbeth for example; it is well known that the king at the time (James I), who was one of The Bard's primary patrons, had a thing for witch-hunting, hence the portrayal of the three witches as meddling old crones. Other examples would be to compare the portrayals of magic as used by Prospero and Sycorax (good wizard compared to evil witch) in Shakepreare's The Tempest, and the portrayals of magic in the King James Bible. These works and others like them have colored the perception of the subject in subsequent works up through the modern era where that perception has only just begun to change in reflection of our modern attitudes. What I'm trying to get at is that muggle literature would not be a reliable source for learning about what magical culture was like, especially since all the accurate sources would have been confiscated upon implementation of the SoS.
