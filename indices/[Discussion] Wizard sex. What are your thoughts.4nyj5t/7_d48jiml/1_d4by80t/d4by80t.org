  I'm sure that not even first wave feminism completely hit the wizarding world

that's a strange assessment. In the source material I don't remember anything that would even hint at inequality between the sexes. (assuming you are using feminism to mean equality rather then female superiority).

In no part of the books were girls/boys ever treated or evaluated differently.

The most 'sexist' I can remember was that guys were the ones who were supposed to ask girls out for the ball in fourth year.
