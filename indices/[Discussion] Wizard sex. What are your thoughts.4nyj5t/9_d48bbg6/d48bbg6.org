I've seen a few fics where the prefects teach the younger kids sex ed which seems possible...

Despite the obvious really cool ways magic could be used in the bedroom, sex in the HP universe seems pretty puritanical. Many of the main characters have kids REALLY young in HP and monogamous/straight relationships are highly encouraged and modeled. It's also implied (canon?) that there are arranged marriages in many pureblood families.
