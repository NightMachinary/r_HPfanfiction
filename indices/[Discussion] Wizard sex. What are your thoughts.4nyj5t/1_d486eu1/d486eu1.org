As far as sex-ed is concerned, they likely get the talk from their parents at some point, but it is also probable that the school nurse may give a one time lecture at some point (likely at least by the start of 3rd year when puberty has kicked in and students would likely start dating) just to make sure they are all on the same page. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised by her teaching/providing contraceptive spells/potions.

As for wizarding attitudes towards sex: Hogwarts is a very big, mostly empty castle full of horny teens with little adult supervision. Combine this with the likelihood that wizards have probably had effective contraceptive options for centuries, the fact that they culturally diverged from muggles long before the relatively prudish Victorian Era, a female population capable of effectively asserting their equality, and all the kinky bedroom possibilities magic would provide, you get a culture that is in all likelihood very sexually liberal and non-discriminatory even by today's standards.

That of course doesn't even begin to address any potential physiological differences that being magical my have on one's sex drive, performance, puberty, etc. Something interesting to think about is what is sex like in a world where magicals are capable of sensing magic and magic is closely tied to emotions.
