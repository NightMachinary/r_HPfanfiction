I think that there are a lot of issues in wizard sex that aren't present in normal sex.

1. Consent - Whether love potions, imperius curse, etc., the wizarding world has methods that, at least on the surface, seem to violate consent more readily than roofies.

2. Partners - there is some potentially cross-species breeding going on in the wizarding world, whereas it doesn't happen, or at least it doesn't produce viable offspring, in the normal world. There are half-giants (Hagrid), half-goblins (Flitwick), and part-Veela (Fleur). For normal humans, there aren't any non-human sentient species that are regularly subjected to sex acts. I know the jokes about certain cultures and kilts and sheep...

3. The potential for trying new things - It seems very possible that the use of polyjuice during sex could be a thing in the wizarding world, likewise with charmed sex toys
