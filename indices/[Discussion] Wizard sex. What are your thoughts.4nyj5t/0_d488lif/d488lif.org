I'm sure there's lots of stuff to consider on this topic, but I ended up thinking about Portkeys and sex a while back...

I've wondered about whether Portkeys can take secondary passengers. At the start of GoF, everyone had to touch the boot to the QWC -- nine people, squeezing around -- suggesting that each individual has to have direct contact with the Portkey, but at the end Harry is able to take Cedric by only holding his wrist. Is this because Cedric was dead, so the Portkey registered him as an inanimate object, like clothing and the bags everyone had at the QWC? If it is possible to travel by Portkey just by having contact with someone who touches the Portkey, what happens when two people are having sex and one of them touches the Portkey?

How much contact do the two people have to have for the secondary person to get pulled in? Harry only holds Cedric's wrist, which suggests not very much. So two people engaged in penetrative sex are probably both going to get pulled along.

What about for oral? Assuming mouths and genitals are the only things in contact, is that enough to for the Portkey to pick up the second person? Does it work for fellatio but not cunninglingus? If so, how far in someone's mouth does the person receiving fellatio need to be in order for it to work? Does it work for cunninglingus if the giver is pressed close enough, perhaps if they're pushing their tongue inside? What about fingering? Again assuming fingers/genitals are the only point of contact, how many fingers, or how deep do they need to be, for the Portkey to pick them up?

How does using a Portkey during sex (with both parties coming along) affect pleasure? I imagine it'd be really weird, but maybe there's a certain pleasure in it. How does it feel if a condom or sex toy is the Portkey? Can a person be brought to orgasm purely through the sensation of a Portkey on their genitals? Is there a sect of witches and wizards using Portkeys for masturbation?

If a Portkey doesn't pick up living secondary passengers, how weird must it feel to be having sex, of any sort, and then to suddenly not be?
