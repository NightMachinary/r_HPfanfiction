As far as Hogwarts is concerned, I'm mostly convinced that the pumpkin juice includes anti-pregnancy effects, possibly including a horniness suppressant. Otherwise, having every teen in your culture trapped in one place for ten months of the year would lead to regular population booms and a lot of young pregnancies.

Instead it seems like everyone starts getting married right after leaving school, but having babies is sometimes delayed by a few years -- as if the pumpkin juice had to work its way out of their system.
