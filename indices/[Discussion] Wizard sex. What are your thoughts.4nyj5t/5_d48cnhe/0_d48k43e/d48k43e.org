A large part of the sexual liberation in our world can probably be related to reliable and more ubiquitous methods of contraception - especially for women (the pill).

If contraception is as simple in the magical world as you - and many other fanfic authors describe it - (also it probably has been like this for a long time) I doubt there'd be lots of (if any) stigmatisation of sexual relations. Why would they want or need to dose their children without their consent? Considering that their culture would also lack most of the sexual repression through the Christian faith why would they be opposed to their children exploring their sexuality in a more or less controlled setting? Especially the older pureblood houses would probably encourage them to use their sexuality as political capital.
