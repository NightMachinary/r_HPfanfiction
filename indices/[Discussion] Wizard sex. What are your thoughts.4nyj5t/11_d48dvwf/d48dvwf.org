I'm not sure it would be as much of a sex-fest as some people think. Although obviously having a bunch of horny teenagers all living in the same castle would lead to some teenage sex, you have to remember that muggles spend so much time thinking about sex because of how much of it we see in the media.

It may be that wizarding culture is quite prudish and sex isn't something to be openly talked about, even if behind closed doors they're more adventurous than muggles. The reason alot of muggle kids feel so comfortable talking about sex is how much of it we see on the internet/tv/etc and the fact that we're exposed to it at such a young age.

If wizarding kids receive little to no social learning in regards to attitudes towards sex, they might be less comfortable exploring it until they're older.
