More puritanical social norms can develop independently of religion.

Lots of kids, many of whom don't have the maturity to handle sex, living in one place without any limits on sexual activity is bound to cause problems at some point, which could have motivated teachers and parents and society at large to develop a hush-hush attitude towards sex to discourage underage sex and the problems that come with it.

Like I said above, even with the desire to have sex, they have to have the knowledge, and since kids are shipped away from the parents at 11, and assuming parents don't spend much time talking to their pre-pubescent kids about sex, the only real source of information they'd have is older kids.

Wizarding children may also never /see/ sex, like, ever, until they have it. Muggle kids have access to porn and see sex simulated on tv, which again makes us more comfortable talking about, and presumably, having sex.
