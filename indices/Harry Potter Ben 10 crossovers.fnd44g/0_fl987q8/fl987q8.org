Sorry, no stories from me, but I do want to talk a bit.

This one's a neat idea, with one small thing to note: Ben's aliens are either reasonably strong (see: Fourarms, Diamondhead, Heatblast) or amazingly overpowered (Way Big, Alien X, Atomix). If you kept Ben to his weaker lot, he'd be about the same level as most of the cast of Harry Potter.

Also, thinking about it, magic /exists/ in Ben 10. Charmcaster, Hex, Gwen, all use magic. So be interesting to see how their magic gels with Harry Potter magic.

I look forward to seeing if anyone can drum up a few stories of this, as it sounds interesting.
