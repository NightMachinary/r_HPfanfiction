So we thought it'd be great to have a whole feature on, you know -- your life now. The Boy Who Lived -- Thirty Years On. No Longer a Boy ...” She was leaning forwards now, tone hushed, fingers wiggling to emphasise the supposed enthrall of this title. “We'll interview you, ask you all about how things have changed for you -- and we were thinking we'd go to Godric's Hollow, where it happened, to do it --”Harry blinked. “You want to go to the scene of my parents' death to ask me about my life?”“It adds an emotional dimension, you see,” explained Tabitha, apparently without irony.“There is already a fairly emotional dimension for me,” said Harry. “You know, since they died and everything.”
