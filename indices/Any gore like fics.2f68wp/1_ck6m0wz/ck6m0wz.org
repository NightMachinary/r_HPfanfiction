You can inch close to the line, but fanfiction.net won't like anything too extreme. And I think Misery would cross the line. Human Centipede /definitely/ would. But most writers don't seem to be interested in pushing those boundaries.

I think the best approach is body horror, though. Please try my much reposted, I-should-have-a-macro-for-this-by-now recommendation:

  This fic is dark. Not silly-power-fantasy "dark," like the kids write nowadays. Really black. The world is not a friendly place, evil things happen to normal people for no reason -- or worse, cold, unfeeling reasons -- and everyone is screwed no matter what the hero does. Rape, abuse, and body horror are the bread and butter of this fic. And again, it is ultra-mature (almost more so than you'd think FFN would allow) but it is done professionally. King, Romero, or Craven would be fitting comparisons to Wordhammer's style, but also Hitchcock. Apparently, I want Wordhammer to have my creative fiction bab- OH GOD NO, THAT IS A TERRIBLE IDEA!!

  Original (and horrible) use of common canon spells, and also some new bio-magical stuff that just...ugh. You were warned, but also recommended.

  It is a thing that stands alone amongst all the sappy and crappy gray/dark Harry Azkaban shitfics. This story is dark, it is the exact opposite of a comfort fic, it does not have a happy ending, it does surprising and horrible things to the main character. It does have a sequel, which I have not gathered the courage to continue, but it stands alone just as well. And you'll be happy to finish it, because you know there isn't another chapter of the main character being tortured just a link away.
