There's plenty of gore in 'Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness' and the sequel 'Sluagh.'

The bulk of it in DAYD is in the final battle, but Andy is very descriptive throughout the work. Very. For Sluagh, the bulk that i recall is about halfway through, but again, he's very very descriptive when something happens. If you haven't been acquainted with DAYD yet, it's a retelling of 7th year from Neville's point of view, what happened at Hogwarts when the trio was off. And it's brilliant. Definitely AU.
