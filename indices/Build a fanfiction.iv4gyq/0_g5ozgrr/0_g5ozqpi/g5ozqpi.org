this would probably work best for an experienced writer who is looking for something fun to do in their spare time or as a side project. A challenge every chapter to keep it all together. The chaoter suggestions i imagined would be an event that the author can build uo to and incorporate somehow. It would be an interesting read because tge entire story wouldn't follow tge same plot line of events that 90% do.
