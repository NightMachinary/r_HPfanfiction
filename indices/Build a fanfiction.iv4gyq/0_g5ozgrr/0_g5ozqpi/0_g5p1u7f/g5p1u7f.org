That's what I was going to say too - an interesting idea for as specific challenge in and of itself. It's something I would do, since I live for prompt-based writing as a way to procrastinate from my one massive project. You could have the author provide the story summary (with their personal ground rules), then the next comment is the next chapter/scene/driving action. Repeat until set number of comments/chapter ideas is reached, then the author posts the results? Maybe?
