Wizards or normal. I remember there was a fic where Voldemort compared his followers to chess pieces to use and sacrifice and when Severus reported the meeting back we got an awesome Dumbledore quote something along the line of "It is at times like these that Voldemort reveals his muggle mindset. As you know Severus, in wizards chess the pieces are alive."
