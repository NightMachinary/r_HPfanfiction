I do read it, and I love it. Rose is sort of mad, and it's true she's arguably more dangerous than beneficial to her friends, but I don't see anything creepy about her as such. It's clear there's nothing sexual about her befriending the kids, so between the fact that she's more a kid than a grown-up psychologically anyway, and that I don't see the problem with a grown-up/child friendship anyway if it works out for everyone involved...

And I don't find Sally-Anne insufferable at all. Yes, if she were real she'd probably annoy me for being such a busybody, but within the prism of fiction I don't find her to be an unlikable protagonist; she's just a mostly-good character with deep-running personality flaws, which is usually considered a /good/ thing to have in a story.
