I dislike Remus a lot, but uhh...

No one wrote to Harry before Hogwarts. Given that Remus ​did his best to avoid striking up a relationship when they did, that's fine.

There's a lot more to Remus and Snape than Remus being a willing bystander and Snape being an unfortunate victim. I don't think too many 15/16 year olds are going to go out of their way to help someone who at best tried to get them expelled and, at worst, tried to get them killed. ​

  Even when Sirius and Severus were at Grimmauld Place going off one each other

We see this once and there's no indication that Remus was even in the house.
