Fanon Remus seems to fix..a lot of the ..not problem but flaws. Remus wanted to help Harry. Was scared of commitment but came off as a guy who's gotten so used to not being well treated by the universe. He wasn't trying anymore. The marauders were long way laway by either POA or HBP. So its been years since he had friends likely.

Fanon explores his background more usually. Makes him more relatable then just pop in and out of Harry's life. I like that.
