Here's my take on why Remus didn't write to Harry: why should he? Consider this: prior to the deaths of James and Lily there were suspicions of a spy working for Voldemort within the Order of the Phoenix. While nobody could prove the identity of this spy, it was known that Remus was interacting with the werewolves, likely trying to sway them away from Fenrir Greyback, and ultimately Voldemort. Combine this with the Ministry's stated anti-werewolf stance, and the fact that Voldemort was at least pretending to be pro-werewolf, and you have a situation where the suspicion over who the spy inside the Order is would invariably include Remus Lupin near the top of the list.

With such a suspicion, it's only inevitable that he would become aware of everyone's thinking, and a confrontation (possibly of the friendship-destroying kind) would be the result. At the end, I could quite reasonably see Remus walking away from the Order, and his now former friends, feeling angry, hurt and betrayed that they think he'd side with werewolves like Greyback over the people that he spent seven years sharing a dorm with.
