I don't understand people's expectation that Remus should've written to Harry. Why? Remus Lupin was James Potter's friend, not Harry's. Sirius cared about Harry because he was his godfather, but Remus wasn't.

If any of my friends ever have kids I don't think I would care all that much about them. friends don't come packaged with their family.
