I'm fairly certain Dumbledore stopped Harry's mail somehow when he was growing up with the Dursleys. As a celebrity in the wizarding world, think how many people would have wanted to write to him and thank (or threaten) him for getting rid of Voldemort. We can also assume his address was secret, therefore Remus wouldn't have been able to write to him the muggle way.

The weirdness of Lupin not contacting him doesn't really start until after third year, and I think we can assume Lupin was feeling a lot of guilt over turning in front of the trio and almost eating them, not to mention being the cause of Pettigrew getting away. He may have assumed Harry wouldn't want anything to do with him after that, and also that Harry had Sirius now, so he wouldn't need Remus. Also that he would likely see Harry through contact with Sirius.
