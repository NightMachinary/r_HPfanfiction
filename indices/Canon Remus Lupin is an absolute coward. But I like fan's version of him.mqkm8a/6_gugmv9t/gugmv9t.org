I got puzzled myself about the letter thing when I first read the books and it was funny cuz I ended up having this dream about Remus being allergic to owls and a great number of birds so he ended up having to use the Muggle post system and when he stayed with the Weasleys he bribed gnomes to take the letters to Harry, why there was such an abundance of them at the Burrow. Since in my dream they can teleport like house elves. And I woke up laughing to Ron with a gnome with teeth locked on his hand screaming and Harry wide eyed storms his way into Remus' house with a prepaid phone from a Muggle gas station and chucks it at him telling him to contact him that way and Remus not pressing any buttons or anything tries talking to Harry only having to hunt down a Muggle old lady who lives on the edge of his block to explain the odd button coated block.

I do agree he didn't really have a backbone in the series and I guess was meant to be the match to Pettigrew, he wasn't so afraid he turned his friends over to Voldy but he let his friends do things that equaled what the DE did to innocents and just tried to bury it in the past while James and Sirius are both similarly brash and out to go after what they want no matter who is in their way with varying moral compasses.

Still love writing him though and how he grows from that to be stronger when he's an adult and helping to raise my oc, Harry and Neville with Regulus' and disguised Sirius' help.
