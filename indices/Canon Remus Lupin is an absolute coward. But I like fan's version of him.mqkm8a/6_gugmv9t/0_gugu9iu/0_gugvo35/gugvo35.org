Hanging a child up in the air and removing their clothes and publicly humiliated them would count as worse to allow to happen than letting one person kill another in my book. No matter what Snape did to â€˜get as good as he gave' as so many people in the fandom say he still was a child and didn't deserve that. And worse there was no punishment at all from the school mentioned about them doing that to him.
