Newt Scamander got kicked out for taking the wrap for a magical creature Leta brought that harmed another student but no, publicly stripping students who are assumed to be or proven to be DE is perfectly acceptable and lands you a hero auror status when you grow up apparently.

As long as you do it to a â€˜bad' guy it's perfectly fine.
