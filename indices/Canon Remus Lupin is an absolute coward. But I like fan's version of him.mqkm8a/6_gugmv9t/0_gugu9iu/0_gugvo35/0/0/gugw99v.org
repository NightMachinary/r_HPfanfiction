Legal age in the books is 17, they're all considered children legally, which if you want to equate that to crimes in our world would have a higher grade of punishment for assault on a minor, not to mention adding in the removal of clothes that would shift it into the sexual targeting categories for forcibly stripping a child, as compared to accessory to murder and failure to aid the victim being murdered, the former would carry heavier degrees of punishment.

But I suppose in the magical world where they don't care students are running around stripping each other by force sure, murder could be worse. After all Umbridge did make it pretty high with her crimes against children â€˜for the greater good' under Fudge's regime. Not even mentioning the whole targeting fellow partial Muggle born Wizards like herself.
