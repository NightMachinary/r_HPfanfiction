I know RobSt gets bashed on this subreddit but they have a story Fate's Gambit linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5210983/1/Fate-s-Gambit]]) that is pre-Hogwarts, includes Luna also, that you might enjoy if you liked the fic you are describing. It has an in-Hogwarts sequel. I hope someone finds the story you are looking for - I'd like to read it.
