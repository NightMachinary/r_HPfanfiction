Tbh I have a real hard time looking past Harry deciding to launch a one-man full out assault on Hogwarts in broad daylight. He'd have to go out of his way to come up with a worse, dumber plan to kill Tom than that.

Did he take Tom's place or something? 'Cause I've skipped to the end of that fic before and there's a Tom Riddle there.
