Marriage without consummation is not valid (otherwise the whole marriage is a non-issue and they could be wed on paper but otherwise do whatever they want). And if you force someone to consummate the marriage against their will that is rape.

I never finished this specific fic but that is the general problem I have with marriage law/contract fics.
