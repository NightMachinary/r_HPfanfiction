  We know Harry's character. Even with this odd behaviour, we know Harry Potter would /never/ rape anyone. He would probably force someone to marry him to spite them, and then pretend they don't exist to spite them even more. Harry has shown himself to be a little bit of a vindictive bastard in canon. The actions he takes in the beginning of this fic- which you clearly did not read as much as skimmed through- make sense, and he makes a very rational, if morally ambiguous argument as to why he could easily live with refusing to revoke a contract drafted by his own parents.

First of all I tried to read the fic a year ago and only stopped after 3 chapters. Secondly forcing someone to marry is not morally ambiguous its downright evil and thirdly I never said that he tried to rape her, only that he threatened to do so and he clearly makes her think that he will do it.

But i guess if you think that forcing someone in a relationship against their will destroyed their chance of raising a happy family and taking away their freedom is rational and logical. Then you simply lack the ability to empathize with the victim and nothing i can say will change you mind.

But for once put your self in her shoes and think how horrible would it be for ot to happen to you, your mother, your sister or anyone you care about just for once
