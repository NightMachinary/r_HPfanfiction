Yeah, my point was that Harry would never force her to consummate the marriage. Based on what we know of his character, and what the author of the fic shows us even up until the point where all this happens, Harry is not an evil motherfucker.

Besides, I don't think anyone cares about consummation (apart from religious people, which wizards cannot be, because they'd be shunned by religion) in this century.
