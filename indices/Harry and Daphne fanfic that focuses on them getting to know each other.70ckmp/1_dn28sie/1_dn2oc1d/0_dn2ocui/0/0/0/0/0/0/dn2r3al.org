OKAY. Let's remember for a second here this is a Harry Potter fanfic. One that is presumably set simply later in the original, canon HP universe. We know Harry's character. Even with this odd behaviour, we know Harry Potter would /never/ rape anyone. He would probably force someone to marry him to spite them, and then pretend they don't exist to spite them even more. Harry has shown himself to be a little bit of a vindictive bastard in canon. The actions he takes in the beginning of this fic- which you clearly did not read as much as skimmed through- make sense, and he makes a very rational, if morally ambiguous argument as to why he could easily live with refusing to revoke a contract drafted by his own parents.

Oh and by the way: fuck you, you addled fool with no understanding of logic or rationale. How in the /fuck/ did you read my comment and think, "Oh! He's saying marital rape is a lie! He thinks bad marriages are the same as forcing someone into a relationship!"

Learn to read, then learn to comprehend. It's stuff we learn in preschool, but clearly you didn't pay attention. CONTEXT IS KING YOU IGNORANT PRAT.
