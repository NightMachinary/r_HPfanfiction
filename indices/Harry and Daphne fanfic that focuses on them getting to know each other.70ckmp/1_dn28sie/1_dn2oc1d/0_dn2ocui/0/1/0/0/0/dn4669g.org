That does not matter, Daphne does not know what is going on in his head and he does not tell her. He is letting her know in that scene that he is willing to force her to marry him and if you read the scenes beforehand when the lawyers discuss the contract you would know how few rights she would have.

So he does threaten her in that scene quite clearly and plainly.

Moreover even after that he forces her to date him, even if its for a little while he still disregards her choice and forces her to go on 5 dates with her in which he can easily manipulate her to get what he wants.
