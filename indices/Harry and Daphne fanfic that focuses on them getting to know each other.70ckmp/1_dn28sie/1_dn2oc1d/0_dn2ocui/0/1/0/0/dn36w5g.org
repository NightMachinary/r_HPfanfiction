While many fanfics of this type usually add in the need to have sex for the contract to have effect, this one does not.

Thus he is not treathening rape, since there is no requirement to have sex. The gist was that Potter will gain from it in a business sense, and due to Voldemorts destruction of Potter property, he does not lose anything because of the contract, since it's already gone.

Admittedly he was being an arse in that scene, even if he didn't mean what he said.
