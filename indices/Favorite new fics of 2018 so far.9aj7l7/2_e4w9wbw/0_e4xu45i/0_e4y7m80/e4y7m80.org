Neither, exactly, yet. He tries to avoid changing the future by laying low, but it's implied so far that this hasn't worked. He isn't it at the screw it point yet, but it seems like he's going to realize he can't avoid changing the future and is starting to actively start changing his approach. It's kind of slow moving, but the writer gives lots of different scenes and varies the tone really well, so it doesn't seem to me like it's plodding. As for angsty-ness, there is some, but I definitely wouldn't classify this as an angsty fic. More he encounters problems or things that depress him but then finds a way to move on. There's lots of humor, so that helps alleviate the angst.
