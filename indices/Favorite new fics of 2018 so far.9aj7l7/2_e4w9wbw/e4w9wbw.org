My most recent favorite is one that just started -- Harry ends up in the 1970s but is terrified of changing the future (it's kind of like /Back to the Future/) so he tries to avoid everyone. Ends up pretending he's a squib and gets roped into working at the Hog's Head for Aberforth Dumbledore. Really smart writing, full chapters, nice characterization, especially of Harry and Aberforth.The only drawback is that the author says it will eventually be slash, but emphasizes that slash or romance isn't the main point of the story. Given how good the first 50 thousand or so words are, I'm sticking with it to see (no slash at all yet). It also, so far, updates really regularly.It's called /The Second String,/ Linkffn(13010260)
