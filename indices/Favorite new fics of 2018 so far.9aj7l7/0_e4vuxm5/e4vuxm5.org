This is every story in my favorites list that was published this year, definitely hoping that this thread introduces me to some more hidden gems.

Linkffn(13022207) is the best new time travel fic released in a while. Its a Hermione-centric story dealing with time travel from an outsider's perspective.

Linkffn(World On Fire by WiseTomato) is an HP/Mass Effect crossover with a older Harry fighting the Reapers invasion of Earth.

Linkffn(Druid of Holly and Yew by Team Ozone) is a story with a Harry who was apprentice of a Druid coming back to the wizarding world.

Linkffn(12885827) has an absurd premise but is worth reading just for the novelty of it.
