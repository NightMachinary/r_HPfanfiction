I'd recommend A Stumble in Time. It's a time travel fic where Death Eaters attacked the Ministry, killing everyone except Hermione and Draco, who formed a last ditch resistance. They plan to transfer their memories for a redo, but something goes wrong and Hermione ends up in Fourth Year while Draco seemingly disappears. While she shamelessly abuses her Time Turner and Arithmancy, she tries to fix things and sometimes makes them worse. There's a whole subplot where Viktor made her lose her memories but that seems to be resolved. Draco is a little bit fannon-y, but not insufferable. Some Snape involvement. No pairings from what I can tell
