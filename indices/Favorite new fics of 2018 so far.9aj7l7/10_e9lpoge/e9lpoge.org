Harry Potter

Words: 2,136 Genre: Adventure/Romance Rated: M

This story follows our unsung heroes, the Muggleborn Wizards from Gryffindor. I also added a new twist to Ron's character, which is more mature and playing to his strengths. Harry and Hermion will play a key role, but the spotlight will be stolen by Ron Weasley, Dean Thomas & Colin Creevy. Smart Ron, Half-blood Dean, Savage Colin. Rated M for Language and Graphic Violence!
