Andromeda's Galaxy by sheyamiku. Was started in 2017 but is still getting updated in 2018 (so I'm counting it). It's got Andromeda being forced to be a death eater. Strong Bellatrix presence and learning a lot about the beginning of the death eaters. I'm dying for the next chapter to come out. It's got a a very good mix of romance and action. Really great star cross lovers of andromeda and ted mixed with great action and hero andromeda!
