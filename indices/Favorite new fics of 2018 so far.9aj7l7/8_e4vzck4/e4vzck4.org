linkffn(13022013) Novocaine was published four weeks ago and thus far has been pretty good. It's Harry/Daphne post-war fic and it avoids or subverts most of the typical tropes that come with the territory of the parring, and beyond that, it's also updated every Thursday with ~10,000 words per chapter. I have a good feeling about this fic, even if there is still plenty of time for it to go downhill.
