Honestly, that's the one that doesn't really change very much, he does get the "loyalty" of those families and can force them to vote his way in the wizengamot, but he doesn't take their wealth or become the "lord" of their family. It's possible, perhaps even likely that I've read enough fics with "Noble and Most Ancient Houses" that I've become numb to their presence. As a result, minor changes to the formula have become "good enough" rather than actually good.

I can at least say, that it avoids Harry being overly pretentious about the whole thing, which is refreshing. There hasn't been any "Oh hello, Mr. Potter - " "Actually it's LORD Potter, and you'd better be appropriately scared and respectful when addressing me." There are some definite warning signs that everything good about this fic could rather rapidly go downhill, and I'm in fact prepared for exactly that.
