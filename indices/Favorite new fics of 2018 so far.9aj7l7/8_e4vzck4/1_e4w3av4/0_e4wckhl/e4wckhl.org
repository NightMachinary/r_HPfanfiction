Harry/Daphne's been a thing ever since Blaise's gender was confirmed male(whereas before, Harry/fem!Blaise was the go-to Slytherin pairing), so basically before the series even ended. Definitely not 'out of nowhere'.

Basically, if you want to pair Harry with a named Slytherin female in his year, you're picking from Pansy, Millicent, Tracey, and Daphne. Pansy's personality is a bit less malleable due to actual canon appearances, Millicent's out because we can't pair Harry with ugly(/s), so you're left with Daphne Greengrass, because the name Tracey Davis sounds too girl-next-door, and you can just go to Hufflepuff and throw a stone and hit a half-dozen of those.
