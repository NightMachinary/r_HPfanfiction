Not sure if it can be traced to one story, but it's popular because 1) people want Harry with a Slytherin, and Pansy is irrecoverable as a potential love interest; 2) Harry and Ginny is rather bland; and 3) all we know about Daphne is her name, so she's a canon-based OC to make your own.

Another user has been promoting Harry/Susan lately. I hope /that/ ship becomes popular soon.
