There are plenty of Susan stories, but she's just a plot device for Harry to get her aunt...

That sounded both wrong and perfectly right.

And as someone who tried writing Katie ships a couple times, it's very difficult to write it without sounding like you are simply having a "better Ginny" (the sporty girl from Harry's team, but not his fangirl) or a "better Hermione" (hot muggleborn, but no nagging). I like to include her as a good friend to Harry like in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12745758][No longer alone]], but to write a good romance with her without sounding bland is rather difficult.
