Nose to the Wind by Batsutousai. It's MoD!HP/Voldemort pairing. Linkao3(15562401)

It's a sequel to a previous story where Harry, in his first life, was bitten by a werewolf and eventually killed for being one. His second life was spent elevating creatures above humans so the non-humans ruled the magical world. His third life is the sequel, where he's up to shenanigans as the MoD Werewolf in a world ruled by Voldemort. The author plans on finishing the fic by end of September and updates every other day.
