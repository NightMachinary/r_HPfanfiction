Would this be an official school newspaper or an underground one where the professors have no control over it? Maybe one of each?

Well you have to have a column of the recent sighting of Nargles and whatnot by Luna. Maybe a Weasley Watch where people talk about their most recent pranks? How about a secret column which needs a passcode (ala "I solemnly swear I am up to no good") to access the Harry Potter Fan Club updates? You'd also maybe want someone to draw a cartoon strip or something. Something to talk smack about Snape would be fun. Maybe a "Whose dating whom" thing?
