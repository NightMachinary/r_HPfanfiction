You know what, a lot of people seem to be not very into this, but I would definitely read it. While the overpowered thing can be annoying, it's really not bad when the story is well written and the main character doesn't have a completely perfect personality to go with it, and I can tell you've put enough thought into this that you're probably not going to go that route.

I'm getting the impression that your veteran Harry is an adult that has been forced to learn over the years. There's a badass lone wolf vibe with the possibility of seeing some traveling (maybe even some exploration around the Wizarding World?) and it sound pretty fun. You could do so many things with this story, and all of them would be cool. Good luck with this story, and if you're not comfortable promoting it, please pm me when (or if) you ever start posting it!
