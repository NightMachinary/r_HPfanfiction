- You don't write him training. Ever. You may refer back to him having practised, but most of the lessons he should learn would be thought fighting for his life.

What you're suggesting is certainly doable - and has been done - in wastelands of time.

- No. Every single thing you've proposed would make it another cliched story. Use the duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore as an example for really epic fights.

Use your imagination. Transfiguration allows for awesome stuff. You can introduce things like necromancy - that's fine - but it still has to fit in next to the other kinds of magic.

Most importantly, there has to be a reason why it isn't commonly used.

I have read several stories with Harry toting a gun. They have all sucked. A lot.
