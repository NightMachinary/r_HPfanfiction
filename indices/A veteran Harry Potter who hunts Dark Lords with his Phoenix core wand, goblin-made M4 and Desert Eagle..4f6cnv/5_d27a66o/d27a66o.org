I'm all for epic stories, but no. You can't just start off with your protagonist kicking ass. It has to be earned and bled for.

Creativity is great when it comes to magic but do not do guns. Use the framework of the series and build on that. Do not tear everything down and replace it with your own stuff because it will suck if you do.

Don't focus too much on how to make your protagonist awesome. Focus instead on making the villain awesome and by having Harry overcome him, one step at a time, he will in turn become the sort of bad-ass you're clearly shooting for.

Another thing is character. Don't turn him into some growly macho-man who communicates in nothing but one-liners. A real characters has strengths and weaknesses, friends and enemies, likes and dislikes. They're sometimes petty, they're sometimes wrong and they won't just shrug off any problem. Best of luck.
