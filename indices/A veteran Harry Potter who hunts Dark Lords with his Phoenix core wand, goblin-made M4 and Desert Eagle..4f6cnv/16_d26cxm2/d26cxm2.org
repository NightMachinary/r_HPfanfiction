Don't let the other comments discourage you from writing or uploading this fic. There will always be an audience for whichever genre you choose and which tropes you use and/or abuse. As long as the grammar is decent, and the story makes sense in the context of your world, people will read it and probably enjoy it.

Personally, I'm of two minds about roflstomp fics. In general they make me happy. Every now and then I just want to read about a character kicking ass and taking names. On the other hand, if you introduce distractions, deceptions, vulnerabilities, and hazards to keep an element of suspense and danger present for the protagonist, you might keep more people interested.
