Yes, although I think the motivation for his family should be the small voice and the addiction should be the large voice. He's been alone for how long? Thirty, forty some years? Killing and eradicating dark wizards for so long, his reasons would have long ago turned from "because I should" to "because I can". Now a small voice is saying, "wait, but now I have what I've always wanted, I need to stop this", but he rationalizes that what he's doing is protecting his family, so he keeps on indulging himself. But of course, this sort of violence scares his family, so alienating them would clash with doing what he loves.

Thoughts?
