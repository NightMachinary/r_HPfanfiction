I wouldn't worry too much. About the only place your work would be "ripped apart" is the DLP forums and here, to an extent. If you want a thorough, tear-your-writing-apart criticism, go to DLP.

Also, I would emphasize the "vulnerabilities" part. If you're going to make something even close to resembling a roflstomp fic, your stomper is going to /need/ a clear, if not apparent, vulnerability that the enemy can take advantage of, whether it is physical or emotional. Otherwise, there is no point. It becomes a battle of attrition, with no opportunity for tactical and effective strikes, and that's boring. Others have said that, I'm reaffirming it.

On the topic of this post:

  a veteran of wizarding civil wars and fighting at that point has become his whole motivation to live and addiction, basically the opposite effects of PTSD. But being sent in an alternate timeline where all the people he still cared about, where his Mum and Dad survived, gives him a different reason to live for. I'm not going to the overused, and for me annoying, 'They're not my real parents so I should stay as far away as possible from them'. Again, what he saw in the mirror of erised when he was young still rings true and that there is nothing more important to him than family itself.

This is good, but there's one thing I think you should consider. Changing his motivation for living from killing dark wizards to connecting to his family is one thing, and entirely possible; motives change all the time. But if you are making him /addicted/ to fighting - literally, physically /addicted/ to the adrenaline, joy, and empowerment that comes from destroying evil- then this /will/ clash with his desire to connect with his family, especially if his family does not want him to put himself in harm's way. Because addiction is not like motivation; it is not easily changed. Addiction is like chains wrapped around your mind, it is a very real and present feeling of "I need this to feel alive!" Breaking the addiction is like cutting through those chains with a broken and rusted metal file. It takes effort, self awareness, ungodly determination, and self denial.

So yeah. If it's his motivation, change it after he meets his family. If it's an addiction, he better struggle and waver like a flag on a windy day, or else it won't be realistic.
