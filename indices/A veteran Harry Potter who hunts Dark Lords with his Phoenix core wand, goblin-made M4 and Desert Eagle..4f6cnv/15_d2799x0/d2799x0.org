It sounds pretty fucking stupid idea to a shit plot, but if your going to give Harry a gun you should at least let him make one and instead it being the top of the line you should give him a Thompson contender or something like that and carve runes on it with a magazine capacity of infinity since magic can do that, and the bullets should be made from the ashes of different dark lords. And when Harry shoots at wizards it completely bypasses their protegos and when it hits their body's they can't use magic anymore till they get the bullet out of their body's.
