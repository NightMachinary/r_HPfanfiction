Don't be discouraged to write. I know a lot of the replies here are caustic, but we are hopefully just trying to steer you into a better direction.

Simplify it into this:

1) What is Harry's goal?

2) What are his obstacles?

3) How does he overcome these obstacles?

It's all good and fun to make Harry a shielded, gun toting, nuclear bomb, but what would his obstacles realistically be? I think you need to answer that question before you start attacking your story.
