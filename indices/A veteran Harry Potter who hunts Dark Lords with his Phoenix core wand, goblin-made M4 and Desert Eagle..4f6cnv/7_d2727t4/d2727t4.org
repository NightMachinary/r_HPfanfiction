I don't get the need for specificity. Your readers will either already know about the characteristics of various firelegs, or they won't care. If you want to write epic fight scenes that's obviously awesome. The important thing about those scenes is /who does what to whom/. With what is very much secondary.

Harry with a gun is cool. If he has an even gunnier gun, then that's even cooler. And if the goblins gave him the gunniest gun of them all -- well, who gives a fuck? Can you write awesome fights? If you can, fuck the details. If you can't, fuck your idea.
