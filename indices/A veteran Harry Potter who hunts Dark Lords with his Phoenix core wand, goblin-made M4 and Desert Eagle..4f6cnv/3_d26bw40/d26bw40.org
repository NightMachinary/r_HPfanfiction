Sorry but thirteen dark Lords in the span of 50 years makes no sense. Dumbledore only lived through two and he's old as hell. Honestly, the rest of your story sounds like Harry goes on a power trip. Harry in Canon beat voldemort with expelliarmus, he didn't have a rifle, a pistol, passive protego, 7000 word magic. I personally wouldn't be interested in reading this because if Harry is as powerful as you say he is then I can't see him getting into any danger, which ruins the story.
