My thoughts:

13 dark lords is a freakin' /lot/ of dark lord story arcs. I am completely sure I'll get bored of this story with that many story arcs, especially if Harry has the same capabilities/resources in all the arcs. It's also such a huge undertaking that you're likely to get bored and start something else. Find some ways to drop it down to a more manageable 3-7 story arcs. Since Harry has effectively traveled back in time he can eliminate some as babies. Some dark lords can team up and be defeated in th same story arc. One dark lord changes their mind and becomes a healer. Etc. Also, plot out the whole thing beforehand to make sure you actually have enough ideas to fill all those story arcs.

If goblins made firearms, wizards would simply cease to exist. And I simply see no reason for a "goblin-made" firearm. Just use a regular firearm and put some charms on it to: protect it from damage and the environment, reduce/eliminate recoil, ever-filling magazines, targeting aids, etc.

Like others have said, dial Harry way back for the first few dark lords and let him rebuild his capabilities/resources as the story progresses. Also, defeating dark lords isn't just about being a super-soldier -- it's about information acquisition and control, gathering and training allies, denying resources to the enemy, etc.
