Hmm, I guess I hadn't visualized shield charms being able to stop bullets.

Wand-carrying wizards are basically armed with single-action pistols and grenades (and stunners and some other stuff). Goblins haven't successfully taken over because they're only armed with swords, pikes, bows, etc. But if goblins can make firearms, that opens up grenades and RPGS, mortars, dragon-dropped bombs, land mines, etc. It's just a can of worms. :)

I'll stop with the goblins now. I'll look for your story. I'm imagining an MHI-like story?
