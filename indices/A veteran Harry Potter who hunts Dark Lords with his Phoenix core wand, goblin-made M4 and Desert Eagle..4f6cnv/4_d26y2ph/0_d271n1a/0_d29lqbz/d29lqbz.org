Aversion to magic, yes, desirable. But I reiterate: if goblins made /magic-proof/ firearms, wizards would have been wiped out long ago. Unless you're planning to make your goblins a persecuted race who just want to be loved. But canon, goblins are mean, rude, back-stabbing buggers who have established their place in the magical world by being willing to go to war for the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Ug_the_Unreliable][flimsiest of reasons]].

How about "dwarf-made"? We don't know much about the dwarves, so there's more room for fan-author interpretation.
