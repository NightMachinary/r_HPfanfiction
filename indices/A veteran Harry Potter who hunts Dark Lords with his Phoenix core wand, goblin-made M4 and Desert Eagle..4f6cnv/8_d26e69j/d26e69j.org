As others have said, an overpowered protagonist makes for a less interesting story. Good stories are about conflict - specifically, the conflict created by a protagonist overcoming obstacles while pursuing some important goal. If everything is easy, there's no conflict, no feeling that the protagonist might not succeed, and thus no story.

Some people still like overpowered protagonists, especially when they are shown crashing through all the original obstacles. So there will be an audience for what you describe. Some people will enjoy it. If you want to stretch your skills and write a better story, however, you won't let your protagonist have it easy.

One option is to start with an overpowered Harry then weaken him. He's being summoned by Death Eaters? Well, I can't see them summoning aid without taking steps to ensure that said aid stays under their control. What sort of control will determine how your story proceeds. If it's some sort of binding that weakens him, then Harry is forced to rely on finesse and skill rather than just blowing stuff up, at least until he achieves his intermediate goal of loosening or eliminating his bonds. Something stronger, like a spell that prevents him from hurting anyone with a Dark Mark, would make things harder on Harry, forcing him to act indirectly for a while. He's got super-powerful magic, but can't use it directly against the people he most wants to eliminate - how frustrating will that be!

In effect, the more overpowered he starts, the more frustrated he'll be when he's leashed. Maybe you can start him out relying too heavily on his power, perhaps causing lots of unnecessary damage, thus allowing for growth as he learns to depend less on power/luck and more on skill/planning/finesse.
