I don't like how you (and many other writers) make "Dark Lord" a generic title. There was only one Dark Lord in canon. The others were just very powerful and/or influential dark wizards. And if you want to keep this interesting, you have to make your "Dark Lords" special, not just generic bad guys. There has to be some ideology, conflict, some theme in the story, that isn't all about power. Otherwise it's just a video game.
