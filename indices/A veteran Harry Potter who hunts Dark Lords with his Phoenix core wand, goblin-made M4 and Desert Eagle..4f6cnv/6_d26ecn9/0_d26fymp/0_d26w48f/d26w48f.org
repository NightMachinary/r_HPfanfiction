Oooh, ideas for dark wizards, huh? I think I can help.

- I'm assuming the Yellow River is in reference to the man-made flood in 1938? WW2 would have been an absolute festival for necromancers. Concentration camps in germany, Russian battlefronts like Stalingrad and Moscow, mass graves due to Stalin's purges, etc, etc. If you're going to have necromancers, make them from Russia and Asia. I wouldn't be surprised if the magical gov't had those areas protected. I would also be unsurprised if those protections were meager and useless.

- Serial killers and all around insane people who consider their killings "art"

- Puppet masters - people who enslave others through the imperius and other such spells, and have mastered the art of legilimency and possession.

- Political terrorists like Voldemort, or a magical version of ISIS. Warlords like those fighting over African countries.

- Those in pursuit of immortality by any means. Horcruxes are far from the only way; there are tons of myths on immortality. Don't be afraid to get ideas from other magical systems in different books.

- Beastmasters - dark wizards daring and insane enough to tame Nundus, basilisks, and dragons, and use them for their own ends. There would also be plenty of illegal breeding and chimeras.

- Alchemists - those in search of immortality, gold, or something else. Look into other works of fiction for ideas, for I have little in this area. You could go the FullMetal Alchemist route and make it so that creating a Philosopher's Stone requires human sacrifice.

- Blood mages - dark wizards that use harvested blood and human sacrifice to power an assortment of dark magic, curses, and rituals.

- Cultists that worship dark gods, similar to Cthulu or Jashin from Naruto. Invoking their name in a ritual could grant the cultists powers beyond what is normally possible.

I'm sure there are more.
