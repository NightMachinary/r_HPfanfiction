Firstly, I would like to apologise for the typo I made. Instead of talking my fanfics, I was actually referring to fanfics in general.

Your choice of Harry being already matured is quite a nice touch from the usual Harry rapidly turning into an adult in a year, which is good. It is really nice to see a different style of the obtaining of power in the mountain of fast unrealistic development Harrys. It would be wise to remember the relationship between the characters that exist in both the past and future such as Dumbledore and other older order members. Overall, your plot seems believable and well structured at the beginning and towards the middle, so what harm is there for you to start writing even if it a bit cliche. I know that I have a guilty pleasure of a powerful Harry versus a powerful dark lord. I look forward to reading it!

Edit- Made my sentences clearer.
