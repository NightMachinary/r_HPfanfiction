  The recoil will be a nightmare, not mentioning the reloading process.
#+end_quote

Granted, the Eagle has a magazine, so reloading is easier. But for recoil its barely less. A Desert Eagle isn't a pistol. A desert eagle is a one-hand howitzer, with the recoil appropriate for such a gun. If you go for practical give Harry a Walther PPQ, or a Beretta 92... something along those lines. Even those 9mm will have enough recoil that using them in tandem with a wand is impractial at best.

  And what's wrong with a weapon made by goblins?
#+end_quote

You misunderstood. I'm cool with a weapon being made by the Goblins. I'm not convinced that the Goblins would just take a muggle design and be done with it. If you make this, give Harry a "Gringotts AR-5" or whatever you'd name it. Or lets even think this further: Why use a explosion based gun at all? Why not make something like a handheld Railgun with the bullet being expelled from the rail by some sort of locomotion charm? Or a Gauss Gun which would have absolutely zero recoil (or close to none, anyway).

  And God forbid I become a little creative in the way he fights.
#+end_quote

Then scrap all you wrote and come up with something truly creative. Shields, overcharged spells, silence fields, reverse patroni,... that has all been done, more than one time.

The only thing I have never seen is that Harry employs magical animal constructs (they're obviously not humanoid constructs so not homunculi). But in the end they're doing the same as conjured or transfigured animals.

Anyway, I'm not trying to discourage you. However, I am saying that the way it is now, the story isn't something I would like to read.
