If the enemy wizard can turn your gun into a fish, he could have turned you into a fish, or hit you with a killing curse. You might want to protect your gun against getting summoned, since that spell doesn't need to be aimed, but against Transfiguration? Be glad you're fighting an idiot who doesn't hex you but your gun!
