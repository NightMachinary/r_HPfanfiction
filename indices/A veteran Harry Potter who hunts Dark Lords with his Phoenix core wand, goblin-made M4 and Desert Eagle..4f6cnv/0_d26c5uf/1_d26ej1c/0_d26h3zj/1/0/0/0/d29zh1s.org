Shielding would block disarming for sure, and probably transfiguration, considering that it works against legilimency. Shields won't do anything to stop the killing curse though, which would be so much more fruitful than disarming his pistol. Keep in mind, too, if guns are going to be a thing, why aren't all the bad guys wearing WWW-style shield charmed clothing?
