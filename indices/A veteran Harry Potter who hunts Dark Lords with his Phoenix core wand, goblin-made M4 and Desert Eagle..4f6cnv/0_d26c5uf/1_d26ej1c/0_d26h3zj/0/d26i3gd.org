I want to see what happens when a mediocre wizard gets their hands on a case of flash-bangs and the goes after Death Eaters or whoever is the bad guy.

My opinion is that magic takes a great deal of concentration and flash-bangs ruin that if you aren't prepared. What could a wizard do in the 5-10 seconds for the enemy to recover?
