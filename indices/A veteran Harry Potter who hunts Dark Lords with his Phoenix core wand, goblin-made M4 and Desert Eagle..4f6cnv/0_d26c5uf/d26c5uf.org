Nothing good, I'm afraid. This all sounds like a very overpowered Harry roflstomping Dark Lord after Dark Lord.

Stuff like "corrupted Patronus" and "worth three Bombarda Maxima" let some serious alarm bells ring in my head. There have been fics like that and they have all been horrible. Why? I think that comes from the fact that great magic in the HP universe has very little to do with explosions and fancy lightshows. Wielding power in the HP universe was equal to wielding knowledge. Your proposed magic is all too... physical? I think thats the right word.

Also, the Goblins using muggle designs for their weaponry rubs me the wrong way. /If/ you need Harry to carry a rifle, think of your own, not one made for the US military. The Desert Eagle... sigh... If you're looking for a "cool" gun, go the full way and just hand Harry a Magnum.44 so he can be Dirty Harry.
