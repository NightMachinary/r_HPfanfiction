I gotta agree and disagree. The ar-15 platform is a bit boring as much as i love my .458 SOCOM in it. And Deagles are hella played out. But a 1911 or, better, a sutiably modified Webley would be cool.

He's coming from a future. So have him wield something from the future. Look at media with lots of gun play that happens in the near future then utilize a fictional weapon. OR have him having built his own magical firearm.

E.g., my Darkness!Harry story has firearms in it. Harry is introduced to the Beretta 93R by someone. And he thinks it's cool so that's the gun he uses. Had I wanted to go to rule of cool, I could have said a Kriss vector and just said "well, it was developed in the eighties instead of the '10s" in the story to facilitate its existence.
