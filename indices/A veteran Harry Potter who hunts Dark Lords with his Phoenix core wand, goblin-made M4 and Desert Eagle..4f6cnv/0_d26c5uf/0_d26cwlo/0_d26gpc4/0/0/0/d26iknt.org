I was more picturing a mass effect style weapon but I can see that as a first attempt that works, but the user always complains about it.

"Bang" the rune-gun went off, sending bits and pieces of the malicious Hag flying everywhere. "Shoot!" Harry yelled, as he waited for the runes to recharge, al the while running and dodgeing the Hag's friends claws. "Why doesn't this piece of crap have more than one shot?" He asked. "Why did you lose your wand?" Hermione replied, sending back ineffective stunners, which only seemed to encourage their attackers. After what seemed like an eternity Harry was able to squeeze off another shot, the sickly purple blast taking out another hag. Soon the hags where upon them, Harry vainly using the but of the blunderbuss to keep from getting pulled apart. After an exhausting 10 minute struggle they where finally able to get back to the civilized part of Knocturn Alley. Harry complaining all the way about how crappy the blunderbuss that saved their lives was. Hermione's first stop after they got out was Ollivander's to get Harry a new wand.
