Yeah, definitely a proof of concept style device. The next iteration I can see Hermione going for a three barrel model before refining to a revolver cartridge design before the working model that looks like Mal's firearm on Firefly(which was a dressed up Taurus Model 85 revolver to make it look like a space blaster).
