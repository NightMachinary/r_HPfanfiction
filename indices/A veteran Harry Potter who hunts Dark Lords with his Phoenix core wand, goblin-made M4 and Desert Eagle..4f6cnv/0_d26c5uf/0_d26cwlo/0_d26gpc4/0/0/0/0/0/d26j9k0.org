I can see Hermione skipping the three barrel concept and going to the revolver concept design, she knows that the mechanical aspect is possible and it's just a matter of getting the magical components to work right. I could see her going back to the three barrel design if the revolver initially proves unsuccessful but I see a bigger jump first. Of course it depends on how needed the final product is, a more urgent need gives rise to bigger jumps and more risks.
