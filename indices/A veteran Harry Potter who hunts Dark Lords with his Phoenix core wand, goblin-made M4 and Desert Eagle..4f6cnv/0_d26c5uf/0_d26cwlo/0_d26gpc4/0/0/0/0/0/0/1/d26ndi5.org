In my Darkness!Harry story, Ollivander is hired to design a wand/gun hybrid where the receiver of a firearm is made from wood while the slide and barrel and other components are normal. Instead of using his normal woods and cores, he uses stabilized leprechaun gold and I think ironwood to create the receiver. The firearms also receive a specialized fitting that resembles a gunlight with toggles on it, allowing the wielder to select between various functions of the firearm. It could then be used by a muggle as a regular firearm or as a magic 'caster by a magical person, throwing specific spells by buttons selected or switching between various combat loads.

Harry is preparing for a future where Humanity is no longer confined to one planet in the story.
