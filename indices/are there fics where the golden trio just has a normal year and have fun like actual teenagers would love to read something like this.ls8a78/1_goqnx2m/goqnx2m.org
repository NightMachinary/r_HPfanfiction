That's pretty much every year in linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay). Voldemort is an occasional minor nuisance; the real plot is about opening up the school to other magical species, learning to become Animagi, Ron latching onto space flight as an ambition that will let him stand out and building a magical spacecraft... And working out why it is that Nora the Norwegian Ridgeback seems to be learning to speak.
