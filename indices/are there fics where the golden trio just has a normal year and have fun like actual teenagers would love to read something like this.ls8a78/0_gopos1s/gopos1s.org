The Strange Dissapearence of Sally Anne is like this. Harry and Hermione try to figure out what happened to this missing student.

It reads a lot like the first few HP books. Just an innocent mystery. I haven't finished it but a lot of people have recced it and so far it is sweet. Big Philosophers Stone vibes.
