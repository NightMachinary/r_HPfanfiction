Well, this is awkward.

Author of ADKOW here with a startling revelation; I have never read A Beautiful Lie, as someone has already said, I was merely inspired by Half Blood Romantic.

That being said, I'm not discounting the fact that there are similarities, or so I'm told. From three near-identical launching platforms inspired by HBR, sharing similar themes or experiences is quite a large possibility.

If, however, I'm mistaking the subtext of the post and it is something more along the lines of â€˜Is this plagiarism?' I'd like to disavow you of such (hopefully).

If you do wish to discuss anything further, both my inbox and discord (who, as a matter of fact, also has the author of A Beautiful Lie in it) is open.
