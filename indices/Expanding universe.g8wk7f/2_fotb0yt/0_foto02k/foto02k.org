I already know about Northumbrian, in fact my question started from that author. I wanted to know if there was someone else who has done such work as the Northumbrian's work..... I wrote it in my first post but you didn't read it all, I guess

Thank you for answer anyway 🙏😊, you are just one of three who did it.

I guess, maybe, theee aren't so many authors who expanded the harry Potter world from book 7 without changing the canon story.

If you know something else, please let me know!
