- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The Secret Language of Plants series]] by Endrina (contains slash). First he's rescued from the Dursleys, then he runs away from Hogwarts. Starts with The Meaning of Mistletoe. linkao3(9323225)
- My Little Runaway by BlueRowley (unfinished). Harry keeps running away, Dumbledore keeps taking him back. Finally Dumbledore sends Snape to "scare him straight," but Snape ends up feeling sorry for him instead. linkffn(12698404)
- Shake It, Bake It, Brew It by Blackkitten23 (cracky, slashy, bashy). The writing style is rough but the story is fun. Harry runs away after he's essentially locked in to die. He discovers hidden potions and healing talents (AKA OP Harry). Snape is pursued by an amorous vampire (in a way that's uncomfortably stalkerish by current standards). linkao3(7637125)
- Extradition Escape by Tangerine-Alert. Harry runs away from Hogwarts to escape the Tri-Wiz, Ministry declares him a permanent fugitive. linkffn(13277595)
- Survival of the Fittest by Marcielle's Musings (unfinished). I think this is the one that [[/u/AlmaArachnidFriend][u/AlmaArachnidFriend]] meant, because Harry works at a bookshop in this. (He works at the Leaky Cauldron in Realizations, and didn't run away.) linkffn(7349133)
- A Time for Changeling by Bloodpage-Alchemist. Harry runs away when he realizes "Dudley" is a changeling. linkffn(5733297)
- Ripple Effect by daily-chan. Starts with the canon running-away after blowing up Marge, except instead of accidentally summoning the Knight Bus, Harry talks to the big black dog. linkffn(12489784)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1078446][Choices series]] by Lomonoaaeren (third story in progress). When the Hat resorts Harry into Slytherin, he tries to make the best of it. But Snape can't promise that he won't be sent back to the Dursleys, so Harry makes a desperate deal with a roommate's Death Eater father and runs away from the Hogwarts Express on the way back to London. First story is Other People's Choices. Direct link goes to AO3, also on linkffn(12271480)
- Overdue Protection by PadyandMoony (some bashing). Harry runs away from Hogwarts when he is harrassed for being a Parselmouth and the alleged Heir of Slytherin. linkffn(7434492)

Are you only looking for specific "running away" fics? Because there are also "time-traveller Harry is not putting up with the Dursleys this time" and "accidental magic that gets him away from the Dursleys" stories. I have several in these categories also.
