you opened this can of worms.... why I love Ron Weasley to the bone.

Let's just say I am a huge sucker for the whole 'underdog' character, aka the character who is just... less good at things compared to his peers which fit Ron very well, but despite this, he still takes on the same challenges and threats that Hermione and Harry does, even if he could just walk away at any time and live a much easier and less dangerous life, he stays by their side through thick and thin, even if he is nothing special in terms of power, intelligence or ability.

He is a loyal friend, the heart of the golden trio, and the guy that is a reality check to Hermione and Harry.\\
Without Ron, Harry would be a miserable lonely kid with barely any friends.\\
Without Ron, Hermione would be a secluded book-worm without any friends, spending all her time with her nose in the books, and not truly experiencing life to its fullest.\\
He is the guy that keeps them happy and bound to earth.

Also, I seriously think he gets a bad rep. Yes, he has made mistakes, but that only makes him human and relatable and people are way too quick to demonize him for his actions.\\
like examples:

1. people call him disloyal, despite sticking with Harry through it all. Yes, there was the fourth year, but he was a teenager going through a very hormonal part of his life with the added burden of his inferiority complex. I can fully understand that the tournament was just the straw that broke the camel's back after a lifetime of being in the shadow of not only his siblings but also his best friends. It had to come around at some point.\\
   Also before anyone mentions him leaving them at the Horcrux hunt, he was CLEARLY influenced by the Horcrux and in much worse pain than the rest due to him being splinched and therefor weaker due to him needing to recover from a heavy physical injury. If anyone blames him from that, they can try to cut off a piece of their arm and try to see how great a mood they are in, while also barely getting enough food to live and no true medical treatment.
2. people call him mean and a bully towards others, especially Hermione. Yet those same people tend to forget that Hermione is just as harsh towards Ron and equally guilty of being a bully at times and being mean-spirited towards others.\\
   Also, all those 'fights' Hermione and Ron have? It is rare it is actually a true fight where they get hurt emotionally. Hermione and Ron both love to argue with each other, they enjoy the exchange of words and ideas and just riling each other up, they both love it and it is rare it goes too far (and often when it goes too far, they are equally to blame)\\
   They even get offended if Harry says their arguments are annoying or tells them to be silent. That should be enough evidence that they like the 'fighting' and arguments.
3. people call him bad for thinking Slytherin's are bad.\\
   This one just makes me laugh. Yes, there is a lack of proper character-depth in the average Slytherin, but it is blatantly clear that Slytherin's are either A) Supporting Voldemort or B) Neutral towards Voldemort. When a Slytherin fights against Voldemort, it is the exception to the rule, the minority of a minority.\\
   If suddenly 1/4 of a school suddenly said they either supported terrorists killing my family or were neutral towards the idea, then I would be fucking pissed at that group as well and see them as awful human beings.

Not to say he is flawless, however, as he has many flaws as mentioned including, but not limited to: He can be lazy, (Lack of focus on studies unless needed badly and tends to rely on Hermione for aid)\\
jealous (speaks for itself)\\
loud-mouthed and often has a tendency to put his foot in his mouth and speak before thinking\\
a tad judgemental (Slytherins, even if I think that is somewhat justified)\\
can hold a serious grudge against those he feels have wronged him and when he gets angry, he is very stubborn about it.

So yeah, I fucking love Ron Weasley. He is a great friend, a stabilizing element to the Golden Trio. He has many great attributes, but many flaws that are VERY human and too many fans, often those who only watched the movie and thus got a wrong representation of Ron Weasley, tend to demonize him over unfairly, despite other characters having equally large flaws or just objectively worse flaws, yet them being ignored or straight up forgiven.\\
There are legit reasons to dislike his character, even if I disagree, but often I feel like those reasons are inflated to the extreme or just taken out of context (either accidentally or on purpose)
