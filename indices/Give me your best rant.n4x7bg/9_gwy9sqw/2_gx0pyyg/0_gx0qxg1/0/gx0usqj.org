They would still definitely become friends though.

Since in canon harry became friends with hermione despite finding her annoying at first.

Don't forget Harry still rempered that she ran crying to the bathroom and wouldn't know about the troll so risked his life to save someone he barley even knew so he couldn't have found hermione too unbearable thag they wouldn't become friends.
