sorry, I just don't see it.

Harry clearly found Hermione VERY annoying prior to the troll and never really argued in her favor. Not even when Ron made her cry before the Halloween feast.\\
He learned to accept and value Hermione after she calmed down with the rules, but before that he was not fond of her and how she was constantly on him about his actions.

also, I don't think we ever see any evidence of Hermione being 'marginalized' by the other girls. If anything she is the one marginalizing Lavender and Parvati due to their love for divination and their girly behaviour.\\
Anytime we see Lavender and Hermione at odds, it is surprisingly Hermione who is the instigator and starting the conflict.
