I think harry and Hermione would become friends even without Ron and the troll incident. Hermione is kind of marginalised in girls dorm due to her love for books, and not for boys and make-up. A boy who didn't have any friends and a bookish girl, both wish to have friends. Yeah I can see that happen pretty easiy.
