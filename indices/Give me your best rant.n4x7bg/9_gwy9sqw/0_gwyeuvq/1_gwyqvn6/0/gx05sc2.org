  â€˜Cause even Arthur hates Lucius.
#+end_quote

Lucius Malfoy tried to kill Arthurs only daughter out of pettiness. I am pretty sure Arthur had lots of reasons to hate Lucius even before that - and none of them has anything to do with him being Slytherin or a Malfoy.

Especially if you think about that Arthurs mother was most likely a Slytherin and from a equally "dark" family as the Malfoys are.

No, it's Lucius Malfoy and his actions Arthur hates.

I bet if Rose Weasley or Albus Potter start dating Scorpius Malfoy Arthur wouldn't give a fuck that Scorpius is a Malfoy or a Slytherin as long he is a decent human being.
