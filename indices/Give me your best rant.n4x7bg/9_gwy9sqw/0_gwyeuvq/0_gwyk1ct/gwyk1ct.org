I don't think anyone /really/ hates Slytherins. There's a bit of prejudice there because all the Slytherins they interact with on a regular basis are dicks and there's a general “Gryffindor rules, Slytherin sucks” attitude because they are competitors in a school competition, but it's not like Ron, Harry, or anyone else is actually going to hate someone or assume they're evil just for wearing a green tie.
