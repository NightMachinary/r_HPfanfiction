So this is probably very cliche but i choose draco.

I mean Harry Potter refuses to make friends with an 11 year old just cause his friend called him a death eater and slytherin an evil house. The fact Ron is prejudiced doesn't matter but when Draco retaliates and defends himself he's called evil. Draco insults Ron but Ron started it. And Mind you its an 11 YEAR OLD KID. A child shouldn't be called a death eater no matter what. Its not the childs fault on how his parents turned out. Ron has done nothing for his parents to turn out good. I understand that there is bad blood betweent he families but Ron us as bad as Draco but he is right cause his family belongs to the light side.

Moreover who do you think draco would've gobe to for refuge. Dumbledore..... the man who favors gryffindor. That is not a secret. Slytherin worked hard to win the slytherin cup in draco's first year but Gryffindor wins cause he murders someone. Regardless of who he is, it doesn't matter. In fact if things had gine wrong, haf the dig got out or something else, maybe if voldermort succeeded then what. It didn't matter that the Golden trio's stupidity could get the whole school in trouble.

Furthermore Mcgonagall gives Hermoine a time turner to attend extra classes. Now thats just stupid. The girl is 13. It doesn't matter is she's the brightest witch of her age, she's a kid.

Next Draco is crying in the washroom and Harry just enters and starts a fight like you dumb. Whatever the accusations, there is a time and way for things and when he almost KILLS DRACO he gets off with a detention. I assure you if Malfoy had died, they would've simply said good riddance.

Lastly kids are innocent and immature. Draco was a bully and he was prejudiced but what did ithers do to help. The others declated the 11 year ild boy evil. Kids are supoosed to be taught that whats good and what's bad. No one knkws this shit when they are born. Humans are different than animals cause we have the ability to learn and improve.

With the way JK Rowling writes, i think its safe to say she considers everyone else as monsters and only the golden trio as humans and their supoorters of course like bullshit. Like sure JK Rowling gave an amzing idea like amgic and all is cool but her olit sucks. Like its a horrible plot. Or not even the plot, the character development is what's wrong with the whole book. Like i can name fanfiction written better than the harry potter series and no Draco is not always the main character and the golden trio are never evil. They all work together. Draco learns form his mistakes, he is taught by people that whats right and what's wrong.

Furthermore there was no one to helo Slytherins or in fact any kid from dark fanily. They had no choice but to join the dark lord cause at least if dark side wwre to win they would get something. The light sode would always sneer on them based on their family names. So yeah there it is.
