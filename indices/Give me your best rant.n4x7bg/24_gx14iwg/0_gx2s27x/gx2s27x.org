  Harry Potter refuses to make friends with an 11 year old just cause his friend called him a death eater and slytherin an evil house.
#+end_quote

Harry met Draco in Madam Malkin's when they were getting their robes fitted.

First he started talking about trying to bully his father into buying him a broom to smuggle into hogwarts (which reminded Harry of Dudley).

Draco is the one who first talks about hogwarts houses "I know I'll be in Slytherin" and says he'd leave if he was placed in Hufflepuff.

He then proceeds to call Hagrid a servant and a savage (to Harry's first ever friend and the man who's introducing him to the magical world. Even if Draco doesn't know that, still not a great start.)

Moving onto shit on muggleborns "I really dont think they should let the other sort in, do you?".

Now with who actually starts the anti-slytherin brigade is actually Hagrid! Harry saying he'll probably be a hufflepuff hagrid responds with

"better Hufflepuff than Slytherin. There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one."

He doesn't say ALL Sytherins are bad, but on the other hand you can't blame him for holding a grudge since it was Tom Riddle who released a baslisk in the school and then blamed it all on Hagrid when a girl died (Moaning Myrtle). Also just to add when the chamber was opened again and Draco is talking about how someone does last time and how he "hopes it's Granger" that time. Personally that alone always makes me wonder why people think Dramione would ever work?? Moving on.....

  Ron is prejudiced doesn't matter but when Draco retaliates and defends himself he's called evil. Draco insults Ron but Ron started it.
#+end_quote

Ron doesn't actually say anything against Slytherin per se. He worried about what would happen if he wasn't put into Gryffindor like the rest of his family

...

"mum and dad were in it too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin"

"That's the house Vol- I mean You-Know-Who- was in?" [Harry asked]

"Yeah" said Ron.

...

And that was the end of it. Again, Ron never said anything directly against Slytherin but worried about what his family would say if he werent a Gryffindor. He never says

  Slytherin is an evil house.

  Draco insults Ron but Ron started it
#+end_quote

Personally it looks to me Draco started it. Introducing yourself like James Bond (even if you don't know who James Bond is) is always going to sound odd from an 11 year old. Technically all Ron did was cough at that but it was Malfoy who took offence and started throwing the punches with

"Think my names funny, do you? My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles and more children than they can afford. You'll soon find some wizarding families are better than other, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there."

Like seriously. Twice? That is two times you've just straight up degraded people you've barely met and never actually talked to, but actually happened to be people that have showed Harry nothing but kindness and friendship. Read the room my dude. Which he doesn't by the way!

Cauwe again its Draco that gets offended when Harry tells him he can tell the wrong sort for himself. He never explicitly says no to Draco's friendship but Draco doesnt exactly endear himself to a friendship with Harry by saying

"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter. Unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know what was good for them either. You hang around with riff raff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid and it'll run off on you."

Like if anyone is being antagonistic between Ron and Draco, I'm straight up gonna say Draco. And that's before Harry ever meets Ron if you count the Madam Malkins incident.

Yeah okay afterwards Ron starts telling Harry about the Malfoys

"I've heard of his family," said Ron darkly. "They were the some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they'd been bewitched. My dad doesn't believe it. He says Malfoys father didn't need an excuse to go over to the dark side."

  A child shouldn't be called a death eater no matter what.
#+end_quote

Ron never called Draco a death eater. But theres clearly bad blood between Mr Weasley and Mr Malfoy but if anything, both 11 year old boys appear to be parroting what they've learned from their fathers.

I don't know what the malfoys have against the light but I can understand why the weasleys might have something against the dark side, considering Molly's brothers were killed by death eaters.

So if anything the first person to call Draco a death eater was Harry in 6th year. And he was right.

Wow that response got pretty out of hand just for your first paragraph.... Sorry about that ðŸ˜…
