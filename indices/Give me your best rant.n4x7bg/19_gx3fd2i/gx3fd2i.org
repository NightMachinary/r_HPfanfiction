If we're talking about the books: shallow Slytherins, and Ron and Hermione are indeed sort of toxic. If we're talking about the movies: Half-Blood Prince is overall awful (which sucks because it is one of my favourite books), Ron's rant when he abandoned Harry and Hermione shouldn't have had its lines changed, and Voldemort's death destroyed everything the books built up. If I explain everything, I will write a book here.

Also: Cursed Child. Everyone talks about Delphi and all, but why in Merlin's name did Cedric become a Death Eater? I was going to give the book a try, but I gave up after I found out about that BS. This is probably the most out of character thing in "canon".

Fanfics: twincest, any relationship between minors and adults (why does everyone make Snape date Harry or Hermione????)

From an in-world standpoint: I hate Snape and The Marauders and honestly Lily lost my respect after I realised she thought James and Sirius hanging Snape upside down was amusing (she had to hide a smile). I get their story is sad, but at the same time, I can't sympathise with any of them. At best Lily and James because Harry didn't deserve to lose them. Also, Fred and George are jerks, why does everyone praise them?
