Now I like reading fan fiction from year one most times but what I hate is when they put the hat song in it and the sorting is the same besides Harry! Just get with the point make Harry focous on something else! Plus with the sorting you can say Harry was thinking about blah blah. Or focousing on the teachers and when he hears his name (and maybe his train friends) he pays attention. We don't need to know where everyone goes especially if they aren't important!
