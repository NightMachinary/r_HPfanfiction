The Dramione ship. I think that unless you are doing an AU where Hermione is dark from the start of the fic or where Draco has switched sides earlier, like in 4th or 5th year, it is a horrible pairing. It just doesn't work for me, because he is canonically xenophobic, and a Voldemort supporter by his 5th or 6th year. I get that when you are 11 or 12, you are more than likely just parroting your parents' views, but in CoS, he clearly states that he believes all muggleborns to die. In PoA, Malfoy is clearly stated to have been ignoring Hagrid, and then insults Buckbeak and expects Buckbeak to not react, despite Hagrid telling the entire class that they're “easily offended,” and that it ”might be the last thing you do.” To me, this ship is like writing a fictional story about Nazi Germany, and pairing a high ranking Nazi official with a Jewish woman. It just doesn't work for me, and I would like to know why people love it so much.
