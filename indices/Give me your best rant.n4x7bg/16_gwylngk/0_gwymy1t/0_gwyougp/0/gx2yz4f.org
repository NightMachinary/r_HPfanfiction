Well, in America, or at least where I live, stews can have carrots and onions, but they also usually have beans, potatoes, peppers and beef in them. Bread is just something to dip in your stew or to give variety to your mean so that you don't just eat soup only. It is similar to potatoes or rice, it's served with everything.

What's buttery mash?
