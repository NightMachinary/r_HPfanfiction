Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw's colours in fanfic VS canon

In fanfiction it seems like a crime if a Gryffindor character wears green; one of the most favorited "prank" seem to be the Marauders/the Weasleys/ Harry to dye something from the Slytherins in red and gold. Like wearing the colours of another house is very embarrassing.

I only realised that recently - because that's such an big deal in fanon, that I started to believe there are some roots in canon. Turns out there isn't:

The robes Molly buys for Harry in fourth year are green, nobody gives a f*;

The main colour of the Malfoys sitting room is red;

The Burrow doesn't show any Gryffindor-colours;

Ron's room is orange, because of his Quidditch-Team;

Slughorn's party decoration is mostly golden;

The only two characters who ever had colour-coordinated rooms were Sirius and Regulus Black - and let's be honest here: that was classic teenager rebellion/angst. Sirius' mother wasn't happy that he was in Gryffindor - so his whole room became red and gold. Regulus wanted to show his parents he is not like his brother - so his room became silver and green. If you look at those rooms Sirius and Regulus were the most teenagiest teenagers in a series full of teenagers - and we didn't even get to know them at that age really: it's in their rooms alone (and I give it to J.K.R - that is a writing/characterization masterpiece).

Anyway - back to my point: the only two characters who ever gave a damn about the house colours are two (troubled) teenagers. But in Harry Potter fanfic it is treated like that is some thing even adults really care about.
