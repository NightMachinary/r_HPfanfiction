Yes, thank you. If you wrote me as a self insert waking up as an 11 y/o British Muggleborn you'd have to write me bawling my eyes out about the magna carta, Amnesty International, and how I'd be expected to join a society where I have no rights to be certain of.

Innocent until proven guilty? A fair trial? Well, chat with either Sirius or Hagrid about that. And Fudge during Harry's trial for that patronus? "Laws can be changed!" Are we all going to ignore that Ex Postfacto?

There is so much so incredibly wrong with the wizarding world that if I were a Muggleborn, I might seriously consider handing out leaflets where I printed all my grievances, before setting myself on fire in the Diagon Alley out of protest.

And that is not even going into how MACUSA isn't made any less horrible in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Are we all going to gloss over how Magicals aren't allowed to befriend or marry NoMaj's? That's an Apartheid Regime! And what about the execution at the MACUSA? Robbing one of their memories first? That is robbing a human being of ones Self, unmaking them, before going to kill them for something they don't even remember anymore? Please give me somewhere to hurl.

I appreciate canon Hermione's activist spirit, but I don't understand for the life for me why she as a marginalised individual, who knew exactly how precarious her position as a Muggleborn was shortly after the fall of Voldemort, and how many Death Eaters got off with an "oopsie daisy imperiousy"; who had seen how Harry had no protection from the press as a minor, who was slandered; did not have the bright idea to secure her own human rights first.
