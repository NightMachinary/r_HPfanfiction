Seriously. I hadn't even thought too much about the politics in the hp world but this is so true. That the governments of at least 2 magical societies are this corrupt and vile doesn't bode well for the rest of the world, and these are in britain and america. I don't even know if Rowling knows the kind of horrifying world shes created. My whole point of contention are the spells and potions and just how fucked up some of them are. I don't know if she knew the implications of a spell that can completely erase a persons memory, lockhart makes me think she might have, but the love potion being legal makes me think otherwise. If i was put in this world, i would suffer through hogwarts, and then immediately nope the fuck out to go live as a hermit in some dark corner of the world.
