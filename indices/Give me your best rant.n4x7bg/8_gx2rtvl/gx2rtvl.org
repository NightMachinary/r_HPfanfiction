I find it really funny when people rant about how many points Snape takes totally unfairly from Gryffindor and how many he gives to Slytherin.

Like, he doesn't take from his Snakes, but he barely gives, either.

In the first book Mcgonnagal takes 150 points from her house in one night and gives detention in the murder forest for being out of bounds at night; but Snape is evil for wanting to expel Harry and Ron after they break multiple rules and several LAWS.

Bitch about Snape being an arse. Don't bitch about things that have been blown out of proportion for the sake of bitching.
