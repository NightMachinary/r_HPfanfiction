Rowling fucking SUCKS at trying to write a diverse world. I get that it's a given, considering she's a TERF, but c'mon dude.

The main School for Magic in East Asia is in Japan? Ah yes, Japan, which is much younger than China, and also has an entirely different language from the multitude of other countries, and is guilty of many war crimes against other East Asian countries. Sure. Filipino people totally wanna send their children to Japan for schooling. Sure.

There's only one magical school in Africa? Like there aren't a considerable amount of countries and languages that vary? Just three schools in Europe? Just the fact that Hogwarts is the only school still surprises me honestly. I guess it could fit more for them, but for other areas, I highly doubt that it would work. She really is short-sighted on that shit.
