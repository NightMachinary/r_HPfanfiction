I remember there was a part about when the competitors families were visiting in the books for the last task the weasleys had come for harry.

The quote was something along the lines of "Fleur was eyeing up Bill's long hair and fang earring with interest." I often took that as read that that was Fleur the one who chased Bill, not the other way around. Hence why, if she found out about him working for Gringotts, would make sense she would seek work for a "chance" encounter.

Also this is probably mostly based in fanon, but I do accept it, that Fleur being part veela means that she often has men of all ages falling over themselves for a chance with her (considering how say Ron and Roger Davies acted around her plus how the wizards reacted to the full veela at the quidditch world cup).

I feel that Bill probably wasn't just with her for her looks or affected by her Veela powers and she really appreciated that fact and that actually made them able to have an actual relationship instead of someone just looking for a trophy wife.
