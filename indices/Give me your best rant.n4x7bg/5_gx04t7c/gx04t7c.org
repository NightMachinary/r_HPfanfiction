Why the fuck did Fleur Delacour get a part-time job at Gringotts to improve her English?

I'm putting the “Fleur was a favorite to be chosen as a Champion” and manipulative!Dumbledore messes with the Goblet of Fire shit from fanon and movies aside.

When the Goblet of Fire announces the champions in the books (please feel free to correct me if I am wrong) Harry mainly recognises her for her looks, not because of some silly entrance pirouette.

  “It's her, Ron!” Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.

We know it was a great honor to be chosen, and some of the other Beauxbatons students took the Goblet's decision differently than, hm let's say, Angelina Johnson.

  “Oh look, they're all disappointed,” Hermione said over the noise, nodding toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. “Disappointed” was a bit of an understatement, Harry thought. Two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms.

I think it's safe to assume that Madame Maxime wouldn't take some average students to compete at the Triwizard Tournament -- meaning that Fleur was one of the best.

We also know that Fleur was quite passionate about it:

#+begin_quote
  “Why should 'e complain?” burst out Fleur Delacour, stamping her foot.“'E 'as ze chance to compete, 'asn't 'e? We 'ave all been 'oping to be chosen for weeks and weeks! Ze honor for our schools! A thousand Galleons in prize money --- zis is a chance many would die for!”

Fleur was not only highly skilled and undeniably pretty; she was brave, and as we get to see later, caring. Even if we skip everything that happened to her before the Third Task, come on -- she was attacked by a fellow champion who was under the Imperius Curse, the second champion died, and the third one came back with a corpse, tortured and with a sliced arm, claiming that a DARK LORD CAME BACK TO LIFE.

What does Fleur do next? She moves to LONDON.

Not only that, she does it almost immediately -- Harry came to Grimmauld on August 6th 1995 and he finds out that Bill already works with her at Gringotts.

Why? To improve her Eenglish. NO. Just no. This makes me so mad. Fleur Delacour is NOT a character who is “wordly” #wanderlust #travel. NO. She laughed derisively when Dumbledore wished them welcome upon their arrival, she shamelessly sat with a muffler wrapped around her head and was completely displeased with foreign food and disliked HOGWARTS.

J.K.Rowling made such an amazing, complex character and completely ruined it for me. What was the point of her coming back? Having a wedding in the seventh book? She could have easily used Remus and Tonks for that one. It would have even been a bigger thrill; Remus being a werewolf and Tonks being an auror estranged from her pureblood family, mainly the murderous Death Eater aunt.

Just... ruined. I know it's silly since it's a minor character, this probably is not even worth to rant about, but it really irks me. Don't even let me get started on Tonks or Ginny. Yikes.
