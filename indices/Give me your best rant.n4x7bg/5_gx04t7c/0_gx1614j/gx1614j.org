I'd like to add to that that Bill Weasley was born in 1970 and Ron in 1980. As someone with siblings both 10 and 12 years older I'd like to say you have zero common ground with your siblings life experiences, social contacts and interests at the age of 16. Sure, you love your siblings, but there is a certain disconnect there.

If I were 16, and my sibling came home with a girl I went to school with, who was only 3 years older than I, I'd be overcome with a certain "ick" feeling. This is a sentiment my brother shares because I know he expressed as much to me when I was 16, and one of his friends introduced him to his 16 y/o girlfriend. I am pretty sure that was one of the reasons their 2 decades of friendship sort fizzled out shortly after.

That shouldn't be any different from Bill when he ran into the girl his kid-brother's best friend had to compete against in school at his job. The second he heard her age he should have instinctively planted her right between Percy and the twins, age wise. You know, his significantly younger siblings.

It feels extremely predatory. And it should have definitely felt that way for Bill as well.

I would have found Remus & Nymphadora's marriage a lot more palatable to read more about despite their age difference being larger solely due to the fact that Nymphadora was older by the time she fell for Remus and was in a secure financial position by having a job for some time, and had family to fall back on within the country.
