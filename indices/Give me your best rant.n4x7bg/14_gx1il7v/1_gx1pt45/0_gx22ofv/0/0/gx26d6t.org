I agree than fans can interpret her anyway they wish without also saying that canon tonks is not real.

Regarding tragic romance and pregnancy, that's what I found so nuanced. I know so many people like tonks who had a similar life trajectory. I am in a profession similar to tonks (not police or any armed force, but similar) and am surrounded by women like her. While most do not go this way, a proportion do fall in love tragically and get pregnant. I really appreciated that jk upended expectations there. You meet tonks and you think she's gonna be badass all the way through and fight the war properly but another aspect of real life happens.
