I think you're mixing several things there. Tonks in book canon was a cool character whose value was then nerfed. Nat Tena did a smashing job with what she was given, but that wasn't much. Your suggestion that fans had coded her as Trans and were upset by her being treated as just another girl, I partway agree with and disagree with; sure, she filled a masculine role with a special power that suggested uncommon gender and/or sexuality, but I don't agree that her falling for and marrying Remus invalidates the suggestion. The fact that one of the most competent characters around was sidelined for a tragic romance and ill-timed pregnancy is what drives me batty.

The last bit I have no idea what's going on there. The only thing impossible for Tonks in fanfiction is marching. Being evil comes a close second, but I've seen it done.
