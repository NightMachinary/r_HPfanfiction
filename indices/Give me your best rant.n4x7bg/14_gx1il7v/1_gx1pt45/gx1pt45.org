  1. Tonks was coded trans and then made to marry Remus--I know many people just like Tonks who are cis-het. With her personality, you can't just say 100% that she was trans. Why can't you be an amazing auror, cool, a tomboy and be cis-het?

Also worth mentioning that Tonks' possible trans/poly-ness doesn't preclude hooking up with Remus, a character allegorically tagged as AIDS sufferer and who was originally 'played as gay' by the actor. There are a mansion of wrongs done to Tonks in her character's portrayal, and this isn't more than a ripple in the carpet (that Tonks would no doubt trip over anyway).
