My biggest rant issue right now is all the people saying JKR is a terrible writer in HP fan sites across Reddit and tumblr.

Like every concept that you're writing about from magic ones like disillusionment charms and dementors to extremely complex characterizations like Sirius and Remus, to the childlike fun in Fred and George or Ron's snark are all her creation.

Their favorite is that JKR sucks at world building. The HP world is literally the best world building in a book. All YA adults strive to be like her and are not as enjoyable.

Another is that JKR does poor characterizations. Said my authors who are writing Remus as a timid cinnamon roll and Sirius as a playboy or Harry as some superman asshole and Hermione as a shrill do-gooder. JK's characterizations are so on point and real compared with the many stereotypes in fanfiction.

Finally, they say JKR was anti many things in her books: 1. SPEW shows JK against social justice and activism-- the SPEW arc is one of my favourites as it is SO REAL. The people you save have often internalized abuse and the way it plays out is pitch perfect. 2. Tonks was coded trans and then made to marry Remus--I know many people just like Tonks who are cis-het. With her personality, you can't just say 100% that she was trans. Why can't you be an amazing auror, cool, a tomboy and be cis-het? 3. JKR is anti-diversity--Given the time the books were written, they were at the time celebrated for their diversity. She had all ethnicities, sexualities, etc. Its like damning Jane Austen for not making any of her female characters an engineer.

I can understand people saying JKR is a terrible writer in a Margaret Atwood fan site. Sure, thats not a forum dedicated to a world created by JKR. But in a HP fansite? You're literally proving the opposite of what you're trying to say.

BONUS: also not a fan of fanfic where author clearly hasnt read the books and rants about inconsistencies that were discussed in detail in the books.
