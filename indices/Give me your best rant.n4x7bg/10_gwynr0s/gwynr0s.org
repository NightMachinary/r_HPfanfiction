The last two books were terrible, but especially HBP. Many of the characters were completely OOC and I hate the whole "Malfoy trying to kill Dumbledore" plotline. Ginny Sue also makes the book completely unbearable, as well as Ron and Hermione's annoying antics. I skip HBP on my rereads now, can't stand it.

Other stuff I dislike:

1. Sirius's death was a complete ass pull by JK Rowling since she didn't know what to do with him.
2. As much as I like him, Ron acts like a dick sometimes. I heard another person say that Harry should've popped him at least once and I completely agree.
3. What the fuck was that epilogue? Those names were awful and the whole thing felt like it cheapened the series to me.
