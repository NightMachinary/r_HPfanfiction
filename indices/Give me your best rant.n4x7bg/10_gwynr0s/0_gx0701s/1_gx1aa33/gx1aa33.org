I think the stories suffered alot from things she wanted to do cuz she thought it was good or cool but it fucked up the story to make it work

Like Snapes Redemption should have been about him changing his mind about blood supremacy not his obsession with Lilly. But Rowling probably liked the doing things out of love narrative

Rowling wanted A marauder to leave behind a kid for Harry to adopt as the kids godfather as a parallel to his own situation. But she fucked over Tonk's character to do it and ruined so much potential with Tonks just to make a orphan right before the end of story.

What werewolves symbolize is interesting but then creating Greyback making him a werewolf supremacist who is psychotic and targets children....Rowling wtf

Tom Riddle paralleling Harry is interesting and neat Except you made the biggest leader for the blood supremacy movement a half blood who would probably be treated as a muggleborn by blood supremacists when he entered the Wizarding world knowing essentially nothing about it. It makes way more sense he'd hate wizarding elites as much as he hates the muggles . Him creating a movement that thrives on blood supremacy when he thinks hes half blood makes no sense . The half blood being the biggest threat to muggleborns and the biggest proponent of pureblood supremacy while he's fought by a group that mostly pureblood is weird. It should have been just him delving into dark magic
