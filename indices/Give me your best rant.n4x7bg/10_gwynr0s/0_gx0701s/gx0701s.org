Sirius is one of my favorite characters, and I like to think that he would have suffered the same fate as Remus had he lived to Deathly Hallows.

I've been thinking lately, you know that bad Remus Lupin moment at Grimmauld Place? It only happened because Rowling had this idea of /just the three of them/ going on the Horcrux Hunt, and I think she used Harry's loyalty to Dumbledore a lot here. But that wasn't enough. Simply saying that it's Dumbledore's orders is not enough to keep one of your father's best friends to help you. It's not real.

Hey, an experienced adult wizard who deeply cares for you want to help you with the extremely dangerous (and lethal) quest? No, thanks, it needs to be just Harry, Ron and Hermione. Ooh, we can make something important keep you away! A pregnant wife? Sure, let's roll with that.

She made Remus a bad guy here, but I don't think she had any other choice, really. She could have made him not come to them at all, but that would be out of character. She could have made Harry say that he made an Unbreakable Vow with Dumbledore, but Harry would then have to lie. If this weren't a young adult book, it might have been plausible, but nope. Having Harry turn into a liar right before their plan to steal from Umbridge... not good.

So Remus had to be a bad guy. Or dead.

Had Sirius been alive at the point, it would have been even harder to keep him away from the Horcrux Hunt. And even though I still get teary-eyed when I read that chapter in the Order of the Phoenix, I would rather have him dead than turned into someone with even more mistakes. We know he made a couple already.
