Alot of people shit on the marauders for the whole prank thing with Lupin and the Snapes worst memory incident.

So they make them feel guilty for that incident in fics and stop bullying Snapes post wolf incident.

But thats not really what happened Snape's worst memory was after the werewolf incident. Sirius and Lupin confirm their antagonism towards Snape didn't stop after the worst memory it was just less blatant all the time.

And this makes sense since its indicated this was a back and forth with Snape and his soon to be official Death eater friends vs the Marauders. And because Snape was actively stalking the Marauders to out Lupin as a werewolf

It also makes sense because this was literally during a war and Snape was openly supporting wizard Nazis in front of everyone but Lilly. Thats why everyone around them just watches because Lilly is in denial at this point but everyone else knows. No one is sympathetic to the actual Nazi being made miserable. Neither is Lilly once he calls her a slur and she can't be in denial anymore.

Its suprising to me that there aren't more fics making the marauders sympathetic in their feud with Snape considering he's a blood supremacist who supports a genocidal snake man wouldn't be hard to do.
