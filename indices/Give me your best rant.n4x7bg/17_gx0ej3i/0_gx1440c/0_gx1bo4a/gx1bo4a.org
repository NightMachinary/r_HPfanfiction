You raise some good points OP. I would just like to point out that JKR herself has described the Marauders' behavior as "relentless bullying" on several occasions and that the bullying started well before Snape displayed any blood supremacist views in 1st Year. I won't lie and say that later on as Snape got more and more involved with his roommates that he didn't gain beliefs in blood supremacy but he clearly didn't harbor those beliefs in the beginning. Later on Snape, became a piece of work, but in early days the Marauders targeted him for little to no reason in my opinion.

After all, let's not forget who started this whole feud. On the train James mocks him first by saying "I'd rather leave than be in Slytherin". If James had just said nothing and kept his nose out of what was meant to be a private conversation between Severus and Lily then nothing would have happened.

Snape did gain blood supremacist views later on in his life at Hogwarts(likely acquired due to his growing friendship with Mulciber and Avery) but the Marauders started bullying him way before all that. JKR herself says that James bullied Snape because he was jealous of his friendship with Lily, and since she's the author, I trust her judgement more than Sirius and Lupin saying they bullied him because he was "up to his nose in the dark arts". Jealousy was the root cause of James' desire to humiliate and degrade Snape, and that's why they bullied him(initially).

Furthermore, I'd like to ask you OP, why do you think Snape became friends with his roommates? Personally, I believe that they offered him protection from the Marauders in exchange for Snape's expertise and knowledge of Dark Magic. As far as Snape using Dark Magic debacle, I am of the opinion that he strictly learned and never used Dark Magic during his early years. Granted, Lupin describes Sectumsempra as a 'speciality' of Snape's but Snape only invented that spell in sixth year owing by the fact that he'd written it down(In HBP) in a NEWT textbook that Harry appropriates in 6th year. So in the first five years, Snape has not used any Dark Magic at all(not even one time) since Lily never flings that accusation at him and never confronts him about it.

I will not defend Snape in regard to his actions as a death eater because they are indefensible and frankly he was an evil bastard for joining Riddle, you and I are in agreement there OP. But Snape's tale is a cautionary one, ask yourself do you think if the Marauders had merely left him alone he would have grown closer with his housemates? Better yet, do you think he would have joined the DEs if he was just left alone to keep to himself during his school days?

Snape did support blood supremacists in his later years that much is true and I concede that, but the books indicate that he only accrued those views at a later date well after the Marauders started bullying him. So what is their justification for bullying Snape then in his early years(IE years 1-4) if he's not a blood supremacist? Dark Magic? Nope. He only invented Sectumsempra in 6th year after five years of bullying and Lily never accuses Snape of using dark magic(but she does accuse of him of associating with people that do use dark magic tbf). Was it because he's a Slytherin? Quite possibly, hardly grounds for justification for bullying someone simply because of their house but that might feed into their rationale. The Author herself said James was jealous of Snape because he had the one thing he could never have. So while they bullied him perhaps in later years because of valid reasons like Snape's views and his desire to join Voldy, I want you to know OP that the reason they bullied Snape first is because of jealousy.
