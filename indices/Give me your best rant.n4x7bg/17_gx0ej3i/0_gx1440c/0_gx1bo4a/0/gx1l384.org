Firstly Snape was already anti muggle before hogwarts . This is from his memories before hogwarts.

/"I know who you are. You're that Snape boy! They live down Spinner's End by the river," she told Lily, and it was evident from her tone that she considered the address a poor recommendation. "Why have you been spying on us?"/

/"Haven't been spying," said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the bright sunlight. "Wouldn't spy on you, anyway," he added spitefully, "you're a Muggle."/

He also already had anti muggleborn sentiments.

/Normally," said Snape. "But you're Muggle-born, so someone from the school will have to come and explain to your parents."/

/"Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born?"/

/Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale face, the dark red hair./

/"No," he said. "It doesn't make any difference."/

This isn't him deciding that being muggleborn isn't bad no matter what purity nonsense he's heard. This is him deciding Lilly is the exception. Something he further backs up when he goes to applogize to Lilly for the slur and doesn't get why being a bigot and making Lilly the exception would be bad

/"Slipped out?" There was no pity in Lily's voice. "It's too late. I've made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater friends-- you see, you don't even deny it! You don't even deny that's what you're all aiming to be! You can't wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?"/

/He opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking./

/"I can't pretend anymore. You've chosen your way, I've chosen mine."/

/"No-- listen, I didn't mean--"/

/"-- to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus. Why should I be any different?"/

As for James and Sirius they start their feud with Severus in my opinion to impress each other not because they feel any sort of way about Snape.

/"Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?" James asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile./

/"My whole family have been in Slytherin," he said./

/"Blimey," said James, "and I thought you seemed all right!"/

/Sirius grinned./

/"Maybe I'll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you've got the choice?"/

/James lifted an invisible sword./

/"'Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!' Like my dad."/

/Snape made a small, disparaging noise. James turned on him./

/"Got a problem with that?"/

/"No," said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise. "If you'd rather be brawny than brainy--"/

/"Where're you hoping to go, seeing as you're neither?" interjected Sirius./

/James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from James to Sirius in dislike./

/"Come on, Severus, let's find another compartment."/

/"Oooooo..."/

/James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip Snape as he passed./

/"See ya, Snivellus!" a voice called, as the compartment door slammed.../

James has a bias against Slytherin for unknown reasons but is loud about it . But he likes Sirius so far and Sirius would like to distance himself from his family as soon as possible and he getting along with this James kid. 

Snape makes a snide retort at James that's pro Slytherin. Sirius seeing pro Slytherin as the same as bigots like his family and wanting to back up this new kid he likes fires back.

James approves since Snape looks down on the house he is attached to and has developed a immediate distaste. Then Sirius joins him in mocking Lilly aka Snapes friend. They being little shits but little shits who don't care about anyone's approval but each others.  And from what little we see of them in school this continues to be their dynamic.

When James harrassing Snape in book 5 Snapes worst memory Lilly gets him to back off but when she leaves he goes right back to harrassing Snape even though at this point he likes her and knows she wouldn't approve. That doesn't matter. The person whose approval matters is Sirius. James starts dramatically fucking with Snape because they both hate Snape and like seeing him miserable. And he decides to fuck with Snape because Sirius is bored and wants him to liven up.

Not saying that a great thing because that's kinda fucked up. But it wasn't because of jealousy. It was because they enjoy fucking with people they hate/dislike as far as what they depict in the books. And why they do hate him is pretty open ended it never really explored. But given they join the Order hate blood supremacists and werewolf haters and dark magic users I dont think hating Snape cuz of his bigotry and interest in dark arts is a unfair assumption.

Because while sectumsempra may have been created only 6th year by him ( though I swear that was the spell he used end of 5th year on James in the memory but it is unspecified) Im sure he didn't just wake up first day 6th year decide to play with dark magic and make sectumsempra that same year.

Im fairly sure he'd been dabbling with the dark arts for a few years to come up with a good effective dark spell. (Also I personally think the Marauders got more vindictive after the werewolf incident because they were mad at Snape stalking them and trying to out Lupin and now they didn't have to worry about that but were still pissed at him. So while im sure it was pretty intense for a period of time before Snapes worst memory and probably for a significant time after, I think it started out pretty non intense. Snide comments mostly maybe trying to trip each other im assuming for a while. It started because they rubbed each other the wrong way and later the Marauders hated him for being a bigot.)

But what is in my opinion a unfair assumption is saying the Marauders influenced snape to become friends with death eaters because of their bullying when he was already a bigot before he ever met them. Not to mention that being bullied by two purebloods who happen to dislike blood supremacy doesn't immediately lead you to supporting genocidal blood supremacists especially not when your best friend is a member of the class they want to genocide. This is not a natural cause and effect.

As for interviews and stuff I dont really count those as canon. I only count whats in the books not just cuz Rowling has added weird shit into the world lately but also cuz interpretation of text should be able to stand on its own without the authors interviews death of the author and all that.

I will say its really questionable making halfbloods who would definetly be shit on and just flat out considered muggleborns by many pure blood supremacists be the ones who very on board with the beliefs and do so much to spread those beliefs. I say this both for Snape and Voldemort. Especially when so many of the Order are purebloods themselves ( in Harrys time anyway).

I get why Rowling did it given the themes of the book and what it added to Harry's story. But once you look at just Voldemort or Snapes stories and the overall blood supremacy movement and its impact it had it makes less sense.
