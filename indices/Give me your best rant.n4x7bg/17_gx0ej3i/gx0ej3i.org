Be prepared, hot take incoming here and it probably won't be well received by you guys but fuck it here I go.

People need to cool off and calm the fuck down about the whole Snape bullying thing. Here's my opinion. I don't give a fuck that he's a bully. That's right. Snape is a bastard, and a dickhead, and a nasty person to be around unless you're a Slytherin or a member of the staff...that said, I don't give two shits about his 'bullying' of students. It's blown way out of proportion and people hate on the man way too much. He's a dick to students? Big fucking deal. Even the Neville's greatest fear thing is blown /so fucking far out of proportion by some people in this fandom that it's fucking mind boggling./ If you take the time to re-read PoA again, you'll realize the whole thing was a fucking joke! Even Neville was laughing at it because the idea was outrageous. The entire class was laughing because Neville didn't want to admit it and even he had a laugh about it!

I find it hilarious that people have so much outrage on Harry's behalf about Snape that even when the man himself forgives him, people can't seem to let go of their hate for a fictional character. I've even seen takes of people saying he's worse than Riddle, Umbridge and Bellatrix combined like WTF? How the hell is being a dickhead and insulting students worse than torturing people to insanity or orchestrating genocide? Honestly. Snape is a dick but he's just that, a dick. People try to make him out to be a child abuser when he's just an asshole. The Snape hate in recent years is so far gone it's hilarious. Seriously folks, he's a dick head, not the devil, not a child abuser. And I might be one of the few people here that likes the fact that he's a dick to Harry. Whenever they're in the same room I love their interactions and the fact that Harry doesn't back down makes them even better. Most people hate Snape because he constantly rails on Harry and that's cool...but I'm the opposite, their mutual antagonism is great and I love the fact that he's an asshole.

If you're the second or third most important person to saving the wizarding world (Behind Harry and arguably Dumbledore IMO) then you earn the right to be a dick to those around you. People blow Snape's assholery way out of proportion and say it's 'unforgivable' and Snape doesn't deserve any forgiveness whatsoever. Since when is being a bad teacher and an asshole an offense punishable by rotting in the seventh level of hell?
