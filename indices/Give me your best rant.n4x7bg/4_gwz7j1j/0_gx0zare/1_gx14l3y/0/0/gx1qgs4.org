I mostly agree. I think JKR did a pretty good job of showing that students don't always fit their house's stereotypes (ex. Pettigrew, Cedric, Luna). For instance, not all Slytherins are canonically evil (ex. Snape, Regulus, Slughorn), /however/ they aren't necessarily the 'epitomes of good' either. So I do agree that JKR /could/ have done a better job of including students at Hogwarts that were against Voldemort.

Out of curiosity, how do you think the Slytherin students could have helped out the 'light' side? I'm pretty sure the DA was invite-only, and it wouldn't have made sense for a Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, or Ravenclaw student to invite a Slytherin.
