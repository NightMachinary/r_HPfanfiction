Well, usually in books you have your 'main characters', your 'minor characters', and then your â€˜background characters'.

The main characters usually get the /most/ development, while minor characters may get /some/ development. (This is just a generalization btw.)

Background characters, on the other hand, are /meant to be in the background/. They're not meant to be fleshed out.
