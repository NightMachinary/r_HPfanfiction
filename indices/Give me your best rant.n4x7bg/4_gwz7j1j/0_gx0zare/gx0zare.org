Honestly everyone outside of the weaselys Harry and Hermione at school were really under developed. There should have been more focus on the other students like when Hermione got paralyzed in book 2 other students should have gotten involved helped Harry with the chamber bs. Harry should have bonded with others in his grade fleshed them out when he couldnt go with Ron and Hermione in book 4 and when he and Ron have the fight in book 4. More people from other houses should have joined Dumbledore's army including other Slytherins. That would have made the battle in book 7 be so much more meaningful.
