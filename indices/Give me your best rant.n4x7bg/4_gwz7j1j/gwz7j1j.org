How neglected other characters are.

Slytherin house is hated on so much from the fanfics I've seen, and almost everyone is evil and agrees with pureblood bullshit.

If Rowling made say-Blaise Zabini or Daphne Greengrass becomes friends with Harry and flesh their personalities out, it would be so much better! It would be a fair show of Slytherin and show that NOT ALL SLYTHERINS ARE FUCKING EVIL. That shit is so ridiculous. Oh, so if you wear a green and silver robe in 7 years of school and it means you're evil forever?! That's like saying all Gryffindors are nice and noble and oh wait, Peter Pettigrew clearly wasn't like that now was he?
