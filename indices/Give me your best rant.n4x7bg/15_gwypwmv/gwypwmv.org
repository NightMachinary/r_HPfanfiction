The instance of Harmione. Just cause Harry and Hermione were close. I mean Harry is constantly searching for a family so of course he cares for Hermione. But I feel like all those who ship Harry and Hermione do not have a best friend who is not their same gender cause it's awesome and it is platonic and it lasts a life time. Also, Hermione. I really don't get all this love for her I mean she is so full of herself and the world is so black and white to her which considering that her whole world view exploded when she was 11 is incredible!
