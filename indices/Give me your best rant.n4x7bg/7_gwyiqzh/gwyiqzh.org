Romance should almost always only ever be massively important in romance fics, nothing else. If the pairing takes over the plot in a fic that was not romance tagged, shit /will/ get burned.

If y'all don't like something in someone else's request post, then leave the post. Don't say shit. That post is for someone who /does/ want it. Move on. You are not the target audience.
