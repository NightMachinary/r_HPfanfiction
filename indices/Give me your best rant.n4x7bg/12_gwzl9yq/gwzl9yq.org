Shape's ONE act of sacrifice is NOT in ANY way enough to make up for six years of bring an absolute douchebag to Harry.

Snape was a simp for Lily, but it's hard to keep the girl you like around when you throw the magical equivalent of the N-word at her. No wonder she got sick of him! And then he gets all pissy, snoops on the prophesy, tells Voldemort, which CAUSES the entire shit-show he got himself into....so protecting Harry wasn't even him being selfless, he just spent years making up for a huge fuck up that HE committed!!

Harry was foolish to name his son after that greasy pile of shit.
