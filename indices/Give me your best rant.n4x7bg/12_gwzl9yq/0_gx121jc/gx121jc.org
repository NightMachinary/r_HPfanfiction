Not to mention that when he does go to applogize to Lilly he's not applogetic for being a death eater supporter he thinks its fine if he supports mass genocide of all muggleborns and thinks its perfectly acceptable to do this and be friends with s muggleborn as long as he makes that one muggleborn a exception to his biggotry

He's still a believer in blood supremacy when he joins Dumbledore and only joins because Voldemort is targetting and later killed Lilly. He still supports genocide. The one good thing about him is his views changed at the end he doesn't support blood supremacy. But that's not what Rowling treats as his redeeming feature its his obsession with a woman who wanted nothing to do with him.
