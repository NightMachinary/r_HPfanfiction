  so protecting Harry wasn't even him being selfless, he just spent years making up for a huge fuck up that HE committed!!

He wasn't even trying to protect Harry - imo didn't manage even the bare minimum. He spied for Dumbledore, yes - but casting /one counter-curse/ in first year does not count as protection, especially considering all the other shit he pulled. He was supposed to be the adult, and he acted like a toddler with a stolen toy for the six years of Harry's schooling.

He hated Harry until the day he died, and he /could not/ find redemption without a massive personality rewrite. Which didn't happen.

Greasy pile of shit, indeed.
