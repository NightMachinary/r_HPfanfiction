Dobby was not enjoyable to me. He was an insane self abusive rat person who decided to hurt harry for a year because he couldn't speak badly about his masters despite implying it plenty. And he knew something was going to happen at hogwarts enough to start hurting harry as soon as the summer started with stealing letters even though lucius doesn't seem to have had an actual plan. It was in many ways the least likely scenario for tom to manifest as lucius plan involved handing a sentient book to a girl whose father identifies and destroys sentient objects at his day job.

He refuses to listen to harry when he asks him to stop and actively sought to get his guardians to hurt him. And ultimately he could see harry seemingly constantly but never offers any help with the basilisk.
