These are such strange things to get on a soapbox about.

Sure, there are a lot of popular fics out there that are basically repetitions of the same plotline, but certain ideas are popular for a reason. And it does frustrate me to see fics with atrocious grammar getting tons of praise, but, like, if it's not your thing, just move on. People like what they like.

I agree about the Hadrian thing. I find it really cringeworthy when Harry's name is implied to be anything other than Harry, and I feel like Hadrian became a popular choice because it's a "cooler sounding" name than Harry. Eyeroll. Still worst fanfic sins have been committed.

I both agree and disagree about the abuse. I agree that a lot of authors throw in horrible abuse for shock factor alone, or as a plot device that is quickly scrapped once it serves its purpose. But I've seen it handled incredibly well in a lot of fics, even when the writer portrays the Dursleys as physically abusive. It's not unrealistic for them to have gone that far in canon. They wouldn't have tortured him, but I can definitely see Vernon and Petunia smacking him around. There was even an instance in book 5 when Vernon tried to choke Harry.

The person who wrote this rant is /completely/ disregarding the canonical abuse Harry experienced. The Dursleys weren't "slightly verbally abusive"; they were highly verbally/mentally/psychologically abusive towards him, and in a normal world he would have been incredibly damaged by it. He was made to feel unloved, unwelcome, burdensome, and worthless his entire childhood, and he spent ten years with absolutely no positive relationships in his life. There's no realistic way he could have emerged from that unscathed. In canon he was periodically locked up for days on end without regular meals, to the point where he had to sneak out at night to feed himself.

It pisses me off that the person who wrote this rant talks about the Dursleys treatment of Harry like it's nothing.

There, that's my rant.
