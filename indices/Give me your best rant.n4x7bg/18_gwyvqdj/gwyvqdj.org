This is not my rant but it's impressive nonetheless.

  So, recently I have been reading Harry Potter fanfictions on this site and on others, and I must say, many people get way too much love for stories that deal with the exact same concepts as hundreds of other authors. And to make matters even worse, many do not write in a manner that makes sense. And yet, these stories get thousands of followers and favorites, along with hundreds of positive reviews. It sickens me that so many people are so desperate for the same cliche plot and characters that authors that basically steal ideas from others can get a large following. Has the bar for writing really sunken so low? Have hundreds of people really forgotten the quality of the source material for HP? JK Rowling may be a bit of a bitch, but that doesn't take away from her writing at all. The fact that so many people seem to be pleased by, /dare I say it,/ horrible stories with dialogue and actions fitting of nothing of HP's caliber.

  I did not mean to rant, but it just upsets me. I will be going out of my way to observe canon and preserve characters as best I can. I also want my story to have an air of originality that is not as common as I would like. With that being said, fan fiction is basically the concept of changing that which is already written. There will be some changes in this. The changes I make will be provided with a background as I hate it when authors just make random changes without context or reason. For example, the name HADRIAN for HARRY drives me crazy in fan fiction. The concept of changing Harry's name is okay to a certain extent. His name is Harry, but logically, it could be written in a way where it stands for either Henry or Harold, or another name that Harry could be a nickname for. A boy named HADRIAN would not be nicknamed Harry under any circumstance. Another thing about that is that in no way is Hadrian a name that would be commonly seen in the area of the world in which HP is set.

  The last thing I want to address is the cliche use of child abuse to further the plot of an HP story. I find that concept sickening and wrong, as child abuse is used by hundreds of authors as a plot device. Child abuse needs to be taken seriously. It happens in today's world every day, and yet, somehow, fan fiction authors have decided that it is a good way to make minor changes to Harry's character. When was the last time a fictional story that is published did well while using child abuse as a plot device? NEVER! I'll answer that question for myself. There are other ways to do make changes to Harry's character without having the Dursleys abuse him. Yes, they were slightly verbally abusive to him, and he might not have received a full meal every meal, and he might have received an unfair level of chores for a boy his age. However, in no way does physical abuse need to be included.
