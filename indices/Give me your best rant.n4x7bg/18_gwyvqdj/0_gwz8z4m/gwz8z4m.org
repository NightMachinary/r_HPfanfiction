I'm honestly a bit saddened by this rant (no shame on you for posting it). I feel the need to rant just a bit in response (again, not aimed at you but at the original poster of this). I think sometimes we forget that a lot of people write fanfiction for themselves. For many people, it's a hobby or a way to improve their writing. Lacking originality or perfect writing doesn't make the endeavor any less worthwhile for the person writing it OR the people who enjoy the story. This is not about writing what "sells" or what someone considers to be original. It's about playing in the sandbox of a story we love. What's the harm in getting compliments for your work? What's the harm in encouraging a young writer to improve? Why does it matter that "bad" stories get likes and favorites? Clearly, someone likes them. AND THAT'S FINE!!

As for the point about child abuse, the post is right that it's sometimes over-used. Perhaps exaggerated. But I think most people who write those fics believe that they are portraying it in a thoughtful way. Whether it comes across that way is another matter altogether. For a young or inexperienced writer, something like child abuse can be hard to tackle. Also, the reason it's so prevalent is because it IS canon. What the Dursleys did was abuse, whether or not they ever actually hit Harry (which there is plenty of reason to think they did). As for the claim that child abuse never makes popular stories....I beg to differ: Matilda, Identical (Ellen Hopkins), Carrie, etc. Actually, I think the trope of painting abusive guardians as just a slightly amusing reality of an orphan's life without ever addressing it (which happens in HP as well as (perhaps to a lesser extent) in Matilda) is far more damaging than some inexperienced authors taking things too far. Some of the emphasis on abuse in fanfiction is a response to the lack of acknowledgment in canon. Anyway, my point is really that we need to stop picking apart fanfiction like this. If people want to read all the Inheritance fics on ao3, that's great! If someone wants to write those fics, that's great too. I'm getting a little tired of all the negativity about what people like and what people write. We all have preferences, and we have the right to share them. But we shouldn't be acting as if our preferences are the only acceptable ones. Anyway, I'm very sorry for this rant. I'm just sad that we can't enjoy fanfiction for what it is: fans who want to dabble in writing.
