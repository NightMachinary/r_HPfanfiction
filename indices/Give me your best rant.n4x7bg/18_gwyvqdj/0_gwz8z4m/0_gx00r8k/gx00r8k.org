What annoys me the most about fanfiction and various medias in general is when people want to decide what's good and what's not, what should be popular...if you dislike inheritance fics ou bashing fics or whatever don't read them- but don't call the people who write or read them idiots- it's called taste people

I hate breaking bad, but who the fuc* says i decide if is good or if people should watch it or not- it's not my decision- i don't go bashing it randomly to people.

And about the child abuse- i agree that a lot of authors use it as a means to an end, but even them sometimes write about that impact better than rowling did- j.k made it seem like what the dursleys did was funny or light- that's worse in my opinion
