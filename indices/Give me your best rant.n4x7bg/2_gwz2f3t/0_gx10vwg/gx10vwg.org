Ron I think especially shouldnt have been the one to leave the second time since he left in goblet of fire. It just feels repetitive and like he hasn't grown when he has. Hermione left the group actively in book 3 but it didn't feel the same. Harry didn't get to miss her the way he had with Ron in book 4. Hermione leaving in book 7 would have let him miss her in the same way.

Ugh everything about Tonks bothers me in book 6. Nothing about her character in book 5 suggests that she would get so attached to a crush rejecting her that she would mope for a whole year shes 24 not 14. It really feels like Rowling wanted all the Marauders to die and one to leave behind a orphan for Harry to be the godfather of for a parallel and ruined Tonk's character and all the interesting potential she had just for a parralel. Just so she could have a kid and then die.

Also its really fucked up Remus was pressured into a relationship and then within months just had to accept becoming a father no time to even acclimatize to a relationship .
