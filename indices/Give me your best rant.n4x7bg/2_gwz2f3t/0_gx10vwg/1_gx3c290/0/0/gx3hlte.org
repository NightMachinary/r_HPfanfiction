I think at this age it's a grey area. If she was 19 or 20, I'd say she's too young, but at 22-24 you are supposed to be more mature already. The difference varies from person to person.

The problem is that we don't know much about them, especially Tonks, and we don't get to see how their relationship evolved, as you said. I agree that she shouldn't have insisted so much, but this might just be who she is, in the sense of trying to fix problems, fighting for people she cares about, etc. Tonks seems to be that sibling / friend who doesn't give up on you even after you gave up on yourself. It would make sense that she'd do the same for a romantic interest. Though, I agree that it was poorly executed.

Since we don't know them well, it could be anything. Maybe she was stressed out, which just added up to their issues, but she usually is better than that. Maybe she really is whiny and immature. We don't have enough information.
