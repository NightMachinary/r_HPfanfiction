I agree, it was badly developed and sort of meaningless. I think their storyline was created to show Remus being accepted by other people, since lycanthropy is supposed to be an allegory to HIV, but that isn't well done either. There is one "good" werewolf, one evil werewolf who infects people on purpose and is generally a vile person, and all the other ones on the background joining the bad one. Not prejudiced at all...
