I think thats how Rowling intended it. But in execution in my opinion it doesn't come out that way because you aren't shown you are told. Or at least it can be easily misinterpreted.

But also even if Remus fears rejection and feels hes not deserving and says no then the answer shouldn't be to pressure him after a funeral. They should have still waited till he became comfortable enough to engage with this voluntarily without outside pressure.

I dont think pining is inherently bad but it just seems inconsistent with the character you knew before. Especially on this level when its just a crush it's not even like they were together for some time but he broke up because of his self loathing. That I could understand more. Though Considering Tonks was only 24 at this point and Remus was 37 that age difference gets more squeamish for me if they started dating got together earlier when Tonks was younger.
