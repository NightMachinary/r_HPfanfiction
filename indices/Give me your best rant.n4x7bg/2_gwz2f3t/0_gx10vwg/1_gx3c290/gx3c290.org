To be honest, I can see Tonks' point of view on the relationship in another way. It feels like this person that she probably got to know better in the Order, especially since they both have strong feelings for each other, is sort of avoiding a relationship for fear. Remus fears rejection because he thinks he deserves it. Then Tonks has feelings for him and tries to make him understand that she knows about his condition and chose to be with him anyway. Remus is a great person, but sometimes his insecurities make him a coward, and the whole thing made me reckon that he fears rejection, so he rejects people first.

However, it still annoys me because she was too patient. I feel like Remus needed a lot of therapy before starting a relationship. I feel like she shouldn't have tried so much, not because it makes her whiny or whatever, but because he doesn't deserve it. She doesn't have to fix him.
