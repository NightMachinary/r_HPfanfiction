I'm currently thinking of rewriting a bunch of books in the series. I recently ran with the idea that someone made about Harry getting some of Lily's book that was written in Ancient Runes (I have a guilty pleasure for fics where Harry's super interested in history and Ancient Runes and Ancient Studies, so that's what I'm writing), and now I want to write an AU Goblet of Fire. That'll probably just follow the idea I got. I also had the idea of making Ginny a Parselmouth. I think that would be really cool to mention, and I have the idea of both Harry and Ginny apprenticing under Bill for Curse-Breaking. That'd be wicked. If you want to check out a scene that I wrote for it, I could link it?

Also, while I have a guilty pleasure for Harry being super abused, I'm actually going to have him and Petunia reconcile. Maybe Dudley, as well.
