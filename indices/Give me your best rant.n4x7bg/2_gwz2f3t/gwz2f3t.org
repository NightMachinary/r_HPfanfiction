Just a few statements on mis-used characters:

*Hedwig*.\\
In canon Hedwig is basically a symbol of Harry's connection to the Wizarding world, then an avatar of his anger, but then there's the Battle of Seven Potters. She's treated like an action figure accessory, stuck in a cage during an AERIAL battle, until murdered. At least in the movies they had the good sense to allow her to actively sacrifice her life for Harry.

Or howabout *Ginny*?

How much cooler would it have been in book seven if Ginny was the one to help Hermione and Ron down to the Chamber of Secrets. That sounds like an awesome scene to play out -- Ginny revealing that her exposure to the diary left her a parselmouth, then she has to return to the scene of the trauma, plus possibly being one to kill the horcrux in Hufflepuff's Cup. Totally would have proven her worth instead of an editorial note about her being Harry's 'soul-mate' or whatever.

Consider *Ron*, who in fanfic is sometimes made into Ron the Betrayer.

I wish that there had never been a canon instance of Ron turning his back on Harry. He stood by him to face giant fucking spiders and stood in front of him when he thought Sirius Black was going to kill Harry. It could have been a bromance of the ages, if Ron had been the one to stand up and say 'I believe Harry' when his name came out of the Tri-wizard Cup, and I think it would have been a better turn if Hermione was the one to get mind-bent by the horcrux enough to get separated from the trio in the last book.

Could you imagine that? Dumbledore believes in Ron enough to give him a book of fairy tales but hands the light-stealing/giving device to Hermione, knowing that she will become frustrated or might be lost along the way and need to find Harry again. When she leaves, EVERYONE would think Harry and Ron are essentially screwed. Ron would agree to visiting Godric's Hollow because he understands how important family can be to a person.

In her absence, the two men would fight but afterwards they would also confess their feelings for the girls in their lives. Ron would resolve to tell Hermione how he feels with Harry's encouragement... if they ever find her again. In the meantime, they'd listen close to Potterwatch in fear of hearing that she'd been captured.

Don't get me started on *Tonks* -- JKR invented this really cool character with awesome abilities who should have been central to the Orders strategy to monitor and undermine the Death Eaters' infiltration of the Ministry, and she's either stuck on babysitting duty, blubbering about because of a guy, or sidelined with a pregnancy. It's like 'We have Wonder Woman on our side. She's a great cook. I love her souvlaki.'
