I like the fics that explain or show that Hogwarts education still covers math and writing, it just incorporates them into the magical curriculum. In the UK that works perfectly because you don't really need the classes like you do in the US, you just need to be able to pass the qualification exams, and anyone can take those at any point in their life.

So as long as a Hogwarts student can study for and pass their GSCEs/SQCs and A-Levels, they don't need a Muggle school transcript at all.

That said, I don't think a Hogwarts education includes computers at all (given electronics aren't supposed to work there without protective charms), so a Muggleborn with no computer experience may be at a significant disadvantage in some job fields.
