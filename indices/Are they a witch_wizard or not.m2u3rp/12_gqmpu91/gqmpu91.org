Aside from getting in, which /can/ be solved (albeit unethically) via magic, the primary problem is lacking the basic knowledge to understand the thing you want to learn.

That said, universities generally offer remedial courses in even very basic topics, so as long as you can read and write in /some/ language and know basic arithmetic, you just will have to put in some extra work and stuff... the cost is in the extra time and tuition to catch up.

On the other hand, at least in my state (of the USA), there are mechanisms by which adults who don't have their educational credentials can take classes and earn the equivalent of a HS degree, which, depending on the precise structure of your local educational system, might be a cheaper way of getting the knowledge you need without having to resort to magical trickery.

Also, once you're into the late 2000s at latest, even if you're not submitting these apps online, there are going to be electronic records of everything, so... you might end up with serious problems down the line (like, an investigation might result in people concluding that you drugged/blackmailed/bribed admissions officers).

Although that opens the whole can of worms of how the hell the SoS is supposed to survive modern technology...
