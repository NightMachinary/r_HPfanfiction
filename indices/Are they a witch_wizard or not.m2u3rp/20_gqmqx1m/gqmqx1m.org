Muggleborn reconstruction/restoration business would be pretty dope. You just have people ship you old & broken shit, you fix it up with a few charms, they get their thing back good as new, you get to help people with magic.

Even better if you require the old people sending you cars and bikes and stuff to send along stories relating to the item, then you're really living ðŸ¥º
