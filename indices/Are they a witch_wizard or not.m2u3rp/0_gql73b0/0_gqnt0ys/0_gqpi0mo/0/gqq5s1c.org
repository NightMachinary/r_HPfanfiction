High school sciences are not difficult, apart from the last two years, school is more about getting social skills than education. Besides there are plenty of institutes which offer coaching for entrance exams of college for students who take a gap year, and I know many people who do it. Besides if someone choose to enter STEM after hogwarts, I assume they have high intellect and can do it.
