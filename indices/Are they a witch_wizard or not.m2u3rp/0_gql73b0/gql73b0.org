I guess it depends on which field they persue. Because their knowledge would be seriously lacking. Take Math related subjects for instance. I think Arthimancy was the closest to Maths and students like Harry that didn't take it only got primary school muggle education. They'd have to catch up or act as a phony ig. But at least they should have mastered writing formally with all the essays they had to do lol.
