I see two main issues with this. First is the competence part - Hogwarts does not compare to a Muggle education in most respects. No science, no non-magical history, no (normal) mathematics from what we can tell, no languages, etc.

So transferring over fake qualifications won't necessarily be enough on its own - there'd be a very limited amount of possible fields that wouldn't require the muggleborn to have to re-study on.

The second issue is legal - I don't think we know what type of magic is or isn't legal to do on muggles. It's possible that for a non-governmental agent, it's not legal to confundus charm muggles like that or to transfigure the records. If that's the case, it's obviously a problem.
