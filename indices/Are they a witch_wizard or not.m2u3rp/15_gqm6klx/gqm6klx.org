Everyone here seems to be considering the difficulty of a middle/high school education, but I honestly don't know why that's even a factor. It's about living life in the muggle world, not living a productive life.

Kingsley was literally one of the Prime Minister's best workers when he wanted to be. I have no doubt that wizards can live life in the muggle world. Would it be enjoyable? No, I wouldn't want to confund everyone and lie to everyone around me. But they could probably easily live life there.
