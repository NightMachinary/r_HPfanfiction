I mean, there's the part where you actually need to be knowledgeable on stuff. Lol. Probably unimportant from primary-high school but let's say you fake a degree in mathematics, assumably you're gonna get a job to do with it, what are you gonna do? hardcore studying? somehow magic your way through it? confound your employer?

I might just be missing the point here, but it seems kind of redundant. If you're gonna go the faking-a-degree route you might as well rob a bank with your magic and then chill out for life with a succubus colony or something :P
