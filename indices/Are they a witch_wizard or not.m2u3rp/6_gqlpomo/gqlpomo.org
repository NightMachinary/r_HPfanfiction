Because depending on the field, especially high paying ones in STEM, you can spot pretty easily who bough or transfigured their diploma pretty easily.

Regular wizards also aren't allowed to go casting spells on muggles willy-nilly, I would guess muggleborns would face even more scrutiny.

The truth of the matter is that if from 11 to 17 you spent your time studying magic and not stuff like high school math, languages or other stuff from regular curriculum, you are going to have a hard time finding a nice paying job.

Compared to living in a post-scarcity society where you could study magic and do fun stuff if it's not that well paid.
