Hell, its hard to get a good job even with a high school diploma and sometimes even a four year degree depending on what field it is. And that's if you actually did what you needed to do and didn't just confundus your way through it all.

If a witch/wizard memory charmed their way into being say... A lawyer. They're still gonna be completely incompetent at their job and would be fired quickly unless they used magic all the time to manipulate everyone. And eventually that's gonna become something the ministry takes issue with.

I just don't see how this scenario could ever last long term.
