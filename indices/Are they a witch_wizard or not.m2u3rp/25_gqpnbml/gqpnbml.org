I always assumed it was less lack of ability to make it happen and more wizards and witches. Stand out. Heavily. They've become used to an ingrained sense of ability. Sure not everyone would be helpless but I think that many people don't go back bevause the magical world keeps them busy. Plus the whole masquerade and statute means they are afraid of being killed. Probably rightly so. Magical wars would be devastating.
