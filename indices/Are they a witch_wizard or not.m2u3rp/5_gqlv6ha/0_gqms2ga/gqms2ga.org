Plus I imagine there would be a risk of getting caught eventually. While anyone who looks at you enchanted piece of paper might be fooled, once you reach certain levels of an organisation (like a director/upper level manager/school principle) or if you work in certain professions (medicine/law/...), people might begin contacting institutions to see if you had done what you claimed. Admittedly though, I don't think they would bother verifying high school qualifications.
