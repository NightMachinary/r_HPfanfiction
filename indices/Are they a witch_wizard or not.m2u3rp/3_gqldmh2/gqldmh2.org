only having an 11-year-old's understanding of science would /really/ hold them back if they wanted to go to college for anything science-related. i'm trying to remember what I knew by the 4th/5th grade... the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell? plus they only have an 11-year-old's understanding of history and civics, and they're mostly cut off from the muggle world for 9-10 months of the year from ages 11-17, so there's a lot of current events they'd have to experience second-hand. in canon, astronomy seems to mostly be looking through a telescope and plotting stars, not actually doing any hard math to calculate positions. and arithmancy is just probability/divination, so /maybe/ if we really stretch, we can infer that in 6th/7th year they dip into calculus. but that's just coming from my experience of taking probability classes as a junior & senior in college, and i'm /really/ stretching my suspension of disbelief here to entertain the thought that any calculus is taught at hogwarts.
