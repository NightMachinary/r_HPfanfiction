Yes, I know people who did that. Perfectly fine way to get an engineering degree. Those people had likely never had any calculus in high school, just like me. Whether their high school didn't have calculus or they just didn't take it, I imagine a lot of them felt like they were behind when they got to college, because I know *I* felt that way. A Hogwarts student almost certainly doesn't have the option of learning any calculus there, and may even learn minimal trigonometry or algebra. We don't know. But their first exposure to calculus will be in college, where they will likely feel that they are behind, especially when they see people their age or younger blowing through Cal 1 like it's nothing because they became familiar with it in high school. But yes, if they stuck with it, they would eventually be fine in the math department.
