For algebra 1, ok, sure. To an extent. Except for the modern notation system, the basics of algebra were re-discovered by a bunch of people all over the world. But other HS math beyond that? Matrices, polynomials and radical expressions, quadratic equations, functions, exponential and logarithmic expressions, sequences and series, probability and trigonometry? That kind of shit that took multiple generations of geniuses to develop; I'd hardly call that 'common sense'. And you need all of that for even a basic high school education. That would be a nightmare to learn on your own without a teacher.
