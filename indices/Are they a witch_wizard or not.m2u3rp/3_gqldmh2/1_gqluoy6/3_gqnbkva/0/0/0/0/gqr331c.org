Yeah I agree it's pretty hard to generalise, but the secondary school curriculum where I'm from is much more rigid and way less flexible than the American one (I honestly thought it was absurd that students could do any class they wanted and these classes were not on the same level the first time I heard of it lol) and everyone comes out of high school doing the exact same curriculum depending on whether you are a science, arts or business student. Secondary school is also 7 years long here so a 3 years long degree is not rushing things through but actually the norm for everybody including the slackers and you can technically finish it in 2 years if you are /that/ motivated, but I did also take an extra year for an intercalated degree haha.
