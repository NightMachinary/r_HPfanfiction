It's pretty hard to generalize. My high school offered classes equivalent to 3rd semester calculus, and two semesters of physics, chemistry, biology, along with anatomy & physiology. But you could stop before pre-cal/trig and take no sciences that would transfer. Your 4 years of required English classes could include 0, 1, or 2 semesters of university equivalent classes. Etc etc.

It's not unknown or impossible for motivated students that were well prepared high schoolers to finish a degree in 3 years, but there's a culture of dragging it out for 4 years to have a kick-ass thesis/graduation project/more internship opportunities. Taking the time to stand out is considered more beneficial than simply rushing through.
