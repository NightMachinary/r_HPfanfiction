American universities teach things we learned in the last 2 years of high school in my country in their first and second year (which is why most degrees including engineering are only three years long here). They only go over the high school level stuff very quickly within the first week and sometimes maybe within the first month. What you learned in junior and sophomore year was literally what we learned in the first year of university here and tell me how you don't need a good grasp of calculus and advanced maths to understand that.

Edit: grammar mistakes
