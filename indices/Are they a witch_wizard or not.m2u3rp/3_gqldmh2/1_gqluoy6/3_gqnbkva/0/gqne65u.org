Bro you don't touch any applied maths more complicated than algebra until sophomore year with dynamics then junior year when you hit fluids for calc and systems/controls for difeq and linear. A good understanding of linear helps in circuits but really isn't required. Integrals are used as representation for physics sometimes and a very small part of statics earlier on but very rarely used. There are very few classes that

Most people who start in lower maths bang out their electives early while they catch up on math instead of going right into their calc and physics type shit. I'm taking two GEs rn and I graduate in like 2 months.
