In the UK we have the open university, who do foundation courses (1yr) for people with no qualifications who want to go to university. Local councils also put on English and Maths classes for adults to help them get GCSEs in those subjects, and for parents to enable them to help their children with homework.

I did Physics at university (2007), and while almost everyone had done calculus at sixth form, it wasn't assumed, and there were two tiers of maths class at the beginning of first year, which there was an entrance test for. If you got less than half marks, you went to the lower tier class with more contact hours and support. Even the upper tier class went over all the maths from A-level.

Additionally, I changed my subjects half way through my AS year (sixth year) and had to catch up with maths through self-study while also taking the classes for the second half of the course. It was work, but not impossible at all.
