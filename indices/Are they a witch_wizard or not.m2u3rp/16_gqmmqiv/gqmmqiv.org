That's not how it works anymore. Everything is stored in Databases on computers...With passwords and secure logins. It's not as simple as changing a piece of paper to LOOK like it's legitimate. What if someone goes on the database and sees that said person didn't even finish elementary school? It would cause confusion and COULD expose the wizarding world if someone looked more into it without getting caught by an auror or something.
