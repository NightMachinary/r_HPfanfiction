It seems like it would be possible and relatively easy for them to get a GED (or whatever the equivalent is in the UK), even if it takes a couple of years after they graduate from Hogwarts. It's not like anything is preventing them from learning. In fact, there would probably be a pretty good business in squib/muggleborn tutors who help hogwarts graduates get a GED/equivalent and get into a college if they want to pursue a degree. A witch or wizard would unquestioningly have a leg up over a muggle even in mundane careers thanks to the use of magic and potions. It's never made sense to me that muggleborns wouldn't take advantage of that and would rather stay in a community where they are second class citizens.
