TBH the Weasleys were poor BECAUSE they had seven children and Molly didn't have a job. Arthur actually had a decently paid if a bit dead-end civil servant career, it's just that it's hard to maintain two adults and seven children on one salary. Actually the fact that he is able to is testimony to how prosperous wizarding England is.
