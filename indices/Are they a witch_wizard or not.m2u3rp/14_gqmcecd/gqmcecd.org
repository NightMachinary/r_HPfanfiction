Aside from the legal, moral and educational issues already mentioned, the main issue for this to be much harder than a simple transfiguration or confundus is the simple logistics of it all.

I've not been in the school system in a long time, but I'm /fairly/ certain that you can't just get into a university by just showing up with your records/certificates/diplomas and get a place in that school. In the UK, getting into university, at least straight from school/college, has at least [[https://www.ucas.com/undergraduate/what-and-where-study/ucas-undergraduate-entry-requirements][these entry requirements]].

If you're coming from Hogwarts then, you'd need to be able to fill most of these requirements to get a placement, many of which can't be fixed with some spell work to make it go away.

In addition to this, it's almost a certainty that all these records will be computerised these days. Suffice it to say /that/ can not be worked around with spell work, unless you're prepared to go to extra-ordinary lengths otherwise (by which time, if you're willing to put that much effort, you might as well just put in the work and just get into higher education legitimately).
