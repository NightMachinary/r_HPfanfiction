In my experience at college in the U.S. there are plenty of people who seem to be running off of a 5th grade education. In my algebra class for example there were three students who could do anything above multiplication and division. with tutoring they were able to pass the class and one of them went on to higher math. I have seen similar students in all of my classes so I really don't think that lacking the knowledge going into to school at least in the U.S. would hinder them if they studied. As for the Dubious morality, well I simply went with cannon morality,(or how I understood the morality to be) not really with how I thought things should go but how I though a witch/wizard from HP would react
