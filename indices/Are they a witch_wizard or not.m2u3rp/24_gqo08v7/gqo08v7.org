The problem would be that Hogwarts doesn't offer any of the classes or education that would be a mandatory requirement for any College or University. Sure you could use the Confundus charm and get in with forged documents but you would struggle in your classes beacuse of a lack of foundation as you don't know many of the basic muggle knowledge that would come through in Schools. For example, if you are opting for an Engineering degree Math and Science basics is a must and I'm pretty you are not getting that from Hogwarts. Even if you have magic in your side it would not be easy to aquire the knowledge that takes years of school education to achieve. Then again it would be easier to cheat during exams with magic and you could top the ranks but it would be pretty meaningless in the long run unless you plan to keep conning your way up.
