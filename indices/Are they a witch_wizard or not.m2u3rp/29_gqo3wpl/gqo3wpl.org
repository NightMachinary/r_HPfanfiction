Yeah, you can technically get to the university, but you're lacking 7 years of education, it's not so easy to catch up. Maybe you'd be able to live in a muggle world as a janitor or a cop, but unless you'll spent another (about) 7 years doing middle&high school, you can forget about good universities.
