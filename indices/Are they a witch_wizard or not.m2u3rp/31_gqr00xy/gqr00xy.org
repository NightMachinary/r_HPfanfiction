Imagine you have metastatic lung cancer. You confund the doctors into believing you're healthy, and transfigure your medical records to agree. You'll still die, because destroying the evidence of a thing doesn't undo the problems the thing causes.

It just means it'll be more of a surprise to university administrators when you inevitably fail.
