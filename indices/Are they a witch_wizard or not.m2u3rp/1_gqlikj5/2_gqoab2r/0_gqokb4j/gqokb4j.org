True. That said, since Huffle is the House of Hard Workers, it is something I could see Finch-Fletchley doing, but NOT something I could see Dean Thomas doing. Neverminding the money aspect, Dean's character doesn't lend itself to this kind of extra work, sine he was always goofing off with the other Gryfs. I could see Dean drawing a lot and building a portfolio in order to get into a reputable art school after Hogwarts though. Imagine the advantage magic would give an artist in pure speed. Wave your wand and your art is colored. Wave your wand and your art is copied however many times. Wave your wand and your art is unstealable, uncopiable. Dean might not have started out rich, but after Hogwarts becoming so might be quite easy.
