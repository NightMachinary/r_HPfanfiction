Also, there's nothing saying that a student can't /also/ get a muggle education. I mean really, if you boil down the course for a regular grade 6 class, it could be done in a few months during the summer. It would absolutely SUCK for the kid, but with rewards of doing magic in the house or going to footy/quidditch matches with the family to keep the kids motivation, it could be done. It would get harder later, of course, and after like 3rd year they'd have to take muggle books to Hogwarts with them and send back assignments, but it could still be done. Honestly this is what Hermione should have been doing rather than trying to take all the Hogwarts classes. There's a LOT of extra time at Hogwarts.
