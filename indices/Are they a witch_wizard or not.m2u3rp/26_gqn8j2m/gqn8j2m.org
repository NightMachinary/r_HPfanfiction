Muggles are just muggles. I don't think anyone except warewolf would seriously think they should live in muggle areas, but if someone is determined, sure they can.

Besides, Wizards live at least twice longer than muggles. They can slowly learn 'Basic Knowledges' while confounding/,obliviating muggles.
