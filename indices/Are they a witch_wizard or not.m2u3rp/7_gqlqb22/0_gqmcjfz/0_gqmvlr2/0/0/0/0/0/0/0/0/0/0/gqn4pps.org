Gold exists as a co.nudity in the form of jewellery, money, and other decorations. Just because you don't see it does not mean that trade of it existed.

I conceded your argument about goblins protecting their money from alteration because it was in character for them and made sense for them do. I am now arguing the same thing for gold as a tradable item.

Gold is a thing that sells in the magical world. Any enterprising firstgen would be able to find a way to sell it.
