This is fair, but frankly, it's also more speculation. What you're saying makes sense. Maybe the goblins do spend time to make sure their money is enchanted to prohibit tampering, or at least imbue the galleon with properties that are hard to replicate to avoid counterfeiting.

But going all the way back to the beginning of this discussion, that only works for goblins and particularly well-informed magical people. (When was the last time you knew how to check for a counterfeit bill beyond looking at it in the light?) Since what you're committing is illegal, or will at least piss off the goblins anyways, just trade with other magicals and let them get in trouble with the goblins.

Or, since you've already obtained real gold from regular people, just use that as trade for other stuff. Gold can't be transfigured without a philosopher's stone, and the goblins use it as their most valuable coin material so it's not like you'd have problems bartering with it.
