We know that all banking is handled by goblins, we know that there is a pegged exchange rate between muggle and wizard currency, and that it's less than the value of that gold, the only way to get money is from the goblins using currency they accept. This implies that the value of wizard currency is separate from the material value, this requires some form of monetary control to ensure control over the gold supply. Since this is a magic world it makes sense that these controls would be magic in nature.
