  Or use Gemino curse to duplicate expensive industrial metals and sell them for decent profit. According to the Books, gold and silver can not be duplicated. But what about titanium, palladium, neodymium, and those rare earth elements that cost a lot more than gold?

That'd be a bit of a pain setting up contracts to sell though. "Wow, where'd you get half a ton of lithium?" Uh, prospecting in Montana?

I think magically counterfeiting actual paper money would be easier, and just ease your way into passive income streams that way. Just get a stack of $20s and $100s, and duplicate the stack as needed. Get audited, magic up some paperwork saying you're a stripper or fine dining server or some other business that's a lot of cash.

Or perhaps selling goods that can be valuable, but expensive to source. Even if it's just clothing. Things that are quality, but not really designer/high fashion. Like $200 Pendleton Wool sweaters and the like. $400 Rapha cycling gear.
