The answer, I thought, would be quite obvious.

You can forge or fake qualifications and lie on your job interview (by both muggle and magical means) but then...

you have to put your money where your mouth is, don't you? Be it a doctor, engineer, teacher, administrator, pilot, lawyer, businessman/woman, or the other 1000+ vocations not listed here.

You have to actually perform the real job that you faked the qualifications for.

Just how many people would you use the Confundus Charm / Obliviation Charm on and how many times? You as a fellow employee/co-worker/or what have would have to interact with these people on a daily/regular basis. Say it's a small place where you work with just 5 people including the boss. At what point would you forget whom you have Confounded/Obliviated of what and when and what concocted story you replaced it with?

Can you keep your story straight after the 100th time? Times 5 people?

In conclusion:

Bob is not your uncle.
