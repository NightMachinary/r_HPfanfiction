Mate, I dunno, canon's a mess. Hermione obviously sucks real hard for mind-raping her parents that one time, but the magic government does it all the time so either mind-raping is cool and good for some reason I haven't been able to figure out or everyone in Harry Potter lives in a dystopian hellscape even before Voldemort.
