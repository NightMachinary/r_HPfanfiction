Drarry

Away Childish Things linkao3(16052816) Harry (and later Draco) gets deaged. I dare you to find a fic that explores impact of Harry's and Draco's upbringing on them better.

Also later parts of The secret language of plants linkao3(9323225), all-around fantastic fic.

Tom/Harry

love is touching souls (surely you touched mine) linkao3(5937535), time travel

Snake Eyes linkao3(13279185) pre-slash with Tom born in Harry's time, can be read as a friendship fic

Dramione... Not my pairing at all, but On the Perils of Free Advice linkao3(243530) is pretty funny and cute. Draco is working as a sex-advice columnist, but he's a virgin and doesn't actually know anything about sex

Edit: People who are downvoting this (and other) comment, at least tell me why. Because I'm pretty sure you haven't read any of these fics, and just downvoted because of the pairings, /in a post that specifically requested these pairings/. That's pathetic.
