  AU/Crossover. Stargate-centric.Harry pays a high price when driving Voldemort from his mind at the Ministry battle; he burns out his magical abilities entirely. Now without magic, he is summarily rejected from wizarding society but comes to realise he has gained something ... other ... or Ancient.Starting a new life from scratch in the non-magical world, his natural skills and love of flying draw him to join the Royal Air Force, and from there to the SAS. Now 24, Harry has distinguished himself as an exemplary soldier, decorated for acts above and beyond the call of duty. The last eight years have been turbulent, and often traumatic. Wounded in action multiple times, and haunted by the memory of a close friend and lover whom he couldn't save, he has endured events that would have broken lesser men; perhaps it is time to let others shoulder the burden.And then, in June 2004, under a mountain in Colorado, everything changes. An expedition is departing into the unknown; they will only take the best. Harry's new powers identify him as a carrier of the ATA gene - the strongest found yet. And in another galaxy, he will find new reasons to fight; amongst the stars he will find a new family, home, and love.
