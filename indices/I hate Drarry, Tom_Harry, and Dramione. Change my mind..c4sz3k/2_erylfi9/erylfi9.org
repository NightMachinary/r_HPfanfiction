linkao3(879852) is one of my favorite Drarry's. I don't want to discuss the events of the story, because spoilers, but I really enjoyed the universe that the author creates. Everything is expertly woven together and the few OCs that are introduced have great characterization.

There are very nice flaws given to each character. Details are revealed as Harry discovers them - it's a gorgeous and well-done way of explaining the differences in characterization and I love how the story unfolds. This piece is really just a journey of self-discovery with slash tossed in.
