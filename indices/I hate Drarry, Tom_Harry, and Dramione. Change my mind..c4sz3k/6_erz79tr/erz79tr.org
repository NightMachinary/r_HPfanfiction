Tom/Harry: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14527497/chapters/33565593][The Philosopher King]] by RedHorse. Very AU, and what I find especially compelling about this story is the worldbuilding (Voldemort won, dominated the muggles under wizarding rule, and the wizards under his rule, and while monstrous, he's also low-key concerned about fixing climate change.

It's in progress, but still updating semi-regularly.
