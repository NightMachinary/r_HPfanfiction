linkffn(Butterfly Heart by The Fictionist) is a very well-written Tom/Harry. It's inspired by Silence of the Lambs, and as far as serial killer AUs go, this is one of my favourites. Going into this, you're....you're not supposed to like the ship. It's /supposed/ to be messed up, and that's what I find so fascinating about this. But that's just me spending way too much time on my major, so idk. It's a good read, and it makes you want more, similar, content once you're finished. One of the few fics I reread every few months. It's complete and on Ao3 if that's your preferred site.
