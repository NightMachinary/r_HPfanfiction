Well, I dislike slash, but I've read several interesting gender change AU fics with Tom/Harry. (in fact f!HP/TR and HP/f!TR are my OTPs)

!linkao3(The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding)

This is a fem!Harry/Voldemort fic that explores an interesting interpretation of Harry being a horcrux and the implications that it holds.

!linkffn(Thunderstorm)

Harry/fem!diary!Riddle. Harry is four years older than canon. This is a short fic, but it's generally considered the most palatable Harry/Tom fic for a wider audience.

!linkffn(Power is Control) Harry/fem!Voldemort. I love this one, though it's definitely not for everyone. Voldemort is drawn to Harry by the horcrux in his scar, and Harry realises that, he can leverage himself to try and reign in her worst impulses. The story takes some interesting turns.

!linkffn(When Harry met Tom)

Fem!Harry/Tom. Harry ends up in the past due to a mishap in the DoM battle in fifth year. She just wants to get back to the future, but Tom Riddle finds her fascinating, since, unlike every other Slytherin, she doesn't care what anyone thinks about her, and it makes him reconsider if his goal of becoming Lord Voldemort is actually something he /wants/.

linkffn(The Advantages of Being Sane)

Harry/fem!Voldemort. Voldemort had her sanity restored by taking a killing curse to the face, and after her resurrection, she wants to work together with Harry and Cedric to destroy all of the death eaters to remove their plague on society.

!linkffn(Departure from the Diary)

(apologies for self-promotion). Harry/fem!diary!Riddle. Tamelyn finds the horcrux in Harry's scar in the chamber of secrets at the end of second year, and decides that using it as a conduit to possess him would be a lot more efficient and a lot less damning than absorbing Ginny's soul and killing the only witness. Unfortunately for her, Lily's protection is still active, leaving her stuck inside Harry's head. She wants to get out as much as Harry wants her out, so they come to an uneasy truce.
