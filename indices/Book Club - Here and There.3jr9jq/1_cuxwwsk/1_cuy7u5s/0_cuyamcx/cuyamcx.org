Nope, not at all. Like I said, I read fast. Really fast. I much prefer longer stories. I've read probably most of the (so-so to very well written) long fics in the fandom. I don't know. It just was....boring.

For example of long fics I like, I absolutely loved the Dangerverse Series. Although I don't remember where I left off, I really liked Prince of The Dark Kingdom. Alexandria Quick had some really good ideas. I both loved and hated Harry Crow (I know how...OOC it is, I just couldn't help myself, it's one of those guilty pleasures.) I absolutely hated HPMOR.
