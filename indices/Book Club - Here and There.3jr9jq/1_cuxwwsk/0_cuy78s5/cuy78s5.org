Then get ready for the wonder that is Spectrum24.

Linkffn(So Close Yet So Far by Spectrum24) and its sequel Linkffn(Illusions by Spectrum24) are both well written bodies of work, although the first fic is a little rough at times.

Linkffn(In The Long Run by Spectrum24) is much better written and engaging from the start, a must read for Hermione/Ginny fans.

Linkffn(At Sunrise by Spectrum24). If you're looking for a tear-jerker, this fic is it. You know what they say, it's the journey and not the destination that matters. Shed a tear and I'm almost a psycopath.

Linkffn(Written In The Body by Poetheather1) Linkffn(Learning to Love by The Forgotten Lover) Linkffn(If You Can Meet With Triumph And Disaster) Linkffn(To know, to feel, to love)

The above are all good fics as well, and probably some of the longest and well written Hermione/Ginny fics out there.
