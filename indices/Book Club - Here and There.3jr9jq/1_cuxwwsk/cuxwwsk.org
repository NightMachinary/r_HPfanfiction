Honestly? Boring. I read it all (I read up to 1000 wpm naturally) within a few days, and it just...dragged on. There's a few interesting bits, but it just was...a bore.

I mostly finished it because the only thing I was curious about was Ron's reaction when they got back. After that, I felt like I had to finish it, because well, I was already half done with it.

The dreams were vaguely interesting, to be fair, but all in all, boring, bland, interesting idea but not executed that well.

It IS one of the best Hermione/Ginny fics I've read, but I haven't read much of that pairing. I'd like to read more though.
