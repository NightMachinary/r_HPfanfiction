Yes and no. I'm pretty strong on what most people would consider the endgame, but...

Okay, semi-spoilers incoming

(Hopefully the spoiler tags are working properly. They're working on the laptop and the phone, but...)

Revolutions don't just /stop/ when the Tsar is dead, so to speak. When Voldemort died in canon, well, okay, that's great, but...How /do/ you purge the Ministry properly, or rebuild it when most of the institutional knowledge was killed already because they wouldn't cooperate with Death Eaters or had to be discarded in the present because they /were/ Death Eaters? What do you do about future insurgencies, especially since magic lends itself well to guerilla warfare? Perhaps most importantly, how do you build a new society? And you've /got/ to build something new, because the old version was taken over by Magic Nazis, which is a pretty clear sign that it probably wasn't working very well. But you are, of course, going to have people who think that was a fluke, and other people who agree that you need to change /something/ but disagree about what changes to makes. This kind of thing---"winning the peace," basically---is also going to be an important part of the story, and is, I think, the true endgame, but I don't really know what's going to happen there because so much of it depends on very tiny details.
