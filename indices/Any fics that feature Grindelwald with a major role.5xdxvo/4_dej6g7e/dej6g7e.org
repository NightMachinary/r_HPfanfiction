#+begin_quote
  In the village of Godric's Hollow, the Dumbledore family is falling apart. Kendra Dumbledore is dead, and Albus is the unwilling guardian to his wayward brother Aberforth, and Ariana, their mad sister in the attic. But everything changes with the arrival of Gellert Grindelwald, violently charming juvenile delinquent with an obsession for the fabled Deathly Hallows.

I sadly haven't run across anything that fits your conditions perfectly (100,000 words and no romance). Let Perpetual Light has only the barest hint of 'romance' however and though technically not Grindelwald focused he does feature heavily. It's definitely worth reading, I personally love the way the author characterised Grindelwald. Hopefully as more Fantastic Beasts movies come out there will be more Grindelwald focused fics.
