Grindelwald was much more dangerous. We are talking about a dude it took Dumbledore in his prime, after at least a decade at the top of the ladder, to even defeat. Dumbledore couldn't kill Grindelwald. Sure people claim oh he couldn't due to love, but that's not clear. It is clear that their duel is stated in multiple sources as the most magnificent duel of all time.

Let us look at Voldemort. Not only did he never conquer Britain, he couldn't kill a group of four fresh out of school kids who didn't understand war, until a traitor let him into their home at the dead of night. I can't help but thing that Grindelwald would have said fuck it, fiendfyre the whole fucking village, and AK anyone who runs out.

Comparing Grindelwald and Voldemort is like comparing Hitler, to the leader of the IRS.

Sure Voldemort could do some massive damage... but he never shaped the world of wizardry. He may have been the "Darkest Wizard of the age" but that was because Grindelwald never stepped foot onto british soil after leaving.
