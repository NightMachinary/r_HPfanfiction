Hell no. Fidelius doesnt STOP magic. it stops knowledge of precise location. Its like building a secret room in your home. Its safe because people dont know it exists. However, if you burn the house down, the room isnt gonna be there later. And If the world is burning around you, as Fiendfyre assumes, are you going to stick inside or nah? Keep in mind how dangerous Fiendfyre is, and tell me with a straight face that you will stay inside your house, knowing that it destroys anything it touches.

I honestly don't think Voldemort would use it in this situation because he would "want to be sure" that the Potters were dead. Never mind the fact that it was a guaranteed way of getting the job done anyway.
