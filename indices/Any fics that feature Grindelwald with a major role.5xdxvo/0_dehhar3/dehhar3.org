I definitely agree when saying Grindelwald was more dangerous.

While Voldemort might have been an awesome public speaker before he went snake face and a certified badass, looking like your daddy fucked a snake won't win you points in the political arena. And the stereotypical "I'm the biggest badass on the block" syndrome (BBB Syndrome) seems to be rather evident as well. Voldemort couldn't take over Britain in a decade, while Grindelwald (probably) took over a majority of Europe during his war(1920s? or 1930s? to 1945). Rowling stated that he was the wizarding equivalent to Hitler, so we can infer that he likely made similar territorial conquests during the height of his power.

Grindelwald seems like a saner and more logical person whose goals included more than just forwarding himself(The Greater Good).
