I can only vaguely remember a few, and they were either abandoned, complete shit, or abandoned and complete shit.

I also vaguely remember a story where Harry had a grand-uncle on the Evans' side of the family who was a Grindelwald supporter and trained Harry pre-Hogwarts. Don't remember if it was abandoned or if I got bored of it, though.

Push comes to shove, put your parameters into the HP Fanfiction.net section and further sort it by favourites and/or reviews. They most likely won't be the best on the site, but it's a start.
