If I remember black family tree correctly, Sirius and Regulas were the main house, as in sons of the last lord, while the black sisters are daughters of Sirius's mother's sister or aunt. Harry is related to black house through his grandmother Dorea black (or is it just fannon). Finally Weasleys are related Arthur's maternal side.

At the end, in facfics the writer is the god, whatever he/she writes goes.

Also, it's a good fic idea, but I think it should be comedy one.
