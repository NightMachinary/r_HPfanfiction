Um, but what about the fact that Ron is the sixth son?

Wouldn't the title go to Bill? Then any kids Bill has, then Charlie, then Charlie's kids, then Percy, then Percy's kids, then George, then George's kids?

Only then, if literally all those people died, would Ron be the next in line for any title.
