That's easy. The Blacks use Agnatic Ultimogeniture succession. Agnatic means only males can inherit and Ultimogeniture means the youngest child inherits.

Edit: Admittedly I'm not sure how that works further up the family tree to get the succession to the Weasleys in the first place. Under those laws it would almost certainly go to Draco but it's easy enough to make up a reason that he is not eligible.
