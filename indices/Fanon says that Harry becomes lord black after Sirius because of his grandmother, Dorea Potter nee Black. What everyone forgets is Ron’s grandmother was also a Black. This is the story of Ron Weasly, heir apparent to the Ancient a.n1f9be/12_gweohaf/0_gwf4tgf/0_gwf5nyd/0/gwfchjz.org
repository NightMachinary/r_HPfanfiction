Pretty much, yeah. The Order never showed concern for Hermione's parents' whereabouts - she had to mess with their memories and send them off to Australia on her own, after all. I'd guess it's partly because it's easier for witches/wizards to track down the Weasleys, who are more well known and have more people knowing where they live, than a pair of muggles. It's also questionable whether Hermione's parents would be willing to leave their home and their work to hide in London in a magical house for who knows how long.

But regardless, if Sirius really was concerned about people keeping safe because he was related to them, then he would be bringing in people like Andromeda - who's far closer in relation to him than the Weasleys.
