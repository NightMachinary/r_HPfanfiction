See I never got that, because Sirius died as a runaway criminal, so he never got to be Lord Black. But surely that actual Lord Black before him would leave the title to someone in his will, right? Most likely Draco, as he is the closest male heir to the main Black line.

Also, I thought Sirius was disowned? Or was that only on the family tree but never legalities?

Anyway, point is, someone had to hold the title while half of the remaining family was in prison or disowned, right? So someone was asurely aready Lord Black.
