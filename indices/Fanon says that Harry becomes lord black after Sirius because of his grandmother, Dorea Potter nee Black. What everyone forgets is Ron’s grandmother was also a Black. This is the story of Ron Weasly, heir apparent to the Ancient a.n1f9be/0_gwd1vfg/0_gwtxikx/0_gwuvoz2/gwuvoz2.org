The thing I see often is he isn't disowned just blasted off the tapestry, which isn't the same thing. The lord thing is often shown as being older then the modern wizarding law so even if they charged him with a crime(which they never did) it wouldn't matter because something along the lines of "how dare these newfangled jumped up petty bureaucrats think that they can tell MY family who is and isn't the Lord". Sirius was also never actually charged on anything so the lordship would automatically go to him as the oldest most direct heir.
