The reason it goes to Harry and not Ron/any Weasley, or to Draco(whose mother is a black by birth) is because Harry is Sirius's godson and named heir, at least that's the normal justification in fics that do the Lord Black thing in the first place. Harry has the required ancestry and the vote of the most current Lord Black, not just the ancestry.
