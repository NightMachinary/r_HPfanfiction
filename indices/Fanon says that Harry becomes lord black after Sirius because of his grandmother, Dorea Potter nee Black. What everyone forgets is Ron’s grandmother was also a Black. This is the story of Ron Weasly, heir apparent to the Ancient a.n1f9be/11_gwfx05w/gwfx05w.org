Is this because of Black's family tree in which Dorea Black marries Charlus Potter? In that case, James' parents were Fleamont and Euphemia, and his family must not be the only Potters out there. Even if they are related, this doesn't mean that Harry's direct ancestors are connected to Dorea Black, making him a Black by default. Charlus could very well be Fleamont's brother or cousin, for example.

Speaking of Black's family tree, has JK ever commented on Walburga's and the Black sisters' birth dates? Their fathers were 13 at their birth. Considering Sirius' birth year (1959), Walburga's could've been a mistake. If she were born in 1935, her father would've been 23 and she would've been 24 when her first son was born. Since Cygnus (her brother) was born in 1938, it would make sense. However, his birth year also means he was 13 when Bellatrix was born and, since Walburga was born in 1925, maybe his birth year was a mistake and it should've been 1928, making him 23 instead. It looks like one of those was intentional and the other was wrong.
