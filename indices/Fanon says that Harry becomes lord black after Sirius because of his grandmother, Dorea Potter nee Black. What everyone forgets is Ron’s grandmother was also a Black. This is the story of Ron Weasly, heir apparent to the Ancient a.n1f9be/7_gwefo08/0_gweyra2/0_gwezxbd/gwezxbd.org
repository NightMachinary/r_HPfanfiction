And Tonks would not have precedence as Cygnus Black II (her eldest ancestor in the Black Tree) was born after Arcturus Black II. No technically once our Sirius Black III is dead, not even Harry or Draco have the best claim but the heirs from Callidora Black (because she was the eldest in the absence of male heirs) and Harfang Longbottom. After the Weasleys claim would come with Cendrella on second position . And in third would be Crouch heirs of Caspar Crouch and Charis Black.

It is only after whose three are eleminated that the Black claim goes to Belvina Black and Herbert Beurk in forth position.

After that it is going to Bellatrix Lestrange. And Tonks.
