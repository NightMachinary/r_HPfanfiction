Fanon may say that, but I've always found it stupid. Everyone is related to everyone in magical Britain, because the magical population is too small. If just having a relative of a line is enough to make a claim, then Bill and Charlie could sue Lucius Malfoy for child support as distant and neglected nephews.

I'm pretty sure Harry becomes Lord Black because he:

A.) Has some Black blood in him.

B.) The previous Lord Black says he's the next one.

That seems to be the most common feature of the "Harry becomes Lord Black" subgenre. Sirius wills it to him. Sometimes Draco attempts to sue and claim otherwise, by saying he's a closer relation. But I don't think I've ever seen a single fic where that ever works. Harry always wins in the end.

So it's not so much closeness to the line as it is because Sirius Black said so. This is literally always the reason I've seen. I think there's only maybe two fics where it goes to Harry because he's supposedly "more related." In the vast majority of them, it goes to him because Sirius made Harry his godson and named Harry his heir.

Now, hear me out.

What if Sirius decided to prank Ron by willing him the Lord Black title, because Ron's jealousy of his godson is pissing him off, and he decides to be the mischievous genie and give the person wishing for something exactly what they're asking for?
