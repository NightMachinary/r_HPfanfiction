Now cause of that last paragraph I'm having thoughts of a fanfic where Sirius pranks someone in his will and they become lord black, but I can remember the name

And I agree with you about Sirius saying in his will that Harry will be the next lord black, I just thought it would be funny if Ron somehow ended up getting it

Edit: Second paragraph
