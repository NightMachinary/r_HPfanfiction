This sounds fun if tweaked slightly but we know Cedrella was disowned via the tapestry. Granted it may not be canon to some.

Lucretia doesn't seem to had been burned off for marrying a Prewitt (Molly's grandmother)? That connection would be more ideal to compare against Dorea since Euphemia is his grandmother and Dorea is just a movie tapestry relative.

Comparing Dorea to Lucretia would be entertaining as the Weasleys don't seem close to the Prewitts or Weasleys
