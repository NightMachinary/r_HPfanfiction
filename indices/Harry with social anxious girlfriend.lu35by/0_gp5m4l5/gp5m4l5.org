I kinda like this idea: the thought of an OC, a canon blank slate (see Daphne Greengrass, Tracey Davis, Su Li, et cetera), or a canon character with little known canon traits (such as Katie Bell) actually being shy and not the gun ho political/confident juggernaut seen in typical Indie Harry fics is intriguing (especially in Daphne's case).
