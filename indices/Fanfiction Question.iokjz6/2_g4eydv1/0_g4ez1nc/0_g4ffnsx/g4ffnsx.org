In Western Europe (the only place where I have at least some knowledge), adoption was not really a thing during Middle Age. It was not that unusual for a child to be "fostered" by another family (usually of higher rank), either as a student, or as a ward (in the case where the child is orphaned), but said children, while being treated as family members, were not legally considered the same as natural-born children, and didn't have the same inheritance rights. If "blood adoption" was possible, a lot of family would probably have taken this option rather than dying out.

Concerning the hyphenated names, it is important to note that Noble names usually represented the "seat of the family", the place of their original fiefdom. As an example, the House of Bourbon (who later gaves some French kings) originate from the village of Bourbon. When the original male lane died out, the heiress of the family married the heir of the Dampierre family (from the village of Dampierre), creating the Bourbon-Dampierre house.

Hyphenated names cames from the fusion of several Houses by marriage, and you could usually consider that each names represented a different Title controled by the family.

PS: Credit where it's due, this post will explain how Nobles house got their name way better than I, and it's where I got the example of Bourbon-Dampierre.\\
