Blood adoptions aren't canon, so there's no real answer.

However, I'd say it depends on the intent of the adoption.

For example, take a WBWL fic where James and Lily dump Harry with the Dursleys and Sirius rescues him and blood adopts him. The intent there is Harry is no longer a Potter and becomes Sirius's son. So we get Harry Black.

Or take a canonish scenario where Sirius is freed and adopts Harry. The intent here is not to replace the Potters but to follow through on their wishes. Here Harry becomes Harry Potter-Black and is a member of both families. How you want to divide Lordships is up to you. Personally I'm a big fan of Sirius reinstating Andromeda and making Tonks Black heir with Harry remaining Lord Potter.
