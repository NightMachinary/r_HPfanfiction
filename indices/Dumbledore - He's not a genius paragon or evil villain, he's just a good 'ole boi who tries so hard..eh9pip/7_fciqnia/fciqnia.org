This makes much more sense than many of the other versions of Dumbledore I've seen.

Though Ciaphas Cain was based on George McDonald Frasier's character, Harry Flashman. in both cases the stories worked because they were written in the first-person as the "autobiographical" memoirs, "truthfuly confessing" the reality behind the pretend-hero. That's the only way they can work, as from any other PoV you're only seeing the heroic facade.

Perhaps it can be done with Dumbledore if you have a story set decades after the book canon. In which a historical researcher interviews his portrait, and gets to hear a story very different to the one they were expecting to hear.
