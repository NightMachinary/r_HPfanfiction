Thanks! It is long... 139 chapters, 400k+ words and counting. Dumbledore plays a very minor role... he appears in the first couple of chapters and then is off stage with brief mentions here and there. Flamel appears first in chapter 138.

Some of my readers have assumed that I'm going to head into Dumbledore bashing, but that is not my intention. I do struggle with some of the facts of canon - leaving a baby on a doorstep and not checking on Harry until he arrived at Hogwarts. Writing this fic is helping me process a lot of my questions.
