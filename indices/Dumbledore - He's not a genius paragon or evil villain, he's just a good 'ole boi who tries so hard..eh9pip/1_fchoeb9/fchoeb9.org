That's actually exactly how I'm trying to write Dumbledore in my fic, Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting. At his heart, he's an eccentric old man who likes to fuck with people. He doesn't trust himself with power due to his ex-friendship with Grindelwald, which is why he doesn't perform any major power plays in the political arena. He wants to stop Voldemort only because he feels deeply personally responsible for the person that Tom Riddle became and is trying very hard not to repeat his past mistakes in the current era.
