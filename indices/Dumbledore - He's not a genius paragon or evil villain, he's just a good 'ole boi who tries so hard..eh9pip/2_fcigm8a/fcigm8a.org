My headcannon is that the entire wizarding Britain has the politics of a small town. You know the one town seems to always be squabbling over if they should expand the horse-trails and whose water board always seems to be under threat of takeover by the state due to incompetence and the fact part time political operatives really can't run that kind of infrastructure.

And Dumbledore is the one guy who has the potential to leave his local political circle and progress on to become a state senator or congressman. Not "He is so amazing he could lead the nation" or anything like that, just that he would be good enough to play at that level, if that level exists.

And he is surrounded by people who certainly are not good enough to play at that level.

He isn't an Olympic athlete out of his element, he is simply the guy who played small time ball who now runs the local ball club and looks amazing next to all the high schoolers he is trying to teach.
