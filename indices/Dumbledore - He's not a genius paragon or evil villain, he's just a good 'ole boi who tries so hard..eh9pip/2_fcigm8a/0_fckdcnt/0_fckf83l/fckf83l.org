I wasn't trying to do a british comparison (thus the ballgame reference), although it might be interesting to put it in British terms. "He governs only 4000 people? I'm the prime minister, I'm not supposed to decide what to do with a fucking mayor"

The US is also very complicated, due to the fact that the primary authority is the states (and there are 50 of them), and each has its own definition of what powers it devolves to local governances. Here in California, we have counties that are defined by the state that cover all land, managed by an elected body, who are in charge of things unless another local body has authority (governor of last resort basically). Then you have cities (Charter & General Law, which are different), School Boards, Water Boards, Air Boards or other institutions generally defined by state law. Oh and the transit authorities. They are supposed to be in charge of trains, but it is usually a slow moving train wreck. The US hasn't quite figured out the public transit thing yet.

​

Generally though, your local authority is your city, unless you don't live in a city, then it is your county. Yay?

It is complicated everywhere.
