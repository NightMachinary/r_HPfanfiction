No you were fine, it is interesting to put it in the British context, because that is the comparision the characters would make should they draw this.

I'll be honest, I think it would be more interesting to resolve the muggle/magical fighting debate with 'the magicals might be more powerful but the muggles are just so much more competent'. I mean, even if you take the 'spells wins over guns' position, it's clear that that JK's world operates at... well a childrens book level.

The complexities of managing hundreds of millions of people just requires a certain level of competence in the government, even if you think it is doing poorly. I mean, just look at what 'managing the press' counts as in HP.

Or even something like corruption, taking bribes in the HP universe is basically out in the open.

I think that it would be more intersting than just saying 'guns vs magic, guns win'
