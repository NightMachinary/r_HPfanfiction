All very true. Though honestly my main argument for Muggles winning would be sheer numbers. Quantity has a quality of all its own and all that. If you've gotta yell 'Avada Kedavra' every time you want to kill someone, a sufficiently determined force with decent dodging instincts would eventually get you so long as they outnumbered you significantly enough. 'We can administrate you to death' sounds fun, though. Totes a fic that'd bring Percy to the Mundane side of things. Just wait 'til he hears about the paperless office. :D

That kind of simplicity you talk about does seem to be built in to the kind of magic system Rowling used. A lot of our societal complexity (in Britain, anyway) came from the rapid centralisation of society during the Industrial Revolution. We very suddenly went from cottage industry hamlets to massive sprawling cities and that adjustment caused massive upheavals in pretty much everything here. That would never happen with magic - primarily because mass production would never be needed, but also because one dude with a decent transfiguration grade can make pretty much everything they'd need. Like a computer shop industry, I suppose. Though that would also be an interesting fic. What would a magical Industrial Revolution look like in the Harry Potter world and what effects would it have?
