Indeed you weren't, that was my point. I was trying to say that, as a British person, I didn't really have any experience of the kind of thing your scenario showed as it isn't a thing here and I've never seen it outside movies. Same with my comment on British Local Governance complexity. I wasn't trying to imply any superiority or undue intricacy to the English system specifically, it was just an example of how British system differs (no town council and what we have instead) and a mildly tangential ramble about how we got there (our system being complicated from evolving through history).

I'm not terribly good at reading tone into text, but I'm worried I might have offended or insulted and I apologise profusely if my phrasing came across as such - it wasn't my intention, but I've been known to be a tad indelicate at times.

Thank you for covering US Government forms though, that was really interesting. I know about things like the State Legislature from John Oliver skits, but I had no idea about the various Boards and such.
