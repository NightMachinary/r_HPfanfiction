I kind of understand what you're getting at with Dumbledore, but I don't think most of that scenario really translates too well to British Culture - I had no idea any of that was even a thing in the US outside of Hollywood, like Solo Cups and Shithead Fraternity Shenanigans.

Though our local governance system is obnoxiously complicated due to having being modified, made-up, and blatantly stolen from various sources over the centuries, we don't really have 'town councils' like you do. I can give you the full rundown if you're interested, but suffice to say that our modern local governance is done on a county and district basis (meaning it looks after multiple towns, villages, and areas across a larger region) and older local governance was usually more centralised too - Vestry committees, Manorial courts, and Hundred Courts, each of which simply did as the Landowner, Elected/Rate-payer citizen or Church Authority told them, which in turn mostly did as the higher ups told them. A lot less decentralised decision-making here, with more governance and management tasks than Operations or Legislative powers. Though, that all does vary. Like I said, obnoxiously complicated.
