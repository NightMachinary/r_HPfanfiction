I actually seem to recall him commenting on his own brilliance on a fairly regular basis, but the first one that springs to mind is in book one:

#+begin_quote
  “How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?” “Ah, now, I'm glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something. ..."
#+end_quote

It takes a lot of work to go through every mention of him though, so I can't collate all of them, lol. I could be just misremembering the rest, too.

Oh, Ainz is the MC of Overlord. His minions are way smarter than him but they think he's the most intelligent person in the universe. He's always trying to play catchup with the plans they make and ascribe to him. It's awesome.
