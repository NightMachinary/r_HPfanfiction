Huh. So he does. I guess maybe I'm just misremembering myself. :) It has been a while since I've read the books. I wonder what the text around those lines says - like, does it imply that he is genuinely tooting his own horn or is it more like him poking fun as you said in your first comment? Winking or preening or some such afterward would change the tone of the line.

This might actually be motivation for me to go back and reread the books! I'd check the movies, but.., uh, the calmly yelled GOBLET OF FYAH moment kind of makes them not terribly... optimal in that regard.

And ah, okay. Sounds interesting. Probably a better example for the Dumbledore point than my Cain example.
