My impression across the board in canon has always been that he is perfectly aware that he's a genius. He doesn't need to put on airs to stroke his ego about it like Lockhart does, though. It's just... a part of who he is. He has an epic beard, and he also so happens to have an epic mind. He knows he's too smart for his own good on occasion, and that no matter how brilliant one is mistakes will still happen and omniscience is unattainable, so he doesn't put all of his identity and trust in his own genius. He's humble, legitimately humble. He doesn't put himself down, pretending he's not intelligent, he just knows his own strengths and limitations.

I actually learned a lot from him as a character in my own maturation, which is why I noticed it. I am myself more intelligent than most, and I've struggled with it. Dumbledore gave me a good, honest example of someone who literally is always smarter than everyone around him, but is also humble about it, without being excessively and disingenuously self-deprecating.
