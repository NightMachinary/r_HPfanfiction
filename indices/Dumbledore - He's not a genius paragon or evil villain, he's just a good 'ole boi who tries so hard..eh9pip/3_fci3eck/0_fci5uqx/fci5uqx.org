Present, yes, but never actually claims to be smart. Quite a lot of his dialogue, to the best of my memory, has a veneer of "I'm not omniscient, I'm just old and you people keep thinking I'm a genius and now I have to act like I am or everyone keeps trying to put me in a dang home." to it. It's what I got from his lines, anyway. :) As always, YMMV.

I'm afraid I'm not as educated on anime as I might like; I don't know who or what 'Ainz-sama' is, though I do know Overlord exists and is a thing.
