#+begin_quote
  1993-94: Twelve years have passed and Remus still cannot forget, nor is he any closer to understanding why Sirius betrayed his friends and the man he loved. Now Sirius has escaped from prison, and Remus has come back to Hogwarts looking for answers. A retelling of Prisoner of Azkaban from Remus's point of view. Heavy in Marauders-era and First Wizarding War flashbacks.Warning: This story has not been edited yet, and may contain unintended problematic elements and tropes.
