Tho, one does not actually need to write it about that, and leave it as a One-shot of Harry going 'wtf!', maybe transition into a 'Reading the Books' story (just keep the book text out of it)... and have him reacting to Fanfic Tropes/arguments... JKR tweet-retcons, Movie-Actors being much hotter than the "real" characters, Movie-Ron character assassination.

I would have him be older/adult, but not have him focus on 'woe is me, I lost everybody I love' angsting.
