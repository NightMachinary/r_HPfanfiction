i usually avoid h/hr too. the fic so far is decent, but it hasnt delved into the romance very much yet. the universe harry comes from and goes to are both very AU, and he was in love with Ginny in the old universe. so its at least not like a “hermione is the destined perfect girl forever” kind of story

so far the emotional core of the fic is a lot of “i watched all my friends die” angst from harry. which i like
