I like reading about the different opinions people hold towards characters. I think learning these opinions makes fics that are based on similar opinions easier to read.

 

I do think that debates on plot probably aren't a great fit for a fan fiction sub. (Only because there's so much variety once you escape cannon. Harry and friends can have their genders flipped or grow up as goblins. Anything is possible and there aren't really any conclusions without going back to cannon.)

 

I apologize if I come off as harsh. Just trying to explain my opinion.
