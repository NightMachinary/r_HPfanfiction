As the person doing the posting i'm really sorry if anyone feels that way. I am trying to be mindful of that, hence why i'm deleting every post after I make a new one and linking to the old one in the new one if anyone wants to read it.

Also i've been pming a few people back and forth about making it run more smoothly and i'm going to /try/ and have the rest of round 1 over the weekend with matches running simultaneously to speed things up.

Again though, I really love this community, its why i'm running this cause I thought people would enjoy it. If it's annoying i'll of course stop.
