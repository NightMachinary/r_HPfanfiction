Hmm, good question! For me, I would say that I've seen parselmagic (offensive and passive), natural legilimency/mind-magic (could explain why Harry was garbage at occluding), elemental manipulation, absorption, polylinguist-esque abilities, wandless manipulation, death magic (really esoteric Peverell stuff lol), and of course, metamorphic abilities being passed down. And one of the requirements a lot of authors made for gaining a natural talent was having a certain amount/strength in magic that would allow the normally recessive traits to pop up.

So, for instance, I once read a fic that talked about the natural skill in mind-magics from the Peverell family and how, even though so many bloodlines descend from them, you needed a specific amount/potency of magic for the trait to re-appear. So, since Tom Riddle had the most potent magic seen in generations and was a descendent of the Peverell family, the ability was passed down to him. And with Harry, seeing as he was "the Dark Lord's Equal," and a descendent of the Peverells, the ability passed on to him. Pretty neat imo.

I'd say that parselmagic, mind-magics, metamorphic abilities, and elemental manipulation are the most common. Personally, I really like the concept of elemental manipulation and mind-magics. Hbu?
