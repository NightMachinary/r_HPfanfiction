Sure! I'll have to look through my history for a couple lol. Here's just a few that come to mind that talk about natural talents. BTW I'm not sure if these are all about bloodlines tho--some might just be inherited talents without going into the bloodline at all:

The Mind Arts by Wu-gang

Honor Thy Blood by TheBlack's Resurgence (the author has some very good stories that have focus on inherited talents)

Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgence

*/Harry Potter and the Elemental Changes/* by /Peeves' best friend/ (it's been a while since I've read this one so I don't quite remember how good it was but it comes to mind when thinking of elemental stuff)

*/Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power/* by /Sage Ra/ (I don't know if it's any good but it was recommended to me)

*/A Second Coming/* by /Icarius51/ (also recommended so no clue what it's like)

Defiance by Dark Lord Slytherin

Magicks of the Arcane by Eilyfe (not sure if it's a bloodline related fanfic but it goes deeply into old magics so maybe interesting)

*/The Merging/* by /Shaydrall/ (inherited power so interesting)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/Basilisk-born]] (This one is Time Travel and heavilllyyy focussed on bloodlines)

*/More Than Equal/* by /Ordinarily Prudent/

I'll check for some "heir" fics in my history later on and can then recommend some of the better ones I've read. A lot of heir fics usually pop up in unusually pairings so it's hard to remember a particular "heir" story. For instance, I'm. blanking on the name, but I read a story where Harry was destined to collect the Deathly Hallows as the Heir to Peverell and thus had a lot of control over necromancy. For now, these are some good inherited/natural talents fanfics. I especially like The Mind Arts, and TheBlack's Resurgence's work.
