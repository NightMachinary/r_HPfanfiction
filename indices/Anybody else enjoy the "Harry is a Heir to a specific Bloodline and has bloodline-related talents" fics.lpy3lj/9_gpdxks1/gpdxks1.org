You could try Passageways by Jerrway69. It's a Harry/Bellatrix time travel fic where Harry is from the Eveningshade family. A grey family known to bypass wards etc and kill any who attempt to harm their family. So Harry learns various family magics that he uses to put the "bad guys" down permanently.

The story is 277K+ words WIP that regrettably looks a abandoned.
