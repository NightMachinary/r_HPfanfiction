I once read a fic in which Ginny was left the Ladyship of the House of Black after they bonded during OotP. That fic had the premise that certain families were good at certain kinds of magic and taking on a new house (such as becoming their leige Lady or being adopted) could change your own natural affinity to that of your new house.

So, I think the Weasleys (or the Prewetts) might have been more inclined towards Charms in this instance, whereas the Blacks had a knack for curses. Ginny had some issues with her magic after becoming a black. I rather liked that fic. I hope it's continued since I last read it.
