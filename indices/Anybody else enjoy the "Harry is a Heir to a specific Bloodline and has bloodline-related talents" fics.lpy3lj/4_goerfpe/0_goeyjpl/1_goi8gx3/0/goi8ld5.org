  Loneliness was something that Harry Potter was accustomed to. He had learnt that there was none that cared for him, none that would rescue him from his misery and none that heard his pleas for help. Much to his surprise, however, Harry Potter had been wrong. Someone had been listening, had been there with him through it all. But, just who was 'Tom?

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

  A better prepared Harry survives a much more devastating Death Eater attack after the Quidditch World Cup. Harry is kept on the edge of sanity and has never felt more alone. Voldemort is not the problem, only a symptom, and Harry is determined to fix wizarding Britain as a whole. Warning: Character death, brutal magical combat Harry/Fleur
