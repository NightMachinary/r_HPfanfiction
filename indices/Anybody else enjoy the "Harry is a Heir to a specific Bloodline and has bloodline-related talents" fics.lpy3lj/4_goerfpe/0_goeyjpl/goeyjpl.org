True, true. Bro, I love those scarcrux fics. It's too bad that there aren't too many of them out there--or I might not have found all of them. I always find it cool how it changes Harry's personality and physicality by making him more like Tom Riddle. I mean, who doesn't love Tom Riddle lol. Any recommendations?
