If you're interested in reading about great power through hard work and talent - it's not inherited, but Harry is very talented at brewing potions, and single-mindedly passionate about them, in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense). (She also inherited Parseltongue, but finds that much less interesting.) I find that the story does a good job of balancing whatever power it gives her; her Parseltongue is a clue that might expose her true identity, her unusually large magical reserves attract unwanted attention from Tom Riddle wanting to mentor her (or the Diary wanting to permanently possess her), and even her drive to learn about Potions is what pushes her to enact the ruse and end up over her head.

It's a really original storyline, though it very neatly weaves in elements from both HP and the Song of the Lioness, with plenty of deadpan humour and high stakes without any character-bashing. Even Riddle is a complex character who is sometimes worthy of an "enemy of my enemy" team-up and turns out to have some partially sympathetic goals (force intermarrying with half-bloods to avert the effects of inbreeding and stop the population implosion) mixed with his genuinely bad ones (push Muggle cultural influences out of Wizarding society).
