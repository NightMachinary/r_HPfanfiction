Agreed, it's difficult to get this trope to work. I rather like this one concept where these specific magical powers are recessive and come from old bloodlines, but you need a certain amount of magical potency and some fresh DNA in the gene pool to get them to pop up.

For instance, I once read a fic that talked about the natural skill in mind-magics from the Peverell family and how, even though so many bloodlines descend from them, you needed a specific amount/potency of magic for the trait to re-appear. So, since Tom Riddle had the most potent magic seen in generations and was a descendent of the Peverell family, the ability was passed down to him. And with Harry, seeing as he was "the Dark Lord's Equal," and a descendent of the Peverells, the ability passed on to him.

You could also make a case for it in canon. Riddle is descended from an ancient and powerful bloodline that hasn't had a powerful heir in centuries. With the new blood from Riddle Snr. and Tom's inherent magical power, he inherited the gift of Natural Legilimency. Another example could be Tonks who, while exceedingly young, held her own against Bellatrix Lestrange and was an uncommonly gifted Auror. With the renewal of the gene pool through Ted Tonks mixed with the ancient bloodline of House Black and her inherent magical talent, Tonks inherited metamorphic powers to an incredible extent. Just a thought, of course.
