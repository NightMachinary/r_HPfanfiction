It's an interesting idea, but even in the one solid fic that uses it more than what already is in canon (Parseltongue, blood curses), it ends up being executed lazily because only Harry gets it (Out of the Night by Raining Ink, the fic, unfortunately, was abandoned but it honestly is the best execution of many cliches).

Give everyone their inherited magic powers. That would be an interesting part of worldbuilding and not just a plot device to power up Harry.
