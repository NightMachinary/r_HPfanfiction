There's linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487]]) which is 'the dogfather' by Hollimichele. Harry was left on the Dursleys' doorstep but they called the cops and said they didn't know whose baby it was (a conveniently ripped letter had Harry's first name). He's adopted by a childless muggle couple and has a loving upbringing. It's seriously heartwarming to read this version of Harry's childhood.

Nobody is bashed, everyone (except Voldemort) is treated kindly.
