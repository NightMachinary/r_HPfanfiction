  James Potter and Scorpius Malfoy are enemies, everyone knows that. So when a Malfoy is put in Gryffindor, sparks soon fly. But with dark magic rising, the Malfoy family in trouble, and the Muggle and Magical worlds set to collide, old rivalries may have to be forgotten. Various pairings. Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone.
