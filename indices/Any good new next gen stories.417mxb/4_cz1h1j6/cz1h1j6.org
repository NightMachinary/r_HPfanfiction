There's The Escapades of Teddy Lupin by Nymphxdora, Linkffn(10554013), which has been completed and it's sequel, The Skeletons in Teddy Lupin's Closet, Linkffn(11412918) which is just getting started.

And I'm not sure if you read this one, House of Cards by Aebbe, it was started in 2010 but only completed 2015. Linkffn(5778331).
