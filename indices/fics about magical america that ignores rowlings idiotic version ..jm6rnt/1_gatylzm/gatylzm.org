Starfox5's multi-fic verse has a different and pretty interesting America, but there's no fic set there. Only a single chapter in The Granger Principle and small bits of information mentioned here and there across other Starfox5 fics. There's a lot of relatively small magical countries scattered across North America with Magical Quebec currently/recently at war. Jamaica is full of zombie magic and there's sections in several Starfox5 fics about fighting those. The worldbuilding is A+.
