[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3792581/1/Screams-Part-Five-The-Downside-of-Immortality][Screams Part Five: The Downside of Immortality]], linkffn(3792581): They tortured Voldemort to 'death' and then resurrected him, over and over again.

In canon, Voldemort was sent to rot in hell forever. That was IMO far more brutal than any earthly torture, and heroes didn't even need to get their hands dirty.
