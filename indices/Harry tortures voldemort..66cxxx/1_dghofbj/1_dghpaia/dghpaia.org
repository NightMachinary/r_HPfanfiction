If you don't believe in hell (and if you ignore those scenes (imaginary train station and all that), then no, Voldemort was not punished at all, he just got to die!)

ps: I don't like personified concepts (sometimes they are funny, but most of the time the very idea is stupid...death ain't a person!) and I don't like afterlive stuff either (staunch Atheist)
