While "soul" seems to be real we don't really know what death entails. Sisrius described it as going to sleep didn't he? Doesn't sound like much of an afterlife if you aren't conscious. Also resurrection stone does it bring back actual person or only s shade/memory?

I had an idea once that soul / afterlife in HP world was simply manifestation of fear of death. It's like lot of wizards believe in this so magic (through shared belief) makes it real. Kind of like accidental magic except cast by whole of wixardkind through all of time. So in essence there is no god/heaven/hell - just magic.
