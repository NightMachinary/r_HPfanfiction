I'll second On the Way to Greatness. It's Slytherin Harry, so it's not an exact retelling, but the story is one of the better HP fanfics that I've read.

One of the darker fanfics that I've read is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls][Elizium for the Sleepless Souls]]. It takes place after canon in Azkaban. I'll leave it at that, because I really, really liked this story. It's setting and characterization where pluses for me. Not exactly a retelling, but definitely darker and grittier.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172846/1/Deathly-Hallowed][Deathly Hollowed]] is categorized as horror for a reason. Definitely grittier.
