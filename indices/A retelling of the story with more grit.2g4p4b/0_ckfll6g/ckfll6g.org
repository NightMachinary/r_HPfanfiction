[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1023780/Kwan-Li][Kwan Li]]'s two latest stories go to some very dark places, with more morally ambiguous characters than canon.

Others that come to mind are mira mirth's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]], Myst Shadow's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]], and Silens Cursor's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/Renegade-Cause][Renegade Cause]].
