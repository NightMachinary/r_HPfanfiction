There are a lot of fics where Harry is filthy rich and the lord of like nine different houses but that is just limiting it. I have never seen one to the ultimate extreme. A piss take that I thought about righting that does just this.

Lord of Just About Everywhere

The Magicus' are an ancient family dating back to the beginning of time. six thousand years ago they were cursed to forever have only one son and the family almost came to its knees if not for the cunning plan of the heir. He swore to bring back power by having the one son wed the heiress of other houses and fuse them into the Magicus' line. They changed their name thrice to keep building their power in secret, first after the accidental creation of Lycanthropy, secondly after Merlin Emrys wed the princess of Camelot and the kingdom passed to the Ministry of Magic, the name shifted to Peverell around two thousand years ago. A third time almost a thousand years ago the name changed to Potter when the Peverell name rose to so much fame over the construction of three objects between grandfather, father and son. A thousand years later with the marriage of James Potter and Lily Evans, first magical daughter of the squibed line of Flamell. The famous immortals in fact being the cousin who was appointed proxy until the line resurfaced. With the marriage the Magicus' line had gained almost every lord or kingship over every country in the magical world and a decent amount of mundane ones two.

Harry Potter was born with a destiny six thousand years in the making. To be the lord of just about everywhere when he came of age. Of course this came early upon winning the tri wizard tournament and permanently being placed in the books as an adult.
