So I had an idea and maybe I'll write it myself someday but right now I'm still focusing on my current fic so you are welcome to write it. It's basically an 8th year fic. After the war, Draco has returned to Hogwarts for an eight year. He visits the 3 broomsticks often (he's apologized to Mdme Rosmerta) and he is mostly sitting alone, because who wants to sit with a former Death Eater. (Sometimes he sits with Marcus Flint who works in Hogsmeade.) Anyway. He watches and soon realizes that the former Gryffindor Quidditch team meets in the 3 broomsticks once a week. One day when he isn't paying attention, George Weasley just sits down on his table. George was dragged to the meeting by Ron and he just wants to escape all the people who are treating him like he could break if they only mention something that reminds him of Fred/the pitying glances etc. This becomes a regular occurence. Draco and George don't talk much at first but after some time they talk about their former Quidditch captains (Oliver Wood and Marcus Flint) who fight every time they meet in the pub. After deciding that it can only be sexual tension, Draco and George decide to get their former captains into a relationship. An unlikely friendship develops.
