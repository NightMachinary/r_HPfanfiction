Harmony story set in modern days. They could be sorted in different houses; Harry in Slytherin and Hermione in Ravenclaw.

No canon golden trio. No Weasley bashing but they should be completely irrelevant to the plot; they don't have to be involved in everything. No alliance or friendship with the Death-Eater Youth and "moderate" Pure-Blood bigots. Harry wouldn't start randomly befriending students from different houses; including the famous Twins.

No fanon abused, meek and OP Harry.

Harry and Hermione's friendship could start during 3rd or 4th year when they "meet" and spend more time in the library. Their secret friendship and/or romance would eventually comes public when Harry shows at the Yule Ball with Hermione as his date. No prior relationship/dating for them with different characters before they become a couple. They would be each other's first and last romantic partner. They would experience everything between themselves.

You could make the Horcrux in Harry's scar acts more as magical boost and made it interact with him like in "my friend Tom". Stick to canon when it comes to destroy it.

Harry could become a ward of Hogwarts after Voldemort attacked his family. Thus, he could be raised and train by Dumbledore.

Let Dumbledore deal with Prime Voldemort into an epic duel. Meanwhile, Harry would face off with a resurrected version of young Tom Riddle after he failed to stop him in the Chamber of Secrets. The final duel would be with an antagonist he could magically match; Prime Voldemort is out of reach. Make use lethal offensive spells. A duel that ends with a priori incantatem (Expalliarmus vs Avada Kedavra) would be boring.

Fawkes could easily become Harry's familiar if he was raised by Dumbledore.

I don't know about Quidditch. It would be a change if he didn't play it.

No Lordship and super friend goblins trope.
