Harry and co. never really had all those life threatening adventures. Instead they are a reclusive and shy bunch who occupy their free time at Hogwarts playing a tabletop rpg campaign. I think this would have potential for subverting many tropes in humorous ways. For instance, Harry took a flaw for his character, “Neglected Orphan” so that he could take the “Chosen One” feat. 11 year olds getting past the teachers defenses guarding the Philosopher's Stone? Harry and co. were surprised themselves, they hadn't known it was possible to roll so many natural 20s.
