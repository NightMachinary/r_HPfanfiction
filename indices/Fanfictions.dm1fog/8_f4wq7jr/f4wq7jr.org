How about a story with Ginny and Bellatrix talking about tom riddle. Both of these women were affected by him. I find Bellatrix to be the dark reflection of Ginny. The only reason Ginny didn't become a death eater is that Tom tried to kill her in year two; if he wanted to he could have made her into another Bellatrix.

As for a plot it could be set during the Horcrux hunt. Voldemort could remember Ginny and order Bellatrix to turn Ginny to the Death Eaters.

You could also relate Ginny's feelings for Harry to being similar to that of Bellatrix's feelings towards Voldemort. They're both fighting a war for the men they love.

You also can point out the fact that both Ginny and Bellatrix are just doing what's expected of them from their families. Bella is a death Eater cause she's a Black; Ginny is with the order cause of her family. Bella was forced into a loveless marriage because of her family and you can have Bella say that Ginny was manipulated into being love with Harry by her family.

You could even do a dark end with Ginny turning.
