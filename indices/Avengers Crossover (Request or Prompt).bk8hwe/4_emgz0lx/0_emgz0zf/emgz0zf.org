#+begin_quote
  Harry has been through a lot yet there are some perks to being as gifted as he is. So he's not going to just sit back and let the world shit on him. He's going to best the absolute best. First few chapters are hard to read. Get past those and I promise it gets better. Also, I know the beginning sounds very cliche. It's explained later so try to stick with it. M for bad stuff
