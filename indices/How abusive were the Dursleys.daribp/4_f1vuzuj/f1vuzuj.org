I posted this on another thread before seeing this discussion:

Early life abuse, trauma, and/or neglect are not things that just go away, or can be overcome through 'strength of character' - they cause serious, measurable damage that will affect someone for their entire life. Brain development is affected. Emotional control suffers. Attachment becomes extremely difficult and fragile. Learning becomes much harder in many cases.

The affects of this are almost never directly realized by the person being affected. They simply act out, misbehave, make poor choices, and quite often sabotage themselves and especially relationships. I.e. they don't understand why they do what they do, although they often realize it is wrong.

Stories where characters just shrug off an entire childhood's worth of abuse and neglect because their circumstances improved are pretty immersion-breaking to me. (I.e. Canon.)

And the periods of 'good times' among all of the normal (bad) times can often do more harm than good. Every time the 'roots' start to grow (a week with a family, or a relationship starting to develop) that is ripped away, teaches the person that nothing good ever lasts anyway, so why bother trying to have those things. Worse still is the lack of control or consistency - it is why many people will sabotage developing healthy relationships/situations. It gives them control, and provides consistency, even if the control is minimal and the 'normal' situation is bad.

- It bugs me that this is brushed off and/or handled poorly in Canon.
