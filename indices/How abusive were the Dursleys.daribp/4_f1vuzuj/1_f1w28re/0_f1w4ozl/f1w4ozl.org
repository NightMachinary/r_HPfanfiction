Understood, and mostly agreed. Like with a lot of subjects, I think JKR was just flat out lazy about this. Either make the abuse/neglect less serious (which wouldn't hurt the story at all) or have the character impacted by what they went through. This is another 'There's 7 years at Hogwarts, every year has roughly 25 students, and there's 1000 kids at Hogwarts' things. It just doesn't pass the smell test if you stop and think about it.

That said, my comment is as much, or more, about fanfic than it is Canon. Fanfic, especially now, is not really geared towards the young adult/children's market. Some of the best fanfic handles some very serious topics in very mature ways. But , as someone else described it, the 'beat black and blue every day and twice on Sunday' level of abuse while being starved and belittled, isn't a thing that builds character - it destroys it.
