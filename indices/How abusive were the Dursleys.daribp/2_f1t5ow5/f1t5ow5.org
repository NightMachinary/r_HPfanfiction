The Dursley's were undoubtedly emotionally abusive /and/ neglectful to Harry. They treated him like a second class citizen, dehumanized him, insulted him, treated him like a servant while Dudley did nothing,. No new clothes when they could afford it, no birthday presents, barely using him name, Petunia taking a swing at him wth a frying pan, locking him up during COS...

"shrugs"

I grew up in a home like that and from experience? .Harry should have been a lot more traumatized, suspicious, and self loathing than he was presented.

If he hadn't been magical, I imagine it wouldn't have been as severe, but I doubt he'd have had a pleasant time of it. The Dursley's may well have resented him and treated him like shit still.
