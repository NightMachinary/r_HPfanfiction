First, I'm sorry for what you experienced - that's awful. And you're right, there's no way that abuse like that doesn't affect you in some way. However, it is important to note that not all who experience traumatic events develop PTSD - or at least, not all meet full criteria for it to be diagnosed. Thus, Harry could simply be an exceptionally resilient person, mainly due to genetic factors and such. On the other hand, again, I would expect someone to have at least some PTSD-like symptoms from someone with a background like Harry's.
