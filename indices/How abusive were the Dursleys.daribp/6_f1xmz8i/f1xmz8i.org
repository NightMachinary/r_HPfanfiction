Canon has some pretty significant emotional/mental abuse a lot of it is in the form of neglect as well.

There was some physical abuse as well, Petunia does swing a frying pan at his head when he's twelve, and in HBP I believe Harry mentions having learned to stay out of arms reach of his uncle whenever possible. Also in OotP I think I remember Vernon strangling Harry, or at least seizing him hard around the neck. Fanon tends to exagerrate the physical abuse to him being "beaten within an inch of his life" and Vernon hitting him with his belt, it wasn't that bad as far as I can remember from canon, but it was still pretty bad.

Things also get better for Harry from Prisoner of Azkaban onward since they're afraid of Sirius coming and just murdering them if they cross the line too much, and even though they know Harry risks expusion if he uses more magic, I still think they're afraid a part of him just won't decide he doesn't care.

All in all Harry is pretty horribly abused and yeah, probably should have been much less well adjusted than he was in canon.
