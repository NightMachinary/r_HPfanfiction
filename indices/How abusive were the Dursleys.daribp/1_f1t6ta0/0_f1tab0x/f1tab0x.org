  Harry should have struggled with his feelings for him for the rest of his life.

This is partly addressed in Cursed Child, where Harry blows up at Albus.

    *HARRY (seeing red):* Well, there are times I wish you weren't my son.

    *There's a silence. ALBUS nods. Pause. HARRY realizes what he's said.*

    *HARRY:* No, I didn't mean that . . .

    *ALBUS:* Yes. You did.

Harry's parenting and ongoing anger issues are attributed to his abusive childhood with the Dursleys. The concept of it was interesting, but as usual for everything about Cursed Child, the way it was executed in the plot was hamfisted, melodramatic (appropriate for a stage show but so stupid when these are supposed to be canon characterizations), and just plain ass.

  *ALBUS:* For you, it's the greatest place on earth. I know. The poor orphan, bullied by his uncle and aunt Dursley . . .

  *HARRY:* Albus, please --- can we just ---

  *ALBUS:* . . . traumatized by his cousin, Dudley, saved by Hogwarts. I know it all, Dad. Blah, blah, blah. The poor orphan who went on to save us all. So may I say --- on behalf of wizarding kind --- how grateful we are for your heroism. Should we bow now or will a curtsy do?

Thanks, I hate it.
