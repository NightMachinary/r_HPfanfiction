They're abusive just not all that physical, outside of Dudley that is. Granted Petunia does try to smack him with a frying pan and Vernon grabs him by his collar at least once.

They do the bare minimum, so he's neglected and verbally/emotionally abused. Lack of food was a punishment. We know he spent a lot of time in his cupboard.

Because it started out as a children's fairytale. It seemingly ends that way, too. I'm a fan of Dumbledore, but I'm of the belief Harry should have struggled with his feelings for him for the rest of his life. Lmfao, Albus Severus is such an absurd name. Ugh.
