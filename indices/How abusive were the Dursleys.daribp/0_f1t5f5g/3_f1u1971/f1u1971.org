That scene was Snape in his absolute lowest when it comes to Harry. I'm not excusing his actions, but saying that he abused Harry worse than Vernon based on the absolute worst-case scenario doesn't really work. It was also the only time he did so, allthough there was plenty of verbal abuse in the series from him. I do not doubt for one second that Vernon did worse than Snape ever did at his worst.
