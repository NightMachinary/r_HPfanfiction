According to the Dursleys, his parents were good-for-nothing drunk freaks who died in a car crash. Secondly... what? Badmouthing someone's dead parents, while poor form, is hardly the only means of abusing someone. And I did mention that Snape did plenty of verbal abuse. The Dursleys, especially their son, was more leaned towards physical abuse, something Snape only did once.

Look, I'm not trying to tone down what Snape did. But claiming him as worse than the Dursleys and saying they didn't do anything is just wrong.
