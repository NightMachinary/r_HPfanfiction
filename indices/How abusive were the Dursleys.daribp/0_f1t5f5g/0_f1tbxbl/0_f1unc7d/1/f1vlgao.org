Bullshit. The Children and Young Persons Act 1933 states that:

#+begin_quote
  If any person who has attained the age of sixteen years and has the custody, charge, or care of any child or young person under that age, wilfully assaults, ill-treats, neglects, abandons, or exposes him, or causes or procures him to be assaulted, ill-treated, neglected, abandoned, or exposed, in a manner likely to cause him unnecessary suffering or injury to health (including injury to or loss of sight, or hearing, or limb, or organ of the body, and any mental derangement), that person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be liable---

  on conviction on indictment, to a fine, or alternatively, or in addition thereto, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding years
#+end_quote

The Dursleys are guilty as hell of most of the offences listed here. Certainly "Ill-treats", "neglects", "in a manner which causes unnecessary suffering" and "mental derangements".
