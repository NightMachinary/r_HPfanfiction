Check out [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9z6tvj/how_do_you_feel_about_the_fact_that_in_canon_the/ea70tko/][what was said about that]] in a previous thread on the subject. At that time the legal definitions of "ll-treats" and "neglects" were not as nicely inclusive as we understand them these days. According to the standard interpretations of the time the Dursleys' bare-minimum level of providing for Harry was not lacking enough to qualify as neglect, and their punishments of him were not extreme enough to qualify as abuse.

Is that fair? No. But that's the way the law was interpreted before the changes in the mid 2000s.
