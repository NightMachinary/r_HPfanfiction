Harry's rations in CoS are below 500 calories per day. That's less than half of what he would have gotten in postwar 1945 Germany, while the country was a bombed wasteland. By any standard, that would be inhumane treatment, especially since the 1933 act mentions the unnecessary clause, which the Dursleys most certainly fulfilled.
