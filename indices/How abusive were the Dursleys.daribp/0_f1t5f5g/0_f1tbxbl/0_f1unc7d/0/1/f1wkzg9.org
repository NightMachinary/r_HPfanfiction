As I mentioned above in response to [[/u/Hellstrike]], a redditor in a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9z6tvj/how_do_you_feel_about_the_fact_that_in_canon_the/ea6xm2z/][previous thread]] covered the legal aspects rather well. Yes, there was a 1933 law prohibiting child abuse, but the legal definitions as to what qualified as abuse were not as inclusive as we understand them today. Thus, even though the Dursley's actions were barbaric, their treatment of Harry was not extreme enough to be illegal at the time.
