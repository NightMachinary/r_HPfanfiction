Keeping anyone locked in a cupboard would be inhumane treatment and a basic human rights violation. A decent attorney might even make a good case for torture. Keeping Harry in the cupboard while they had other options (even the living room couch) available also violates the "unnecessary suffering" clause of the 1933 law.
