The Dursleys may not have broken any laws on the books at the time regarding child abuse (I personally don't much care one way or the other; the fact remains that they are very much abusive), but I'd be willing to bet that they're in violation of some truancy laws: children born prior to 09/01/97 (or 01/09/97, if you're British) were required to attend school between the ages of 5 and 16, and the Dursleys kept Harry out of school for a month in Philosopher's Stone as punishment for the zoo incident.

Unless the pre-pubescent child is held responsible for their absenses in cases where their legal guardians are actively keeping them from going to school, which I seriously hope they aren't, I'm willing to bet that Vernon and Petunia have broken /some/ law with regards to childcare, if not necessarily a very dramatic one.
