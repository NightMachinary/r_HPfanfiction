I'm not familiar with British laws regarding childcare (for any number of reasons), but that seems improbable to me: they locked him in his room and literally starved him for days on end on at least two occasions, the latter time with no intention of letting him out (as in letting him back into the world, not just letting him use the bathroom twice daily) ever and with the explicit intention of keeping him from going to school.
