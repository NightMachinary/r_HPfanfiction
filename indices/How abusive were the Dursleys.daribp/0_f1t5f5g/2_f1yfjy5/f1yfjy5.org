The Snape Chronicles points out that the whole point of those Occlumency lessons was because Harry's mind was exposed to Voldemort, and Harry /knew/ that, and he also knew Snape was spying on Voldemort, and then he saw that Snape was extracting memories so that Harry wouldn't see them - so it should be pretty clear that those memories may contain damning evidence of Snape's true loyalties, which must not under any circumstances be shown to Voldemort.

For Harry to go behind Snape's back and deliberately put those memories in his own head was, from Snape's perspective, either an act of /monumental/ idiocy, or else a deliberate attempt to have Snape murdered, and either one could lead to catastrophe.
