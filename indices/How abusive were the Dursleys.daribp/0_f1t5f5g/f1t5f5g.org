The Tl;dr - Harry was abused. The Dursleys were abusive guardians, though the brunt of the physical damage came from Dudley and Dudley's gang, rather than Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia themselves (though there are explicit incidents where Vernon grabbed him roughly and Petunia swung a pan at his head.)

Many readers write it off because Harry's internal narration brushes it off, except for the 5% of each book where he's staying at Privet Drive. Harry never thinks of his treatment in terms of abuse, by the Dursleys, Snape, Dumbledore, or the myriad of people who did wrong by him throughout the story, as a part of his "forgiving" nature.

By canon standards, /Snape/ was more physically abusive to Harry than the Dursleys.

  "So," said Snape, gripping Harry's arm so tightly Harry's hand was starting to feel numb. "So ... been enjoying yourself, Potter?"

  "N-no," said Harry, trying to free his arm. It was scary: Snape's lips were shaking, his face was white, his teeth were bared.

  "Amusing man, your father, wasn't he?" said Snape, shaking Harry so hard his glasses slipped down his nose.

  "I---didn't---"

  *Snape threw Harry from him with all his might. Harry fell hard on to the dungeon floor.*

  "You will not tell anybody what you saw!" Snape bellowed.

  "No," said Harry, getting to his feet as far from Snape as he could. "No, of course I w---"

  "Get out, get out, I don't want to see you in this office ever again!"

  And as Harry hurtled towards the door, a jar of dead cockroaches exploded over his head.

Fanon, however, makes it so the Dursleys beat Harry black and blue every day and twice on weekends, sexually abuse Harry, call him "Freak" instead of teaching him his name, stunt his educational development by punishing him if he scores higher on a test than Dudley. I even read one where Harry didn't know what the word "Mom" meant (yes they spelt it that way) until he went to school and asked the teacher. Lol.
