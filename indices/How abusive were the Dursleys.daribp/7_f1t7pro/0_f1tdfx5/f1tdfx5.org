  Do the Dursleys ever get punished? Almost never. Writers always come up with strange scenarios where the Dursleys get away with it.

I honestly don't think that it's such an unlikely scenario. More often than not people don't help or ignore something terrible going on because 'they don't want to get involved'. Out of sight, out of mind, so to speak. It's not happening if you don't acknowledge it. Ignorance is bliss.

Just look up the murder of Sylvia Likens.
