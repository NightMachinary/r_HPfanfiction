The fanon abuse by the Dursleys is ridiculously exaggerated. It's no fun to read.

Usually, Vernon beats Harry to the point of breaking his bones and letting him half dead and nobody ever notices, especially the adults in muggle elementary school.

Do the Dursleys ever get punished? Almost never. Writers always come up with strange scenarios where the Dursleys get away with it. They sometimes go too far; Harry gives a fortune to the Dursleys so they move to a different location because our brave and wise hero believes that getting the Dursleys arrested for beating him would make him worse than them...
