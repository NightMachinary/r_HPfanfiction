I was just playing Digimon Cyber Sleuth so this is really timely to me.

Guilmon is a pretty good idea. He's my favorite of the show Digimon, because of his viral-yet-adorable nature. But I think he'd be really good for Harry. And maybe you could link a digivolution to Megidramon to his being corrupted by the Horcrux?

How about a Dracomon that eventually digivolves all the way to Examon? Examon has got Arthurian-based lore which I think fits well with Harry.
