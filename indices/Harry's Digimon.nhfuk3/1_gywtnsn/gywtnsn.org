Hedwig but it's an - to use this sub's favorite word - eldritch creature. It has eight wings that when she spreads them she can cover the sun even if she's pretty high up in the sky, she has a peacock-like tail with actual eyes on it that can shoot lasers, her beak is just her nose and her actual mouth looks like that of the sarlacc from Star Wars when she opens it. She also has a second mouth on its chest that when it draws air it also sucks the souls of all the people around. Her eyes can penetrate your mind and make you relive your worst fear in an endless loop until you're driven insane.
