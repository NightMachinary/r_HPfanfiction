Hmm, so there's Hermione's Furry Little Problem by Gandalfs_Beard

linkao3(2062614)

which is kinda bad and has the classic creepy underage sexuality, ew ffs

Also there's

linkao3(6318238)

which is pretty much identical due to being "inspired" by the above

linkffn(6624252)

The best of the three I've found, but still pretty dubious. It actually manages not to have explicit sex between children, and the writing isn't as bad as the other two.

In any case, you're pretty much out of luck. Those are the only three I know of and all of them are both kind of creepy and Hermione/Harry which will put off most people. The first two were all I could find for you on Ao3 and the other one I've run into before.
