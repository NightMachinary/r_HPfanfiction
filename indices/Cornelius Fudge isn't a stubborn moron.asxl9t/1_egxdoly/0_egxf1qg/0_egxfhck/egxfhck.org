I have no idea what tangent you're on about. I was in no way talking about before Voldemort's initial demise. Hence why I mentioned Harry Potter who wouldn't have existed in that time period.

Are you saying he wasn't responsible for what happened post-GoF and in OotP? He was the cause for the public denying Voldemort's return even going so far as to start propaganda for the sole purpose of ensuring nobody thought he did.
