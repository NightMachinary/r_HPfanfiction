Fudge was responsible for sending Hagrid to prison "just in case" for the Chamber of Secrets, or needing a scapegoat and using the one person who, by his prior record, was guilty of the same or similar offense. But Fudge wasn't responsible for convicting Sirius Black (the innocent man) and putting him into Azkaban for life after the first war.
