Imho, I think Fudge could be convinced to let someone like Sirius Black go, if there was reasonable doubt of his guilt, and if there was a chance he'd be offered favors for having pardoned the son of a wealthy and powerful pureblood family. Fudge is a closet supremacist, pocket politician, and cozied up to Lucius Malfoy, a Death Eater who got away with it by claiming Imperius.

It was Crouch Sr, under Bagnold, who put Sirius and a bunch of wealthy purebloods (including his own son) into prison, because he was a hardliner who made no compromises. He was a wealthy pureblood himself and had no reason to share Fudge's materialistic aspirations.
