I don't know of a story, but I can explain this.

Fudge has to be stupid for the same reason that Disney characters can't have parents. The issues can be simplified very easily. Fudge's uselessness is a plot device to ensure that events would still go to JK's tune without the audience breaking disbelief. Fudge is competent, he prepares for Voldemort's return, he gives the Order of the Pheonix support as they do to the Ministry, previous death eaters are rounded up for questioning or even temporary imprisonment, and Voldemort's final battle is more along the lines of America (Ministry) vs My House (Voldemort) rather than A House (Voldemort) vs a literal school kid.

I won't even go into the injustice proposed by sending people into prison just in case even if the period of time is limited. I can scarcely think of something worse than an innocent man being judged as guilty.
