Wasn't there a fic where Harry was a handsome, good natured himbo and incompetent but also super powerful? Like a less self centered and superficial Lockhart, but with real powers.

So he could cast a patronus right away, but he'd make it too large and too bright and basically blind himself temporarily and shit like that. And it drove Hermione nuts that someone so powerful could also be so dumb, but she still cared for him as a good friend.
