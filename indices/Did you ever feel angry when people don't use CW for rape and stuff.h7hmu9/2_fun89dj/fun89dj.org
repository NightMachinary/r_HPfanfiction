No. I've seen some pretty fucked up shit in real life, so coming across something fucked up in fiction doesn't bother me. If it's not something I feel like reading then I'll just stop reading it.

I can understand someone more sensitive to this kind of stuff being upset, so I'm not against it. It just doesn't bother me at all, which is what you asked about.
