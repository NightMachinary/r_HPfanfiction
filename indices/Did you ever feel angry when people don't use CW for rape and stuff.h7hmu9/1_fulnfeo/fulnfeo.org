It's why I use ao3, and why I have user scripts. I can permanently blacklist tags, works, or authors. I even have it set up to ignore fics with 30+ tags, because I hate seeing drabble collections with 60 different fandoms in it! But even without user scripts, I almost never have a problem with people not tagging things, especially important things like rape, on ao3. I never use ffn.net, unless I'm clicking through from a reddit recommendation, now!
