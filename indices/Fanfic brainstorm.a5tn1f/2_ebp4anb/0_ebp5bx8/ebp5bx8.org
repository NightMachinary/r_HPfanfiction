I'm thinking they've both had multiple relationships throughout the years, but none have stuck. In canon, everyone kind of married really young, but it's entirely possible that F&G could have just been swallowed by their work and could have developed some issues with accepting additional commitments. They have each other as constant company, so probably don't feel as lonely as others in similar situations might've. No incest whatsoever. I just don't want romance to be a central element.
