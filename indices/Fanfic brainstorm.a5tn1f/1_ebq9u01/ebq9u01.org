My first thought was having them end up as Sherlock Holmes and Watson. With George being super mad because everyone thinks he is the sidekick.

Another idea is them being swapped with Ron time-wise. Making Ron the big brother would make them quite upset. It would end up being canon rehash unless you make it 7th year or something.

You could also do a time travel fic where in the end they are Merlin.
