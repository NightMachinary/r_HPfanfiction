The unfinished second part to " a stranger in an unholy land", "a stranger in the promised land", has a girl who lived. I can't link because it's 8 chapters are scattered across the web, but its worth searching for in my opinion. I think its pretty good and has one of the best fight scenes i've ever read( between harry and grindlewald).
