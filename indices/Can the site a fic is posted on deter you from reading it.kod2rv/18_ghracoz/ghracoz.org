There was a time were I really tried to teach myself how to search and use Wattpad and ff.net, and while I still read on ff if the story is good enough I hate the site. Because I read in phone, the text is waaaay too small and doesn't change even if I adjust the configuration in the phone, doesn't even let me put it in night mode. Also, ads... Wattpad has a friendly format and my most famous work is posted there, but I hate the "sorting". AO3 is so convenient with the tags and everything else that since I started reading there a couple of years ago I haven't looked back. I love how you can do your own collections, bookmarks and you even have a history and Read Later option, that's what really does it for me.
