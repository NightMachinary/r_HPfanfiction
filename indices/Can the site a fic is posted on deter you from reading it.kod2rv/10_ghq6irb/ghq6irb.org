Yup. I prefer [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] because I've been established there for so long. It's second nature for me to use it, so I'm more likely to give a chance to a fic that's a "maybe" there. I have to really want to read a fic to make the extra effort to visit ao3. And if it's wattpad, I probably won't read it even if I find the summary very intriguing.
