Yeah, sadly, I do. I really don't like [[https://ff.net][ff.net]], and the story must have a really interesting premise for me to even try to read it if it's only on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]].

I won't even touch anything on Wattpad.

I really love ao3, so whenever I see an interesting rec here, the first thing I do is look if it's posted on ao3 too.
