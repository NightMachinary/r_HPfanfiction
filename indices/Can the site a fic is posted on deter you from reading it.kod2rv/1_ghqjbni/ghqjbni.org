I'm happy to use ffn or AO3 but I only actually go and look for stories on AO3 (rather than following a link). This is because I've saved a favourite with all of my included/excluded tags set up - and AO3 is really good with filtering - so I just click on my favourite and I only see results that I'm interested in.

I think there would need to be a substantial cash incentive to persuade me to read anything on wattpad. (Assuming that I could find it in the first place).
