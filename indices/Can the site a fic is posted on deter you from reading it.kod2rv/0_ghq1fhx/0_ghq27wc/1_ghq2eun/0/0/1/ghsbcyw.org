It's always fun when you look up a new fandom you get into, sort by kudos, and then count how many pages of depraved smut or "whump" you have to wade to before you can find a decently written AU.

Ffn is so much harder to search than ao3, but at least sorting by favourites gives you well written long fics rather than the equivalent of Hogwarts/Giant Squid
