I will go against the crowd and say I prefer reading on FFN. The text on FFN is a little bolder/blacker than the text on AO3, and that just makes it slightly easier to read for me.

But it's not as though AO3 is bad, just a slight preference for FFN.

Any other site, though...ugh.

ETA: I mostly read on my mobile at the website itself. (No apps.). So not sure if my experience is reflective of everyone's.
