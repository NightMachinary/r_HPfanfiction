There have been several similar requests in recent weeks, so I will just combine my recommendations.

First, James and Lily never died:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]], linkffn(6439871): Lily and Harry met Hermione's mum on that fateful day. One of the better robst fics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): James and Lily were more paranoid here and set a very nasty trap for Voldemort. They fled Magical Britain afterwards and Harry never went to Hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]], linkffn(10099028): No Voldemort AU, Bellatrix and Hermione are main characters. Decent story, but Harry, James, and Lily are minor characters.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(half awake and almost there): Non magic AU, but an excellent Harry/Ginny romance. [[/spoiler][Potters, Hermione, Sirius, Tonks are all Americans, and Lily is the POTUS]]

--------------

Harry met them in an alternate dimension:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052): Both Harry and Sirius ended up in a world where its Harry was killed long time ago, but Voldemort had trouble with a 'fucker'.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/A-Riddled-Universe][A Riddled Universe]], linkffn(8678567): Both Harry and Sirius ended up in a world where Tom Riddle was good, but there were different bad guys. No Harry in this world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2705927/1/Imprisoned-Realm][Imprisoned Realm]], linkffn(2705927): During the Horcrux hunt, Harry ended up in a much worse place where his counterpart was quite bad.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2477819/1/Lily-Potter-and-the-Worst-Holiday][Lily Potter and the Worst Holiday]], linkffn(2477819): The entire Ministry Six got catapulted into an alternate world where Neville was the BWL. Super!Harry soon showed his mettle.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9754483/1/Para-Bellum][Para Bellum]], linkffn(9754483): Harry and Ginny ended up in the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] universe, linkffn(5511855), and 20 years into the future. They were kind shocked to find Bellatrix as the Minister and married to the other Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadows Walks]], linkffn(6092362): In search for Hermione, Harry embarked on a long dimensional travel and encountered many different outcomes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville ended up in a different world where Snape and Sirius were best friends, and Lily was married with Remus. No Harry in this world.
