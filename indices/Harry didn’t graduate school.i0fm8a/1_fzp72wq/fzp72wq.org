Does Harry want to be normal? I can't recall him ever saying or thinking such a thing.

Regardless, Harry doesn't like learning for the sake of it, has no authority figures telling him otherwise, wanted to be an Auror to begin with, and was probably begged to help round up escaped Death Eaters. So it's not so great a surprise to think he'd drop out to get a headstart on something he wanted to do anyway.
