The British Ministry of Magic resembled more of a failed state after the Battle of Hogwarts. Although it properly tyrannized law-abiding citizens, it was utterly useless against sadistic genocidal terrorists. For example, after Voldemort came out into open in Year 5, it failed to capture a single Death Eater, despite Harry Potter (their supposedly Chosen One) knowing every one of his inner circle members.

Then, 6 weeks after the great Albus Dumbledore died, it fell without a fight to Voldemort's hordes. Large number of its bureaucracy collaborated enthusiastically with those sadistic genocidal terrorists to exterminate a sizable minority of its population.

Finally ten months later, its own security force, along with that sadistic genocidal maniac and his minions, were destroyed at the Battle of Hogwarts by a group of teenagers and citizen volunteers.

This was an completely pathetic organization that should have lost all authority, legitimacy, and reputation after the war. The Ministry NEEDED Harry Potter, not vice versa, to become a viable institution again.

This teenager army, who had held off some of the most dangerous dark wizards and their Auror collaborators, didn't need bureaucratic tests to prove themselves anymore. They were already much much better than those old 'Auror' scums!
