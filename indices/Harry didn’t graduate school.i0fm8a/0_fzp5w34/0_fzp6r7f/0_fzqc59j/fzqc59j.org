J. K. Rowling is constitutionally incapable of imagining a “good” revolution which does anything but reestablish the old social order plus one or two tiny adjustments.

(I joked the other day that Lucius Malfoy might still have a career in politics following the Deathly Hallows, but the more I think about it, the more likely that is in Rowling's post-series world.)
