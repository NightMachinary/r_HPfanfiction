In the 90s, although it's a little different now, leaving school with just GCSEs and not A levels was completely normal. In HP terms that would like leaving after OWLs. There are some jobs, and certainly going to University, that require post 16 education but not as much as you would think, at least back then. Also in the UK you don't graduate from school you pass exams, you don't graduate till university. If Harry wanted a job that didn't require NEWTs then it would be perfectly reasonable to not do them. The fact that the books specifically state that he needs NEWTs to be an Auror mean that he should go back and do them for that, but if he doesn't then it's less of an issue.
