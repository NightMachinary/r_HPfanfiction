You could try Certain Dark Things by eirajenson. It's a femharry with many of the same strengths as Victoria Potter: excellent prose, age appropriate characters, magical world building, and no bashing. It's set in a world that feels like a somewhat darker version of canon. Some of Riddle's horcruxes have become sentient and that really alters the broader political context.

Currently in year 3 with regular updates. The primary endgame pairing may be a little off putting (I totally get that), but at this point it's a completely gen fic and the author has made it clear that it is not going to be romance-centric.
