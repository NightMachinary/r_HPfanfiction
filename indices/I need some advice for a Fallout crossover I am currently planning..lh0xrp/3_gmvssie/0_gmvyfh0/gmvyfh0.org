I could alert her via the flag. She obviously would have seen an American flag at some point in her life, and she could see that the flag in Fallout has Thirteen Stars.

Not only that, but during her time as the Courier, she could read multiple books on the history of the world, and compare it when she got back to the HP-verse.

Oh, and she technically doesn't know anything about magic. Remember, the Courier lost their memory, and radiation damages genes, meaning in the fic she has less magical ability. This is to prevent anything...spontaneous from occuring. Such as her collar exploding in Dead Money.
