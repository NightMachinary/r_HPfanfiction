Get back to the people that need her... in the future, irradiated wasteland? Why would she think that she was in an alternate dimension, rather than just the future?

Then, rather than devote herself to studying magic to prevent the Great War, or joining anti-muggle supremacists (presumably, wizards suffered greatly during the nuclear exchange also), Ginny thinks "Total nuclear holocaust isn't that bad, but the idea of New Vegas not charting an independent course just grinds my gears!!"

If you want your Ginny to be remotely likable, it seems like she'd *have* to try and stop the war once she got back to the HP-timeline, or you'd need some sort of omniscient plot device to alert her to the fact that the Fallout-verse was a different dimension entirely from the HP-verse.
