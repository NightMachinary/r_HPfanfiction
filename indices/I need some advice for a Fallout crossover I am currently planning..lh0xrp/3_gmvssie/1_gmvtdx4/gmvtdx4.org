Continuing: I love the Fallout games, and NV was absolutely the most well-written (base) game of the whole series. But remember that they are, at their core, meant to be hopeless. It's why everywhere is an absolute shithole, and even the places that your messianic playable characters enact change (think NCR arising from FO:1/2, or BoS from FO:3), corruption and violent bigotry quickly take over.

It's a fundamental misunderstanding of most Fallout fanfiction, which so often are romances/fix-it fics. Those run contrary to the baseline of the whole series - that human beings are flawed, corrupt, and ultimately self-defeating.
