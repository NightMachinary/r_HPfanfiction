What about the different paths the Courier takes? I imagine their reactions would, on a scale from 'You are no longer my daughter!' to 'I'm proud of you, sweetie,' be this: Legion ending. House Ending. Independent New Vegas ending. NCR Ending(Since the NCR is closest to modern Britain). Now, I am an NCR player, so in my fic the last one is what I'll go for. Can she spend time in both worlds after defeating Voldemort(Or rather blowing him to hell and back a hundred times)? She has a lot of responsibility to the Wasteland, and after learning about her childhood(Since, again, thanks to Benny she only remembers her name at game start), she'd also want to spend time with them. But, she can't just abandon all the people who are counting on her. She might love Neville and Hermione, but wouldn't she like Boone and Veronica just as much? And here's something else: Would they approve of her killing so many people? The Courier has, no matter what path they take, killed tons of people. Granted, most of them were either A) in the middle of killing them, B) About to kill them or in the middle of killing their friends or innocent people, or C) trying to eat them. Still, their body count makes all the Death Eaters look like wimps.
