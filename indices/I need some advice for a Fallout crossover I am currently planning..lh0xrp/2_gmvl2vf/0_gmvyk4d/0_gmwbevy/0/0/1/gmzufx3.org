I guess my three more questions are:

1. How can Ginny balance her life in the Fallout-verse and HP-verse?
2. Would her family judge her for all the people she's killed, even if it was justified?
3. Would the battle against Voldemort be easier if they had an Endgame Courier on their side? I think getting shot in the head with All-American would be a very poetic end for Voldemort.
