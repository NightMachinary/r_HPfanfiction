Hmm...well, I think Molly would take it all very badly. Ginny is her only girl, and she's very protective of her. It would be hard for the whole family at first, but I want to believe that Arthur would find the technology fascinating eventually, especially all the stuff in Big MT. The boys might also be scared/angry, but I think most of them would come around to the cybernetics after things settled down. Would she bring something like ED-E back? Arthur and the boys would love that.

Like with many unexpected changes, it would take time to adjust, and I think most of them would, with Molly and Percy being the most resistant to it. For Molly, she'd probably have less of a problem with changes that she couldn't visually see, like heartless or spineless, than she would, let's say, a glowing cybernetic eye or some other constant visual reminder. You might have a different opinion on Molly, I know many people do. Personally, I like Molly, but her worry and love for her family can sometimes cause her to not always be the most likable person. All of them would obviously be relieved and overjoyed that their Ginny was standing there in front of them, and at the end of the day, that would help get them through.

A chem addiction, however, would be far more serious and harder to get through. Chems are nasty. Med-X is morphine and Jet is an amphetamine, for example. That's coming home with a drug addiction. It would be a struggle, but the Weasleys, and her brothers especially, would help her through it. I could see Ron, especially, staying by her side through the rough patches.
