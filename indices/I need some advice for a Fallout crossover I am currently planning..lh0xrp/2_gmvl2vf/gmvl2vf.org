I just wanted to say that I'd totally read this. I don't know why, but I like the idea of Ginny as the Courier. Possibly include the Weasley Family Ghoul? Maybe he'd come with her, regain his mind, and keep her company. Maybe she'd figure out his radioactive origin when she returns. Also, Undetectable Extension Charms, because we all know how Courier Six loves to carry everything on her back! Oh, and her technology (possibly from Big MT) /must/ save Fred.
