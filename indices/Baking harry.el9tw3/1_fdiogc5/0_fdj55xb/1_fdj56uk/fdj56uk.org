  Lily Evans was actually a deity. As Harry's Divine parent, she blessed him with her death. Now that Voldemort is defeated and Harry is of age, Lily will be able to formally claim him as hers and lead him into a bright future where he attracts the attention of a certain Norse God of Mischief. Loki never saw this storm coming when Harry caught his eye. AN: SLASH. Loki/Harry.
