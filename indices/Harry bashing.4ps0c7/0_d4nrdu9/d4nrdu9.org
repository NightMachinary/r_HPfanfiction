Crossovers often bash Harry. Dimension Hopping for Beginners sometimes bashes Harry(s).

I can't think of any non-crack HP fics that obviously bash Harry right now - unless Harry changes dramatically / goes back in time, and then bashes the old-version-Harry, or wrong!bwl where /everyone else/ bashes Harry. Both types are still Harry-centric fics.
