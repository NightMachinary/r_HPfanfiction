If you'd accept mocking canon Harry with a rather non-canon Harry depicted, a number of time travel do-over fics start with Harry dying and usually Lily berating him for being an idiot.

HPMOR, to its detriment, tends to lampshade stupidities in canon (by saying it would be stupid, or by demonstrating how stupid it was), and canon Harry is targeted sometimes.
