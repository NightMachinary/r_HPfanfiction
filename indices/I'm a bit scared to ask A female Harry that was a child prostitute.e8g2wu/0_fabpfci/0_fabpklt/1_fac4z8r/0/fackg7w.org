It's not so much weird as it contains maybe three characters from beginning to end that aren't at least morally compromised if not outright evil. It's a brilliantly built and realised world, in which is told a compelling story, but you have to catch yourself on regular when you realise what utterly repugnant individuals you're starting to feel sympathy for.
