Two-person collaboratives work pretty well. One example I can think of is the Expanse series by James SA Corey which is a pesuodym for Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck who have published works on their own. I know in manga/anime fandom there are creative collectives, but I don't know exactly how those work. Beyond that though, I agree it would be very difficult to make something in this way without some parties getting out of sorts and quitting. We've all done group projects that sucked!
