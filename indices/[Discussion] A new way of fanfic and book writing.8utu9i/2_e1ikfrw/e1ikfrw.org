This sounds like something that is a good idea on paper, but a disaster in practice.

First, writers tend to be more creative and (arguably) connected to their works and vision. I know I am. Communal creativity is not really a good idea when applied; there is a reason you don't have many great works of art that are painted by a team of people.

In my own experience, what it usually has to devolves into is one of two things: either a hierarchy is established where one person has control and can make all the decisions and decides who does what, or authors argue and compete until its a game of last man standing, and it just becomes a solo fic.

And besides which, this sounds like nothing short of attempting to create a literary equivalent of Frankenstein's monster. You have a mish-mash of multiple writing styles and agendas that people are arguing for. Even if people stuck through it, I can only imagine the narrative would flow like honey or molasses.
