I mean, I have to agree, planning exists for a reason. It's super hard to be fully aware of things like foreshadowing and theme when more hands are in the plot. I've tried 'co-authoring' things outside of fanfiction and it's an utterly miserable experience to me. I can't imagine doing it with multiple people.

As a whole the OP would have to convince me why I should bother when I know I'm perfectly capable of writing my own stories and thinking of my own plots.

And sure community vote is great and all, but..well...I can tell you the way the community will vote and that there's almost a 100% chance that is not going to be where I want to take the story. Christ had I done that on LdS I shudder to think of the final product.
