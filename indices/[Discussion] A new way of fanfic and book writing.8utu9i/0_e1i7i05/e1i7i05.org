DLP did this a few years back. It never got past chapter 2. I'd identify the problem as:

1. Authors get attached to their preferred story direction and drop out when the story goes in a direction they dislike.

2. The voters' preferences do not line up with those of the authors, accelerating the process of author alienation.
