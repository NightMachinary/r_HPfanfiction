I feel like it's partially to avoid making any close/meaningful OCs. In an orphanage, the adults can pretty much be mentioned in passing and ignored. Even the other kids can be greatly glossed over if you don't want to make any plot with them (ie bullying Harry, finding another witch or wizard there, etc).

If you go with foster parents, you need to flesh them out, give them realistic dialogue and interaction with Harry, give them longer scenes, etc. You have to do it whether they're abusive shits, or loving parents. If you just skim over most mentions of the foster home and parents, it would probably feel sort of empty and make the reader think "eh, why bother writing it that way at all then? Why not just put him in an orphanage?"

The main reason though, I'm sure, is what you mentioned about linking Harry and Voldemort.
