Hah that sounds like it could be interesting I love stories that have Harry taught other kinds of magic by characters from elsewhere. Not sure on the threat of infernal invasion, I mean that's cool too I suppose, but just seeing Harry going through the wizarding world as a walking OCP is always fun enough. I'ma just going to camp out in this thread in case someone decides to start writing something.
