I thought more people would focus on the magical, talking animal aspect of the Pixar classic, but Darla seems to make for an interesting plot point, too. I think if I was going to one-shot this I would write a lot about what happened on the reef from the dentist's perspective. It would be interesting if he interacted with Darla and started to get Hermione flashbacks or something weird seeping through from his former life, too.
