How would Darla happen? She's the niece. Although... I have had adults in my life I called aunt and uncle, for non relatives, it tends to be a term of endearment if you really like an adult/if you're close to an adult that's not a real relative, not because they were related to me, but because they were close to my mom. That could be something that happens here.
