I feel like the years between late 1997 and 2003 are sufficient for someone to become a proficient diver and build a new life, for sure.

This is an interesting take, but I also like Darla just being a totally uninvolved niece who is now - for a reason not immediately clear to the surrounding Aussie family members - the object of her previously distant uncle's affections.

There are actually a lot of ways this can go.
