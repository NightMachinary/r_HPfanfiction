Nemo takes place years after Deathly Hallows. The Grangers liked Australia and their new lives and decided to stay there. Darla is actually either Lily (there's no common term for your aunt's father, so they go with 'uncle') or Rose (they claim Hermione is their niece because they told everyone they don't have kids, so Rose is their grandniece, but they just call her a niece in public too for simplicity).

And they call her Darla instead of Rose/Lily because...I don't know, they all use fake names too or something.
