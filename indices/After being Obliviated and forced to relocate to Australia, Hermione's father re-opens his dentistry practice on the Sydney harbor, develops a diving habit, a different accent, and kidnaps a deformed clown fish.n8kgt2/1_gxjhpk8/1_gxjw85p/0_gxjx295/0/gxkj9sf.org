Honestly, less of an issue than you may think. Australia is a very large distance away, and i doubt a ton of people know the specifics of distant, estranged family. And it's not like the Death Eaters would be able to properly parse modern muggle methods of finding or contacting people, much less the still-developing Internet.

All she has to do is make sure there's no real evidence of where they went, other than "visiting family", and that noone really recalls the couple of times they may have hinted at relatives in Australia.

Even then, there's a limit to how far the Death Eaters may be able to go. With all of Wizarding Britain in the hands of Moldyface and focused on stomping out the massive degree of dissent, as well as trouble from other, far more close countries on the continent...and not being able to reasonably use airlines... as well as not getting any good indication of WHERE other than "out of the country"...

It could take literal YEARS, if not DECADES, for the Death Eaters to find them.

She just needs to implant suggestions of changing their practice's name, and make sure noone knows where they're heading. Maybe leave a few fake hints across the pond towards the U.S.

No need for an identity change. No need to even erase their specific memories of her. Just have them forget about the war, and how she's "studying abroad", and wouldn't be joining them until she's finished. Just keep mum about the magic, like they have since she was eleven, and they just...blend in.
