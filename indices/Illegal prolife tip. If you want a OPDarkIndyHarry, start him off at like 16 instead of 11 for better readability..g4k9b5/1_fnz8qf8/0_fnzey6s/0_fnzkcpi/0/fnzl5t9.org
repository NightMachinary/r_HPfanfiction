It just depends on what kind of story the author wants to tell. If it's going to be heavy on politics and more adult/complicated storylines, while still combining with the discovery of magic and learning angle, it makes sense to change the age around. If it wants to keep the dynamics of it being children, it's obviously not necessary.

But a lot of fics have the 11 year olds talking and reasoning as though they're adults - that's just ill-fitting.
