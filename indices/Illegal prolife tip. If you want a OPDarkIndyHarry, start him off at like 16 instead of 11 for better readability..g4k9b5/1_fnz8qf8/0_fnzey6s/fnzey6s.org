I believe the OP's suggestion was to shift Hogwarts so that Year 1 = 16 years old (or an older age than 11 - I like 14 personally, which would make 4th year when they turn 18 and a logical place to shift OWLs to).

In that respect, his AU backstory can be pretty light - because he still hasn't been introduced to the magical world and can keep plodding along.
