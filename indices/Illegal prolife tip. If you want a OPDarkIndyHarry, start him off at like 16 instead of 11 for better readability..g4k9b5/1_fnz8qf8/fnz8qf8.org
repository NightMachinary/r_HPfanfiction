Yeah, but in order to successfully do that you also need to build a solid AU backstory. The stories that are like "Harry snaps" tend to take cannon Harry at age 16 and just make him completely different with basically no reason what so ever other than the plot says so.

If you start him at 11 you need to take it slow and show the transition from cannon 11 yo Harry to whatever you want him to become when he's 16.

If he's already 16 then you still need to have that slow transition, you just don't have to write it.
