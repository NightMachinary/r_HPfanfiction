In our western society, maybe, remember your outlook in life can be quite different depending on how you are raised and how things are framed for you. Some countries like India and others still practice this, especially amongst the richer families, it's getting out of fashion(as far as we know) but it is prevalent enough in society to have survived well into the 21st Century.

Some fics explore this with arranged marriages, with Hermione huffing and puffing about barbaric practices, and Ron just shrugging and saying that's how rich people have been doing since ever. It's not hard to believe an insular society would still practice this.
