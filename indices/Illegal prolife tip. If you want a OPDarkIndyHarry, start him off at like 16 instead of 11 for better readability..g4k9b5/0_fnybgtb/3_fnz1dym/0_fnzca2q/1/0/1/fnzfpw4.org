Of course it was common, it was the easy way to settle wars and feuds between families. And tu further the family status. And it served to pacify the Kingdoms, peace between Kingdom could only be obtained by a union between two royals that could not be broken. A King never married for love but for the Kingdom. Or simply add the same, you never marry for love but for the family or lineage be it single or multiple. And I hate to add but the Harry Potter society is of course strongly patriarchal in those types of fanfics. In fact all nobility is always patriarchal, the line being fully transmitted in the male line, the female line being absorbed when possible. And with it the notion of Lady of the Manor.
