Then how come in almost any other society that was not Christian or similar the upper echelons of society had at /least/ concubines? Even the advanced ones.

Muslim, Indian, Mongol, Old Chinese, Old Japanse, even old Hebrew all these had men(and sometimes women) who were capable of doing so having more than one spouse, the limitation for one was normally tied to financial issues.

The Romans and Greeks may have had one spouse(I honestly don't recall), but they were so free with that stuff the marriage part was almost purely for legal reasons of inheritance.

Even old pagan European societies had polygamous relationships not being out of the norm. Yes, many chose to be monogamous but those that weren't were not persecuted unless they did something illegal or were not in the right group to do so.

I am not saying it's right, just that it happened.
