The tie between Christianity and monogamy came more from when it joined with the Greco-Roman world, which already had those values. See [[https://www.princeton.edu/%7Epswpc/pdfs/scheidel/010903.pdf][here]] for a paper talking about that, which also notes that monogamy was present in ~20% of societies - drawing from [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249179301_Regions_Based_on_Social_Structure][here]].

Furthermore, the WW was fairly decently integrated with the muggle one until the Statute of Secrecy - and still has muggleborns coming in since. Changing the cultural norms of the region that /does/ require a pretty big jump.

What I'd say is reasonable would be an arranged marriage + a mistress or affairs on the side, for the WW - that'd fit in fairly well with European nobility from the period that purebloods fics tend to draw inspiration from. If going further than that, particularly with the small numerical size of the universe, it'd take a pretty wide shift to make multiple marriages accepted/standard IMO. It's not impossible to do so by any means, but just shoehorning it in to give Harry a harem will be out of place.
