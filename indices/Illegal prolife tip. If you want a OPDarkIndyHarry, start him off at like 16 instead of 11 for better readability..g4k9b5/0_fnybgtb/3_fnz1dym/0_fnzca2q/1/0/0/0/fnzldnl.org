The Catholic church was not the only reason people were monogamous... Nor was it christianity in general, either.

It's fine to switch things up for a wizarding society. But it would need a pretty substantial change to social dynamics to make harems a normal thing of life, and /just/ adding betrothal contracts is not enough there.

That's particularly true if the Wizarding World stays as small in numbers as it is in canon.
