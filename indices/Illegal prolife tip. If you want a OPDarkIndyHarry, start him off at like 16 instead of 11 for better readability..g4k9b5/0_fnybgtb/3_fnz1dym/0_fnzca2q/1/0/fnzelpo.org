I think a betrothal contract society wouldn't be enough for that - arranged marriages were quite common in aristocratic Europe in the past, and that wouldn't make polygamy/a harem acceptable there.

You'd need to add something further to it to make it fitting socially - something like the Firebird Trilogy, which rewrites the setting to have a huge imbalance of numbers between witches and wizards.
