Agreed. If a fic wants to shortcut a lot of development (and let's be honest, how many fics really go through 7 years to have him end up as a young adult), it definitely makes sense to up the ages a good bit.

It's particularly egregious in the 'political' fics - where you've got 11 year olds talking in super stilted language and acting like tiny adults. Just up the ages a few years and you can have your political slytherins from year 1.
