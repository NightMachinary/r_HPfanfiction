It's possible, for sure - but it's not really that possible to have all the main political actors as 11 year olds, you know? If you want Harry and his friends/other students to be making important decisions and deals/plans with politics, they really do need to be aged up a bit to work. (Edit - at least, if wanting to start it from year 1)

That's assuming that the political situation and dealing with it is an integral part of the plot of that story, though - like you say, injecting a bit of the WW politics into the later years of the canon Harry Potter timeline would not be a problem.
