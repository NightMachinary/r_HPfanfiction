I maintain that it is possible to bring politics into a normal-ages HP fic without dumbing down - /as long as the author actually thinks about character when introducing political exposition or conflict/, instead of using characters as incidental mouthpieces for some particular dialogue they think sounds cool. Eleven year olds aren't stupid, but they aren't anything like what some authors portray them as.
