I only notice FictionHunt stories gone because the author deleted them at the source. But I never use the "Read Archive" feature anyway.

- [[http://ficsave.xyz/][Ficsave website]] is your friend for downloading from FFN.

- [[http://www.omnibuser.com/][Omnibuser]] is good too, and it can load Spacebattles/Sufficient Velocity threads if you read forum fanfics and CYOA's.

- [[https://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre app]] is useful if you read fanfics with your regular books on Kindle and eInk readers.
