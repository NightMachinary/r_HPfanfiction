For the first, I've seen stories get removed after an author is notified that their stories are there. They honor authors' requests to have stories removed.

For your second question, I've seen people ask for a copy of a removed fic and have success, and I've also seen people point out that an author specifically requested that not happen. So your mileage may vary depending on what story/author it is. Archive of our own let's you download stories in a few different formats. I use ficsave.xyz to download from ffn website for my Kindle, or just the ffn app itself for general offline reading. I just check the author's profile first to see if they have a note against downloading their stuff before putting it on my Kindle.
