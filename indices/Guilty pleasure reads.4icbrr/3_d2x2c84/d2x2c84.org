Ah. I'm the same with megamatt09. The writing can be pretty Ugh. and the sex scenes fairly bland/practically copy pasted every chapter. But damn do I love some of his stories. And he even has some really, really good ones. Like not his usual stuff. But my guilty pleasure read is probably linkffn(5353683). Harry Potter/Sailor Moon/Ranma 1/2 crossover. Has threats of m!preg and evil!dumbles. But I love this story and it's sequel. Holds a special place in my heart.
