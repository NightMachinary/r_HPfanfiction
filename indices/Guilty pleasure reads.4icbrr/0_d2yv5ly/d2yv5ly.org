I have a thing for Marriage Contract fics (and to a lesser extent Veela bonds). They're usually incredibly cheesy and i've really only found one or two that did it in a decent and at least somewhat realistic way but i just can't stop reading them.

It's like watching bad romance movies. Objectively i know that this is stupid but it just makes me feel good when they patch up their differences about half way through the story and then start to kick Voldies arse and take over the Wizarding World.
