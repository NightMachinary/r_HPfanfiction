All of robst's stories follow a similar structure.

- Harry and or Hermione suffer a great injustice, usually by the hands of the Ministry of Magic government, and or the Wizarding world as a whole.

- Harry and or Hermione suffer as a result of this injustice, and vow for revenge.

- A miraculous event occurs or a miraculous person assists Harry and or Hermione achieve this revenge, followed by roughly 50-100 chapters of pure ass kicking done by aforementioned characters.

- At some point during this time, Harry and Hermione hook up (if not already) and proceed to have sex at every possible moment.

- The story then ends, Harry and or Hermione living happily ever after, their revenge now taken.

That's not to say I don't like robst's fics, in fact I enjoy them a lot, just be aware that if you liked one story, his others are fairly similar, for better or worse depending on your opinion.
