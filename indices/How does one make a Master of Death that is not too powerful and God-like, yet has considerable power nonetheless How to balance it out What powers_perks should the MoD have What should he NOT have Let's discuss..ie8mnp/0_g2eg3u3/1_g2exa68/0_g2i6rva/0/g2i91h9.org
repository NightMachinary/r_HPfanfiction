Yeah, but we don't know how difficult that really is and we don't know how much of a role the elder wand played.

Could a random wizard with the elder wand do the same? Does using the elder wand when you're not the master of it help you a lot? Or at all? Could Voldemort do it without the elder wand? If not, just how much of a boost did he need?
