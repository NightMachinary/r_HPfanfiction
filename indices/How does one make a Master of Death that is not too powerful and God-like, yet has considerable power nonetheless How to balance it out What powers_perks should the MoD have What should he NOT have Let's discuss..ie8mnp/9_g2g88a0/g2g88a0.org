IMO, I think it's not about the OPness that is the problem but how you handle the characters that can make or break the story. How do Harry's power adds up to his opponent? Does MOD power gives literal power of Death r empowered necromancer backed up by Death? Both are OP in their own level; at universe(s) and world level.

And what about character interaction? Does Harry have anyone to interact for him to grow as a person? Or what genre's is the fic set in? Is it adventure/action where there'll be many action scenes or a more laid-back slice-of-life stuff where there can be comedy scenes or some fluff. All that can give laid out the foundation for the fic to progress.

My take ia that if you want to write a OP character; write it, but don't make it a one trick pony where the only focus is how OP Harry is. Make it so that OP Harry is only one facet of the story, maybe add some weakness or perceived weakness like deaden emotion or sensation.

In conclusion, it's all on a person preference and there are no right or wrong OPness level. In the end of the day, you must plan out at least a rough plan so there'll be no unforseen avoidable hiatus.
