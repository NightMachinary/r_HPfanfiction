Maybe you could have Harry slowly discovering the full extent of his abilities. He has the title of Master of Death but he clearly isn't a 'master' yet. You could start with the three artifacts always appearing on Harry's bedside table even if he always throws the stone away and puts the Elder Wand back in Dumbledore's tomb until he gets that there's no escaping them. He will have to discover the powers on his own since no avatar or persona of Death ever comes to visit him to explain things.
