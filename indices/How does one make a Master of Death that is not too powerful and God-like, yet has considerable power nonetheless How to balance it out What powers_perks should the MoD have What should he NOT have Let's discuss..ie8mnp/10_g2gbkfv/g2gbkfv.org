Just giving him the power of the 3 Hallows (without any additional perk) could give you a very powerfull, yet not invincible wizard :

- The wand would make him stronger than most, but unable to take on armies or a monster like Dumbledore or Voldemort
- The stone would permit him to communicate with the soul of the deads, very usefull in an mystery story where the MC try to investigate something
- The cloak would make him invisble, infiltration and surveillance.

I'm not a big fan of the Immortal trope, but I always liked how the 3rd brother chose the day of his death and could "greet Death as an old friend". Maybe the MoD, while he can be killed, while only die of old age when he chose to do it.

With that, you could have a 500 years old wizard (let's say a Potter) who reunited the Hallows and became the MoD. He could have stuck around Earth, doing something until he found a new MoD and then he could finally chose to die after he trained him. You would need to explain why he kept his power despite dropping the Hallows but maybe the MoD keep the immortality even after leaving (or losing) the hallows, as long as there is not another MoD to take his place.
