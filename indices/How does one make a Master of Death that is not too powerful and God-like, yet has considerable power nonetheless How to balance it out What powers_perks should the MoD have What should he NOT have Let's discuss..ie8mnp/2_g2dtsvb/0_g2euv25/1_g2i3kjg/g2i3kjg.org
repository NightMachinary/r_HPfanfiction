I agree totally that the villains don't necessarily have to be buffed to compensate for a buffed hero, though it's partly a question of /how much/ the hero's been buffed and partly one of what kind of story you want to tell. For pretty much anything but a fix-it/power-trip story, the antagonists have to have an edge over the protagonists in order for there to be narrative tension; a victory doesn't feel earned if it comes easily, after all. Thing is, no matter what the prophecy says, Harry's starting at such a massive disadvantage vs. Voldemort that many upgraded Harrys are still fighting uphill. Events go so badly for Team Good in canon that there's a lot of room to make them better without hitting the point of "too easy".

Now, that's not to say that an upgraded hero can't lead to a buffed villain: A stronger hero could lead the villain to step up their game in some way - training harder, learning new tricks, changing strategies, or using nastier stuff they had in reserve and never felt the need for in canon. They will almost certainly at least adjust their methods to account for the hero's capabilities. If there are crossover elements or the like empowering the hero, the villain will almost certainly at least want and try to acquire such power for themselves as well.

To continue with the lightsaber example, Harry getting a lightsaber and Force training would prompt Voldemort to explore the Force as well. If Riddle himself wasn't Force-sensitive, he could do something like possessing a Force-user or finding an old Sith mask or even getting some of those lizards that suppress the Force nearby to at least deny others access to a power he can't have. Having him immediately become Palpatine-level powerful and skilled in the Dark Side would be ridiculous overkill, however, at least in my opinion: When I (and I presume a lot of other people) read a crossover, we're looking for the crossover to make things /better/ for Team Good, not worse. I'm sure some people would love a dark crossover where the outside elements make things way worse and almost everybody dies horribly, but my sense is that they're not in the majority.

EDIT: Also - and to me at least this is non-negotiable - any buffs the villain gets should happen as a natural consequence of the events of the story/crossover. If nothing is different from canon for the villain, then their actions should not differ from what they did in canon. SO MANY fics ignore this and it drives me insane when things diverge from canon events without any reason to do so, just as much as railroading the plot through the stations of canon when it /should/ diverge.
