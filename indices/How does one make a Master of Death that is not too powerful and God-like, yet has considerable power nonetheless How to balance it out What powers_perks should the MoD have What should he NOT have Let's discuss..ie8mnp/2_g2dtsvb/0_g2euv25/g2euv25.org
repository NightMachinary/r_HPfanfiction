I really don't like this idea... at least in fanfics.

I enjoy the idea of a out of context power/problem coming in and messing with stuff, and going 'surprise, Voldemort has summoned demons and is now just a puppet! to \o/ /real evil/ \o/'... and similar buffs to the opposing force just to keep the power level the same(ish) defeats the reason I would want to read about some new twist.

--------------

as for MoD!Harry, imo there are a few versions you can use:

- *Actual MoD* - Death (and probably) other conceptualized-Entities need/want Avatars or similar... Harry is one, and can't die or whatever else Author wants to tack on.

  - *Early Life* - Maybe Harry pops back up after dying, maybe he has aptitude for Necromancy... The Hallows follow Harry around.
  - *Effects start showing* - Harry does not age; people notice... his friends grow old... Harry becomes a vagabond.
  - *Earth Has Died* - Harry is /old/, he is Ē̸̼̖̳͂̂̐l̷͖̜͇̏͌͐̒d̶͕̤̲͔̆̉̕r̶̹͕̒̃̀͘î̷̹͖͍͂̽͜͠ṱ̸͊͒c̴͙̠͈͠h̵̫̙̬̒̌, he has seen Cilization die... he is Apathetic.

- *Whipping-boy MoD* - Death is an asshole, it was all a trap to get a new toy to play around with.

- *Damaged Goods* - Dying leaves a stain, Harry was never the same.

- *Clueless Teenager* - After Martyr-death transference MoD; crossover or Peggy Sue, Harry is still canon!Harry and has almost nothing special except default HP-magic.

- *Old Man Harry*

  - *Family Man* - Harry achieved his dream of normalcy... he has coasted on his fame and hasn't really achieved anything special.
  - *Veteran* - Harry is /competent/, he lived a long life constantly living through crazy stuff...
  - *Knowledgeable* - For some reason Harry has learnt a lot, be it Hermione or His work or simply his crazy adventures.

- *Nifty Trinkets* - The Deathly Hallows were created by the Prevell Brothers; sure they are cool...but still "just" magic.

- *Just a title* - It does /nothing/, except maybe some ambitious idiot will hunt you down to claim the Death Stick

- *Might have forgotten some*

--------------

And many of those I find can be easily twisted to almost any power level... Heck if you throw MoD!Harry into a crossover you can strip him of his magic and hand-wave it with 'that magic system does not exist in this universe'
