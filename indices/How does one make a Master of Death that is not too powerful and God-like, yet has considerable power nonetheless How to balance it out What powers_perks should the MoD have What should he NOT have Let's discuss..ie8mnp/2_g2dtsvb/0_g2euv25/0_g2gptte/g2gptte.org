The lightsaber/death star thing is so stupid because it assumes that you will just tell the same story again. The real conflict can very well be the aftermath with billions of imperial loyalists, and even if you give luke a Death Star, that would do very little to win over people to the Rebellion side of things unless you want them to become the empire come again with a new logo. Or you give Luke the Death Star and yet the story is about his inner demons.
