You can't have a not OP MOD-Harry in my opinion. Or shouldn't at least.

But that doesn't have to keep a fic from being compelling. You just have to have an antagonist that's even more OP. There's a quote out there somewhere that's “if you give Luke a lightsaber, you have to give the empire the Death Star.” Give Harry whatever powers you want, just be able to one-up it for the bad guys
