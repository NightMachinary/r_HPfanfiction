It's pretty clear in canon that each of the hallows only works properly for their true owner. The Elder Wand is obvious, but Dumbledore also says (paraphrasing) "the cloak would never have worked for me as it does for you, its rightful owner". For my money, the most sensible (and most interesting) take is that the Master of Death is just the rightful owner of all three hallows. There's plenty there for a story, without any need for some magical set bonus.

I think the most interesting of the hallows is the stone, since it's given the least explanation in canon. I'd love to see a story where Harry uses the stone to help ghosts and spirits find peace. Not out of any cosmic duty, but just because it's the kind of thing Harry would do.
