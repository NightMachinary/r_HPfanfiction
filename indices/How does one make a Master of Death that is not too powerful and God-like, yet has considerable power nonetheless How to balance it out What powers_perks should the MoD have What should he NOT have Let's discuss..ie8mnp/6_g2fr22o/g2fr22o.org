MOD is always too literal hence why its OP. Rowling is a great writer due to that, the artifacts are powerful, but their powers are subtle.

The wand is capable of great feats, like repairing a wand... but it requires a great wizard.

The robe is an invisibility cloak that hides its wearer from the most dire of threats, but does little beyond that.

The ring... it does not bring people back to life. Merely apparitions.

Honestly, great items for a detective or an auror. But hardly “game breaking”. MOD should really be just used as an informal title rather than the ridiculous OP shit most dic writers dreams up.
