Ooh ok now you've got me thinking!

Each Death Hallow gives him a power over death. Combined, they enhance one another.

Powers:

1. The wand allows him to him kill anyone he wants effortlessly.

2. The stone allows him to commune with the dead indefinitely.

3. The cloak keeps himself alive forever.

But he's only MoD if he has all three deathly hallows on his person at the same time.

Pros:

1. He can wipe out entire armies in seconds if he wanted to.

2. He has the vast knowledge of every human being who ever died at his disposal, and can also talk to dead loved ones.

3. Immortality.

Weaknesses:

1. He can only kill if he knows his target since you can't murder someone you're unaware of.

2. He cannot bring back someone in the flesh since he wouldn't have a body to use.

3. He cannot keep someone else alive, seeing as how the cloak is what protects him, and only works for the one wearing it.

4. He ages as normal, so a couple few hundreds years down the road and he'll be painfully withering away.

5. Losing any single hallow means he is left significantly weaker and without their respective power. The remaining hallows will be rendered back to their lone abilities (wand is just powerful, stone is good for alchemy, cloak makes you invisible).

6. After losing one or more hallows he'll die quickly if he's past his normal life expectancy. Maybe even crumble into dust depending on how old he was.

I think this works because it doesn't give him any god like wisdom or power. None of that undead army raising, dimension hopping, time travelling, omnipotent nonsense I've seen before. Being MoD doesn't make him any more skilled as a wizard other than the pros listed above.

He's killable, basically.
