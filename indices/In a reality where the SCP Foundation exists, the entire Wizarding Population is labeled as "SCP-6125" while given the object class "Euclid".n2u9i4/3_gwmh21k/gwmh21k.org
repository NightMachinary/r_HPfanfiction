In a story I'm writing currently, the Department of Mysteries and the Unspeakables are the SCP Foundation.

An Immortal Harry used to work for them, studying the Veil and other Death related things, before they tried containing him. In this world, the Foundation is less than ethical, and care more about containing- /read imprisoning,/ than protecting. He escapes, and over the years he helps other's escape too.

He's Keter Class.

In the end, some idiot decides to mix time magic with the veil, it goes bad, and Harry gets sent back in time when they come crying to him for help.

Ironically, the SCP stuff is only referenced, and isn't a big part of the story. He's just name dropped as being Keter, and he says the disaster he's trying to stop is a Code Magenta.

I just love the idea of the Unspeakables being the SCP Foundation.
