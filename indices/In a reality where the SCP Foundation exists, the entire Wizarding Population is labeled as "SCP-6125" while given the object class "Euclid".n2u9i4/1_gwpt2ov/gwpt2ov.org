Wizards are definitely not euclid. Sure, they may be mostly self-containing and thus not require that much work currently, but if they chose not to, they'd be a extremely hard to contain. Additionally, the random births of new magic users can come from anyone, making containment even harder.

I think they'd be Keter or one of the esoteric classes (Cernunnos might fit but I feel like it still misses the intricacies of the “currently self-containing but easily could stop being so”).

If anything, they're probably closer to a GoI than an anomaly.

------

I think the Foundation would definitely work with the at least the higher levels of the wizarding governments in regards to maintaining containment/the statute of secrecy. They'd likely also employ a number of wizards since their abilities would be quite useful.

I could definitely see a (probably crack) fic where Arthur Weasley, as the head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, works alongside some Foundation people in the containing of some anomalous artifacts.
