A nice way to work that into the plot of HP : The SCP foundation decides that the efforts of the wizarding world to contain themselves are enough and do not require additional measures, they still monitor it and act subtely against threats to this established order. As such, when Voldemort returned and took to hunting muggles for sport, it was decided to send a taskforce to help our dear heroes put an end to the containment breach.

It could be really fun to put magic against some of the foundation's toys such as dimensionnal anchors or even a few approved SCPs used on the field. And the ruthless nature of the Foundation if discovered by the wizard could be really interesting to explore.
