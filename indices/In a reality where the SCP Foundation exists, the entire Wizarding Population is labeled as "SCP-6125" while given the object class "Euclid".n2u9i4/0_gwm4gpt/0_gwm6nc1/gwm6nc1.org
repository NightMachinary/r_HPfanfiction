lol, when Voldemort and his Death Eaters causes trouble in the Muggle World, the SCP Foundation decides to deploy Mobile Task Force Tau-5, also known as Samsara. Magical anomalies are one of the fields that Samsara specializes in containing or neutralizing, so it would be interesting to see them go up against Death Eaters.
