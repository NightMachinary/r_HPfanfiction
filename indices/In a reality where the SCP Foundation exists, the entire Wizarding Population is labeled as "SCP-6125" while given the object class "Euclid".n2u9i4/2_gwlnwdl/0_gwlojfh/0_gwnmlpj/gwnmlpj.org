I'd say it depends on if magic is something unique when compared to all the other shit the foundation knows about. For the story to be fun it would almost have to be, because stories that go like "and then they brought in a reality anchor, the end" are shitty.

Magic being unique also removes some of the absolute counters the foundation possesses, like the aforementioned anchors or telekill, which prevents the story from being a total curbstomp.

If the story still had anchors and such affect magic in unique ways, but not neutralize it, the story would ascend from good to great.

Hell - maybe magic is the natural state of the world, but suppressed by the combined psionic potential of humanity and only capable of manifesting in some areas and people. In this case, bringing an anchor to a wizard would /strengthen/ them by an immeasurable amount.
