#+begin_quote
  When it comes to odd experiences, Ash Ketchum has seen them all. So when one of Clemont's inventions malfunctions and throws him and some of his companions into another world, he decides to take it in stride and make the most of his time there - causing changes along the way. Rated T because of SAO's premise. Contains SatoSere and Kirisuna, but not main focus. Sequel has begun.
