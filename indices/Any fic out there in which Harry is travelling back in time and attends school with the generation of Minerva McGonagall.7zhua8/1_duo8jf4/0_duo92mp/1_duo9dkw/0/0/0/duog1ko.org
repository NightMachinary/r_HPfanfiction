That was the truth for a long time. JKR stated in an interview (given when the then-current in-story year was 1995) that McG was 70. That gave her a birth year of 1925 and a starting year at Hogwarts of 1937.

Unfortunately then came Pottermore and a statement of higher canon-level stating there were just two years between her leaving Hogwarts and starting teaching. And we know from her conversation with Umbridge in OP that she started teaching in December 1956. Therefore her birth year had to be adjusted.
