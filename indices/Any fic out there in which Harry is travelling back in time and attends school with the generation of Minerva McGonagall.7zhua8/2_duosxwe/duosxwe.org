I don't know about anything like that, but there's one on FanFiction.net called "Disorder of the Phoenix". Basically Harry is 20-something with Teddy Lupin being 7, and they get sent back in time by Fawkes to Harry's 5th year. Harry's older self takes the place of his younger self and he teaches DADA while trying to stop Voldemort. It's a HarryxTonks fic, if that adds any incentive.
