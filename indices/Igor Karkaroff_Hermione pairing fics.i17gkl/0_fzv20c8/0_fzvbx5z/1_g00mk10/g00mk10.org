I mean, yes, the redemption bit is a huge factor. At first I was like ooo here's a pairing I haven't seen that could be a post-war thing between the studious Hermione and the Headmaster of Durmstrang...

But wasn't he killed for trying to hide from Voldemort?

I always thought that was a really good death to include in the series, because it showed that even the Headmaster of one of the greatest magical schools in the world couldn't escape get away from Voldemort.
