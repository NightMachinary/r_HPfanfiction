  I'm getting a bit sick that every story like that is Harmony and has Dumbledore-bashing and Ron/Ginny/Molly-bashing.

You don't say?

Honestly every time I see one of these "challenges" (Severitus' The Severitus Challenge, Reptilia28's 'Don't Fear The Reaper' challenge, CoastalFirebird's 'Death Challenge') I figure some of the authors were too lazy to come up with their own story and just want free, personally tailored reading material. It's good for anyone who has trouble figuring out where to start in the wonderful world of fanfiction, but the fanon tropes get repetitive.
