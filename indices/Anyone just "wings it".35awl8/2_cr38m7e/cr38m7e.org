Take a look for [[https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=architect%20vs%20gardener%20writing][Architect vs Gardener]] on google and you'll find a lot on this topic.

Some writers are more "planners" and plan everything out. Some are more spontaneous and write what comes to them as they go. Most authors, fanfic or pro, are a combination of the two, though they may lean more to one side than the other.

Both types can be successful, for sure!
