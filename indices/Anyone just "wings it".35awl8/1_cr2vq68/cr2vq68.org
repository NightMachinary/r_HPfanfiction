Planning is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.

On the one hand a complete lack of planning is likely to reduce the interconnectedness of the story. Without planning it becomes more difficult to create hooks and clues that you can capitalise on later, instead you have to just latch on to thing you already wrote and pretend it was planned all along. If not planned it becomes more difficult to explore more complex themes and interactions, everything (themes, plot-lines, character-arcs) becomes more short term and immediate.

On the other hand too much planning can easily spell the death of a story. It can also kill the characters and the feeling of living spontaneity that most strive for. It can make a story feel more like a script, rather than a description of events. For me personally, too much planning can kill my enjoyment of writing a story. If I already know everything that's going to happen the need to write wastes away. I write for the same reason I read, because I want to see what happens. If I already know that before-hand then the enjoyment is much reduced.

I've gone to both ends. While it's easy to finish an unplanned story it also doesn't hold together quite so well, the strings and tape sometimes become visible. On the other side an exhaustively planned story looses the feeling of spontaneity and begins to feel more like an exercise in transcription.

I think it's best to try and find the middle-ground that best suits you and your style. Personally I follow these steps:

- The Bunny: "Harry Potter timetravels to WW2 and battles Grindelwald"

- The Investigation of Worth: I create a very brief overview of disparate events that could happen in such a story and decide if they would be likely to make it worth reading. I also consider the characters involved and consider if their growth or personality would be interesting.

- The Rough Plan: A time-line of events that the story much fit between. There are set milestones that are, for the most part, outside of the influence of the story. For example D-Day in the Grindelwald idea above.

- The Chapter Plan: Do a very brief (1 paragraph per chapter) description of events and things that I want to have mentioned/foreshadowed in that chapter. Nothing specific about characterization here as I like to leave them mostly to be explored in the full text. If the full text does not follow the plan exactly it's no big deal, if I discover a character simply /would not/ act in the way I'd thought they would then I'll probably re-think the plan.

TL;DR: Plan enough to foreshadow stuff and map character growth. Don't plan too much or you might kill your enjoyment of the fic.
