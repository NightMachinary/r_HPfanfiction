I use this method. Maybe call it talented, maybe lucky, but all of my professional and personal works are written this way. I prefer it, as if I stop in the middle, it breaks my flow of narrative. Slower, as i check for spelling and grammar as I go, but infinitely easier for me.

Unless I'm typing on a phone, like this post :)
