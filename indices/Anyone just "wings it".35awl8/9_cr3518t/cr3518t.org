I try to write as much as possible, maybe even the whole thing (has only happened once) and then go back and edit it. Try to make connections, cut things that dont add. This is after having a very bare bones outline, just so I know I have to get somewhere.

I find this is the best way, then I can keep a consistent once a week update schedule
