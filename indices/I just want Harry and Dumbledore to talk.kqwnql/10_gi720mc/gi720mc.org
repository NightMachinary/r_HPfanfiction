Dumbledore:- You may hate me Harry but I will say what I have kept saying it was for your best.

Harry:-No it was best for me to look up to you as a saviour.

Dumbledore:- I believe Mr Potter you are forgetting your place. You are a student in this school and I am the headmaster. Regardless of what your opinions are, the people of this country has seen it fit to have me as the headmaster so you will show me respect.

Harry:-Respect has to be earned professor.

Dumbledore:- And I have earned it Mr Potter. I have been regarded by many as the best headmaster to ever walk through Hogwarts. I had so much power at my disposal but I became a teacher. I defeated the Dark Lord Grindelwald with my skills not a fluke or sacrifice like you. I have earned my place as the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot and Supreme Mugwump of the ICW.

Harry looked stunned.

Dumbledore:- And to clear your doubts Mr Potter, I am not answerable to you. You come and criticize my faults. Do you not have your faults. What happened to this self righteous boy when sneaking out at night, sneaking a dragon, making Polyjuice potion to sneak into another house's common room, sneaking out to Hogsmeade without permission. Well then I believe you would have loved to die at the age of 11 after leading a loving life with a family over living with the Dursleys for 11 years and survive and live a long life. You surviving Quirrell was evidence to the fact.

And as for you looking up to me as a saviour, if I wanted that I would have placed you with members of my Order of the Phoenix or better yet, went myself to collect you form the Dursleys.

Now sorry for thinking about your own good. You may live wherever you want. Maybe divination really is as futile as Minerva says. Now I have much work to do. You really should learn respect. Now go and do whatever you want with your wife/girlfriend who is waiting for you. I am a busy man.
