I'd /love/ to read a fic where Harry does his edgy indie thing, only to get stopped at every step because he's grasping at straws.

"Harry, why would I steal from you? You know I'm fucking loaded."

"You think I'd hire /Ronald/ to spy on you?! Come on Harry, I have dozens of ways to get information that don't involve relying on an eleven year old boy."

"For the last time Harry, nobility was abolished generations before /I/ was born, you are /not/ a lord."

"By Merlin, that girl tried to slip you a love potion? Head on over to Poppy for a checkup while I contact the aurors..."

"My boy, I truly don't mean to sound controlling, but I literally fought Cyrus Greengrass on a death eater raid last night. There's roughly a zero percent chance his daughter has noble intentions towards you."

"Harry, for the last time, I'm a school headmaster that holds a ceremonial position in our country's legislative body and another ceremonial position in our international legislative body. I had absolutely no impact on your placement with the Dursleys."

"I get that you're trying to make new friends, my boy, but are /hufflepuffs/ really the way to go? You spent two of your four years here at Hogwarts being shat on by them, that's not a good track record."

Damn it, now I want to write a powerwank with Dumbledore being Harry's enabler.
