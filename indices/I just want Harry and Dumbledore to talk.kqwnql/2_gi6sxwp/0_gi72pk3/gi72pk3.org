The issue is that most EVIL!Dumbledore are also incredibly stupid. The plans make little to no sense, and he's incompetent enough that a child can unravel it with ease.

A proper evil Dumbledore - who's competent, smart, and actually has a good plan - would be a very interesting antagonist. But otherwise? Yeah, it's cartoonish.
