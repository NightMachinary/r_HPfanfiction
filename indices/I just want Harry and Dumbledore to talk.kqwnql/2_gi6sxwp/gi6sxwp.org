All the bashing fics (or most of them anyway) are so bloody cringeworthy.

Harry: "I HATE YOU DUMBLEDORE, IT'S YOUR FAULT MY PARENTS DIED. YOU KNEW VOLDEMORT WAS AFTER THEM AND PETTIGREW WAS A TRAITOR, BUT YOU WANTED THEM TO DIE BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO CONTROL ME BECAUSE OF THE PROPHECY! YOU PLACED ME WITH THE DURLEYS, KNOWING THEY'D ABUSE ME, SO THAT I'D SEE YOU LIKE MY SAVIOR! YOU SET UP MARRIAGE CONTRACT WITH ME WITH GINNY SO THAT WHEN VOLDEMORT KILLED ME, ALL MY ENORMOUS WEALTH WOULD GO TO THE WEASLEYS! AND SHE WAS JUST GETTING READY TO FEED A LOVE POTION! BUT BECAUSE I'M LORD POTTER-BLACK-GRYFFINDOR-SLYTHERIN-RAVENCLAW-HUFFLEPUFF-PEVERELL, I HAD THE CONTRACT BROKEN! THE GOBLINS DID IT OF COURSE, SPECIFICALLY GRIPHOOK WITH THE HELP OF THE BANK'S DIRECTOR, THE GOBLIN KING RAGNOK! AND I'M NOW GOING TO USE MY ENDLESS POLITICAL POWER TO RUIN YOU FINANCIALLY AND POLITICALLY. YOU'LL REGRET WHAT YOU DID TO ME!"

I'm sure I missed some cliches in that, but seriously, there're so many bashing fics with "evil" Dumbledore where Dumbles is so cartoonishly evil, he might as well have twirly moustache instead of the beard and let out an evil laugh every couple of minutes during his obviously evil inner monologue. Half the time (or likely more often) his evil acts don't even make sense. Seriously, I'd love to see a fic where Harry tries to drop accusations like this, and Dumbles calmly debunks each and every one of them. Or have a true evil Dumbledore, but a logical one, not the cartoonishly evil caricature. That'd likely be a one-sided slaughter, though, since I don't see how Harry could compete against all the resources Dumbles has at his disposal.
