Agreed.

I mean, I can accept and even enjoy that kind of scene... If it's at least somewhat realistic.

That can happen as a result of the adult not wanting to set off a clearly unstable magic-powered teenager, it can be because the boy is actually that powerful and they have some survival instincts... But such would need a bit of build up to be believable instead of simple asspull, as per Sanderson's First.

If there is no preparation and the adult actually holds the advantage, I'd expect some firm chastisment (if the accusations are groundless) or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11613187/1/What-Was-Your-Plan][this]] (if Dumbledore is actually a Master Manipulator Lemon Drop).

As for the harem... If they bring up their 'loved ones' in a rant against their enemy (real or imagined) then they should be ready to bear the consequences of the Death flag that raises.
