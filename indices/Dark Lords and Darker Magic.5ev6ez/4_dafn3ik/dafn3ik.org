The rarity of Horcruxes is not the danger of the Dark Arts, the costs involved in making one, or the societal taboo against those things, but because Horcruxes are /unnatural/. In the same way that having your soul sucked out by a Dementor is the worst "ultimate" punishment anyone can have, a Horcrux is the worst of the worst Dark magic, something that you'd have to be half-mad to even entertain the idea let alone actually do it.

Why? Well, to make one, you're shattering your immortal soul for a prolonged mortal life despite living in a world where the afterlife is /proven to exist/.

In short, the lack of Horcruxes is not because they are Dark -- it is because they are *insane*.
