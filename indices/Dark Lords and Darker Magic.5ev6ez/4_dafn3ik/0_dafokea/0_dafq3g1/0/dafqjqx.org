No. Ghosts are just memories of dead wizards. It could simply be their magic that lingers after their deaths. Sir Nicholas just states his own beliefs. We never know fo sure what's behind the Veil. All these evidence is circumstantial.

For what we know, what they call a soul could simply be a magical construct that is a part of a human being and plays an important part (since when it's taken from you, you die) but has nothing to do with a life after death.

There may be a life after death in HP, or there may not. But nowhere is it stated if its the case or not. At least not in the books or movies.

It seems to be a matter of personal belief, as it is in the real world.
