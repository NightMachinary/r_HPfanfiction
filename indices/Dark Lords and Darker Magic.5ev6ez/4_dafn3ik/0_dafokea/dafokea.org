But it's not.

And we don't know, either, what a soul actually is in the Potterverse. Anything on the subject in this world would be mere theory and educated guess. I can see how someone would go ahead and try it.

The evidence we have in canon about life after death are the resurrection stone and Harry's visit to King's Cross where he meets Dumbledore. Neither of which are common knowledge in this world. The former is a myth for most people while the latter, well, you only have Harry's word on that, if you're a person in the book rather than a person reading the book.

Unless there's something else?
