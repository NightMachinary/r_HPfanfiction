That's pretty weak evidence for an afterlife actually. Even if we take it as evidence of an afterlife, the ultimate question becomes 'is it better than here?' and no one seems to be arguing in favor of that.

Nick says he could have chosen to 'move on', but to what? Nothingness would be somewhere other than 'here', after all. Also, if ghosts are an 'imprint' of the living wizard, that does not require the existence of a soul. Only magic.

That the veil produces a sound superficially similar to human voices is /definitely/ not in favor of an afterlife; it sounds more like a sort of dark compulsion deal to me.

Ghost seem to be similar to humans, but apparently only form from magic/in high magic areas. They aren't really evidence in favor of an afterlife on a surface level, just complex soul/mind magic.

The Resurrection stone has not been /tested/. It /appears/ to bring back a dead loved on... *as a memory*. Your quote has Harry comparing them to the Riddle memory; that seems like a mark against the 'realness' of the wraiths, and if they aren't real then they aren't being called from an afterlife. The Deathly Hallows in general sound more like lures made by Death to kill the users than something which would actually be a challenge to Death's authority.

Lastly, the limbo state in DH is again, not necessarily an intermediate stage before an afterlife, it could just as easily be a hallucination or bizarre side effect of magic.

All in all, we have a fair bit of /weak/ evidence in favor of the soul and afterlife, /but/ nothing to indicate the afterlife is 'good', only /different/ or that making a single horcrux completely excludes one from it. The soul fragment appeared to be insufficient for the task, but an only slightly damaged soul might be able to make the transition.
