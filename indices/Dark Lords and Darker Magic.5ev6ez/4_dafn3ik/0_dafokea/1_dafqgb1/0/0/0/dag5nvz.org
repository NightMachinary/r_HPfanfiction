That's no evidence, that's what I say. There's no definitive evidence one way or another. Remember that Christians don't doubt the existence of the soul either, or that of god. It's evidence of the strength of their beliefs, not that they are right.

We knew that the soul is a real thing in HP, but that's really all we know about it. We associate the idea of a soul with that of an afterlife. But it doesn't mean this association is real.
