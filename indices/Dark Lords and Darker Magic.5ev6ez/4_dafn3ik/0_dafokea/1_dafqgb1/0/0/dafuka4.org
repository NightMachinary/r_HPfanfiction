The counterarguments seem to be mainly that "we can't take anyone's word for it," "that's just the belief of characters," and "it could be something else that wasn't mentioned even once in the books."

That's not just weak evidence -- that's /no/ evidence.

No matter how "circumstantial," what facts can be gleaned from canon point, at least for me, in one direction. Wizards do not appear, generally, to doubt the existence of a soul or its departure to wherever souls go. Dumbledore states that making a Horcrux, separating a "body and soul," goes against one of the Fundamental Laws of Magic. By that, it appears that souls are not physical but they /are/ real.

It seems to be general knowledge that souls can be destroyed (Dementors). It's less commonly known that souls can be mutilated (Horcruxes). If a soul can disappear or be altered, it has to exist in the first place. The body dies but something "goes on," and that something is likely the soul.

JKR left enough wiggle room for other interpretations, yes, but the various things in the text as a whole (along with the heavy-handed Christian themes and parallels of the last book) render the idea of an afterlife in the /Harry Potter/ 'verse plausible to me. And I'm not religious in the least.

It makes sense to me that Horcruxes would be considered the darkest of the Dark Arts purely because making one sullies what should be the most important thing a person has -- their very being.
