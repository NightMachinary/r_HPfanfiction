Put yourself in the boots of a character of the books. How many people have seen the stone? Most people think it's a myth. It's the same with Harry in the limbo. How many people have actually seen it?

  In Order of the Phoenix, Harry asks Nearly Headless Nick about the afterlife and if Sirius will come back as a ghost, which leads to him saying: "He will not come back," repeated Nick. "He will have ... gone on." And: "I was afraid of death," said Nick softly. "I chose to remain behind. I sometimes wonder whether I oughtn't to have ... well, that is neither here nor there ... in fact, I am neither here nor there ...." So Sirius has "gone on" while Nick, as a ghost, is "neither here nor there."

Here Nick just states his beliefs. We just know that Sirius hadn't become a ghost, not if there's an afterlife. I mean we can infer it since we know for sure that the stone exists, but it's not the case for most people in this universe. Also what the stone does could be something else entirely. It could make better ghosts the same way the cloak is far better than any other cloak, although it is farfetched.

  The Veil is further proof of an afterlife -- both Harry and Luna heard voices emanating from the other side (and Luna implies that she heard her mother later in the same chapter of OOTP).
#+end_quote

It doesn't prove anything. We don't know what's beyond the Viel.

#+begin_quote
  So, from what evidence there is in the text, a soul is the essence of a person and when a person dies they "go on" to somewhere else.
#+end_quote

That seems to be the most widespread belief, but it's just that, a belief.

#+begin_quote
  From all that, it's reasonable to conclude that the soul is something that exists beyond the body, something that is, for lack of a better term "immortal," and it is the soul that departs for the unnamed beyond.
#+end_quote

Again, there's no definitive evidence of that. Everything is circumstantial.
