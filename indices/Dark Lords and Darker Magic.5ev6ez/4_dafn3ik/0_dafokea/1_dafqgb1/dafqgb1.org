  Unless there's something else?

Well, there's canon.

The afterlife isn't usually explicitly mentioned in so specific a term, but its existence can be inferred from evidence in the books, like, as you mentioned, the Resurrection Stone and Harry talking with Dumbledore after the latter is dead. First, a quote from /Deathly Hallows/ when the Stone is used:

#+begin_quote
  "They were neither ghost nor truly flesh, he could see that. They resembled most closely the Riddle that had escaped from the diary so long ago, and he had been memory made nearly solid. Less substantial than living bodies, but much more than ghosts, they moved toward him, and on each face, there was the same loving smile."
#+end_quote

So the people summoned by the Stone seem to be more "there" than ghosts do. Interesting. Maybe there's something to that. A difference of some kind.

In /Order of the Phoenix/, Harry asks Nearly Headless Nick about the afterlife and if Sirius will come back as a ghost, which leads to him saying:

#+begin_quote
  "He will not come back," repeated Nick. "He will have ... gone on."
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  "I was afraid of death," said Nick softly. "I chose to remain behind. I sometimes wonder whether I oughtn't to have ... well, that is neither here nor there ... in fact, /I/ am neither here nor there ...."
#+end_quote

So Sirius has "gone on" while Nick, as a ghost, is "neither here nor there."

The Veil is further proof of an afterlife -- both Harry and Luna heard voices emanating from the other side (and Luna implies that she heard her mother later in the same chapter of /OOTP/).

As far as the soul goes and what it means -- it is the essence of a person and what "goes on" to the afterlife. Nick, again, same book, same chapter:

#+begin_quote
  "Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to walk palely where their living selves once trod," said Nick miserably.
#+end_quote

But what exactly is the soul? Remus Lupin knows what a soul is and what it means when a Dementor takes it, from /POA/:

#+begin_quote
  "You can exist without your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But you'll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no...anything. There's no chance at all of recovery. You'll just --- exist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever... lost."
#+end_quote

And, lastly, in /DH/, Harry in the "limbo" of the imaginary train station, is given a choice to either stay (in the world) or "go on."

So, from what evidence there is in the text, a soul is the essence of a person and when a person dies they "go on" to somewhere else. A ghost is a pale imitation of the person who once lived. The dead can be summoned via the Stone, personalities -- essence -- intact, aware, but not of the flesh.

From all that, it's reasonable to conclude that the soul is something that exists beyond the body, something that is, for lack of a better term "immortal," and it is the soul that departs for the unnamed beyond.
