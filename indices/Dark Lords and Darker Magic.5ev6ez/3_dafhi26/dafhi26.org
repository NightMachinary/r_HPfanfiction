I think we need to take into account how massive the Hogwarts Library is, and that the term "Dark family" is a political statement.

I believe in the first or second book, the Hogwarts Library is stated to be one of if not the largest library of magic in Europe. if it is magical, I would bet harry's trust vault that it is mentioned in that library, in some way.

Also, the whole "Dark family" thing needs to be taken with a grain of salt. So far we have only seen the Wizarding World through the eyes of Harry Potter, who is definitely bias towards the "light". Every "Dark family" is considered an enemy of Harry Potter in the series. The only one that is a stretch for is the Blacks and that can be explained by them being labeled "dark" by Sirius who loathed his family. Dark families seem to be a political thing. Nothing more or less. they dislike muggles and muggleborn and are conservative.

The reason I think we dont see alot of Horcruxes is because the process of splitting the soul is most likely extremely complex. Not only that, but upon splitting you must bind it to an object. Then you must figure out where you are putting the object. Also, it should be noted that there are doubtless wizards who created a horcrux, and then decided to carry it with them, and after death, their bodies were destroyed, and the artifacts possibly destroyed as well. We dont know what happens to the wraith of a wizard or which after their horcrux is destroyed.

I think horcruxes are those niche pieces of magic. I also don't think that Wizards or Witches view mortality like standard humans. They went to school in a place that had ghosts, and were undoubtably told all their lives about how so and so lived to be over a century. For them, I bet time does not seem to be a factor. Voldemort was unique in that he was an orphan, during one of the most death filled times of human history, and had a phobia of being alone and forgotten, most likely due to the passing of his mother.
