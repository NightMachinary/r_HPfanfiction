  We don't know what happens to the wraith of a wizard or which after their Horcrux is destroyed.

We can infer, though. Dumbledore seems pretty convinced that the Dark Lord has to be alive in order to be killed. I think that while the wizard is in a wrath state, destroying his Horcruxes isn't enough to kill him, he has to be alive so he can die. I'll admit that my evidence is pretty poor, though.
