I would counter this by stating that Dumbledore and Horcruxes only were brought up after the resurrection of Voldemort in the graveyard.

It is not in Dumbledore's best interests to cover a theoretical idea when the real threat has blood and flesh.

However, your inference maybe correct. We just dont know for sure.
