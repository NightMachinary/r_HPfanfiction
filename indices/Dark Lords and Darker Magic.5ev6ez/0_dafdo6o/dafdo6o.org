  Now, Horcruxes are supposed to be essentially the blackest form of magic, literally the most evil thing you can do. This seems... kind of odd, since murder is pretty easy and common, so presumably it has more to do with the act of splitting the soul than the murder.

I think you're misunderstanding and underestimating the wizarding aversion to splitting the soul.

  “Well,” said Slughorn uncomfortably, “you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting it is an act of violation, it is against nature.”

  ...

  “Merlin's beard, Tom!” yelped Slughorn. “Seven! Isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person? And in any case . . . bad enough to divide the soul . . . but to rip it into seven pieces . . .”

The aversion is not wholly, and perhaps not even primarily, an aversion to the creation process involving murder. Rather, wizards find horcruxes so horrifying because they're an act of self-mutilation of the soul.

We don't know much about the soul in the context of HP, but if it's anything like the soul in traditional Western religion and philosophy then the soul will be the carrier of your essential being, your true self, which is not capable of being destroyed but rather will outlive the death of the body. To mutilate one's own soul would therefore be to a wizard as the idea of performing brain surgery on yourself would seem to a Muggle. You're fiddling around with your own character and nature, who you are as a person, and causing great damage to it. Not only that, but you could very well be destroying your chance at possessing eternal life as a disembodied soul in favour of clinging to mortal life.

I doubt many wizards would be willing to do such a thing, even Dark wizards.

  It seems like a big bad pops up about every century/half a century in HP, not necessarily in Britain specifically, but in Europe more generally.

You're taking this from a sample size of two, and even then, there seem to be some pretty significant differences between Grindelwald and Voldemort. Grindelwald was not "a Dark Lord", he was a Dark wizard. As far as we know he had no aims of immortality, and indeed his goals were largely political. Voldemort appears to have been the first Dark wizard in history who sought to become something more than just a powerful Dark wizard with political influence. Rather by inventing the title "Dark Lord" and by making the horcruxes he seems to be showing an intent to become an embodiment of dark powers, a kind of primal force of nature - a boogie monster. That's the reason why Dumbledore considers Voldemort to be the most powerful, most dangerous and darkest wizard to have lived. Grindelwald may have been "wizard Hitler" (or some such analogue) but Voldemort seems to have wanted to be "wizard Sauron".
