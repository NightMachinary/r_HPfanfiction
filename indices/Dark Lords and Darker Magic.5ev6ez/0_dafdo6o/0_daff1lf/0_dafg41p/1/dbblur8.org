Voldemort wasn't "winning" against Dumbledore in Ootp, he was fighting to kill him so passionately that he looked like child throwing a tantrum before an old Dumbledore who was fighting him casually while protecting Harry from any assault. It's looks like Mcgonagall vs Snape situation in a much worse way except that in that case you consider it to be proof of Snape "superiority" over Mcgonagall.
