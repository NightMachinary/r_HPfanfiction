I certainly prefer Grindelwald as a villain. I've always seen him as a more intellectual villain that Voldemort, who was unfortunately /shown/ to be completely crazy despite how much we were /told/ that he was intelligent. This ties in with my seeing Grindelwald as an essentially political force who happens to be a very talented wizard, as opposed to Voldemort, who is more of a pure magical threat.

That said, I do think that Voldemort would win against Grindelwald in a duel (or as you would prefer to call it, a fight), given that Voldemort had a slight edge over Dumbledore in OotP, and Dumbledore had a slight edge on Grindelwald in 1945.
