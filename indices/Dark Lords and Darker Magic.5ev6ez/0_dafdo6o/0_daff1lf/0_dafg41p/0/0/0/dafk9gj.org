  All signs in canon point towards high level duels being primarily cerebral exercises involving no significant amount of physicality.

When you're older, your reflexes are slower, you tire quicker, you even think slower, you're sight decreases... Aside from this, even the more intellectual tasks are impacted by your physical condition. Not to say you're wrong, I actually agree with you for the most part, but to say that a duel doesn't require any amount of physicality, well maybe not directly, but it doesn't mean it doesn't play a part.

I heard somewhere that when Kasparov beat Karpov at the game of chess, Kasparov was in a much better shape, and that it played a huge part. Although it's difficult to find more intellectual than chess. And in chess, you don't actually put your life at stakes.

What I don't understand, though, is how someone that only led a few terrorist strikes in a relatively small geographic area (The British Islands) can be considered a bigger threat than someone who actually gathered an army and carried war over a whole continent at the minimum. I mean nobody's going to pretend that Ben Laden or al Baghdadi were more dangerous threats than Hitler...

I mean, Grindelwald seems Stalin-level threat, Voldemort, not so much...
