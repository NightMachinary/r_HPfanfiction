  Protecting a secret also is

Ok, "killing" you can explain in terms of "stopping bodily functions" or whatever. But "secret"? The intent behind a spell is to "protect the secret", but this mean that it works on the "secret", which is not an objective physical fact, but an idea. And so is "free will".

But I will try to find more decoupled from intent examples. In transfiguration it is easier to transfigure things with similar names. The intent of the spell is the same, what changes is the language connection, which again is not a tangible, physical thing, but a system that exist within human minds.

The matter of authority from which the discussion sprang upon. Neither authority nor country are directly physical ideas, they exist in the world of ideas. The use of the authority to support magic doesn't change its intent, yet it's supposed to change the effect.
