  What I don't understand, though, is how someone that only led a few terrorist strikes in a relatively small geographic area (The British Islands) can be considered a bigger threat than someone who actually gathered an army and carried war over a whole continent at the minimum.

Wildly speculative theory ahead that I was going to incorporate into TOHF:

There are a few indications in canon that temporal authority has magical weight. See this section from PoA:

  Harry blinked. Snape's eyes gleamed.

  "Let me see, let me see...." he muttered, taking out his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk. "Reveal your secret!" he said, touching the wand to the parchment.

  Nothing happened. Harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking.

  "Show yourself!" Snape said, tapping the map sharply.

  It stayed blank. Harry was taking deep, calming breaths.

  "Professor Severus Snape, master of this school, commands you to yield the information you conceal!" Snape said, hitting the map with his wand.

Snape seems to believe that including his position within Hogwarts school as part of his second spell will give it a greater chance of success. This implies that him being a Hogwarts professor gives him greater magical power (presumably within Hogwarts). Snape is generally someone who we can trust to know about magic.

Another example of this is how Dumbledore was able to fly through the no-fly spell over Hogwarts in HBP.

On top of this, the Ministry appears to possess a number of very powerful unique abilities. The Trace, for one. The Taboo is another. The ability to instantly collapse the substantial magical protections around The Burrow in DH, despite those protections having been enough to keep the Death Eaters out.

Speculative part: the Ministry is able to do those things because it has authority within Britain that boosts the magic used by its agents in its name, like Snape and Dumbledore did within Hogwarts. That authority stems from being the accepted magical ruler of Britain.

Voldemort sought to make himself essentially the dictator of magical Britain, and came very close to doing so. If his rule had endured for long enough, surely there would come a point where Voldemort was considered the accepted (however reluctantly) magical ruler of Britain. At that point it's possible that Voldemort would absorb the Ministry's magical authority and as such become an almost godlike immortal entity, at least so long as he was within Britain.

That's a pretty terrifying prospect compared to Grindelwald's ambitions, which were ultimately about promoting the welfare and power of the wizarding community at the expense of the Muggle one. Grindelwald did not really pose a threat to most wizards - only those who opposed his ideals.
