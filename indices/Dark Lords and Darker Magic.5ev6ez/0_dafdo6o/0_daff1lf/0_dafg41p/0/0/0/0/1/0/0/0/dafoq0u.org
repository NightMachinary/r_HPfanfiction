Killing Curse simply "kills".

Fidelius Charm protects "secret", and the Secret Keeper can only divulge of his "free will".

"Love" is a powerful force that is studied and can protect from powerful magic.

The Sword of the Gryffindor will appear to those who are "brave".

Etc, etc.

What are those if not ideas?
