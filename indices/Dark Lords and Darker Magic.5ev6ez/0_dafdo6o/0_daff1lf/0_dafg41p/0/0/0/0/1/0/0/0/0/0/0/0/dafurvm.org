I found the crux of the problem.

What I meant by idea and what you thought I meant by idea are two different things.

I meant idea in "philosophical" sense. To quote Wikipedia (yeah, I know)

#+begin_quote
  In philosophy, ideas are usually construed as mental representational images of some object. Ideas can also be abstract concepts that do not present as mental images.

And I thought that it's obvious from context.
