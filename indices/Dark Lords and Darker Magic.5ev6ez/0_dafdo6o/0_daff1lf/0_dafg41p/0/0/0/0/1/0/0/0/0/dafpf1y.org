Killing is an intent. Protecting a secret also is. Sure, there seems to be something about magic and semantic, but magic coming directly from ideas? No.

The sword of Gryffindor is made to appear to does who are brave, this is the intent in (of?) the spell. Being brave has a certain meaning (it probably is what the caster thought being brave is).

The caster wants a spell to do something and so the spell does it. Thus, intent. I mean, it's still an idea, but a very specific kind of idea. You don't cast a spell by simply having an idea, you actually have to want something to happen.
