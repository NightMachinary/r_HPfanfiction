The intent is to protect a secret. It is enough that the person casting the spell knows what a secret is. The spell works because the caster wants to protect a secret. Whether a secret is tangible or not is irrelevant. The spell basically makes it so your intent becomes reality. That your intent is about physical stuff or ideas has nothing to do with it. Once again, you don't cast spells using a simple idea, you cast it using an intent, you want the spell to do something and it does.

If spells were cast using ideas, you would imagine something and it would become true. It obviously doesn't work like that.

And yes, as I said before, magic seems to have something to do with semantic. It still doesn't mean that you cast it using ideas.
