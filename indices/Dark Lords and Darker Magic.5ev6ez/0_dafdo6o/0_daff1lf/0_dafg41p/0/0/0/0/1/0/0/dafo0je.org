  Magic seems to be based on ideas.

Not directly, I don't think so.

  Intent is just a part of it, so is the knowledge, so are emotions and feelings.

Yes. Although the intent seems to have a bigger role in the casting of a spell, whereas knowledge, emotions, intuition or familiarity with the spell seem to affect the power of the spell. And there also seem to be a threshold of knowledge underneath which you cannot cast your spell. Also, a strong enough emotion allows one to use magic ignoring the usual requirements but without control.

I like the fact that magic seems full of weird quirks and exceptions. As a result, it feels almost alive like it should.
