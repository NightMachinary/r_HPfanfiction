I was inspired by this fragment from Toaru Majutsu no Index

[[/spoiler][“You cannot do anything either,” said the “brains” of Versailles quietly. “We know that Curtana Original was destroyed and that the Second is with Queen Elizard. In other words, you have no real power right now. And as long as you are outside the borders of the United Kingdom, the knights surrounding you do not have all that much power either. I am aware that you love war, but are you aware that you are merely in the way?”]]

[[/spoiler][“You fool,” Carissa muttered.]]

[[/spoiler][Immediately afterwards, the knights around the second princess received a large amount of power from Curtana. They received the power from Curtana Second. Elizard must have sent out some sort of order. However, that was not enough to explain it. Curtana's effects were supposed to only work within the borders of the United Kingdom. “Surely you know that I was planning to head out to Europe in order to destroy all opposing forces if I had succeeded in my coup d'etat using Curtana Original.”]]

[[/spoiler][“You don't mean...?”]]

[[/spoiler][“How do you think I intended to do that? Did you think I was just going to complain about my inability to use Curtana's power outside of the UK?”]]

[[/spoiler][A loud noise resounded from about 10 kilometers behind Carissa.]]

[[/spoiler][Something was floating up there. It was a ridiculously huge construction. The mysterious structure could perhaps be referred to as a “square bubble” created from a random assortment of dozens of cubes made of heavy stone. The object did not seem to use any sort of normal construction technology. It looked both like an artificial castle and like a giant piece of quarried stone that was now floating in midair.]]

[[/spoiler][“That is the Mobile Fortress Glastonbury,” said Carissa. “The surroundings of the fortress are forcibly designated as within the United Kingdom, so it allows Curtana's usable area to be rapidly expanded. Don't you think this large scale spiritual item is just perfect for making an invasion regardless of what your opponent thinks?”]]
