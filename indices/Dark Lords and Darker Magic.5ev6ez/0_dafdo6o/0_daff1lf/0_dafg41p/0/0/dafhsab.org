  I actually disagree with this. Dumbledore was over a hundred years old, and was way out of his prime when he dueled with Voldemort in OotP.

Is there any evidence of this? That wizards have a prime, and that Dumbledore was past his? I can't think of anything in canon to indicate as much. Slughorn was most definitely physically unfit but was also a formiddable duellist, being one of the three who confronted Voldemort himself in DH. And Dumbledore never seemed to be experiencing any handicap in his duel with Voldemort as a result of his age. Any time he needed to manoeuvre he apparated, as did Voldemort.

All signs in canon point towards high level duels being primarily cerebral exercises involving no significant amount of physicality.

  That does not mention the fact that at the time he dueled with Voldemort, he was protecting Harry, with an animated statue.
#+end_quote

I think it's disingenuous to present this as something that hindered Dumbledore. He animated the statutes before the duel properly started. It's not like he kept having to abandon his focus on Voldemort to remedy some issue with Harry. He basically created protection for Harry and that was that.

  He was also not attempting to kill Voldemort.
#+end_quote

I don't see how this changes things at all. Whether or not Dumbledore was trying to kill or disable Voldemort, winning the duel involves the same state of affairs: getting through Voldemort's defences such that he can land a single decisive spell.

Ultimately, it comes down to this: Voldemort would have successfully killed Dumbledore in that duel had a third party (Fawkes) not intervened and taken a hit on Dumbledore's behalf. And that's Dumbledore /with/ the Elder Wand. As flawed as the Elder Wand is, surely it must impart some kind of advantage.

  I think that in a fight, because it would be a fight not a duel, since Voldemort would not bow to Grindelwald as is a requirement for dueling, Grindelwald would fair much as Dumbledore did.
#+end_quote

In canon, "duel" is the word used for any kind of magical fight.
