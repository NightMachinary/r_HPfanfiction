I actually disagree with this. Dumbledore was over a hundred years old, and was way out of his prime when he dueled with Voldemort in OotP. That does not mention the fact that at the time he dueled with Voldemort, he was protecting Harry, with an animated statue. He was also not attempting to kill Voldemort.

We haven't seen the duel between Grindelwald and Dumbledore. For all we know, Dumbledore won via luck. The whole conversation where Dumbledore tells Harry he was slightly better with his wandwork, took place in Harry's head, and was not said by the living Dumbledore. He did not learn anything he couldn't have if he thought about it. He just needed "Dumbledore" to show him the way.

I think that in a fight, because it would be a fight not a duel, since Voldemort would not bow to Grindelwald as is a requirement for dueling, Grindelwald would fair much as Dumbledore did.

I know that the Elder Wand was supposed to be the most powerful wand in existance, but we know that isn't true. The elder wand not only has been beaten, but it was beaten by a teen who had less than ten years of magical education. It was beaten by hundreds of wizards and witches throughout history. The whole Elder Wand is superior nonsense is just that. Nonsense. The only amazing feat we have seen from the wand itself is the repair of Harry's Holly Feather wand. Sure Dumbledore dueled with it, but Dumbledore was also said to be one of the greatest wizards to live.

The whole power/danger scale is up to personal interpretation, and as such is bound to be a matter of contention.
