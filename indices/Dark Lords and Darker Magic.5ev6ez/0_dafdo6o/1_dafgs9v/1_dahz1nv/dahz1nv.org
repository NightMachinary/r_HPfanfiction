To be fair, though, being a dark /wizard/ might not necessarily mean being a bad guy. Do note that quite some of the stuff used in Defence Against Dark Arts is really dark magic taught to be used defensively. Likewise, the Malfoys are sometimes said to be a “dark” family despite the fact that people actually believed Lucius about being under the Imperius rather than willfully following Tom, Thus, it is possible that there are some qualifiers for being a “dark” wizard or witch and we simply do not know what they are, and while I do not doubt that a “dark” wizard or witch probably is not the nicest a person, I think it is not tantamount with being evil.
