Point: Voldy might have been going for something more than just ruler of magical Britain and so been a 'dark *Lord*' rather than just a 'dark /wizard/'.

However I would /still/ say that dark wizards of the kind to catch the public eye must be pretty common, otherwise how could Slytherin house get a reputation for producing them? The Malfoys in a Voldy vacuum would still be a 'dark family' but no one would actually /call/ Lucius a 'dark wizard' since he isn't blowing up orphanages or whatever. There has to be a pretty big crop of people openly practicing dark magic, even if they aren't necessarily leading insurrections against the government.

Heck, Aurors are explicitly said to be 'dark wizard catchers' which is a /different job/ from the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Department_of_Magical_Law_Enforcement][MLEP]], something more like a constable. If you need an entire branch of Law enforcement devoted just to catching dangerous practitioners of the dark arts, it has to be relatively common.
