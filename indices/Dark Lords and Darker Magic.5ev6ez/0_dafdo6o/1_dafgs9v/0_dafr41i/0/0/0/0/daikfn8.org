Not explicit, but the info we were given throughout the books makes what I said way more likely to be true than any other version.

The only thing Lily did in the nursery was get spared (had she not interfered she truly would have been left alive) and offer her life in exchange for Harry. While I will not deny the possibility of there being some never-heard-before shield thing that only works if you do that, and I will note that I have seen AU stories that did this well, we do know that there are ways of enforcing deals with magic and that Tom sparing her (at Severus's plea) was a component of it happening, that her /willingly giving her life/ was important to it, and that what Harry did at the end of the seventh book (willingly give his own life, a trade asked for by Tom, in exchange for safety of the others) was the same or at least very close to what she did (and that one backfired on Tom only after he broke the terms of the deal he himself set).
