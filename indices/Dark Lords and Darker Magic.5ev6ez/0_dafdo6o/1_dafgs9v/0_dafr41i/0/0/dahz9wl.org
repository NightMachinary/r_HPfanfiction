  because then Lily Potter's protective shield (which was a, lethal and b, requiring of human sacrifice) would be like some absolute pitch black shit.

Erm, just a note, it wasn't really any effect of /hers/. What happened to Tom back then was backlash of his own magic that struck him because he gave mercy and then took it back once Lily struck a deal (her life for her son's) with him. This is why it's called “old” magic: it's not about whatever shield or other rubbish but about making a deal with intent and magic to back it up and then breaking that deal.

I do like the notion of dark magic being something different than simply curses and stuff, but if you want to get into actually picking it apart then you shouldn't slip on something like this one as this one is very much not a good example for dark or light anything.
