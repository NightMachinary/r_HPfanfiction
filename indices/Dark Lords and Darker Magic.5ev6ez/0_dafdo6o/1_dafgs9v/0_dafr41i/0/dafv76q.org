I can understand that argument, but compare it to the ATF in america. Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms are all *legal*, they just need extra regulation because of the capacity to cause harm.

*This is not that.*

The Dark Arts are (in cannon) literally all about inflicting violence on your fellow man in horrific and inventive ways. This would be like if we had an /entire branch of the police/ dedicated to orphanage arson and rape. That isn't 'something that happens and is legal but needs more oversight'; that's something which is /already a crime/ but apparently is /such/ a large concern that it needs an entire division of law officers to monitor it.

It /could/ be that it gets that much attention due to the high profile nature of the incidents, but it seems more /likely/ that it is a concern because of frequency rather than intensity.

My personal theory is that 'Dark magic' was though of more as 'traditional magic' a century or two ago; something out of fashion and not very popular in the main stream, but which still /happened/ and people were more or less okay with it. Calling /all/ spells which can harm another person 'dark' seems dumb, because then Lily Potter's protective shield (which was a, lethal and b, requiring of human sacrifice) would be like some absolute pitch black shit. It seems plausible that with the wars with Grindelwald and Voldy, and a bit of meddling from Dumbles, it was gradually made more and more unacceptable to perform Dark magic. Dark magic likely includes other sorts of spells that are somewhat grisly, such as blood based magics, but which aren't necessarily 'evil', thusly; a division of police to regulate it, not because it was 'super duper bad' but rather because, like with the ATF, this is dangerous and needs oversight /but is legal in general/. Overtime, it has become less and less acceptable until we get to the modern day where anything more than a dim grey will get you sent to Azkaban (in theory). With a bit more time, the Auror office would be dissolved or incorporated into the Hit Wizards, since virtually all Dark Magic would be absolutely illegal and be responded to with extreme prejudice.
