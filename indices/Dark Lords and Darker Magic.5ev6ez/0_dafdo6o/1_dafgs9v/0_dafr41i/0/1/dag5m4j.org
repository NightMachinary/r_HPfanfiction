But are the Dark arts about inflicting violence in horrific and inventive ways? In canon, we see that, but we're also only offered a small glimpse into the world of Dark magic. We see everything through the eyes of Harry, who clearly does not study Dark magic, and who only experiences the Dark arts when it is being inflicted on him by Death Eaters, or when Harry used the Sectumsempra curse. This is a very limited sample of Dark arts, and there is potentially a whole lot more that may not be geared towards causing harm in the most painful way possible.

Snape's speech about the Dark Arts in HBP:

#+begin_quote
  The Dark Arts are many, varied, ever-changing, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.
#+end_quote

Snape very clearly outlines the ever-changing nature of the Dark Arts. It's hard to fight because it's so varied, always changing and always developing. The danger of the Dark Arts, as implied by Snape, lies in its variation, its ability to adapt and persevere.

Hence, I don't think you likening the Dark Arts to murder and arson is very accurate. Murder and arson are two very specific crimes, far more specific than what it seems the Dark Arts are. I think, weirdly enough, the closest thing that I can relate the Dark Arts to is the Internet. The Internet is something almost everyone has access to, just like how wizards all have access to a wand. But the Internet is mostly harmless unless you choose to use it for harm--cyber bullying, hacking, advertising negative and hateful messages on forum boards, etc. The potential harm the Internet could cause is many and varied, from causing a cyber-bullied person to fall into depression to hacking government databases and releasing massive amounts of sensitive information, which is why there's a cyber division in the police these days. It's a bit of a strange leap, but I think describes the danger of the Dark Arts more accurately in a way.

Perhaps frequency plays its role, as well. But I don't think frequency is the major factor in the formation of the Auror corps.
