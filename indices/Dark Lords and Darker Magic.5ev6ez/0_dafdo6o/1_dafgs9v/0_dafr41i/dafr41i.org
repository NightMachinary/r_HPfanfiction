I'm not entirely certain about this, but it is possible that the Slytherin House reputation only became really prominent after the rise of Lord Voldemort. There's no real mention that I can recall of their reputation for producing Dark wizards prior to Voldemort. Maybe for being a House where pro-pureblood sentiment was more openly displayed or more common, but being pro-pureblood may not have equated to being a Dark wizard as it seems to have had in the Harry Potter years. Their reputation may only have been earned in the years of the war, due to both the fact that people would likely see a large proportion of Slytherin recruits amongst Death Eaters/Voldemort supporters, and especially the fact that Voldemort is a known Parseltongue and the Heir of Slytherin.

And certainly the existence of Aurors implies a prevalence of Dark arts practitioners, but also the nature of the Dark arts makes it so that it's necessary. The Dark arts, as far as I know, are typically magic that is aimed at causing harm, pain, and murdering its victims. Dark magic is very specifically to cause harm, but it's also so vague and varied that it becomes necessary to form Aurors in order to control it. Hence, I think you're overestimating the prevalence of known dark wizards. The formation of Aurors may indicate instead the variety of the Dark arts or the fear wizards and witches hold toward the Dark arts, rather than a high quantity of known dark wizards.
