I'd be a fan of the idea that making a horcrux is fairly easy and often done, but actually coming back from the wraith-state of existence after death is pretty darn complicated and therefore rare. So, a lot of people did it, but given the general danger prevalent in the wizarding world, they eventually died and are now caught in the wraith-state, unable to come back due to a lack of knowledge, ressources or the like.
