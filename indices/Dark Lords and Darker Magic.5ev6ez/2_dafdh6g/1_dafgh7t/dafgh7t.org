That seems plausible. Voldy seemed to think that the Horcruxes would make him 'immune' to death, rather than acting as tethers for the soul. Otherwise making seven doesn't make much sense, except for redundancy, and then why stop at 7? Of course it is possible that they /do/ make one resistant to common forms of death, like dragon hide makes you resistant to spells, but the AK is just powerful enough to slice through that since reflected AKs are what killed Voldy twice.

But if you didn't have a gang of loyal followers to resurrect you from the wraith state, you could be in for a long eternity.
