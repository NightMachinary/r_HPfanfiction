  Horcruxes are supposed to be essentially the blackest form of magic, literally the most evil thing you can do.

Let's say creating a horcrux were no more punishable than the murder involved in its creation. Then it would be sensible for me to murder someone to create a horcrux, go to Azkaban if I'm caught, commit suicide on the first day, and get resurrected. I've got an escape method at my fingertips. And if you can create a horcrux from killing a Muggle, well, that's barely even a crime, is it? So a person could then escape any punishment for real crimes just by dying.

By making it /evil/, you potentially turn the rest of society against anyone willing to make a horcrux, which reduces the likelihood that that escape will succeed. Azkaban or living forever as a bodiless wraith, turning less and less human as time goes on -- they're both sufficient punishment.

I'm not sure how you would convince random people to treat it as evil, though.
