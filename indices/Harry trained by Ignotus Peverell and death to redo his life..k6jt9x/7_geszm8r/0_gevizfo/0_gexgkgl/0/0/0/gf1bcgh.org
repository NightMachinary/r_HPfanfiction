holy macaronis fam

the " Kronos willing to send Harry back because of how he destroyed the time turners" you mentioned, is that part of this fic you are searching for?? because I found a fic with that. Ignotus is also involved but im confused with the whole training aspect that u mentioned (but then again i skimmed thru the fic so i may have missed that bit...)

And in this fic there is Harry being sent back to when his parent are killed and there is the whole crying for Sirius part but Sirius still leaves him bit. The goblins bt with the insult is also there, with the threat Harry gives to shift his banking to the dwarfs (who are the goblins' rivals acc to this fic)

I've skimmed thru the last few chapters and Arcturus Black is also involved but i honestly wasn't following the plot...

You know what imma just leave the link of that fic below. If it turns out to be what you are searching for, hurrah! If not, well, oops, got to simply go back to searching more ahahaha
