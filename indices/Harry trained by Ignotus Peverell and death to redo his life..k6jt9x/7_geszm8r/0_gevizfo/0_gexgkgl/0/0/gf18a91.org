oof-

so far what i found that has both ignotus and death (in the form of Thanatos tho) has no form of training given to harry...just sends him back in time to when he lives with the Dursleys :/

i+m praying so hard that the fic u mentioned has not been deleted in reality fam cuz it sounds too interesting to be deleted :(+

on a bright side, i've stumbled upon many interesting hp fics that have death in them due to searching for this fic so thanks by the way for that ahahahaha :)
