The story doesn't sound remotely familiar. Looked for Ignotus Peverell, Harry Potter, and Arcturus Black on AO3 didn't net any similar results, and random googling of FFN for Ignotus Peverell, specifically Harry trained by him netted nothing but what seems like a Ignotus reincarnation fic and what seemed like a Darkest Arts wank fic. Let me know if you find it though, since it does seem somewhat interesting.
