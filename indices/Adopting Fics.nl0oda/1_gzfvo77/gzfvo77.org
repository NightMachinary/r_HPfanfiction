I say go for it. If the fic hasn't updated since 2008, I'm not even assuming the author's alive anymore... although I tend to make that assumption about any unfinished fic these days. Even for fics where I've seen the author posting on this subreddit, when I check for updates on FFN or AO3 when I see the story still doesn't have a new chapter since 2020 or earlier, my first thought is always "Damn, I hope Covid didn't kill them", not "I hope they regain interest in writing this story".
