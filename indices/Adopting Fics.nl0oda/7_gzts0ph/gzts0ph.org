since 2008? I have no idea how to reach that person, if they haven't been on the site since. if you wish to continue a fic, then you could, but make it obvious that it is ''a continuation'' of the fic, an alternate ending, not a rewrite. You could say it was inspired, though. Last but not least, don't copy parts of that fic, although referencing them, imo, is okay.
