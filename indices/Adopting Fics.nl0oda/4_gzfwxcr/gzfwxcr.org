If the profile is still there (not deleted that is) I'd suggest sending them a PM and leaving a comment asking for permission - give it maybe a week or so, and then take a lack of response as permission.

Heck, some authors are rather against fanfiction of their work though that hardly stops content from being made so yeah.
