I've never seen Mean Girls, so I don't know exactly what level of stupid that is, but I have these stories in my lists:

linkffn(Ice Princess by Luan Mao) has Harry tutoring a brain-damaged Daphne.

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Blue_Steel/index/][Blue Steel]] by Jeconais has a Daphne who uses the ice princess persona to hide the fact that she can't walk and chew gum at the same time. At least some of the stories on the site require a login; I don't remember if this one does.
