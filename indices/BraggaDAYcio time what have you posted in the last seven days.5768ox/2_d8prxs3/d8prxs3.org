Just released chapter 12 of linkffn(The Lesser Kindness), the HP/Witcher crossover I've been working on for the past 8 months or so, after a semi-lengthy hiatus of two months. While it's not the most faved, followed, or reviewed fic in its archive (not even close, in the case of reviews), I'm pretty proud of it.

I had been low on motivation to write after the last release in August, and had actually been contemplating leaving the FF scene behind to finally take a stab at original fiction, but taking some time away from the fic has sort of renewed my fervour for it, and so I ended up working on both projects concurrently. Where I only had one idea of where to go after the current 'arc' in August, I'm now spoiled for choice with 6 or 7 different paths I can go down.
