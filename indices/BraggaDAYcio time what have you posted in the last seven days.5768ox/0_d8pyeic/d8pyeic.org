Well, I missed my (purely internal) deadline for the next [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar][Shadow of Angmar]] chapter. So that's bad, and I feel bad. On the other hand, I spent an evening cleansing my palate and posted a new chapter for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11120132/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elves-Most-Fabulous][Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous]] last Friday.
