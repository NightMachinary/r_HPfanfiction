[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11859282/9/Darkness-Ascendant-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure]] Edit: Oh, also the most faved, followed, and reviewed in its niche as well but there's only two so that doesn't say much really.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10622535/9/A-Trek-to-the-Stars-The-Potter-Files]] Third most followed in its tiny niche, sixth or seventh most favorited. got my first "i'm quitting reading this because I don't like how you write this" review too(too much sex(which might be a valid point but it was also my last sex scene in the story for quite some time)). I loved this review though:

  This is a heavier read than Tolkien. There are some mile-long, rambling sentences that are nearly incomprehensible. This is the most frustrating story I've read in a long time. I feel like I'm having a stroke. I have no idea what's going on.
