Well, in my current story, there's this flashback, but on the whole, she's not acting very jealously:

*Lavender was making eyes at him again. In the middle of the common room.

She didn't like it. They couldn't afford such distractions. Not with the Headmaster slowly dying and the Dark Lord gathering his forces. Sooner rather than later, they would have to fight. Would have to track down Voldemort's Horcruxes. And face him at the end. They needed all the preparation they could manage. Any distraction could be fatal.

And Lavender was a very obvious distraction, she thought as she narrowed her eyes at the witch. She was pretty enough, with long, blonde hair that fell in waves over her shoulders without having to be tamed with charms or potions. But she also knew how to use cosmetics and fashion to her advantage.

And she had obviously decided to go after Ron. Couldn't the witch accept that it was over? Ron and Lavender had broken up last year! But here she was, again trying to catch his attention. Too tight robes, inappropriate makeup and obviously rehearsed poses that displayed her charms to best effect.

They couldn't afford such distractions. They had to focus on the mission. On their plans.

She stood and walked over to her friends. “Ron? Would you mind helping me with Defence?”

He blinked. “You need my help?” He was looking at her, not at Lavender.

“Yes.” She nodded. “I'm still not as good at casting on the move as I need to be. And you're good at it.”

“Ah, yes...”

“Please?” She beamed at him and twisted around her finger a lock of hair that had somehow slipped out of her ponytail. Two could play that game, after all.

“Uh, sure. Let's go to the Room?” He stood, and she smiled.

They had no time for distractions like Lavender. That sort of business could wait until they had won the war. And she really did need more training in Defence.*
