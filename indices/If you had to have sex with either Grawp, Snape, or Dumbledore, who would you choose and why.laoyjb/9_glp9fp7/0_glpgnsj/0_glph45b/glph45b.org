I've never had a problem with someone being old. I was joking with my friend recently about the fact I find McGonagall sexy. He tried to argue the actress was when she was in her twenties, and sent me a pic to prove it, but I found her to be too baby faced. She's much sexier now. But I'm attracted to people and not their bodies. The real problem was the younger version wasn't Minerva.
