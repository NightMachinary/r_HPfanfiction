He also ignored the marauders bullying which could easily have driven Snape to suicide as happens much too often in real life. I'm not saying he's evil, just, not nearly as good as people make him out to be. I don't think he ever grew out of his phase of seeing people as peons to be ruled over with a gentle hand. He just got better at hiding his contempt for other people. But I grew up in an abusive household so it feels much more personal than it would otherwise. I loathe abusers. I have tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, but the evidence is pretty damning in my opinion. I know a lot of people still see him as a kindly old man, but I can't.
