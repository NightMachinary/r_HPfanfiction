No. I know he's a bastard but he also cares about the students. There's a part early on in the books where that becomes obvious so I always took it as read that he was behaving that way for a reason. Which still isn't an excuse of course.

But there's a difference between a teacher behaving cruelly and a parental figure doing the same. I had a teacher much like Snape and I hated her, but her cruelty never bothered me like my parent's did. But that may just be me. Either way my point is that for Snape having grown up in an abusive household and having experienced cruelty from others at school, he would likely have felt that what he was doing was less awful than it really was. A small price to pay for maintaining his cover.

I may be cutting the man too much slack, I know, but I don't think he would ever have knowingly left a child in an abusive household.

I understand that others might not see him the same way I do, or might not care about the distinction. Any cruelty is terrible of course. But I have an irrational affection for the man in spite of his viciousness.
