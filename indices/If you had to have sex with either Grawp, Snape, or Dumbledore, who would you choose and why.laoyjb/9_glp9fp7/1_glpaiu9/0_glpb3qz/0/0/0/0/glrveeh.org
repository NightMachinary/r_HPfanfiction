As far as we know he saw only snapshots the same as Harry did. He saw him get chased up a tree by a dog, but he didn't see that Harry spent the next few hours in that tree, etc. Granted the things he saw should've been enough to concern him. But we have no insight into what he thought of the things he saw. He may have been concerned and he may have taken those concerns to Dumbledore who convinced him he was mistaken. He may have brushed off his concerns himself, seeing them through a lens of his preconceived notions.

What we do have context for is his reaction to Harry's attempts to learn occlumency. The one time Harry forced himself into Snape's mind Harry saw Snape's memories of his abusive father and fully expected Snape to lash out at him for having seen something embarrassing, but the man didn't say anything about that. He was only interested in the fact Harry had shown himself to be capable of learning the skill. Then a moment later when he saw the fact that Harry was still having those dreams he went ballistic over it, seemingly furious that the boy was still in such grave danger. Although I know some think he was merely concerned about their losing the war because their weapon was at risk.

I won't deny that his treatment of the students was inexcusable. But I don't think he was a terrible person. There's a difference between being cruel to someone for a few moments and sentencing a person to a decade of cruelty. Both are terrible, but one is a hell of a lot worse. Dumbledore groomed Harry to off himself in the hope that he would survive it, not the certainty.

I get that you like Dumbledore and you don't want to see him as a complete bastard. But I have never seen him as anything other than a manipulative bastard. He reveals at the end of the second book that he knew Lockhart was stealing people's memories. I hated him from that moment, but I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps he didn't know until after he hired the guy that he was doing that, hard to believe but I tried. But in my opinion the books provide too much damning evidence of his guilt.

I'm not trying to argue you out of your opinions of either of them. Just clarifying my own. I think we're going to have to agree to disagree.
