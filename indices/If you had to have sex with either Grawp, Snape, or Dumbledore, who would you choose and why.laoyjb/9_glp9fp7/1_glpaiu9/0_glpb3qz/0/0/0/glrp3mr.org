He... Doesn't, tho?

I mean, he explored Harry's mind, all his memories, while teaching him Occlumency. Now, I refuse to believe that you'd think Harry wasn't in an abusive home, so tell me, what did Snape do?

Did he wallow in self-pity, convinced that he did to Harry what James did to him, but worse because you can't fight a teacher? Did he give any kind of excuses to Harry for the way he's been a massive piece of shit?

Fuck all, he just told him "lmao u suck at occlumency" and continued assaulting Harry's mind.

Another proof he doesn't really care? When a non-Slytherin gets injured by a Slytherin, he just mocks them, and doesn't give a fuck about bringing them to safety. Like with the incident between Malfoy and Harry, in GoF, where Hermione's teeth grew up because of Malfoy's spell. I don't remember what happened to Crabbe, but he was allowed into the infirmary. Hermione had to /skip classes/.

Which means as a professor, he was bad enough, unprofessionnal enough, and uncaring enough to /play blatant favourites/.

Sure, the poor wittle Severus Snape, always consorting with future Death Eaters, cursing "Mudbloods" in his off-time, was constently targeted by the Marauders. Poor baby. That must justify the years of abuse the children of Hogwarts suffered under him.

Poor little Severus Snape, creating dark spells made to injure permanently someone at age 16. Can someone give us an F in the chat for this poor lost soul.

I can easily see why Dumbledore, the well-meaning but old and disconnected Headmaster of the best British Wizarding School + 2 other full times jobs, is infinitely worse than someone who didn't hesitate to betray the guys he was working with, because the other guys could maybe do more to save his crush. His crush that, must I remind you, /he pissed off because of his racism/.

So yes, your affection towards this piece of garbage is deeply irrational, much more than your dislike of Albus Dumbledore, whose biggest failures are probably not seeing the individual pieces in a war he fought for, what, more than 3 decades?
