Grawp is a hazard to health so really it's just a choice between Snape and Dumbledore.

On the one hand, Dumbledore is old. However, Snape in the books is described as truly hideous, with unhealthy, sallow skin, lank, greasy hair, and crooked, yellowing teeth. His personal hygiene is extremely suspect.

Dumbledore, at least, is likely to maintain a basic level of cleanliness, and on that basis, I'm going with Dumbledore over Snape.
