A lot of people see him only as a coward but I personally abhor him more so than almost anyone else in the series. He indirectly kills one of his best friends and sentences another to what he expects will be a life in prison. He kills those twelve muggles, Frank Bryce, and Cedric.

Worst, however, is how he, more than probably any other character, is responsible for Voldemort's return. In a way he's indirectly responsible for everything Voldemort does post GoF
