I don't know --- the books are unclear on whether the stone just works on your loved ones, or if it can call back anybody but most people just /use/ it on their loved ones because that's who most people want to bring back. I remember stories where Harry uses it to call back Cadmus Peverell himself, for instance, thereby getting more info on the other Hallows.
