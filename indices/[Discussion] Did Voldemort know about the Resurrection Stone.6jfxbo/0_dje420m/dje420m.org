Personally, I think Voldemort was lying through his teeth. He didn't have any way of bringing James and Lily back, but neither did he have any intentions of letting Harry join him. He was just talking out of his non-existent ear, making promises he did not intend to keep, just to get Harry to give him the Philosopher's Stone. And then he could kill him afterwards.
