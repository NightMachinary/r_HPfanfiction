Why is it so impossible for him to bring them back? In a world where Prior Incantato from brother wands can bring back a spirit, where the resurrection stone does it on its own, why can't people be brought back from the dead?

I can see how that idea wouldn't appeal to voldemort as a method of immortality as it would rely on a third party to help him once he is gone.

I could see it being within his power to bring them back, but I can also see that power, or even knowledge of it being possible considered a very dark art.
