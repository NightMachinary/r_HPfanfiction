It is a truth very rarely acknowledged that there is more than one kind of "unfinished business." Certainly, ghosts are evidence that you aren't quite done with this life - but what of the others? What about those who weren't afraid to move on, but still had so much more to give before they really /could/? That's where Harry came in. Souls stuck in a never-ending cycle of death and rebirth couldn't move on until they "got it right" . It is the job of the Master of Death to gently prompt and arrange things so that a soul may finally meet Death as an old friend, this time.

Harry, immortal and never changing, got used to seeing old friends in new faces. The first time it happened, he could have died of a heart attack! He saw the angry, bitter expression of Severus Snape on the face a small South Asian girl that was staring at the Sorting Hat as though she would dearly love to set it on fire. The expression deepened as she was sorted into Gryffindor.

As Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Harry was ideally situated to interfere in this particular case. (Although he had to laugh, after all of those cursed years, Hogwarts finally had a teacher it couldn't get rid of. Assigning group work with a mixture of cheerful souls and hard-working "parent friend" types had given young Sevitri a group of friends for life very early on in First Year. In Fifth Year, Harry had taken her aside to discuss careers and gently suggested that she consider the Department of Mysteries and not teaching. Her talent for research and innovation had carried on into her present life and, frankly, Harry wanted those old bastards to be shaken up a bit.

Many years later, Harry reaped her soul from her deathbed and watched as Sevitri/Severus' eyes widened in recognition.

"Potter... No, Professor Potter."

"Severus. Or Sevitri, as you like."

"What... Oh. I'm dead again. Aren't I?"

"Well-observed. I have a question for you: Do you have any regrets?"

"I have achieved all I wished to, professionally. It's only polite to leave some mysteries for the next generation to explore." They waved their hand imperiously.

"And personally?" Harry persisted.

Sevitri/Severus looked over at the sobbing figure of their green-eyed wife:

"How could I?" They said softly. "I had her."

As Harry escorted them to meet Death, he privately vowed to never, ever reveal that Sevitri's wife contained the spark of life that once animated Petunia Dursley.
