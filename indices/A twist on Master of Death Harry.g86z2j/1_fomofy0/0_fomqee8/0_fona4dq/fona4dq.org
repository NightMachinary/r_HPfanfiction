FINAL PART

"Really?! Bloody really?! What was wrong /this/ time?" Harry felt a vein throbbing in his temple.

A spectral Cedric looked at him sheepishly over his latest body.

"Sorry Harry, it was nice and all... But I guess it turns out the Quidditch life wasn't for me. Sorry." He shrugged.

In his latest life, Cedric had been Ganymede Harper - star Seeker of the Irish team and the Wellington Boots. He was talented, handsome, roguish and dedicated his spare time to saving the non-magical Kiwi bird. He had a wide circle of friends and family, and the occasional meaningful relationship; he was on good terms with /all/ of his exes, for heaven's sake! He was perfection! Until he took a Bludger to the head and his neck snapped.

"Help me out here, Ced. /What is for you?/" Harry rubbed at his scar aggressively for the first time in decades. "You've been an Auror, a Charms teacher, a Quidditch player and even /Minister for Bleeding Magic/ once!"

"I'm honestly not sure, Harry. It's been all been enjoyable, but honestly this time was a bit... Grand. Honestly, I don't know how you can stand it. Stood it. You're not still famous, are you?" Cedric asked.

"Eh. Kinda? I think I'm just a fact of life right now. "The sky is blue, you can't conjure food from nothing and Harry Potter is still alive." That kind of thing. God bless wizards and their total acceptance of the bizarre with only a few questions." Harry smiled indulgently in a way that immediately reminded himself of the way Mr Weasley regarded muggles. "The Department of Mysteries occasionally tries to capture me in a summoning circle, but they haven't done that in a looong time." Not since he'd sent them a reincarnation of Seamus Finnegan to wreak incendiary chaos. (How was Harry meant to know that Heliopaths were real)?

"Wow. That seems rude." Cedric frowned.

"You get used to it. Now onto you. Hmm... "Too grand" eh? Let's try something new." With a wave of a hand, Harry banished Cedric into the void to be re-born, focusing desperately on the word "humble."

Of course that was the mistake Harry had kept making. He'd forgotten that Cedric was a Hufflepuff, through and through. He'd spent so long focusing on what Cedric could have been, he had forgotten who he was. A kind, fair person who thought that there ought to have been a re-match in his third year, and had shown him nothing but decency in his fourth - even when no-one else had. No. Glory was never his aim.

Harry sighed. He really, really missed Dobby. He wanted a cup of tea and simple non-existential conversation. Sadly, Dobby had died happy the first time and moved on.

He kept a metaphorical ear out for Cedric, and carried on with life as per usual. Lavender Brown surfaced as a Centaur and was living her best life without his help. He marked essays between comforting students who experienced death for the first time. That was always heartbreaking, but at least most of them appreciated his explanation - even if they hated that he refused to tell them what lay beyond. He even managed to convince Professor Binns that it was time to move on while he waited. (It turns out that he really just needed to deliver a lecture on the treaties that concluded the last great Goblin War. With the unit finally done, he felt he could move on).

One day, he got a "ping" on his spiritual radar and found himself in a maternity ward in London. Two muggles cooed over a healthy baby boy that had Cedric's hazel eyes. There wasn't a single spark of magic about the child. Huh. Now wasn't that intriguing?

--------------

Teon Stone had a good life. His parents loved him to bits, he had Aunties and Uncles for streets around - he was even related to a few of them - and friends to play football with. He loved a kickabout in people's back gardens, and he liked the huge matches that they played with a tennis ball across the tarmac at school. As long as he had a friend and a ball, he was happy as Larry. He didn't even mind it when he was inevitably called in for tea.

Harry surreptitiously slipped a leaflet for a summer school at West Ham United's grounds through the letterbox. Teon's Mum hadn't needed much persuading; Harry had enchanted the word "free" to stand out to her. So off he went to the summer school, which lead to him eventually joining the junior side and making a lot more friends along the way.

Harry watched as Teon grew to love football, but loved teaching the younger kids more. He turned down a place on the Under 17 side to focus on his exams. He didn't want any more pressure in his life. Somehow, wherever he went he saw and heard ads telling extolling the virtues of teaching - as if by magic!

By the time he died, Teon had lived an excellent life. He had become a Primary School teacher and coached football in a park next where he grew up every Saturday. He had become a "pillar of the community" in his own way. He'd married and had three children who he loved with all his heart - not necessarily in that order. Harry knew that Teon Stone would be mourned even more than Cedric Diggory had been. The years to come would be filled with wistful talk of "Mr Stone" - tales of full of comforted children and encouraged potential, of smiling at people he met on the street and of the best goat curry since their Nan's. He would be missed.

"How's it going?" Harry eyed Cedric smugly as he lead him away from the mourning Stone family.

"You know what? That was just right." His smile was calm and gentle.

"No regrets?"

"Not this time."

"I am so glad." They walked towards the light in silence.

Suddenly Cedric stopped.

"Harry... Do you... Are you alone?"

"Huh?" The question short-circuited Harry's brain briefly. " I mean... I do all of /this/ alone and I have friendships, I mean they all die sooner or later..." He trailed off. "It's okay. I'm fine."

"It is /not/ okay!" Cedric frowned. "You do all of this for everyone else and look after everyone else, who looks after you?"

"I do, Cedric. Always have, always will." It's not like the Dursleys had coddled him.

Cedric threw his hands up in the air. "That's it. I'm officially unsatisfied! I'm not leaving a being of near infinite power to go gaga on his own, just because he doesn't know how to share a burden!"

A retort died on Harry's lips. An image of Dumbledore, alone in his machinations and gradually losing sight of the humanity of his chess pieces as he confides only what he has to to who he has to. It was sharing the burden that got them through the Second Wizarding War, after all.

"I don't know if anyone can." He confides quietly. "Me becoming Master of Death was a very unique set of circumstances." He felt a hand on his shoulder.

"Well, it's a good thing that I don't want your job. I just want to help." Cedric spoke softly and smiled moreso.

"Is this where we kiss? Buy me dinner first and then we'll talk about eternity together." Harry quipped.

Cedric rolled his eyes:

"You wish, Potter. C'mon, we have Death to convince."

Harry chuckled and they walked side by side into the light. Wait until he saw that Luna Lovegood had taken upon the mantle of Death herself...
