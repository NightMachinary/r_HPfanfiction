Hi! I know this comment is like a month old, but I stumbled on this post today and the premise reminded me greatly of a novel called Reincarnation Blues. The main character is more like this story's Cedric than Harry, but if you liked the general premise- reincarnating over and over again until having lived the 'right' life, including mildly exasperated Death- definitely give it a shot.
