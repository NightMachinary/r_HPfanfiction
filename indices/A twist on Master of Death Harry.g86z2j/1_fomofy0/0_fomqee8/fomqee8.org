PART TWO

Some assignments were easier than others. Who would have thought that Draco Malfoy would be happier running his own bistro in Montpellier and making his own way in the world? Harry was very sorry when he eventually died and moved on; his treacle tart was heaven on a plate. Sirius had been happy just to live long enough to grow old, even if he always had a love of open skies that he couldn't quite explain.

Hagrid had been simultaneously incredibly easy and difficult. Seeing him at all had thrown Harry for a loop. He'd always assumed that Hagrid had been very happy in himself - he seemed content with how his life had turned out. But then it occured to Harry: How many adults relied on eleven year-olds for company? Did Hagrid even have friends outside of the student body? The teachers and the other members of the Order seemed to treat him like some kind of simpleton, and the less said about his brief on/off dalliance with Olympe Maxime the better. On top of all this, no-one had apologised when it was revealed that Hagrid should never have been expelled. No-one gave him a new wand and offered to teach him. Harry felt like a horrible friend.

Somehow it hadn't surprised Harry that the new Hagrid was almost exactly like the old one: "Big-boned", fiercely loyal and Gryffindor. What did surprise him was how hard it was to constantly prevent him from getting expelled. If he wasn't sneaking into the Forest, he was trying to sneak the Forest into Hogwarts. An acromantula, again? Really, Hagrid! A brief word in Hagrid's Fifth Year to Professor Weasley (a grandson of Percy's) and Hogwarts suddenly had it's first ever student TA. He was only allowed to assist with younger years, but it seemed to teach him restraint and lesson-planning in a way that he'd never quite managed as a teacher.

Harry had been called to the Dragon Sanctuary on Skye in time to witness Hagrid breathe his last. He was a literal bloody mess, but he had a smile on his face.

"'Arry! What are you doin' here?! They're gonna do summat horrid to Daisy!"

"Hello old friend. Is Daisy the dragon that just eviscerated you, by any chance?" Harry was bemused.

"She were only playin'..." Hagrid grumbled. "She don't know her own strength. Don't deserve to be killed for that..."

"Hagrid. This is a dragon reserve. They know that better than anyone!"

"Fair enough. Anyway, how are you?"

They chatted amiably as Harry guided his first friend into the light.

If Harry had thought that Rubeus Hagrid was a challenge, it was only because he hadn't known Cedric Diggory was yet to come.
