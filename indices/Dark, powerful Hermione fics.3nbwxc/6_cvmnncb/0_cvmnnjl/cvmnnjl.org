  Hermione Granger snaps and unleashes fire and death upon the wizarding world as only a muggleborn can. “I am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds”- J Robert Oppenheimer, father of the Atomic BombI've wanted to write a story where the light uses muggle technology for a while now, and also one with a dark Hermione. This is what came out. I won't be expanding it any, as I feel like the ending fits. The HMS Vanguard is a real ship, one of four Nuclear Missile submarines in the service of the British Navy. It calls from the Clyde Naval Base in Scotland and carries forty nuclear warheads atop eight Trident-II Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles. I don't think I'll write something quite this dark again, but if I'm in the mood I might put out another oneshot like this one. - Sincerely, ~partiallykritikal

  Hermione is a sister to Harry, a mother to Rose and Hugo, a wife to Ron, and a Legilimens and Unspeakable. She is also very, very angry. A look at a Hermione who developed the instincts she evidenced with Marietta Egdecombe and Dolores Umbridge. AU, though canon compliant. *Drama/horror. COMPLETE.*

      This piece is posted under my old profile name on FF\.net\. As that profile notes, after a colleague sent a link to that profile to several other colleagues, I moved all but two of my fics to a new profile, which shares the name I use here\.A/N: This story arrived from nowhere, hopped on my back and took up a very great deal of my time\. Less a plot bunny and more a plot gorilla\. Or, if you like, a plot walrus\. Story notes and acknowledgments afterward\.
