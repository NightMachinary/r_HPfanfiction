  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)

  When she was young and naive, she thought that nothing could justify slavery and the end of liberation justified any means.

  Like all children, however, she grew up, and put aside childish naivete; she came to realize that slavery was not such a bad thing - that slaves did not desire freedom, but a kind master.

  In which Hermione takes over the Wizarding World.

      Minkhollow's prompt: "Epilogue AU\.
  #+end_example

  All is not well, and the leader of the next group of troublemakers... is Hermione."

  Trigger warnings for spousal abuse, character death, blasphemy, and an imminent dystopia.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
