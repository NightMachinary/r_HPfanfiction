Ow that Star Wars one is an hilarious premise, hadn't seen that one before.

Too bad most of these fics are unfinished, and some even abandoned :(

ps: I check the bloodmoon story manually once or twice a week despite following it, that's how much I'm looking forward to that updating. You know, just in case ffn forgets to send me an email
