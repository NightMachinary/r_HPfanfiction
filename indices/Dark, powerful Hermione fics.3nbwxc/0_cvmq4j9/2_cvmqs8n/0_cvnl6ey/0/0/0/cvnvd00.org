Considering both chapter 4 and 5 ended with one of the two main characters of the story going in a major new direction from where they'd been going so far, that doesn't surprise me ;)

I've reread the first 5 chapters several times now, and am thinking of breaking my 'don't favorite incomplete stories'-rule, so your efforts are most appreciated.

I do have to say, I really want Hermione to have her revenge on Dumbledore & co, I hope she can get Harry('s new coven) to follow her as she goes on to lead the world into darkness....
