I was going to do this, but as [[/u/zombieqatz][u/zombieqatz]] noted you get less reviews and favs this way, and I haven't made any of the changes my betas suggested so I'm going to release as I finish editing the chapters, after finishing the entire novel-length fic. I think the idea of finishing a novel-length story before posting is a foreign one to most fic authors.
