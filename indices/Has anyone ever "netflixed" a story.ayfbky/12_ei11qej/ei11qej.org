I remember the author for lucky harry did not do this. He completed the story and then released it over time to get maximum hype. He had the complete story for a good year or two before he "finished" it.

I remember being in a facebook group with him, he was like "Hey guys just completed lucky harry" and I was like "Great, link me to it and i'll read it." and then he acted like I was an asshole for wanting to read the story he just said he wrote????
