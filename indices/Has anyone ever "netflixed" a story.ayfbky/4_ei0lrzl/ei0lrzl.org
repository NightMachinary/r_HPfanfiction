I've kinda done it. I've got a ton of abandoned stories on FFN (still adding to that count). So, for Euphoria, I told myself that I wouldn't post any of it until it's done, so that's exactly what I did. Wrote and edited about 120k words over the span of two months, and then released a chapter a day until it was all up. So it wasn't all on the same day, but there really wasn't a reason why I couldn't do that, I just tried to milk some extra reviews and such.
