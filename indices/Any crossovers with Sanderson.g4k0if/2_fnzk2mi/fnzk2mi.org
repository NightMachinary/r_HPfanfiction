I would love to see allomancer!Harry! Like if the killing curse opened his soul to death and since magic flows through the soul into the body he got powers like he ingested Lerasium or something.

Bonus points if Vin's cognitive shadow gets attached to him somehow and she gets him to run away from the Dursleys and teaches him how to live on the streets.

Extra bonus points if copper works like occlumency shields and emotional manipulation metals works through said shields, though Snape notices it happening.

Also, goblins.
