I think that sort of thing needs to be handwaved away in any crossover setting. Allomancy seems easiest to do that with, as I think canonically an allomancer on another planet in the Cosmere would still be able to get powers from the metals there - so just saying it'd happen on Earth seems fine to me.

For Stormlight, it'd need an extra step, but it could probably be tied in with Harry Potter magic somehow if the author wanted to - probably starting with needing to carefully ration it, and then having a way to renew the investiture somehow.
