Well, you could, but without Stormlight anyone from Roshar no longer has their magic. Meanwhile Allomancy runs on Preservation, so if the HP universe has no connection to the Cosmere any Mistborn is also rendered useless. These problems could be handwaved, true, but I think you'd have to at least make any fic using these elements partially crack.
