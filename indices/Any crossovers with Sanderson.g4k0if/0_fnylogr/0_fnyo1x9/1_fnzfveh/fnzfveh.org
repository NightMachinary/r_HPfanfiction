I think that's the way it'd have to go, yeah. Natural 20 does it wonderfully - though it'd be harder for an allomancer or stormlight user to manage to pretend to be a wizard/witch, it would still make for an interesting setup.

Particularly with how /weird/ both Roshar and Scadrial are (at least, pre-Catacendre Scadrial) - I'd see the major non-worldhopper characters finding our world very, very strange, which would be a good bit of fun.
