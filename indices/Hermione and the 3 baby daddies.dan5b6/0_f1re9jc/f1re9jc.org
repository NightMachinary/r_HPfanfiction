"What do you mean, you can't be pregnant?"

"Well, I just can't!"

"Hermione, you have been sleeping around for years. This was bound to happen eventually."

"I have been sleeping with witches Harry. Witches! Not wizards."

"You - but I thought that you played for both teams."

"But - I - That's what I told you in 98 to ease the shock - And in the past decade you never noticed that I only introduced you to girlfriends, and not a single boyfriend?"

"Well, if you put it this way it sounds a tad suspicious..."

"Great. Now that we have sorted this out, can we please go back to my apparent miraculous conception?"

"Well, I don't know how I am supposed to help you there."

"You are the only person I know who has experiences with House Elf stalkers."

"Dobby, bless his soul, was trying to protect me by almost killing me."

"And I nearly choked on my red wine when that elf suddenly popped in to vanish the glass."

"So you took the word of a mad house elf - "

"I did the test, both magical and from Sainsbury. I tried on three different days, and they all show positive, no matter what I try."

"Do you have no idea who the /father/ could be?"

"Unless my child will become Jesus or Anakin Skywalker, no. I had three partners, and none of them had the necessary plumbing. Believe me, I checked."

"Anyone I know?"

"Well, there was Linda from the bakery across the street. She has no magic, but who knows if her great grandfather was a squib. Aveline - Fleur's cousin, I am not sure if you have met her last Christmas at Shell's Cottage. And Mel, although that was just two week ago."

"Maybe try asking the Elf next time he comes around."

"So I just wait, possibly for months, to find out who knocked me up?"

"Wait here, I have the perfect bait."

"Harry, you know I can't drink," Hermione said as Harry returned with a green bottle.

"Yes, but does the elf know that you won't?" Harry replied and his friend took the glass. But before it could touch her lips, an elf popped in and vanished it before disappearing with a mumbled /'Bad Mistress!'./

"Well, that was useless."

"I hate to tell you, but his robes had the same embroidery as Fleur's towels."
