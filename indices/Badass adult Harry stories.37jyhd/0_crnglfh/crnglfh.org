- 1, There is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/41/Emperor][Emperor]] (W: 619,123; abandoned for 5 months), in which Harry sets himself a goal of becoming --- well, an Emperor. You may have problems with the OoC-ed characters and their morality though.

- 2, +There was another rather original story the name of which I don't remember,+ [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][HP & the Wastelands of Time]] (W:346,090; abandoned for 7 months), in which an adult-“Harry” was stuck in a time loop, I think. The author seemed to have pretty good writing skills, but the story was rather different from the original universe, both in terms of character personalities and magical system.
