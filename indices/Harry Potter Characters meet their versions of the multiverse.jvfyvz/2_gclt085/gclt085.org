.oOo.

Dumbledore looked at his counterpart, who was talking about how indignant he was that he hadn't used Harry. After all, there were so many different ways to manipulate the naive brat.

Honestly, Albus was still trying to process how he could become someone so heartless. Especially to spoil Tom Riddle? He did exactly the opposite. Use the Potter child? God, he loved him like a son. It made his conscience hardly hold out, although he knew he was doing well. Besides, meeting this Dumbledore allowed him to relieve a little. But when he heard about forcing him to be loyal to him, giving him potions to make him love Ginny Weasley was too much for him.

- What the fuck are you thinking? - he yelled in the face of the speechless old man. - Forcing someone to LOVE ?! YOU MORON...

It ended up with the other Dumbledore's having to pull the canon! Dumbledore away from the Manipulative! Dumbledore, because it would have ended in murder and changed universes.

.oOo.

Lily Potter was currently trying to calm down. She was staring at the front woman, so soulless, heartless, and in general, it couldn't be called her. All she wanted to do now was find that poor boy Harry from their universe, hug him, and make sure that Lily was tormented. For now, however, she had been listening to the argument between Lily who had lost Harry while fighting Voldemort and Lily whose son had been raised by the Dark Lord, who were rightly screaming at the bitch.

Hearing how they threatened her with the Cruciatus curse, she was ready to join them.

The woman's pathetic excuses were like music to her ears. She really didn't want anything more than hurt her. Anyway, now that she thought about it, who was standing in her way? There was no James or Sirius or Dumbledore so she was all hers and the few other women in that room, but that's a detail. I mean, there were these other idiots trying to help her, whether it was because they thought Harry was evil or some other kind of bullshit. In any case, they could handle them.

She stood up with a disturbing smile and sparkling eyes. She pulled out her wand and thought about what she wanted to do first.

.oOo.

Sirius tolerated his counterparts quite well. Of course, he had already dealt with the traitor of his friends, ended up broken with both legs, two teeth knocked out, a concussion and a cracked chest. Now he could have a pleasant conversation with Sirius who raised Harry, and Sirius who was deadly handsome and raised Harry as well.

.oOo.

If Harry were to be honest, he would never have thought that he would have been invited to tea by Tom Riddle, who was smiling and clearly mental, and certainly that he would also invite Dumbledore and (here he began to seriously consider the mental health issue) Severus Snape.

However, once he knocked on room number 7 (began to wonder if this was a joke on the part of the good Dark Lord) and sat back, he couldn't help but notice that the place was really cozy. The green walls, white curtains, a few ancient looking appliances, a green carpet again, a couch covered with a gray blanket in a reindeer pattern, and finally a Christmas tree in the corner of the room were really nice to look at. He couldn't help but wonder what happened to their Tom.

He had almost forgotten that twenty-four-year-old Voldemort was standing leaning on the doorframe, watching him with grinning teeth, and he came to sit on a beautiful green-upholstered chair. Is everything /green/ here? he asked himself mentally, but it was interrupted by the doorbell, which the brunet in the kitchen opened with wandless magic.

- Make yourself at home! - heard him scream - I will come to you soon.

The man looked around the small apartment with hidden admiration. Severus could not imagine his serpentine master in such a decorated room. Or even imagine him as an ordinary person. And also one with empathy. Albus Dumbledore had those annoying glittering eyes in place as always. But now they looked more natural. He sat down comfortably in the armchair that sat on the other side of the patterned table.

They waited in silence for a moment until the young man brought tea with milk and cookies and took his seat himself.

`` It's ... '' he began swaying. "I met that one of yours ... what was his name? Voldimort? No, I guess it was ..."

"Voldemort," Harry put in helpfully, and Tom gave him a grateful look.

- It was he ... Can someone finally tell me what is wrong with my counterpart?! - he said calmly, but it was obvious that he was agitated. - He was killing children! He murdered effortlessly and still laughed. This ... it can't even be called bestiality!

Dumbledore looked at him grimly from under his half glasses.

- Forgive me, Tom, but I don't know when it happened. We suspect that when he turned sixteen and created the Horcrux ...

As Riddle heard the word Horcrux, his cup fell from his hands. He looked shocked, turned terribly pale and focused his incredulous eyes on the old man.

- WHAT HE DID?!

Sorry if there are a lot of mistakes, but English is my second language and I am still learning it.
