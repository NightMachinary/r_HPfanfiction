.oOo.

Harry honestly had no intention of being in the room of his other versions after meeting Tom. But as he stood in the middle of the arguing five Harry Potter, one with an even more fucked up childhood than he was, he felt even worse than a few minutes before. There were two super Slytherin Potters in the corner of the room who watched it with a mocking smile on their face, there were four mentally tired Boy-Who-Lived by the door, and nearly twenty pathetically annoying scarred men who were making Canon! Harry could feel bile rising in his throat. And to think he might have acted like that.

When he almost had a nervous breakdown due to being pulled all over the place and curious younger or older Harry's who were genuinely curious about how he was living, his savior appeared. Another Harry in Slytherin, but that didn't bother him. The boy pulled him out of the circle of the curious club and quite rudely announced that he was now his and that they could piss off, took him to the cafeteria.

He looked gratefully at his companion and took his seat. He looked around quickly and noticed that there were a few Ron's and Hermione's and probably some giggling Lavender Brown and her severely irritated version. He shook his head and looked at his counterpart in the other universe and smiled.

"Thanks, I thought I was going to die there. Seriously, just a few more minutes and I'd have to crank up." He said, at which the black-haired smirked.

"Someone would have thought the Golden Boy was used to the spotlight." He replied lightly, but there was a hint of bitterness in his tone. If Harry didn't know himself that well, he wouldn't have known the difference. He also knew he wouldn't want mercy, so he quickly changed the subject.

"So .... You like Quidditch?" he asked after some thought.

"W-What? ... Er, I guess ... I usually play the seeker." He said clearly confused. The young man on the other side of the table, on the other hand, smiled inwardly.

"Me too, what's your record for snitch catching time?

They spent an hour talking about Hogwarts, his differences, the Quiddich, politics, and most importantly, Voldemort and his band of flatterers. Harry involuntarily felt relieved that this particular Slytherin Harry had never joined him.

"You know, they say he used to be sane. But sorry, I don't believe it. Nobody in their right mind would create a Horcrux for one. Second, I find it strange that he was chasing children in the first place after hearing the prophecy. Seriously?"

"I totally agree." Canon muttered, "No offense, of course, Tom." He muttered to a man who passed by, who nodded his apology.

"True words never spoken." They heard a scream at which they both laughed.

And then Harry wanted to bring up a topic that annoyed him. He had heard that James and Lily from another universe had another son who became the Chosen One, and that Harry was given to the Dursleys. He needed confirmation.

He cleared his throat and prepared to speak. "I heard that this ... How did he get? Conrad? No ... Connor! Yes, Connor, is the Boy Who Lived at yours." he said casually, but saw the other tense. "Honestly, I always found these titles funny. For me," Harry Potter, the boy his mother saved while he sniffed" It would be more fitting."

A reluctant snort sounded to his right.

"And overall, I was wondering if he was as annoying as they say."

" Yes, he is."

Harry chuckled at the reply.

"And there is also the matter of his parents. "The boy couldn't bring himself to call them parents the Slytherin next to him." They say they are mean. If that's the case, then I need your permission to hurt them pretty badly. Very much."

Hammer stiffened but said nothing. So he continued.

"And as the only member of the family in question, and the future heir, I must obtain such permission from you. "He muttered softly before grabbing his arm." Did they hurt you directly or indirectly? "He asked seriously, dropping his light tone.

For a moment nothing happened, even the buzz seemed to subside and the fire in the fireplace stopped. A feeling of tension filled the air. Green eyes, green eyes did not leave ...

Before he finally nodded.

The elder's eyes sparkled in ways that promised bloody revenge.

Okay, maybe I did Harry some OOC, but really in my imagination after the Deathly Hallows, he had no resistance to taking revenge or whatever. Note that Harry was very protective of his family and children who, like him, grew up in a difficult environment. I think this case could have been considered both.
