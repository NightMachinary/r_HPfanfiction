"You abandoned your own son?!" Lily questioned furiously. "We died for him!"

The other Lily shrugged. "Why would I want that stupid squib? He's worthless compared to John."

Dumbledore's eyes widened as he saw Lily beating up her doppelg√§nger. "No, Lily, stop it! Get off her! /Relashio/!"

OoOoO

Dumbledore stroked his beard thoughtfully as he eyed his clone. "So you corrupted a boy named Tom Riddle so you would look like a hero and blocked 99.9% of Harry's core?"

The manipulative Dumbledore nodded quickly. "Yes, it was all very fun! I wish I could tell you all of my exploits! Love potioning him, hiding his lordships from him, and even stealing most of his money!"

Dumbledore sighed. "At least I feel much better about myself now."

OoOoO

"You should have died for them like I would!" Sirius shouted as he kept on punching his other self. "You-you coward!"

The evil Sirius was confused. "Weren't you just laughing about how you planned to kill a classmate?! Even I didn't do that in school!"

OoOoO

Severus sneered as he looked at his smiling clone. "What are you smiling for, you idiot?!"

"Why shouldn't I! Everything is going well for me really!" the clone beamed at Severus. "Beautiful wife, healthy kids, and a perfect job teaching bright young minds!"

Snape fainted.

OoOoO

Ron's clone eyed the Weasleys suspiciously. "Is this an ambush?! Are you Order members?! Because I know you guys went to the Death Eater gathering already! This won't fool me!"

Fred snickered. "So, Ron, when were you going to tell us you were a Death Eater!"

Ron glared at him. "Hey, in that universe, you guys are Death Eaters too, if we believe what he says!"

OoOoO

Harry frowned as he saw his alternate self. "Why are you naked on all fours and begging to be knotted?"

His alternate self ignored him, his eyes landing on Sirius. "Alpha! Knot me! Put your thick, juicy-"

Hermione turned green. "Stop talking!"
