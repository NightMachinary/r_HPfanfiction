It's basically the concept of a hierarchy in second gender. The levels are Alpha, the one that's supposed to be in charge. Beta, the one that isn't in charge but isn't a pushover. And Omega. In some fiction the omega is the lowest of the low socially, often being raped for breeding purposes. In other fictions the omega is a highly prized and rare partner that can bare children even if the couple is the same gender.
