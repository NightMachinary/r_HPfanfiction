For anyone who was in the middle of reading a long fic like I was, I was able to find a .mobi of the story to read in an app from here:

[[http://p0ody-files.com/ff_to_ebook/]]

Click the link that says archive and search for what you were reading. (if you get a plain page with a file upload box and nothing else, change your mobile browser to desktop mode. Took me a minute to figure that one out)

(I skimmed the sidebar to make sure, so I hope this is allowed)
