Dang the site that Harry Potter & The Soulmate Bond is from is pretty sexy... I'm totally digging the colors and the looks. Just needed to share that.

I'm planning to try out the story itself.. it actually looks like a promising romantic story with drama (I think) even though it uses soulbond.. but I never had a problem with soul bonds existing in a magical world.
