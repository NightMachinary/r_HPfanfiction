This is, at least nominally, supposed to be a place for discussions, and discussions don't always involve everyone agreeing with one another.

It's not harrassment to disagree with someone. I stated my opinion on the matter, which happened to be different than yours. If I'd started calling you names or started using swear words just because I knew you didn't like them, then you could have made a case for this being harassment -- but I wasn't.

I stated my opinion, I stated WHY I thought as I did, and -- I will admit it -- I expressed some amazement at your extremely condescending tone. If you think this is harassment, then you have a very different definition of the word than I do.

Responding with passive-aggressive insults REALLY isn't very constructive.
