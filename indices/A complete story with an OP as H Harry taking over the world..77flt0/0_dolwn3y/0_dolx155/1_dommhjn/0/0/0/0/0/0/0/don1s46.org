Since I was still here answering anothering question i'll answer yours, because that is a valid question. To your question the answer is no. I'm not asking for you to agree with me or not, i'm just asking that you respect that others have different viewpoints than you, and that if you can't accept that to not bother, because all that will accomplish is nothing. If you can't change someones mind, and you know this(which I should hope you do now) all you are doing at this point is harrasment. So please just accept that other people have different viewpoints, and do something that will affect you positively instead, because when it comes down to it we are two random people on the internet.
