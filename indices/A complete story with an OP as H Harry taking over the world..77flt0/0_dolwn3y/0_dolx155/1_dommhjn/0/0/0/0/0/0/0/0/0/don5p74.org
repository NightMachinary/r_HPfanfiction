Sorry had to reply to this. Yes this is a place for discussions, and you are supposed to discuss on the topic at hand. You are doing neither of these. You are berating my viewpoints, and being somewhat condescending about it. Yes you stated your opinion multiple times, and I have heard, and explained my reasoning, and you still continue to argue with me, and the point. If you have nothing constructive to say about the original post, and if you are just going to continue arguing, all you are doing is proving my point. The only reason I could have a condescending tone is that all you are doing is arguing. Literally that's it. Do you know me. No. Do I know you. No. So please if you have nothing constructive to say about the OP, don't say anything at all.

Also i've been pretty polite, all things considered. Just because you think it's silly doesn't mean I do. It's a point of view. It's how I was raised. You calling it "silly" is quite rude considering these were values my parents bought me up with. So yes I could call this harrasment since this is the act of systematic and/or continued unwanted and annoying actions of one party or a group. Continuing on would be classed, by leagal meaning, as harrasment.

Warryn.
