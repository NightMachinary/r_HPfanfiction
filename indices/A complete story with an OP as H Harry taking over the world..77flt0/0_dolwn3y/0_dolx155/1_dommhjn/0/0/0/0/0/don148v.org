Yes. Why is that a suprise. If you don't like it, don't read it. Am I forcing you to read or reply. No. Am I having some philsophical debate or even just a debate. No. You seem to be under the mosconception that I care about this. Well i'm sorry, but I don't apart from the whole trying to get through to you that I don't care, and that you're arguing over something so pointless as a swear word. I mean really, all i'm doing is a business course which doesn't leave much room for a life, but I still have time to answer usless comment's, and questions. After this i'm no longer answering you, because to be honest I still have some work I have to get through, and what you're doing is really indicative of how bored you must be so find your entertainment elsewhere, because for the last time. If you don't like it, don't read it. Not that difficult, nor should it be to difficult to do.
