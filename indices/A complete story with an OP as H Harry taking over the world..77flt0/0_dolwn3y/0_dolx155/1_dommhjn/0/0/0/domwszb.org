That's your opinion. The point of censoring it is that only the people who know it will understand it. If they don't know it they at least won't get it from me. You'll understand this better if you had children like me. For example around them I don't say f*** I say fudge. If you don't like it that's your choice, but i'm going to keep doing it. If you don't like it then the answer is quite simple, stop reading or replying to my post. A random person over the internet isn't going to change how I was raised nor how I raise my kids, and I know that my kids aren't on here, but that's how I was raised as well so sorry, but if you don't like it than the back button is up in the upper left corner of this page.
