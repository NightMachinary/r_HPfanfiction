Let's see... if we go by the legal reason, "harassment," is defined as "any repeated or continuing un-consented contact that serves no useful purpose beyond creating alarm, annoyance, or emotional distress."

Which is not what I'm doing. What I'm doing is trying to tell you that I don't appreciate being condescended to or insulted. Because, I'm sorry, but you have NOT been polite, and since you seemed like a fairly reasonable and intelligent individual otherwise, it was my hope that perhaps you'd understand that you were being rude and condescending.

It started well enough. I made a suggestion, you said that you didn't like the suggestion and made the comparison to TV shows bleeping out swear words. I stated why I didn't like this idea -- maybe I didn't word it delicately enough, or maybe I implied that I thought less of you for it -- in which case I do apologise as this was never my intention.

But at the time I was purely expressing an opinion, trying to explain why I thought so, and opening for further discussion as I'm always interested in hearing what other people have to say even if I may not agree with them.

Yes, I got a little snappish when you responded in a condescending matter, and even more when you began pouring on with the "look-how-morally-superior-I-am-to-you." So I responded to let you know that I don't appreciate being talked to that way.

I'm sorry, but when someone goes all passive-aggressive on me and are two steps away from telling me to "get a life," then it's not in my nature to just shut up and take it like a good little girl. Do I know you? No, but that doesn't mean I have to take your insults. Nor does it mean that me telling you this constitutes harassment.

You post something online, people are going to disagree, because humans have different opinions on just about anything. Claiming harassment just because I disagree with you, that's stretching it.

Now, if you don't mind, that's all I had to say.
