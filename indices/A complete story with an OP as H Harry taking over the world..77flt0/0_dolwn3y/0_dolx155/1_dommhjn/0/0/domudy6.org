Yeah, and I think it's silly. Asterisking or bleeping out swear words is just calling attention to your bad language. My take on it is that if you're REALLY that concerned about the children (who aren't even supposed to be on reddit, but you know, whatever) then don't use the swear words at all. Trust me, the kids KNOW the swear words, so if you are afraid of them imitating you, then set a good example and avoid swearing altogether.

But if you're going to swear, then at least commit to it. Don't try to play both sides. Either use the cuss words, or don't.
