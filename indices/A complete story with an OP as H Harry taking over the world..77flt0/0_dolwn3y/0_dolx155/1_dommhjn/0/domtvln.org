Yes I could do that, but i'm not a child, and it get's the meaning across more effectively. It's like asking why t.v. Shows are censored, it's not because they don't use the language themselves, it's because they don't want children to learn such words, because of them. That's why I censor any swear words I use. If you understandit than you'll get it. If you don't than at least I won't be the reason you learn it.
