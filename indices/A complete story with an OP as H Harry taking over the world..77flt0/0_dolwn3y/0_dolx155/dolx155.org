I just don't like posting explicit language on a website, and on a sub on such a website that literal 10yo, and even younger kids use. If they know the word, bully for them, but if they don't than they at least won't learn it from me. I would also ask if you edit or delete your comment, because I don't want to be the reason a kid learns such a word.
