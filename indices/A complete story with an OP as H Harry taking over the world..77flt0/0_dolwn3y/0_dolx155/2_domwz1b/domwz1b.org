Hell isn't an explicit language. It's a "place regarded in various religions as a spiritual realm of evil and suffering, often traditionally depicted as a place of perpetual fire beneath the earth where the wicked are punished after death."

Yes, it can be used as a swear word, but only when used to emphasis or express anger or surprise. Which wasn't your case here.
