Mmm.

Well probably my favourite fanfic of all time has elements about it.

Deals with what it /truly/ means to be a dark wizard ect.

The problem is that it's abandoned.

Not only abandoned but has been deleted by the author.

Thankfully there are copies of it kicking around.

I could have sworn someone picked it up on another site but I could be mistaken.

Edit: Someone did pick it up, posted one new chapter then a year later deleted their account for no visible reason. Maybe the fic is cursed /shrug/.
