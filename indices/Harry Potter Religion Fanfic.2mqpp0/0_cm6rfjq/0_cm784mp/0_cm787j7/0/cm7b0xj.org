I noticed because I wrote them a review asking if they'd continue, because I found it a while after it was adopted and wondered why someone would adopt something and then only write one chapter. And the review vanished from my history, where I looked after I couldn't find it anymore. But I couldn't even remember enough details to post a "looking for" here (or rather, I couldn't be sure what was part of this story and what belonged to others), so I'm really glad to have it safe now. Reading it for the third or fourth time now :D
