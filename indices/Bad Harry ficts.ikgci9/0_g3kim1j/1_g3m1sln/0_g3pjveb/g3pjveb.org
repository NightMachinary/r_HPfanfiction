I read a bit of the story, apparently Hermione's parents kept her in chained in the basement for 14 years and named her Kraug (naturally). She barely knows how to speak or eat (apparently they never fed her?) Then Harry and Sirius rescue her and they go to Hogwarts.

Not quite up to My Immortal levels of tomfoolery, but it comes pretty close.
