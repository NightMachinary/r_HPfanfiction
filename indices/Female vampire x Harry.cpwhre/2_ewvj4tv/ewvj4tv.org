Not quite what you're asking for, but I remember an old (really old) fanfic where a female vampire stumbles upon a 13 year-old Harry dying (I think that's what happened at least) so to save him she gives him her blood and mentors him in being a vampire.

I don't remember what is the story's name, it's been a long time ago since I've read it.
