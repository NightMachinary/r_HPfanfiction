I've read that too, though I never realized the chapters were quite that long. I've just come to accept that that's how that author writes all his stuff. Though his chapters actually make sense as discrete story units despite their size and the overall story is commensurately large. This other story op recc'd is something else though. Seeing as its marked complete I can only assume he split it into beginning-middle-end arcs rather than proper chapters.
