There is the fanfic "Harry Potter and the Vampire's Kiss" by The Santi where Harry is turned into a vampire and falls in love with the female vampire who turned him. I think it was taken down but I have a copy of it saved if anyone wants it.

/Summary:/ AU post OoTP. Harry's summer after Sirius' death is horrible. None of his friends write to check up on him and his life begins to seem empty and meaningless. Harry wishes for death and a young Vampire grants him it. NOT SLASH. Over 80k words.
