It takes a lot to make some truly irredeemable IMO. Voldemort's point of no return is the creation of his first horcrux.

Plenty of Death Eaters clearly retain their wits -- for example, Lucius, but not Bellatrix. As long as they do, it's never truly impossible for them to be redeemed IMO if they receive the right sort of attention. Whether it's deserved or not is another matter.

Irredeemable implies that they deserve /eternal/ punishment because of their actions. /Almost nobody/ deserves this.

EDIT: To clarify, I was giving Lucius as an example of a Death Eater that never went insane. That doesn't mean I consider him redeemed after all canon events add up. It makes him /redeemable/, not redeemed. Just saying.
