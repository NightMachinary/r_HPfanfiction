Joking aside, I agree with the utilitarian point of view. There is no definable point (like flipping a switch) at which a human being becomes 'irredeemable'. Given the right resources and circumstances anyone can be programmed (rehabilitated?) to be a beneficial member of society. Thus, purely punitive justice is senseless. Of course the problem is that society usually lacks the resources and near-omniscient understanding of causality needed to rehabilitate the worst offenders.
