Because each horcrux is a murder. Each time a wizard murders in cold blood or whatever, their souls is fractures or damaged. It might heal, I'm not sure. But when this happens, to create the horcrux you then put one of those fractures into an object to create the horcrux. So after that first horcrux most would consider it irredeemable. Also add in the fact even one wasn't enough to the point he made so many he went totally insane and filled with paranoia. The fact he messes with his soul isn't really the problem, it's the fact that to actually do that to your soul requires you to murder is why any mutilation of the soul is frowned upon.
