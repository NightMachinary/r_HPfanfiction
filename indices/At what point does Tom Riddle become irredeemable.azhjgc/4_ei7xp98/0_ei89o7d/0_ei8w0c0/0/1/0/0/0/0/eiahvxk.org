  You've essentially severed any possibility of feeling compassion, guilt, remorse, empathy, etc, and turned, without a doubt, into a psychopath (whether you was before the creation or not).

I'm not quite sure that's true; certainly Voldemort by Book 7 had flushed out whatever capacity for empathy he ever possessed, which is why Harry giving him some back from his mother's Love Protection is important and stuff. But I feel like this would be a gradual process with every Horcrux, and the maker of only /one/ Horcrux would be colder than before, but still not completely unfeeling. Mirroring the physical corruption, which is also gradual (at one Horcrux the difference is hard to tell to the naked eye, by seven you're a noseless snakeman with red eyes.

Also, as I said in my response to OP, "define redeemable". A psychopath (in the 'clinical' sense of someone who fundamentally doesn't feel love, empathy or compassion) can still be a decent person; just because they don't get warm fuzzies from helping people, doesn't mean they'll necessarily get a kick out of murder and conquest. A Psychopath-Voldemort could theoretically be /Clockwork Orange/d out of liking murder, and fall back to magical scholarship or snake-breeding or something as his go-to hobby, never again harming anyone.
