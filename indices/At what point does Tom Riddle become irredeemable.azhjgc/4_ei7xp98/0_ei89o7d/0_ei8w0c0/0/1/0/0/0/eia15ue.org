Because once you've created a Horcrux, you're no longer fully human. You've essentially severed any possibility of feeling compassion, guilt, remorse, empathy, etc, and turned, without a doubt, into a psychopath (whether you was before the creation or not).

Murderers in general aren't /irredeemable/, because with the correct set of actions, some of them can turn into better people (especially in cases where there was a somewhat "sensible" motive, such as revenge or whatever -- would you consider a Sirius who successfully killed Peter irredeemable?). Do they deserve the benefit of being able to do that? Very debatable (usually not). That doesn't make it theoretically impossible to redeem them.
