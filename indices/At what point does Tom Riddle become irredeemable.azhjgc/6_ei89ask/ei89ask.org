In terms of "points where, for want of a nail, TMR probably wouldn't have gone [evil] Dark Lord"

1) [Probably] having had even one real friend in the orphanage. However, if they were harmed by either muggles or wizards, especially if he lost them because they weren't magical, he would probably just be just as extreme, but with the opposite position (e.g. aiming for genociding purebloods or even all magicals).

2) Dumbledore's initial interactions with him.

3) Slughorn not being so dumb/oblivious/lazy/not-so-considering-of-the-consequences (depending on how one reads his character)

4) Horcruxes, if only because the Horcrux-induced insanity kind if locks one into a very specific path.

In terms of "committed an act so evil that he could not redeem himself from it, no matter what" - I don't think he ever did, actually. I believe that to be irredeemable, one must have caused so much death and suffering that even if all of one's victims miraculously came back to life, one would still be universally reviled forever (the worst perpetrators of genocide come to mind).

Thus, while he did cause and perform various crimes against humanity, they live in a universe that canon evidence suggests has an afterlife - so murder, while bad, isn't /that/ bad, because it's an inconvenience, not erasing a being from existence. Thus, we are already really in the extreme case where he only caused pain and anguish, but not being-erasure, and even then, he wasn't very good at it.
