I won't say Tom Riddle is redeemable per say, rather, he can be turned to a different path.

Tom Riddle loves to be acknowledged, praised, feared, to be in the centre of attention. His name, his reputation is just as important to him as anything.

He hates to be forgotten.

How to use this?

It's really rather simple. Instead of Dumbledore visiting Tom at the orphanage, let it be Slughorn instead.

It would be all the catalyst needed. For one, Tom would not fear death, thus removing the need for horcruxes. Another, his skills and powers would be treated with reverence and adoration. He will always be in the centre of attention.

That's enough to at least steer him away from becoming Wizarding Hitler.

To stop him from being a bad person though, that's another case entirely.
