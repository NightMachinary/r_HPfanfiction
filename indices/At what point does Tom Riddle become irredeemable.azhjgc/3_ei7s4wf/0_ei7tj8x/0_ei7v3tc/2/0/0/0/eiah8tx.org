It's one thing that murder is /worse/ than rape, mutilation & theft. I agree with you there. Where I disagree is the idea that it makes the murderer necessarily beyond redemption. Personally, I don't think the possibility redemption has much to do with the actual nature of the crimes committed beforehand; it's much more about the intentions & feelings behind the crime and whether the person grows past these. Grindelwald committed quite a lot of murders, but his intentions were a misguided attempt at doing good, so I think he's far from beyond redemption; there are no doubt many unrepentant rapists much less likely to ever turn their lives around than Grindelwald.

Also, all this is my moral stance in the real world. In the /Harry Potter/ universe though, I feel like the fact that death isn't actually oblivion but just a forced one-way trip to Heaven makes murder much, much less horrible than it is in real life, and we shouldn't forget that. It's still a pretty nasty thing to do to someone (life is great and you're wasting the person's one chance at experiencing it before they go off on their Next Great Adventure with no chance at a replay). But it's not the same as "erase you from existence".
