Here's an article/interview with a psychopathic scientist who himself studies psychopaths, but grew up to be functional and nonviolent.

He says that it was because he was raised in a loving environment and kept busy with sports; his parents told him that if he ever had time to himself, he'd start getting dark.

Hogwarts, I think, was precisely the /wrong/ environment for Tom. Nevermind the orphanage, the fact that Hogwarts encourages competition and antagonism between students due to the house system and doesn't appear to give many other outlets for aggression besides Quidditch means that Tom had pent up energy and "valid targets" that he could lash out at without much fear of reprisal. With no constructive outlets - and no encouragement to make his own - Tom took the absolute worst path he could have gone down.

Dumbledore didn't help either. Not when they first met, and not when he rejected Tom's attempts to become the DADA teacher. One made him an enemy in Tom's eyes, and the other told the highly aggressive/competitive boy that he'd "lost" to someone else.
