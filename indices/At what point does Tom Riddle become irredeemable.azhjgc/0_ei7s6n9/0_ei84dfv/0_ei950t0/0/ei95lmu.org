I was merely pointing out the first and last interactions Tom had with Hogwarts as a student/prospective teacher. I also didn't bring up the orphanage, or the fact that he lived in London /during WWII./ The kid /literally/ survived the London Blitz /only/ because he was starting his 3rd year of Hogwarts at the time and wasn't actually in the city. Hogwarts was just giving him the means without an outlet; it was the orphanage and the bombing of London that pushed him from "potentially productive member of society" to the mass murderer we know today.
