"Redeemable" is a very relative term. My understanding is that Tom Riddle was by nature psychopathic; no amounts of nurturing parenting, at any point in his life, could have gotten him to be a caring Hufflepuff. But of course, not every clinical psychopath becomes a mass-murderer.

The most realistic point at which his course could have been reset is of course his first encounter with Dumbledore. Had Dumbledore been less antagonistic to Riddle, and instead seemed more like a friend, it may have begun to disspell this idea of Riddle's that utterly crushing everyone who seems like they might at some point threaten you is the road to happiness.

Stick an unfeeling monster in a situation where they get a chocolate if they help an orphan kitten, but not if they kick the orphan kitten, and it won't matter that they don't get warm fuzzies from helping orphans, 'cause they want the chocolate. Repeat this enough at an early enough age and Voldemort could conceivably have gotten into the "habit" of being a decent person, to a point where even if he had no visceral repulsion for it, murder and evil wouldn't have been things he was interested in.
