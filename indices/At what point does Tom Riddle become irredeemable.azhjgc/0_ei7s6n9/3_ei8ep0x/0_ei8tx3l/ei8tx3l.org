*No, there is such things as both psychopathy and clinical psychopathy. While Clementine Productions or yourself may have an opinion that it doesn't, his videos do nothing to disprove decades of research, evidence and peer reviewed journals that such phenomena exists. While Scientology may use opinions to support their "science", it is not accepted as a form of evidence to further or disprove the existence of a phenomena within the wider scientific community.*

He provides nothing but opinion pieces, with no history in the field, with no clearly cited articles, journals or books. He merely displays a screenshot of a definition from god knows where and forms an opinion about it to use towards his argument. I mean he doesn't even really target the existence of psychopathy, his videos are about how media negatively changes the perception of mental illnesses. For future reference, psychopathy is a disorder, not an illness and isn't really in the scope of his videos. The words disorder and illness are not interchangeable.

Psychopathy as per [[https://www-sciencedirect-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/science/referenceworks/9780080970875][International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences (Second Edition)]] is defined as "[[https://www-sciencedirect-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/topics/social-sciences/psychopathy][Psychopathy]] is a [[https://www-sciencedirect-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/topics/social-sciences/developmental-disorder][developmental disorder]] associated with increased risk of instrumental and reactive aggression and with chronic and violent [[https://www-sciencedirect-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/topics/social-sciences/maladjustment][antisocial behavior]] in both youth and adults. Individuals with psychopathy show specific impairments in stimulus-reinforcement learning, [[https://www-sciencedirect-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/topics/psychology/emotional-processing][emotional processing]], and moral decision making. These [[https://www-sciencedirect-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/topics/social-sciences/deficit][deficits]] have been tied to dysfunctional [[https://www-sciencedirect-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/topics/psychology/amygdala][amygdala]] response and to problems appropriately representing reinforcement expectancies in ventromedial [[https://www-sciencedirect-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/topics/psychology/prefrontal-cortex][prefrontal cortex]]. While [[https://www-sciencedirect-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/topics/social-sciences/treatment][treatment]] recommendations are currently sparse, recent work has shown that previous assessments of treatment amenability in this population may have been overly pessimistic."

And if you look up clinical psychopathy, you get pages full of peer reviewed articles such as this one [[https://doi-org.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/10.1016/j.paid.2010.08.024]] examining the effect of rewards and punishment upon inhibition control.

As per my background, I'm 3 years into a Bachelors of Psychology (Honours) degree, already completed a voluntary placement into NSW Department of Health hospitals for experience and my grades are good enough to get accepted into a Masters of Clinical Neuropsychology for postgraduate studies.
