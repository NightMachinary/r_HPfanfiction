I work with teenages with conduct disorder, which is what it's called before you are 18.

Many people have it, and the difference between good and evil with it is the realization that actions have consequences.

They won't not hurt people because hurting people is wrong, but they will avoid hurting people because someone will hurt you back if you hurt someone (get punished)
