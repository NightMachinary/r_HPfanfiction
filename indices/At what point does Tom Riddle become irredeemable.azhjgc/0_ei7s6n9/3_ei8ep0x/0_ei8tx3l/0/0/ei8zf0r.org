Do you not think I'm also not tired of people spreading false information as some sort of fact?

*"I refuse to believe people are predestined to be evil."*The bad news is that developmental disorders exist. Psychopathy is one of them, just like more well known but milder ones like Autism (ASD) or ADHD/ADD. You can address the symptoms to improve their quality of life, but with current treatments the effects of disorder will always be there.

It's important to note that psychopathy is not just a state of mind like a conversion disorder, but there are often biological differences in the shape and size of areas in a psychopath's brain compared to a control. "By using the PCL-R (or the abbreviated PCL-SV) as a screening tool, it was possible to find that psychopaths have reduced gray matter in their frontal lobes ( Muller et al., 2008;Raine, Lencz, Birhle, LaCasse, & Colletti, 2000;Yang et al., 2010 ), increased striatal volume ( Glenn, Raine, Yaralian, & Yang, 2010 ), abnormal asymmetry in the hippocampus ( Laakso et al., 2001;Raine et al., 2004 ), a larger corpus callosum ( Raine et al., 2003 ), a lack of structural integrity in the uncinate fasciculus, ( Craig et al., 2009 ), abnormal activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) ( Kiehl et al., 2001 ), and deformations within the amygdala ( Yang, Raine, Colletti, & Toga, 2009 ). There are two points to note here; first, the PCL-R works extremely well as the differences in neurology reflect the results of the test (at least in an academic setting). Second, all of these neurological studies have added an immense amount of knowledge to what it means biologically to be a psychopath."

*"Can you explain the difference between a sociopath and psychopath then?"*\\
I'm not sure if there is a consistent distinction between the two, some use them interchangeably, some offer distinctions but these vary between authors. Both can be diagnosed with either PCL-R or ASPD (in DSM-5), both can also be developmental or acquired (through a traumatic brain injury).

An example of the later would be Jack Pemmet, "Psychopathy versus sociopathy: Why the distinction has become crucial" published in the journal /Aggression and Violent Behavior, 2013-09-01, Volume 18, Issue 5, Pages 458-461,/ offer the distinction that "Psychopathy, which is the condition Hare successfully captured with the PCL-R, means the individual will have no empathy or sense of morality among a number of other traits ( Hare, 1991 ). Sociopathy, on the other hand, is indicative of having a sense of morality and a well-developed conscience, but the sense of right and wrong is not that of the parent culture. As this difference is reflected in the brain, the distinction again shows its use."

I'm not sure if he is correct, sociopathy vs psychopathy get a lot of attention as psychopathy is quite rare compared to other developmental conditions.
