Victoria Potter: linkao3(13795605)

Slytherin Fem!Harry where she's a Metamorphmagus. She impersonates McGonagall and Hermione at different points to get out of trouble (being out after curfew, being in the Gryffindor common room).

First year is mostly focused on "normal" magic-school shenanigans, which is also the extent of the angst. Second-year has a different plot around the Chamber of Secrets.
