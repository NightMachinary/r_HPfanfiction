linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man)

I'm not sure if this fic needs an explanation, it's a typical wbwl but everyone(almost) is a bit nicer to harry. Also his Metamorph abilities are not really developed yet. So you might want to wait a year or so and then come back to this fic.
