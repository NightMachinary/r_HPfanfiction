Above all else there is one circumstance that makes me back out immediately. If the story is like 100k+ words and it is written like it's an original story in an original world. Meaning the author explains every single canon thing like we are just random people that don't know shit about hp universe. 100k word stories ends up being a 30 min boring one shot read since i just skip those parts. At least i used to, now i just close the tab.
