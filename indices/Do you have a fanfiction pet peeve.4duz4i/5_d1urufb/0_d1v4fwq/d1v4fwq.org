Oh my god, yes! I'm not sure whether this is exactly what you are talking about but blatant author/Bible tract is so annoying. Incessant shapperoning... "No sir, we will not have sex until we are married and of age" yuck. Purity nonsense and all that... Teenagers talking to and treating each other like an old married couple. Sudden mentions of visiting church and discussions on which kind of religion they follow. It all feels so alien to HP.
