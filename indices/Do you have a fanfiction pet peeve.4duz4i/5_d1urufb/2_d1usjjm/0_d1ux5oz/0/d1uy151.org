I've actually read only one H/G fic that I remember that actually has this going on for several chapters (linkffn Unexpected Events by Epeefencer). I haven't really read Northumbrian, so I wouldn't know.

  Ginny's more than other female characters, I guess because she has so many men in her life

I disagree. Going by canon, Hermione has been romantically involved with three guys (Viktor, Cormac and Ron), the same number as Ginny (Michael, Dean and Harry). Hermione is an only child, so you won't really see this in H/Hr fanfiction. To me, when this happens, it's just people seizing on a few canon moments of overprotectiveness and making all of the Weasley brothers the "protectors of morality". I don't think this trope is as common as you're making it sound like.

Most of the "overprotectiveness" I've seen is more plot-oriented as I said in my previous comment, by combining it with other tropes regarding Manipulative!Dumbledore.

By the way, I saw your interview yesterday, congrats :) I'm really hoping that your fic becomes the go-to DH story. It's definitely one of the best stories I've ever read, you really managed to capture the sombre atmosphere perfectly, as well as all the characters, especially Ginny :)
