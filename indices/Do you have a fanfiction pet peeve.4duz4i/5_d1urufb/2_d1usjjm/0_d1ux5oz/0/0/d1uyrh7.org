You might not have seen it much, but I've certainly seen it slipped in a lot. Not usually as a plot device, but as the author applying their own morality in the background, probably without thinking about it. It's probably because I do read so much Harry/Ginny stuff, it's a peeve that disproportionately bothers me. Also I meant men in her life in regards to the amount of brothers she has, not boyfriends!

Thank you so much, I'm so glad you liked it! I really miss writing it!
