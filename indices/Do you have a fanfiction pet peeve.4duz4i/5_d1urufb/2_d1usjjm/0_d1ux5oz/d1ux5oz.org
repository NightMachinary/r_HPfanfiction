Nah, I meant more about the Weasley boys being over protective/nasty to harry, conflict in harry and Ginny's relationship coming from her wearing skimpy clothes or having other men admire her, making a huge deal about virginity, that sort of thing. It just seems to be placed on Ginny's more than other female characters, I guess because she has so many men in her life, and otherwise great authors, like Northumbrian, fall into this trope of Ginny needing to be told off for being an attractive young woman.
