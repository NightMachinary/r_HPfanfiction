I haven't seen this that often. I think this is more to do with the typical trope of Dumbledore controlling Harry and hiring the Weasleys to help him, than about some evangelistic creed spouting about "Christian values". When Ginny sees through the bullshit, they're going to try and forbid her from seeing Harry ever again (or put memory charms on CoS memories, that sort of thing). Such as in Brennus's /Harry Potter and the Butterfly Effect/.
