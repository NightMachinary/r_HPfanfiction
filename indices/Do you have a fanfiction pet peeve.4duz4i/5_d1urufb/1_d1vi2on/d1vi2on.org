I tried to undermine this in one of my fics:

  "So Harry," Hermione interrupted, speaking loudly. "What were you doing all alone with Ginny?"

  Though about as subtle as a niffler in a Gringotts' vault, Hermione's attempt to steer the conversation was a huge success: both Tonks and Remus stopped mid-sentence and swiveled to face Harry, the glint of curiosity in their eyes.

  "Yes, Harry," said Fred, who had apparently been listening. "What exactly were you doing with our sister?"

  "Not besmirching her virtue, I hope," said George, coming to rest his hands on the back of Harry's chair. Harry's cheeks tinged pink and he glared daggers at Hermione, who at least had the grace to look vaguely apologetic.

  Tonks /cackled/. Apparently it ran in the Black family. "Getting a special birthday present, Harry?" she asked, grinning widely.

  "Now, now," said Remus, his own mirth barely hidden. "I'm sure they were just talking."

  "About what?" said Hermione, "the colour of Ginny's underwear?"

  "All right," said Harry, trying to calm them, "I think that's-"

  "Ginny!" cried Fred, just as she emerged from the stairs. He waved a doughy spoon in the air like a wand. "What've you been doing to poor Harry?"

  George laid a protective hand on Harry's shoulder. "Not been besmirching his virtue, have you?"

  Remus snorted; Harry had to resist the urge to obliviate everyone, instead sending Ginny a look that he hoped said "help me!"

  Ginny smirked. "Only a little," she said, sending Tonks off laughing again. "And he wasn't complaining much." Harry began to feel ganged up on.

  "Only a little?" said George, looking shocked. "Don't tell me you left him hanging?"

  "How many times have we told you?" added Fred, who was clearly enjoying himself. "Once you Wingardium-"

  "-you better leviosa," completed George.
