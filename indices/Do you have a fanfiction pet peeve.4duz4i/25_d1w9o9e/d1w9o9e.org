The act of an magical oath. There are /so many/ fics with this happening when a character needs to convince another character of his or her sincerity.

And authors don't even realize what a plothole of galactic dimensions this opens.

Sirius Black could walk into the Ministry "I did not betray the Potters to Voldemort and I'm not a Death Eater, so I swear by my magic, so mote it be.". Then he casts a Lumos and holy shit Harry has a godfather. Make the oath specific enough and you will never again need a trial. Magical Oaths are a cancer and any fic that uses them needs to be top-notch otherwise to not be deleted from my life 100%.

Also I just realized that this is probably more than a pet peeve. So my pet peeve is "so mote it be". I hate that line.
