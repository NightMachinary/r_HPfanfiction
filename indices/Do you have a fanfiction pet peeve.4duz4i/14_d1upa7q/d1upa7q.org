There are so many, I could turn this into a long rant, but I'll just restrict myself to the worst of them.

-Bashing, especially Dumbledore and Weasley bashing. If it is mentioned in the summary, I don't even bother with the story. Dumbledore bashers completely ignore how complex a character he is. Ever since his encounter with Grindelwald, he knows that he has to be wary of positions of power, but at the same time, his prodigious magical skill keeps putting him into a position where he is expected to save the wizarding world.

And the Weasleys, every one of them has their faults, but that's what makes them realistic people. They're just a kind family, who welcome Harry into their family, just like the Potters did with Sirius. They aren't evil master manipulators.

-Marriage Laws: Well, this is just stupid. Mostly used as a lazy plot device to justify contrived pairings, writers who use this device ignore that it would be large-scale governement-enforced rape. So writers should stay away from this unless it is their intention to literally turn the Ministry into the Khmer Rouge.

-Magical Cores: "Magical core" makes me think of wizards and witches having some sort of battery somewhere inside their body. That's not how magic works in canon. Magical power is a very complex thing, it's influenced by knowledge, practice, intuition, confidence and intention.
