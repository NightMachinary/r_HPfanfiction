We just don't have enough information to speculate efficiently. I'm not one who's annoyed by magical cores, as this scene in particular makes it seem not unlikely that there's a physical component of some kind to a character's magic. At least that's an interpretation that's not ruled out by canon, which makes it as valid as any other.

And from there, someone just invented the phrase "magical core" and apparently enough other people liked it enough to put it in their fics. I especially don't blame fics from before the series finished because Harry discovers new things about magic every year, so some people apparently thought he'd discover the source of it was magical cores? ¯_(ツ)_/¯
