Your muscle analogy is not invalid, as practice is definitely important when it comes to magical power, but I think it's a bit too simple.

Dumbledore insists that Voldemort's interpretation of magical power is flawed. Voldemort always seems to equate magical power with proficiency in the Dark Arts, so that's probably what the boat is looking for. And even though Harry had successfully cast Sectumsempra, his abilities in the Dark Arts are very limited, thus the boat failed to recognize Harry as a threat.

This is just my interpretation of this scene though, so feel free to interpret it differently.
