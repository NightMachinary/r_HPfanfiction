  They mostly take away from the complexity of magic rather than adding to it.

As I wrote in another response, "complexity" isn't inherently good. On the contrary, too complex can be a detriment.

Most secondary characters, for example, need to be simple - if you give them all huge, complex backstories, you detract from the story itself. So you make them simple. You make them recognizable. Arthur and Molly Weasley were fairly simple examples of standard parental characters for the most part. They weren't given "complex" stories, motives, goals, etc. They were only what the main story needed them to be, and readers filled in the rest from their own assumptions, experiences, expectations, etc.

A "complex" magic system might be enjoyable to think about, but it doesn't necessarily make a story better. It certainly won't rescue a story with poor writing, poor characters, etc.

A magical core /can be/ simpler than the canon system, but need not be. And whether it's simpler or not doesn't automatically determine whether the story is better or worse.

What matters is how well it drives the plot. What matters is how the characters use and react to it. Your complaint says more about the overall quality of inexperienced fanfic writers than about magical cores. You might as well complain about the use of magic generally as a plot device.
