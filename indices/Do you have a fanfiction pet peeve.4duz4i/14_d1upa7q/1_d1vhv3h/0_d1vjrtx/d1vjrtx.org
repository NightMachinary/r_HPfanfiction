Extending the canon universe is something very different from repeating it. I wouldn't consider myself a JKR fundamentalist, I can enjoy an AU when the author has some really good worldbuilding skill and doesn't just recycle lazy tropes.

My issue with magical cores is that fics that use them, at least those which I have read, at best treat magic like just another internal organ, at worst like a mechanical component. They mostly take away from the complexity of magic rather than adding to it.

In the end, whether you like or dislike a fic is always down to personal taste. Even the most cringeworthy stories will often have a few favs. So obviously any explanation why I dislike a certain trope can always only be personal opinion, as we're talking about fiction here.
