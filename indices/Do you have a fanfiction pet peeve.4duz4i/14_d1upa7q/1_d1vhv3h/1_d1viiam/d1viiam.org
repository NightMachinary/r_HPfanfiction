Being different from canon isn't the problem. Being /worse/ than canon is. The problem with magical cores is that they are simplistic, reducing all the beautiful complexity and variety of magical power down to a single quantifiable value. It's perfectly possible for a writer to make a great AU fic using some kind of idea of a magical core... if they made it complex, like a kind of magical biology equally complex to human physiology.

The magical world revolves around magical law like the Muggle world revolves around natural law. Imagine if instead of a brain you just had a "thinking core" - a single, simple object with only one component. The world is suddenly a lot less interesting. Instead of marvelling at the complexity and cleverness of nature, the human condition can now be summed up in a single sentence.
