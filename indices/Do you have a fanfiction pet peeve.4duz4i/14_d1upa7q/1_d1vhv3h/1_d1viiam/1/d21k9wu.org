Well, to be fair, one could make “magical cores” interesting if they really wanted. It's just that this requires not making them the primary magical organ of a wizard or witch, which is something that most people reaching for the “magical core” fanon without thinking about it are too lazy to do.

So yeah, I think the problem with “magical cores” doesn't come from the concept itself but rather from how it is executed. I mean, it's basically D&D's “mana pool”, if you think about it, and yet this system, as well as many other systems, has elements added to it to make it better (like spell reagents, for some stuff) so clearly it's possible to take the idea and build on it rather than just leave it as a boring ... thing.
