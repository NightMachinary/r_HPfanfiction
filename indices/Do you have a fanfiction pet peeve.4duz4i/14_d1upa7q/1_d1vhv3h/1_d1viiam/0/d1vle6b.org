  Being different from canon isn't the problem. Being worse than canon is.
#+end_quote

That isn't what was written, and I can only respond to what someone writes - not what someone completely different is thinking.

  The problem with magical cores is that they are simplistic
#+end_quote

No, they're not. They /can/ be, just like anything /can/ be. And you admit to such in the very next sentence:

#+begin_quote
  It's perfectly possible for a writer to make a great AU fic using some kind of idea of a magical core... if they made it complex...
#+end_quote

So, the problem with magical cores /isn't/ that they differ from canon. The problem with magical cores /isn't/ that they are inherently simplistic. The "problem" is that they /can be/ simplistic... just like /everything/ can be simplistic, which means that there's nothing special or unique about them. They're just one of dozens and dozens of things that can be done simplistically.

Which, you know, is probably to be expected in fanfic stories written by inexperienced, amature authors. And which makes singling them out rather suspect.

And even so, I'm still going to disagree with this being a problem.

Magic is a /plot device/. It's not the /point/ of the story, it's simply a vehicle for moving along the plot and getting the characters to do things. Simple plot devices are not inherently worse than complex ones; indeed, they can be better.

Was the movie /The Maltese Falcon/ made inferior because we don't know much about the falcon statuette? No. Quite the opposite - a lot of time spent on the falcon itself would have detracted from what made the movie great. The falcon was no more complex than it /needed/ to be in order to move the plot along and get reactions from the characters. What complexity it had came from the reactions of the characters - it was simple, but the audience imagined it to be more because of how characters reacted to it.

Same with any magical "system" in a story. It should be as "complex" or "simple" as it needs to be in order to move the story. Too simple and the story will flounder. Too complex and it will detract from the story, or create unnecessary problems.

So, even if a story uses a simplistic magical core system rather than a complex magical core system, that /still/ doesn't mean that it will be a worse story. It will only be worse if it's too simply for the plot. A complex magical system, with or without a magical core, won't improve a story with poor dialog, poor pacing, poor characterizations, etc.
