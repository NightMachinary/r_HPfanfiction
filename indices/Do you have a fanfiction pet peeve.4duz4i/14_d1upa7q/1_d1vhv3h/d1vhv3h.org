  That's not how magic works in canon.

So? If you're just going to repeat canon, why write? Being different from canon isn't a valid complaint. I think your complaint is more that it's a difference you don't personally enjoy. That's fine, obviously, since everyone is entitled to their own tastes. I just wish people wouldn't dress up personal tastes as some sort of objective critique.

Magical cores are a valid way of presenting magic. What matters is whether doing so works well as part of an interesting plot.

What we need are interesting plots and characters, not JKR fundamentalism.
