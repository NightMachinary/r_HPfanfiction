Americans not knowing about geogprahic distance, i remember reading something about the Delacours living in a suburb of paris, just 7 hours by car away and i just facepalmed.

Also, and this is a general pet peeve in all sorts of writing cause it just scream "No education" for me, writing voil√† as walla or V`walla or something similar.

For actual fanfic stuff, bar many of the things mentioned here the whole lord potter, or lord potter-black and so on really annoys me, it has gotten to the point where if harry enters Gringotts in the first 5 or 10 chapters of a fanfic, gets a private conversation with a goblin and then suddenly is the super wealthy lord xyz of houses whatever i just close it.

Bashing in general, and bashing of the weasleys in particular, i get if you dont like ron and want HHR to happen and i can tolerate some ron bashing, but the whole Molly is the super manipulative bitch and Dumbledore paid them to befriend harry so ginny could marry him to get his gold is just bad imo.

"glowing emerald eyes" - this phrase being used

Others have said it before, but the whole prank thing is just cringeworthy. AS is the whole Marauders thing in general - really not a fan of those.

What really annoys me is the amount of abusive relationships in non smut fics, especially anything with Tom riddle JR or voldemort, or even Draco. If he beats you, curses you and thinks you not worth anything - walk away and dont ever trust him. And if the only reason he spends time with you is "cause he loves you so much it hurts", then walk away even faster. Its just a horrible relationship waiting to happen.

Strong female characters becoming cowering cowards when stuff actually happens - i dont know why but especially female writers seem to think that a girl that actually shows some backbone and feistiness should never be written and the spineless pretty damsel in distress is so interesting.

Powers being introduced cause they are cool but then they are never used again, if harry becomes a animagus or gets a really cool magical animal as a familiar/companion - make it be relevant for the story, to often he gets something and then its almost never mentioned again, that is really annoying to read.

Authors who write pages upon pages of thanks and similar stuff at the start of each chapter, pm the reviers or something, and dont articifally increase the world count by thanking and aswering every review in the chapter itself.

I could go on forever.
