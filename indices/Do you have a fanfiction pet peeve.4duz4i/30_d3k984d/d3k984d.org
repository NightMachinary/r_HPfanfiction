So many. I've been reading Fanfiction for under a decade (something that's only become clear to me just now) and so I've gathered a general idea as well as dropped some of them after maturing a bit, and I'm an accidental user of some on a bad day of writing.

- Spelling characters names wrong: Delores, Zambini (that was bloody popular for a while), etc.

- Massive paragraphs with heavy exposition: When I discover there's no real point to reading a chunky paragraph, I skim and then see if it's worth sticking around reading the next chapter. I'm a uni student, so I want to read something that's more quick to the point after getting cross eyed at the paragraph per page scholarly articles I have to read.

- Certain words (seemingly tiny but huge for me)

- "MOM!": It's set in Britain with British children. No one calls their Mum "Mom". You can hear the O in that and it's specific to an accent that isn't British. It's a very tiny and considerably insignificant detail for many, but for me, it usually takes me out of the fic after being immersed for some time. (The only exception to this is the obvious. The character is American/any other accent that commonly uses that pronunciation.)

- "Ya": As in yeah? Why are you saying it like that? Can't imagine Hermione suddenly putting on a voice to go "Ya" or "Yah" like she's a different kind of European than we once believed or is a young girl who prefers it over the option of "Yeah."

- "Anyways": This is a recent one, but I've seen it cropping up more often and it's commonly used when Dumbledore/McGonagall/Voldemort/Amelia Bones/any adult is talking and trying to continue their recount of a tale (that probably doesn't need to be retold because we just watched the whole thing happen last chapter or read it in the source material). I don't picture Albus rolling his eyes and going "Anyways" although that would be hilariously OOC if it were canon.

- Couples who don't actually get along except for their undying love for one another. Otherwise they don't have much in common and don't really understand each other beyond "emotions".

- Flames. I think they're pretty much non-existent now to majority of fanfiction, but if someone sent a scathing review to a young writer with no actual constructive criticism just because "I wasted 5 minutes of my life reading this so now I'm going to make you feel like dirt" then you need to sort out your priorities. Don't like it and have nothing useful to say? GTFO and move on.

- Young kids getting it on: I've been particularly scarred by a fic mentioned on here, I don't remember what it's called but Hermione should not be doing those things at her age, to an eleven year old Harry. No.

- Students and Teachers/obvious Adults out of Hogwarts for some time getting it on: "Age is just a number" isn't always a great argument and I think as it is mostly illegal in the Muggle world depending on the age of consent, it would be in the Wizarding world too.

Those are the only few I could think of that stick with me. Ships are ships, I'll read if the story is too good to stop just because I don't commonly read a certain ship involved. I stick mostly with canon but I occasionally see what's going on in other ships when I'm particularly bored.
