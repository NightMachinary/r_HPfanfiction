I really, really dislike it--

When Fred and George--

Only speak--

In incomplete sentences--

Because they're always--

Finishing--

Each--

Other's--

Thoughts!

But seriously, I find this to be rather irritating to read, and I feel like the author is perhaps struggling to model how Fred and George would act. So they resort to choosing something that they view as uniquely Fred and George, and expand it so that the twins can speak no other way. If I remember correctly, Fred and George did this only a few times in canon, so it's not as if they're just following Rowling's lead.

Or maybe the goal is to be funny. And that's fine for a couple of scenes, but after a while it gets tiring.
