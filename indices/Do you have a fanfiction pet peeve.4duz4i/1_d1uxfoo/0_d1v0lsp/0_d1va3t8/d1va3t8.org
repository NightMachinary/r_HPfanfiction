"You're the cleverest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione.' - Remus

and since I was looking "Cleverest" is used twice more (brightest not at all)....

"Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school," - Remus

Hermione is better than Lily confirmed (fight, fight, fight). But then Remus also ignores Snape (understandably, but biased) and Barty Crouch Jr. (twelve OWLS). Also quite possibly Amelia Bones, Frank and Alice Longbottom, Marlene McKinnon, Andromeda Black/Tonks, and others.

So we all know she's clever, but after looking at it I think the often used quote should be replaced with the third quote from PoA

#+begin_quote
  "Hermione, the cleverest witch in Harry's year" - Harry's POV
#+end_quote

It just seems logical that (whether named or not) there should be other witches that are in with a shout. Just as she wasn't better than Snape (as a student or Lily?) at potions I am sure there were witches better at practical DADA or Transfiguration and so on.
