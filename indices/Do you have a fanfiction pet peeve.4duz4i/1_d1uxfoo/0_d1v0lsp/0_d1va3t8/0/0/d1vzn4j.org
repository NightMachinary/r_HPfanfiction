Lily was Head Girl, which traditionally in British boarding schools is given to a student who:

a) Has top academic results in all their subjects.

b) Is socially active and involved in extra-curricular activities.

So I've always imagined her as getting straight Os. But that isn't a huge stretch - there are plenty of students who get straight Os so it's not like it means you're the second coming of Dumbledore.

To be honest I think Hermione is a good comparison: achieves mastery of all magic they learn (i.e. gets an O in all subjects) but isn't noted as being particularly creative or inventive, so wouldn't make it into the pantheon of "great" wizards. All of the best wizards are singled out as having created magic of their own: Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape, the Marauders. In addition to academic prowess, creativity is highly correlated with magical ability.

If I were to tier magic, the first tiers would be something like this:

Tier One: BAMFS. Dumbledore, Voldemort.

Tier Two: Pioneers. Straight O students who also show creativity and inventiveness. Snape, James, Sirius.

Tier Three: Competent generalists. Straight O students. Hermione, Remus, Percy, Lily. Probably most Aurors.

Tier Four: Competent specialists. Os in their specialism, decent grades in the others. Harry, Draco, Arthur Weasley.
