I totally agree, it's supposed to be that Hermione's astoundingly clever /for her age/ or /compared to her peers./ Certainly not like, the smartest person ever - she had fewer OWLs than Barty Crouch Jr. did! (she had 11 IIRC). Remus (nor Hagrid, nor whoever else calls her smart) isn't comparing her to every witch or every wizard he's ever met: just her peers.

Side note on the Lily thing - Lily was supposed to be 'bright' and great at potions and charms, but I don't think she was ever at the level of genius of Snape (making his own spells) or James (transfiguration whiz, spearheads illegal Animagus transformations x3) or even Sirius (less canonical evidence, but was very adept at charms and probably did most of the map tbh). I usually equate Lily's intelligence to Harry's - good (but not astounding) student, bright (getting mostly E's in OWLs), particularly gifted in some area (probably Potions for Lily, DADA obvs for Harry), but not extremely talented in everything they do. But that's just my interpretation; others can feel free to make her into some Hermione level genius if they so desire (side eye at fanfics that make Lily into a Hermione/Petunia cross)
