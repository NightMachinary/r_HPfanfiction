It's been a while so I really can't remember. I see Brightest used so often that I thought that was the canonical phrase. I think it's interesting to note that Remus says "that he's ever met". Aside from teaching one year at Hogwarts and being a teen himself 20 years before, he hasn't exactly been around a lot of teenagers to compare. If someone like McGonagall or Flit wick said it, it would carry so much more weight because they've being teaching for decades.
