- Pranks in fanfiction. Especially when it's crack!humour or the pranks are blown way out of proportion. Often time, they're just dying something pink or forcing someone to embarrass themselves and they're just cringe-worthy.

- Female characters that are just pretty arm candy for their male love interest (usually Harry). Hermione or Daphne or whoever are /oh so clever and talented/ but they never actually /do/ anything clever or talented. You might as well replace them with a lamp... and in Hermione's case you can even keep the Brightest Lamp of Her Age line that people repeatedly use like it's a title...

- Which leads into when The Brightest Witch of Her Age is used like it's some sort of title, with capital letters and all. Remus was just saying she's smart and I always took it to mean that she's smarter than her peers at 13/14 (of /her/ age). It's definitely not a title that deserves to be capitalized or repeatedly mentioned in every single chapter.

- Rehasing the same story to every new character we meet. So Harry will sit down and tell Sirius and Remus about his first two years at Hogwarts in detail. We get their reactions. Then they sit down and tell Amelia Bones. We get her reactions. Then she make them tell the Minister or the Head Auror or someone. We get their reactions. It just wastes a lot of time with information we already know from reading the first two books.
