I'm currently in a Next Gen fic where they time travel to the Summer of 1995 inside 12 Grimmauld Place.

Other than the ages being incorrect between the Potter kids, the amount of unnecessary information ("And I like charms etc), and "highjinks" the one thing that's grating me is the nicknames.

For example: 'Uncle Siri.'

I have an automatic reflex whenever it comes up.
