Lilly.

Deloris.

Stupify.

Harry being a shortened form of anything.

Dumbledore durogatory nicknames.

Highly AU stories where the author contrives things to happen the same as in canon to avoid having to be original.

The list does go on. I tolerate most of these if the rest of the story is good, but I do immediately think less of the author for a few.

I really couldn't care less about simple grammatical errors, especially if the author is a non-native English speaker, but the least you could do is get the names of your characters right.
