  Highly AU stories where the author contrives things to happen the same as in canon to avoid having to be original.

So much this. I've been trying to read a story like this, and every time some plot point is brought up that happens in canon, the author QUOTES canon - literally uses the same dialogue and descriptions. Nevermind that this story is told from Hermione's perspective and Hermione isn't even in Gryffindor... I had to stop reading before I even got halfway through first year.
