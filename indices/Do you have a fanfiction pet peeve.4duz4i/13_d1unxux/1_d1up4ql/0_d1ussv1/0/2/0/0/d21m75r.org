I think the answer might very well be “no”; it's not a secret that many people who get into writing fan fiction of books with movie adaptation only watch those adaptation and don't actually read the books, as sad as it is. It's why we get stuff like “[whatever] Maxima” and Ron being useless and spells being spelled utterly wrong.

Thinking about it now, we need a story where a character misspells some spell and it results in weird stuff happening, like someone saying “Stupify” and getting buried under a two-meter high pile of confetti.

But yeah, I find those things annoying and distracting from the story too.
