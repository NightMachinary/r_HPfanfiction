- Gred and Forge every damn time. They must have said it once in seven books, get over it
- Puffs, Claws, Gryffs, Snakes and anything in between. They're houses in a 1000 year old British school not plastic franchises in a new football league
- Herms, Hermy and for the love of fucking christ stop saying Mione, it makes my skin crawl for some reason. Hermione is an amazing name, stop butchering it.
- "Familiar". I don't know if this is a common word for people or if it's another thing people have fixated on because JK said it twice in a decade, but just call her an owl.
- "Scion". I'm sure JK said this once too, but it sounds like you're describing a butcher's knife, not a blonde, poncey racist.
- And pretty much anything that got dropped once in canon being used every other chapter.
