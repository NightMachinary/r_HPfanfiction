Oh, I have a bunch:

- The overbearing/overprotective father cliche. It's not funny. It's boring and always the same. "What are your intentions toward my princess?" Not to mention it's a really dumb move to scare a suitor into compliance if you want to judge his character (is this an American thing? I don't know how it is in Britain...).

- Magical marriages and oaths that can be entered by accident or unintentionally. Magic is supposed to be intent-based. You can't swear an oath to something you can't/don't understand. If the wording is ambiguous the vow will either not work or follow your intent. Magic is not that dumb, don't turn it into a cheap plot device.

- Soul bonds that define a relationship instead of the other way around. It's fine to allow for some kind of magical component to relationships, but don't just Deus ex machina relationships into existence.

- Redundancy of all kinds pisses me off. Don't treat canon as a checklist that needs to be walked through (most prevalent with Horcrux hunt). Just skip it. Don't have characters solve puzzles in incredible detail when we already know the solution (*). I don't care how clever you think your writing is. Don't waste my time.

(*) I've recently been reading "The needs of the one" and there's almost a whole chapter where the other characters figure out that Hermione is involved in some kind of time travel. It's all completely pointless (we already know exactly what happened) and could be wrapped up in 1 paragraph.
