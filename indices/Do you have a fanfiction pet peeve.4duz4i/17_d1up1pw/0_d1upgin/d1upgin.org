Agree with most of your points. Snape is a hero, but he is not a good person. His work towards destroying Voldemort is admirable, but in his daily life, he is just awful.

Draco Malfoy is a spoilt child, a bully and a coward. However, I love how the final two books add depth to his character. He is a boy who was raised to believe all the pureblood propaganda bullshit, and when he joins the Death Eaters, he initially thinks it is an honour and a priviledge.

And then, he realizes that the reality of it is nothing like his imagination. And while he loves bullying and having power over others, he is not up to actually kill and torture others.

I like to think that his war experiences made him a better person. Still a pretty flawed one, but a better one. I imagine he will always retain some subconscious prejudice against muggles and muggle-borns, but he will grow more accepting of them.

"Noble and Most Ancient" is just a title the Blacks came up with, and it's just showing their arrogance. It's ridiculous when every pureblood family starts to refer to themselves in that way, because if it was common, the Malfoys would surely do that.
