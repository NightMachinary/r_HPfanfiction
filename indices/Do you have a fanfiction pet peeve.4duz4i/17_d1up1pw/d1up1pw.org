Bashing.\\
Overly convenient timing. Once is fine. But constantly is horrendous.\\
Good Snape/Draco. Especially where they are just misunderstood. I don't mind it conceptually, but usually its "shame on you for not understanding how tragic they are."\\
Shopping.\\
Ancient and Most Noble yadda-yadda, especially with old dueling by laws and marriage contracts etc. I do enjoy this to some degrees in Princess of the Blacks, but that has a lot of things I normally hate yet still like that fic.\\
No real threat to the protagonists. I don't mind Harry getting OP, just so long as Voldemort is there too.
