- Muggle wank. Both in terms of presenting Muggles as more powerful than wizards, and in terms of fetishising Muggle social institutions (e.g. HealthAndSafety!Harry).

- Bashing, and in particular poor Dumbledore characterisation. If you absolutely must make him a villain, he should be an extremely serious threat.

- Simple magic (including but not limited to magical cores, wish magic, and dictionary magic).

- Inconsistency in the protagonist's abilities or temperament to artificially create conflict (can't count the number of times I've seen a supposedly war-hardened Harry have an emotional breakdown at an inopportune moment).

- Taking rare magic and presenting it as common. E.g. having occlumency as a standard skill rather than an obscure discipline that most wizards have never even heard of.

- Shipping of any kind. Note: not the same thing as a pairing. Shipping is when you use your fanfic to put forward arguments for why a pairing is correct. E.g. all the H/Hr fics where they get together by listing all the arguments for why they should be a couple.

- Kids who act like adults. Writers need to learn to separate out intelligence and maturity.

- Adults humouring kids who act like adults instead of just laughing them off.

- Ranty or preachy Harry.

- Friendly Goblins.

- Any version of the international wizarding world where Voldemort and Dumbledore are trivialised.

- Fics that act like canon Harry was a complete idiot who knew nothing. He's been at magical school for years and gets pretty good grades. He must have a relatively good understanding of how magic works. We should not be seeing post-OotP fics where Harry is learning the basics of magic.

- Any kind of pre-Hogwarts friendship between Harry and characters who he will later meet at Hogwarts. Especially guilty: the coincidental pre-Hogwarts meeting with Hermione.

- Overblown abuse storylines. Two forms: firstly, exaggerating the Dursley's level of abuse; secondly, exaggerating its emotional impact on Harry's psyche.

- Any story which changes canon circumstances but doesn't change characters actions accordingly, which then purports to criticise that character's actions. For example, having Voldemort able to access Privet Drive after GoF (not canon) but not changing Dumbledore's view of the safety of Privet Drive, and then criticising Dumbledore on that basis.
