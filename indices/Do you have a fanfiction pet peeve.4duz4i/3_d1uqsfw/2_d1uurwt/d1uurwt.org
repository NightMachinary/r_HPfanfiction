So how are we supposed to deal with the abuse (non exaggerated Dursley abuse/neglect)?

JKR glosses over it. But his reaction to it is something that can be worth exploring.

So obviously we can abandon that plot but if we explore it how are we supposed write it versus canon? And sure authors have taken it too far but if you're gonna use it you have to do better than JKR did.
