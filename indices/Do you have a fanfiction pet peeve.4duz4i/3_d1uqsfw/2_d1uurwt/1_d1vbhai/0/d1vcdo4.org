Oh yeah. To be sure I don't think it's to the extremes that FF goes.

It just bothers me that people want to...or it at least feels like...pretend that it didn't happen at all (and lord knows JKR did basically pretend it didn't happen even though her writing implies a few things at the least).

I think his reaction is muted in canon and not explored better. But I agree with what you're saying.
