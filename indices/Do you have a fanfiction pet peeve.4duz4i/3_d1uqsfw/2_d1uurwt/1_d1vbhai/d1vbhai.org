  So how are we supposed to deal with the abuse (non exaggerated Dursley abuse/neglect)?
#+end_quote

Basically, it's neglect with any unpleasantness being reactionary (it wasn't right, but it was reactionary). The result of it is that Harry strives to be “normal” but at the same time he wants to be acknowledged; that is why he said the bit about having a dream about a flying motorcycle to Vernon in the first book, for example: at that time what he wanted was to get approval, and that was the effect their “abuse” (which admittedly was emotional abuse and is proven to be bad for kids, but is not even close to what many fan fiction authors try to make it out to be) had on him. Harry not really being into studying, for example, wasn't because they were beating him but rather because neither the teachers at school nor the Dursleys ever acknowledged any of his efforts so he simply ... stopped caring and thus stopped trying. On the other hand, Hagrid got his interest and became Harry's friend almost instantaneously because he came /for/ Harry, he talked to Harry /about/ Harry, because he got angry at the Dursleys /for Harry's sake/; because he acknowledged Harry.

Neglect and reactionary unpleasantness can result in many outcomes, but the one that seems to be most popular in fan fiction is very very unlikely.
