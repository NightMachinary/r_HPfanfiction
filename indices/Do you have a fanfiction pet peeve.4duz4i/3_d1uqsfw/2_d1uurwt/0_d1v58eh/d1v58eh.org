I think the problem with Harry's abuse in stories is the same as the problem with rape. It's rarely handled well, usually it comes out in one big dramatic reveal, everyone freaks out and then cuddles Harry and then it's never mentioned again.

Plus I always find Harry's very OOC in them. His way of dealing with the emotional neglect throughout the books is being flippant or snarky about the Dursleys. Most people seem to miss that and I think it's a really interesting and valid copping mechanism.

Stories that deal with Harry's abuse and keep Harry in character or show how it would have affected him can be well done, but it's a rare exception.
