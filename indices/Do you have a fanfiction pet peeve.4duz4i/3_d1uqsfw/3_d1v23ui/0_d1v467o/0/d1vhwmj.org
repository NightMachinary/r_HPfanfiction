Yeah, we're pretty much told wizards went into hiding out of convenience, not fear. Hiding gives them everything they want with no drawbacks. It's a no-brainer.

Thinking it's a loss is a distinctly Muggle mindset, because for Muggles it /would/ be a loss. Muggles need resources from the world around them to live and progress. But wizards are pretty much entirely self-sufficient. Physical resources like land mean very little to them.
