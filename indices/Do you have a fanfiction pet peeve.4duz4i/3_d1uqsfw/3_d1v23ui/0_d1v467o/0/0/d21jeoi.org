  But wizards are pretty much entirely self-sufficient. Physical resources like land mean very little to them.

Well, kind of. I think they probably still need /some/ land, it's just that with magic they can get good enough yields that they need much less of it than muggles do and so they can hide it without it being an issue, and with either house elves or spells for it or both or even something else entirely they probably don't even have to think about it but just leave it be and reap the benefits in the form of food.

I mean, well, it wouldn't surprise me if at least some wizards were actually stealing food and stuff from muggles, and overall I do agree with you, I just wanted to add my own take on the quoted bit.
