I don't like wank of any kind. Magicals wank, pureblood worshipping, treating muggle characters as complete idiots are even worse.

The Magicals went into hiding because they were afraid of the Muggles of 1692. Now that Muggles had 300 more years of rapid technology advances and huge population growth, the balance of power should have tipped even more toward Muggles. Even as we speak, the pace of Muggle power increase continues unabated, while the Wizarding World basically stagnates. What would happen the balance of power, let's say, in another 30 years?
