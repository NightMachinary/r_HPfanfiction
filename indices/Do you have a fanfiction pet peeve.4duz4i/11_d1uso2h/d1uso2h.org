I like reading H/G AUs from the "Three-Year Summer" ('00-'03, between GoF and OotP). And quite often they will have Ginny's full name as being "Virginia". Sure, they couldn't have know Ginny's full name, but it still irks me somewhat. Even after JKR confirmed that her name was "Ginevra" in 2004, you still had fics up till about the release of DH still doing this.
