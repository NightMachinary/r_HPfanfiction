This might be canon and I might very well just be stupid, but the first one that comes to mind is when we find out that animagus forms are already set and you just have to find them. I'm sorry, but the Marauder's forms seem far too convenient for what they wanted to do to be random. The same with Rita's.

My biggest pet peeve however, is when people write a story about female!Harry and her name is...Harry. Or Harriet, so they can have her be called Harry for short. Look, if you have a cis male Harry get turned into a female, that's fine. Heck, if it's a MtF Harry that's fine. But when she's born a cis female, put some creativity into it dammit! I don't care if you call her Daisy or Rose because of the Evans' flower themed name thing. I don't care if you call her Jamie, because fine, I can see James naming his daughter after himself. Just name her something other than Harry!
