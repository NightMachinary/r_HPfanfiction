Coming out of lurkerdom to ask if you know that Telanu is taking the Tea Series and all her other Snape/Harry fic off the internet? At this point, it's only archived on [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewuser.php?uid=148][Walking the Plank]] because she's already removed it from AO3. Fans of her HP work have until midnight tomorrow to download and save copies before she deletes it.
