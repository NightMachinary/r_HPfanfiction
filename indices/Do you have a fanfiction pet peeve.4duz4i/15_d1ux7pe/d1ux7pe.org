Snape being anything else than his intelligent, angry, snipity self.

 

Yes, he has emotions... yes, he has a sex drive... yes, he can be nice in his own special little way... but! He's a sharp witted asshole even he's being 'nice.' Yes, he's a tough character to write, but that's the pleasure in reading him.

 

I find him almost perfectly written in the "Tea Series." He sends very thoughtful intelligent gifts that are dangerous if used incorrectly. He's funny, wickedly intelligent, nasty, bickers even when in love, and cold when vulnerable.
