The only two I can really think of that are any good are linkffn(Dragons by Annonimous4862) which is Inheritance Cycle/Elder Scrolls and linkffn(Zero Summing by Poliamida) which is Familiar of Zero/Elder Scrolls. linkffn(Unrelenting Force: Haraldr of Winterhold by INQ8448) has some potential, though the fact that the author left whether Dumbledore is good or manipulative up to a poll worries me, and it has the whole "Dragonborn did everything in the game thing" going.
