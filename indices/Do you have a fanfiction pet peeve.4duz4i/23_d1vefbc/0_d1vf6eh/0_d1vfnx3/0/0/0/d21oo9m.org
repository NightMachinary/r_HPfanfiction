Hmm ... the one I remember most right now is “No Need for Halkeginian Logic” (linkffn(10093207)); as I said, it is crack and thus not meant to be taken seriously, but it has a lot of funny moments. And I'd found “Magic, as opposed to Magic” (linkffn(6822698)) which is ... well, not crack but close enough as it's still a humour fic, and not perfect either, but it's a good enough read. I hadn't read the ones you mentioned before, so that's maybe something to try.

That being said, when a writer makes a poll for the readers to decide what an already-established character's core personality will be, it is my personal opinion that likely there no longer is anything to salvage and it's time to move on.

Edit: Yeah, and I gave the one with the pool in question a try; Tom is OOC, the timeline is out of whack, what kind of name in all insanity even is “Jaime”, and I am out because the author had failed to keep me in.
