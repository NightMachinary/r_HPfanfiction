  Harry Potter was lost, but now is found. The Arch-Mage isn't happy. Harry isn't happy. And they're just the first two people who are going to find The Boy Who Lived's destiny one immense headache... Completed. It's my "Winnie the Pooh" to my A.A. Milne. (That's NOT a complementary comparison, by the way.)

  Whether heroic or villainous, the Dragonborn we all play is a guy who steals when he can get away with it, helps out daedric lords of domination just cause, robs the tombs of the honored dead, and then proceeds to play tag with children and help out his local temple of the goddess of love. This is the story of one such insane individual summoned by Louise Valliere. Crack fic.
