to be fair, 90% of all HP crossovers suck. for Various reasons. The most major in my opinion is how Harry Potter was written. JK only elaborated on how the world worked close to Harry. We have no idea if all of the Wizarding World does things as Britain does. While most other series they expand the WHOLE world. Example: Naruto. Naruto created a whole planet, multiple cultures, different religions, and then told a story about a boy (much the same age as harry) and his life.

I honestly think that this is one reason I dislike AQ. In my mind it is not Harry Potter fanfiction. its a seperate story, that molds its characters around Harry Potter. Its also why I dislike Cassandra Clare's work. It is a cheap rip-off the Dark Hunter Series.
