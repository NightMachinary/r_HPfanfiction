Hey, the prompt seems interesting but the writing needs a little polishing imo.

What I mean by that is for one the pacing. For example there is one sentence in there telling us why all the male blacks are unavailable. Instead of slinging it all together it would have been easier on the readers to form multiple sentences. The way it is now the fic feels very rushed and unpolished. The use of so many half sentencees strung together by comma makes me feel out of breath reading that and also makes it harder to understand what you actually want to tell us.

Also it would have been awesome if you could have discriped the setting a little bit better so we as readers can have a better picture of whats happening in our head. Like i dont mean discribing every little thing there is, but like what does the flat look like? What does the Baby look like. Where is the Baby? Just lying in there around on the ground in the flat? Then later: where does the Ritual take Place? Where is the mirror in Relation to the Baby? What kind of dagger is she using? Do you get what I mean? It would be awesome if you could put more effort into painting us an interesting picture around the plot.
