tysm for feedback, it is very rough atm and i need to flesh it out more and drfinitely work on making it more realistic ig? like i said in my post i don't have any fiction experience, the only things i've written for the past four years are research or analytical essays lol, so i'm going to try and find a style that is comprehensible and that i can maintain.
