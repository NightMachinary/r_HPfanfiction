I suspect the curse is more like leprosy (or Hansen's Disease if you prefer) rather than like gangrene. That is, you can cutoff a physical manifestation (or symptom) but the curse is on the body as a whole. If you cannot remove the curse (read: counter-curse, cure, etc.), it will continue to affect the afflicted.
