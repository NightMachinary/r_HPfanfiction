I suspect anyone who designs such a fiendish curse (that can't be dispelled through normal means, that can't be halted; only slowed, that will slowly wither away your body, that slowly /spreads/ while withering away your body) would have spelled it against such trivial means.

It would likely resurface somewhere else, like on the other arm, or a leg.

I dislike it when powerful magics with a lot of thought and power behind them are defeated through such obvious and trivial means, often muggle in nature. There was one crackfic, surprisingly enough, that had the curse jump physical objects, so it transferred through some tongs into the wielder's hand. That I liked.

Curses are almost alive, especially ones that act stationary. I suspect one can adapt to a very high degree to remain effective.
