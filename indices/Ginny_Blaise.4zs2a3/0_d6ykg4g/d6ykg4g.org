One of the best Ginny/Blaise I've ever read is in TURN by saras_girl. It's probably the best canon compliant Harry/Draco of all time (seriously, even if you're not big on slash its amazing). But Ginny/Blaise is the main featured side pairing. There's a one-shot of just them later in the series, but it's not as good without having read the main story. Linkao3(879852) linkao3(879881)
