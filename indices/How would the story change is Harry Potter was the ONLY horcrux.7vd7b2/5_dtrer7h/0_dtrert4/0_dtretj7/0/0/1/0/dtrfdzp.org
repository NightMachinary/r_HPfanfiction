I think he would have figured it out eventually. There were plenty of clues that hinted a deeper connection between Harry and Voldemort. Maybe Voldemort would have already risen, meaning he would have Harry sacrifice himself. I admit I overestimated Dumbledore's omnipotence, but I still think the series would have concluded earlier and definately without Dumbledore's death, if only from a logical standpoint. If you're thinking of this concept from a story-telling veiw then I think the plot would be different.
