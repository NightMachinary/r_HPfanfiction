  He was ready to sacrifice Harry when there were seven Horcruxes

No, he wasn't.

Dumbledore absolutely knew Harry would survive and had been plotting for several years to ensure that it would happen. He knew he had outplayed Voldemort at the end of Goblet of Fire when Harry told him that his blood had been used in the resurrection ritual.

  “He said my blood would make him stronger than if he'd used someone else's,” Harry told Dumbledore. “He said the protection my --- my mother left in me --- he'd have it too. And he was right --- he could touch me without hurting himself, he touched my face.”

  For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore's eyes.

All of Dumbledore's machinations paid off. He had one last step - Snape needed to ensure Harry found out at the last possible moment, when the Horcruxes were all destroyed, that Harry was the last one.

And he told Snape, /very specifically/ that Harry needed to be aware that /Voldemort MUST/ be the one to do it.

  “So the boy . . . the boy must die?” asked Snape quite calmly.

  “And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.”

  “We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to raise him, to let him try his strength,” said Dumbledore, his eyes still tight shut. [...] If I know him, he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death, it will truly mean the end of Voldemort.”

You can argue that Dumbledore's plan was convoluted. You can argue that his plan was unlikely to work. But his choice was between Harry's permanent death by non-convoluted means or the possibility that he could maneuver things in a way that ensured Harry's survival.

For all the trouble going on in the world around them - Voldemort's resurrection, Moody's incapacitation and torture, to Cedric Diggory's death - Dumbledore's mask slipping to show his triumph when Harry discusses his blood being used in the ritual will always cement his love for Harry, in my mind. Defeating Voldemort would always be difficult, but the /absolute hardest/ road that Dumbledore could take - a road requiring his own death to ensure Snape could tell Harry what he needed to know at the right time, when Voldemort kept his snake close-by - was the one that he sought out. The road that would, should everything come to fruition, would allow the boy who he viewed as a grandchild to survive the war.
