  Dumbledore absolutely knew Harry would survive and had been plotting for several years to ensure that it would happen.

How?! What would have happened if Voldemort send a cutting curse towards Harry's neck (or a Bombarda on his head or anything that would have been more in character) instead of letting Narcissa check on his pulse?! Would Harry's head magically reattached itself to Harry?

Oh, and I thought Harry won because Voldemort wasn't the true owner of the Elder Wand. How did Dumbledore plan for that?

IMHO there's very little evidence that Dumbledore expected Harry to survive. Unless Dumbledore is omniscient or omnipotente there's plenty of opportunities for Harry to die that Dumbledore couldn't have planned for (and actually made more likely by leaving Harry in the dark about is plans).
