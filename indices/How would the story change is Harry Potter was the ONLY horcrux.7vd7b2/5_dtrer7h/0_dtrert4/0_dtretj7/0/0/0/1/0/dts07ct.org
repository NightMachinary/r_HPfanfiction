You're right. I admit I phrased that incorrectly.

If you read further down, however, you'll see my real opinion.

  You can argue that Dumbledore's plan was convoluted. You can argue that his plan was unlikely to work. But his choice was between Harry's permanent death by non-convoluted means or the possibility that he could maneuver things in a way that ensured Harry's survival.

There were, of course, things that could go wrong. Dumbledore was doing his absolute best, though. It was either his plan, or Harry died. Dumbledore could have said "Fuck you, Harry", killed him, and hunted for the horcruxes himself. Instead, he set in plan a motion that would have the best chance for Harry to be able to survive. He loved him.

As for keeping Harry in the dark - he /had to/. One of the key ingredients to Harry's survival was invoking similar properties to Lily's sacrifice. Harry couldn't know about his chances of survival for things to work - that's why he so specifically phrased things to Severus.

As for the Elder Wand... That wasn't part of Dumbledore's plan at all. His plan went awry. He admits this, openly.

  “Why did you have to make it so difficult?”

  Dumbledore's smile was tremulous.

  “I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.”

  [...]

  “If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn't you?”

  “I admit that was my intention,” said Dumbledore, “but it did not work as I intended, did it?”

  “No,” said Harry. “That bit didn't work out.”

Far from being omnipotent, the last two books showcase Dumbledore's imperfections. He wasn't all-knowing and, given the reason for his poor health in Half-Blood Prince, had weaknesses and faults that led to his demise.

But he did his best. He cared about Harry. And, even once his carefully laid plans for the Elder Wand were destroyed by Draco, he still offered the child refuge from Voldemort, with his last moments.

It is ironic to me that the people who so ardently despise or think poorly of Dumbledore are the ones who so typically hold onto the belief that he was omniscient, that everything that went poorly must so obviously be his fault, as if he is a master puppeteer.

The truth is that Dumbledore was an extremely intelligent, but flawed man who cared very deeply about every person and being around him.
