I'd be interested in reading a story where Harry is the only Horcrux, and Dumbledore doesn't know about the blood protection, so he thinks Harry will actually die. Dumbledore only realizes this around Harry's 16-17 age range. So everyone loves Harry like in canon, including Dumbledore, but Dumbledore still needs him to die, which is an agonizing decision for him to make. Then all the Weasleys and Harry find out, and Harry accept it, but Ron, Ginny, Hermione, Remus etc don't. And the story becomes about this impossible decision and the characters coming to accept it/not accept it.
