I actually came up with another idea, once, that the Horcruxes didn't make Voldemort literally immortal, rather, they let him 'defy death', in the sense of resisting cosmic order & fate.

Meet a powerful opponent? His strength will grow to match them. Hit by a notoriously deadly curse? He'll oh-so-dramatically stand back up. Caught in an inescapable trap? He'll stay for all of 15 minutes before pulling a brand new power out of his rear end to break free.

In other words, Horcruxes make the Mary Sue.

And thusly the reason it becomes so important to find and destroy all of them is because Voldemort is narratively-unbeatable otherwise, with the sole exception of whatever Lily did to slow him down for 15 or so years.
