  Voldemort doesn't die if the horocrux is destroyed, that is made up for the movie. And the reason as to why? I guess so Harry doesn't kill Voldemort.

I know. But even in the books there are no questions asked about "what do we do after we destroyed the Horcruxes.". The whole thing is somehow treated as a means to an end. I would have never gone on that idiotic quest, because it seems much more prudent to get Voldemort into his wraith form, defeat all the Death Eaters and while remaining extra vigilant give yourself years to track down his Horcruxes - maybe even use some more resources than 3 school children and a hunch where to look.

"Oh noez... he can't be killed! You have to destroy his Horcruxes first!"

"So?! He can still be imprisoned, tortured for information or into insanity, temporarily killed, crippled, obliviated, experimented on or whatever dark and twisted thing I can come up with. I'm not going to turn my back on the guy aiming a gun at me in order to look for some stupid McGuffins without having a plan how to kill him first."

The whole logic in the story is backwards! It pretends that trying to kill/defeat Voldemort is pointless even though that's blatantly false. The last time that happened they got 10 years of peace and quiet. It *is* pointless to look for his Horcruxes if you can't defeat him yet though. "We should try to overthrow Voldemort's regime and for ways to defeat him and maybe if we're bored look for some Horcruxes along the way"

How the story actually could have gone: All was well. Except noone knew that Voldemort created another accidental horcrux in 1975 while murdering a bunch of younglings. Since everyone just accepted the Seven-Horcruxes theory just because teenage Voldemort talked about it once with a school Professor - without ever considering that he might have changed his mind - they all died horribly 5 years later, when Voldemort hit them with a surprise attack. There was no happily ever after for any of our heroes.
