This nails one of my problems about the whole horcrux plotdevice: It makes it seem as if the big problem about Voldemort is to kill him permanently. That's so lame. Voldemort should be difficult to defeat. He's the super-duper dark lord that everyone is afraid of. His defeat in 1981 was a total fluke and he even had a backup plan for that eventuality. Under normal circumstances noone is able to defeat him, whether he can be killed or not is completely inconsequential.

What I'm trying to say: Sacrificing Harry shouldn't resolve the biggest problem about Voldemort or guarantee his eventual defeat. The biggest problem about him should be his power and abilities, not some stupid McGuffin(s).
