Plot #2 sounds really interesting. Protecting Harry would actually create increasing amounts of collateral damage because Voldemort would have to gain more power just to get to him.

If the circumstances became public knowledge I could totally see the entire wizarding world attempt to sacrifice Harry to appease the +gods+ demon.
