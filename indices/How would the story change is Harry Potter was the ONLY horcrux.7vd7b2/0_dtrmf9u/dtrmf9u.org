Heh, Philosopher's Stone could end a lot differently; hell-bent on killing the Boy-Who-Lived, Quirrelmort realises too late that Harry is the only thing tethering the Dark Lord to life, so that when Harry's near-death at the Mirror of Erised becomes an actual-death, he unwittingly takes Voldemort with him.

Really, though, the canon explanation for why a bit of soul got stuck in Harry's scar in the first place was because Voldemort's soul was already massively fractured from making horcruxes in the first place. Without them, he wouldn't last long enough for the soul bit to enter Harry's head after his killing curse is reflected back on him.

In order for this to work, Voldemort's initial immortality would have to come from someplace else...hrmm...

Alright, I have a couple of plot ideas for you:

1 - Voldemort's initial 'immortality' was actually a messed up ritual to turn him into a demon; by sacrificing 13 innocent souls, the last of which was intended to be Harry Potter, he aimed to become a mighty and terrible demon or half-demon. When the killing curse backfired on him, the 92% complete ritual activated to save him from death, transforming Voldemort into a meagre possessing spirit. This is basically a possibility for how Voldemort survived without horcruxes, not that conductive to a story where Harry's the only one...

2 - Voldemort died that night...but his spectre has come back as a revenant, hell-bent on taking Harry Potter down. In this case, Harry's anchoring Voldemort to life, but only in the sense that destroying him is the sole purpose for which Voldemort continues to exist. You could get a good story out of Harry fleeing Voldemort's spectre, seeking to find a way to erase the 'horcrux curse' that allows Voldemort to track him.
