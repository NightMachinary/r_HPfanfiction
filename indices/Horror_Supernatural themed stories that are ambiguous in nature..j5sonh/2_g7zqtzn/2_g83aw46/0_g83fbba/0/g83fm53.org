It really is! I wasn't expecting the ending either it was fantastic. Thank you for all of the great recommendations! If you like stuff like this and haven't read these stories I want to recommend them to you.

1Quo Vadis? It is the greatest threat the world of magic has ever faced. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be bargained with. It cannot be hexed. It cannot be cursed. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be killed. And only Lord Voldemort stands in its way (oneshot that is very chilling) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5614134/1/Quo-Vadis]]

2) The Eyes » Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. (Very eerie and well written)

3) The Serpent and the Mirror » Dr. Dumbledore suspects that Harry's hallucinations about Hogwarts and the Dark Lord hold the clues to a terrible family secret. What are the Potters hiding? And what is Harry's relationship to the shadowy Voldemort? Now COMPLETE. (Not exactly horror but very mysterious and has a big twist in the end)

4) Leviathan Rising Set in Gof, what if Harry had found a way to overcome the second task? What if while searching through the library he came across an insignificant seeming little book that teaches him the magic he needs?
