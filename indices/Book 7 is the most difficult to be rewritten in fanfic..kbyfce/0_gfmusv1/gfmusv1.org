Horcruxes are the worst thing to happen to fanfiction in the entire series. Some authors feel like they have to include the canon ones, and almost inevitably write a boring predictable plot. Some authors try to mix them up a bit, which at best results in...pretty much the same thing as canon. The best stories tend to throw them out altogether, but that generally involves a lot more original world-building (if they never existed), or comes across as checking off a box (if they somehow mitigate them all at once).

Also, people tend to write endings in year seven, and endings are hard. But I still think Horcruxes are a major factor.
