Some of the events in book seven need the characters to hold onto the idiot ball, and some need them to be eerily prescient or very lucky. That doesn't help when reworking the plot.

I haven't written a single fixit yet where I managed to get the trio into the tent hunting horcruxes to rework that particular section of the plot, because there are always a thousand easier, more sensible things that any of the entire cast of characters could go and do, that take out Harry's 'years in the wilderness' at dozens of different points in the proceding story.
