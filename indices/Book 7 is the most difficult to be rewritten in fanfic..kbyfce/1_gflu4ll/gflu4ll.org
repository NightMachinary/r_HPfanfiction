In my opinion as someone who wrote fics NOT of HP, but reads HP fics more than other fandoms- I myself find that 7 (and the ending parts of book six) seem to be the hardest to find a good fic that isn't a full redo.

A majority of my favorite fics that seem to enter book 7, try and change where some of the objects are found, if they even keep the Horcrux plot in at all! One of the more commonly used changes I've seen is that the old orphanage does have a Horcrux when the Trio starts hunting. I've also seen a few where they keep the locations the same, but change how they are retrieved. (I've seen some where they don't Have to break into the bank, they have someone cast Impero and get Bella to do it herself, some where the Room just drops the Diadem in someone's lap, Ect.)

My opinion is just that- an opinion. But I myself feel like the whole ‘on the run while hunting' was done well enough by Rowling, that it all kinda feels the same when fics do it. Yes there was a LOT of filler in the tent in the book, but the hunt felt like it was done well enough to me.

Another big issue I've seen is when people try and figure out what to do with Umbridge and the whole MoM. Most fics just have Kreatcher kidnap her and move on, because not many writers seem to want to do the ministry scene.

TLDR I agree the whole of book 7 is hard to find good fics for, and it also has a lot of cliche fics- but it also has some of the most creative ‘away from cannon' fics I've seen.
