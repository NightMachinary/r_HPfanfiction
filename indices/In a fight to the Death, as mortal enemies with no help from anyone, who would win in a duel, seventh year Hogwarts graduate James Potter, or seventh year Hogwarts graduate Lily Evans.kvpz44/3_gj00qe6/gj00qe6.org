I'll vote for James.

James is described as a brilliant student by McGonagall, Lupin and pretty much everyone else. He, along with Sirius, were said to be very talented.

Lily on the other hand is also described as talented by Slughorn and others. Considering that she was the Head Girl, it isn't beyond the realm of possibility that she was also a straight O student (like other Head Girls in the story eg McGongall). Note that she possessed a degree of control over her magic before attending Hogwarts.

The only question is whether her academic performance stemmed from studiousness like Hermione's or brilliance like James'/Sirius'.
