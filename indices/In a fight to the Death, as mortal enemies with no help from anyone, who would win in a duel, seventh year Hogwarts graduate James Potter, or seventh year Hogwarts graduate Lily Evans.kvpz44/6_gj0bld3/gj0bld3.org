James without a doubt, due to his away from school studies, he appears to be far more capable with a wand and a brilliant student of both Transfiguration and charms.

He and Sirius were pretty equal and one of them was rumoured as a freakin 21 year old to be capable of being the right hand of Voldemort.

nothing in the series suggest tthat Lily compares to James with a wand, unless we go into fanon territory where she is a charms prodigy that was being mentored by Fitwick
