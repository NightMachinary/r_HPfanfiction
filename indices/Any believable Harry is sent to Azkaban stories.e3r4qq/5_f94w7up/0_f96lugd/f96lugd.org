Honestly, this story broke my suspension of belief by chapter 3. No healthy relationship should be built upon a lie. Harry here has been hiding his past and his real face from his family and that's pretty despicable.

Edit: I read till chapter 7 and the suspension of belief is still broken. The story is deliberately trying to put angst where unnecessary. Also characterization of Harry is just too out of the realm of reality.
