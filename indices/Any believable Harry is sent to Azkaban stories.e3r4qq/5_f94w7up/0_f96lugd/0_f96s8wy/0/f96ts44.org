On the contrary, detailed criticisms of a fic are useful because they provide alternate points of view. This is helpful to those who haven't read the fic and would like more information to determine whether it might appeal to them.

If you /actually/ believe that the criticism is invalid, then you can contribute to a constructive discussion on the topic by explaining /why/ you believe that specific points the other redditor made are incorrect. This would be more helpful to potential new readers of the fic.
