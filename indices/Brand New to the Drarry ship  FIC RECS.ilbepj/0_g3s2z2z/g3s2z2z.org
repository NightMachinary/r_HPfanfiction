I've been reading both ships for the first time this year, and I still find it kind of funny that so many of the top stories for Draco/Hermione are dark, angsty war AUs and so many of the top stories for Draco/Harry seem to be fluffy comedies. Thus far, I'd say my personal favorite has been [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852][Turn by Saras_Girl]] which isn't quite so dark but is certainly long. An adult Harry gets a glimpse of how his life might have been if things had gone a little differently, and everything spirals from there.
