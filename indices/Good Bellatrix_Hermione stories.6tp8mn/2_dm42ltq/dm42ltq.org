I ADORE some good Bellamione. I just finished a shorter one that isn't complete that literally had me laughing aloud, For Whom The Bell Tolls by MeltingSunlight.

Fractures by N.Blackman is a fun one but the sequel has been abandoned.

Concurrent Existences by Sephyxia is also good but it takes a very...strange turn towards the end.
