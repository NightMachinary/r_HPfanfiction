Those Gilded Chains We Were linkffn(7755315) is probably the best Hermione/Bellatrix story I'll ever read. It's slow but in a way that sets up the characters nicely. Hermione and Bellatrix don't immediately have a romantic connection or anything like that. In fact. they hate each other for the first 10 chapters or so and Bellatrix is /horrible/ to Hermione. She straight up fucks her up at times.

The author is sneakily good at dropping hints that you won't pick up the first time and Bellatrix's insanity is treated like a mental disease rather than her being insane just for the sake of it. Unfortunately, it hasn't been updated in a year.

Impossible linkffn(7200246) is the second best one I've read and, fortunately, it's completed. Unfortunately, the author kinda downgrades Bellatrix from an insane murderer to merely a sadist, using half-assed explanations for her most heinous acts. Besides that, it's another slow story that nicely builds up their romance.
