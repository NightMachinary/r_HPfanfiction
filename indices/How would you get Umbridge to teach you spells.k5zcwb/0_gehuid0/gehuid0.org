While that would have worked better than using Voldemort as an example, her response would have just been to let the aurors handle him.

A better argument would be "What if I want to be an auror?" But her response would probably be that learning theory is enough to be able to cast the spells when you need to, and auror training will teach you what you need to know anyway.

Personally, I'd try to appeal to her bigotry. 'If theory is all that's important, why don't we teach magic to muggles?" I'm sure it wouldn't work as an argument, but it would make her angry and at least be amusing.
