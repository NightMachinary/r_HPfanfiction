I don't think any argument could have convinced her. Because Umbridge never intended to teach them anything in the first place. She came to Hogwarts to dig dirt on both Harry and Dumbledore, in the intent to silence them (and if possible arrest them). Had she been confronted by good arguments (such as the fact that Sirius Black was still roaming free), she would have either lied through her teeth or used her authority to end the conversation. Harry would have still ended up not learning anything, and would probably still have gotten a detention (Umbridge was targeting him, and she is the kind of person who write "disagreement" as "disrespect").

That being said, it is a fact that Harry was just terrible during this scene, and acted exactly as Umbridge wanted him to. While Umbrige couldn't be convinced, he had his whole class as witnesses, and most of them were on the fence concerning his claims. It would have been hard to convince them that Voldemort was back without proof, but a good performance could have helped convincing them he was not crazy.\\
Using the previous DADA teacher as an argument is probably a bad idea. Most of what happened with them is "confidential" (most don't know about Quirrellmort, or Fraud Lockart), and it's something that can be used against Dumbledore anyways (a "proof" that he is terrible when hiring teachers). The fact that Sirius Black is still free, and have already managed to enter the school and escape before the arrival of the Aurors is probably the best argument. He is officially a menace, has a know interest for the school, and even the Ministry can't deny that he managed to escape the Aurors several time.
