"Do you expect to be attacked in this classroom?"

"Wouldn't be the first time ma'am. Every Defense Professor I've had so far has tried to kill me. The werewolf was the scariest though. Can you imagine ma'am, being forced to sit in the same room as a werewolf for nine months? And he's still out there somewhere. Dumbledore fired him, but he's still out there somewhere. Probably went back to Fenrir Greyback to tell him which of us students they should turn. I dont want to become a werewolf ma'am, won't you please teach us the spells we need to put down such dangerous beasts?"
