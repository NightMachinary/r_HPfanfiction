Bulldoze her with flattery. Don't give her a chance to come up with objections, just keep talking like:

"Oh, but of course only the best Purebloods know that practice makes perfect, right? Bloody Muggles stole that phrase from the Tarpentines down in Chiswick, such a Noble Family, ruined by Muggles. But we know better now, don't we - of course you agree, you're an upstanding Pureblood witch - and we really do need to use this gift of ours like good Purebloods, we're so much better than the Muggles like that with their insert racist bigotry here and their other discriminatory things too! They'd never understand how to get truly great at Magic! Even the Minister uses his power regularly, potent pureblood that he is," and so on and so forth until she starts nodding along.
