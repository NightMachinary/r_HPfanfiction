linkffn(A Long Journey Home) - Almost no action happens inside Hogwarts, all of the story is post-Hogwarts, and don't be put off by fem!Harry, that's not the center of the fic.

linkffn(A Black Comedy) - Almost no canon action, but you probably already know this one

linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes) - A great story but the same author as "A Black Comedy", with similar humor - but it's well-done Firefly/Harry Potter crossover. The crossover is so well executed that you sometimes ask yourself if the makers of Firefly secretly worked with JK Rowling.

linkffn(Shadow Walker) and linkffn(Shadow Walks) - The finished story comes first, and it's a truly unique concept that you really might like.

If you haven't read it, maybe linkffn(Barefoot) too, it has a unique concept as well.

None of these are particularly unknown fics, but I hope I could recommend something that you might enjoy and heaven't read before.
