A pure-blood family that would arrange the marriage of their children only for the children from both families to be squibs but produce a magical child. I think they would still view the child as being pure-blood. A family that would arrange the marriage of their children like this and on the off chance that something like this happened they would consider the two's squib status ailments. If anything if the marriage is still going through that suggests that the marriage is still profitable for each family despite them both being squibs. This is also assuming that the family is wealthy (with the arranged marriage aspect) they'd probably just keep the two out of the public eye to save face. It's been shown that squibs aren't always removed from magical society or forced to leave magical society (the existence of quick spell type products). It seems that some families just have children who choose to live in the muggle world out of convenience +^{(and probably as a way to not constantly be reminded that they don't have magic abilities})+ It's been shown time and time again that to families where blood status is important they can and often will ignore someone's half-blood status and have no problem lying about their own blood status. So i doubt that a family that's gone through this situation would even acknowledge that the parents are squibs BECAUSE they produced a magical child.
