I have a problem with the wikia, the line "Squibs are .....Muggle-born witches and wizards are descended from squibs..." is incorrect, they have a source listed and it's a J.K. Talk. in her talk she says

" *J.K. Rowling*: Muggle-borns will have a witch or wizard somewhere on their family tree, in some cases many, many generations back. The gene re-surfaces in some unexpected places."

She didn't say they had a squib somewhere in the tree she said a witch or wizard. I feel like if she meant they had a squib in the tree why wouldn't she have said that?

The real answer to the question depends on how you define magical folk. Do you say wizardkind? If that's the case then yes Squibs are wizards, therefore their bloodstatus is following the traditional way.
