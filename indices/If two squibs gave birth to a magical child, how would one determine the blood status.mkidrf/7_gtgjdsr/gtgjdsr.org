That's not something that we know for sure - blood purity in harry potter can be weird in fanfiction I find (like, am I expected to believe that a family like the Blacks that have been 'always pure' their whole line is going to find a person with muggle ancestry a few generations back equivalently pureblood? )

Additionally, I'm not sure how strong the rule is - I know some people hold with the "all grandparents and parents are magical" rule for purebloods, while I've also seen the "no known muggles in the ancestry" rule. Depending on how we view those, it could affect the status.

However, I think it comes down to this - what are the politics surrounding that child and those families? It'd be on a case by case basis if those families throw their weight around to make them considered pureblood (with good arguments for it, obviously) or if they kick them out into obscurity or something else. Some families would be more willing for one over the other, etc etc.
