A squib is still a pureblood. The word indicates an anomaly- a person who is supposed to be magical that is not. A muggle born is a person who should be a muggle who is not. A half blood is someone whose parents are a pureblood and a muggleborn. Either all muggles are descended from squibs or all wizards are descended from a muggleborn. Squib doesn't effect the blood status- just indicates a magical bloodline person with no magic. Pureblood families do have squibs, and yes they are embarrassed about them- Filch. That is why a child isn't sent their Hogwarts letter until they show some magical ability- remember Neville's grandma scarring him so he would because they feared he might be a squib. A squib wouldn't go to Hogwarts even if they were pureblood.
