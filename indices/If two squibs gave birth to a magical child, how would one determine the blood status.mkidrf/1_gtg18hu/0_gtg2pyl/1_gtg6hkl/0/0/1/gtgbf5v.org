Bigots are also famous for not being entirely consistent with their bigotry.

Hell Voldemort was a half blood, and yet they still followed him.

Hell the Nazi's had the concept of honorary aryan they applied to people who who they should consider less beings, but just handwaved it away as say nah your an honorary member of the superior race.

Biggots might accept help from people they consider Lesser. but there is also stories of Biggots not being entirely consistant with said biggotry due to personal attachments.

Its also worth noting, that the potters are also an old and respected Wizarding family.

so if a Potter was a halfblood and Joined the death eaters. it might just be ignored

whereas a halfblooded weasley might not get that same consideration.

you forget the idea of being pureblooded is also a political stance
