Thank you! I think in general the fandom wants magical blood to make sense as it's made so important in the books and has had a huge impact on the magical world. Bloodlines can be a legitimate factor in plenty of other fantasy works, too, so it wouldn't be all that odd if it did come with certain magical perks. I definitely fell for subconsciously thinking that way many times myself at any rate. But in HP it's a factor of discrimination, not something that has reason to it, as we're constantly reminded of with Hermione's and Lily's successes.
