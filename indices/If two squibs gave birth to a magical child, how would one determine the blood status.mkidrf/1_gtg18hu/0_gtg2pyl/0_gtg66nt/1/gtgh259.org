  In the book it's stated quite often that there aren't that many true pure-bloods left.

That's kind of the point, though. "True purebloods" are those that like to think themselves superior, like the Malfoys, Lestranges, and Blacks generally tend to do. But I think the books also said the Malfoy line wasn't entirely pure anymore. We see this with the Blacks and their family tapestry where they blast their squibs and those that marry muggles or muggleborns from their family tree. But that's still their blood that continues on in those lines.

There are also people like Umbridge who'll conceal their bloodline and pretend to be pureblooded. Or be connected to an "important" pureblood family. We don't know how much pureblood families bothered to research their prospective partners. For all we know, they do have half-blood or muggleborn ancestors somewhere up the line.

While blood purity is a baseless notion-- nothing more than something wizards and witches can feel superior about--pureblood culture does give them huge advantages. Being seen by the elite, to have influence and be rich, being a "true pureblood" is made to look very desirable. It is also not something you cannot simply /become/.

Most magicals would thus rather claim being pureblood than half-blood. Pureblood is where the power lies, after all. So instead of evening the playing field, they rather claim they're purebloods after 2 generations of magical ancestry. I think that also perfectly explains why some "true pureblood" got irked and wrote The Sacred 28, to remind everyone what a "true pureblood lineage" should be and no matter what they call themselves, they still wouldn't be able to claim that sort of prestige. It's a giant fuck-you from the "true purebloods" so they can still feel superior to those who claim being pureblooded only based on their parents and grandparents.

Though ofc they also didn't include several families that can be considered to be among the "true purebloods" too (like the Potters). Kinda makes you wonder what sort of beef they were having. Or perhaps the author only wrote of the pureblood families that 'they' were related to in the past century or two. Either way, it's besides the point.

Point is, "pureblood" is a social construct within the magical world; it is whatever value they agree to put in it. As there are doubtless more magicals that can claim magical relations to their grandparents and would want to do so, then that becomes the norm.

I also don't agree with JKR's explanation that squibs are wizard-born muggles. After all, we all know Hogwarts has loads of extensive anti Muggle charms on it, but Argus Filch is not at all affected. However, I doubt magical society would be all that considerate. I think most magical children born from squibs would try to claim being pureblooded or half-blooded. They wouldn't be as clueless to the magical world as muggleborns, so they should be able to get by that way. Squibs are a pretty taboo subject in the wizarding world, unless it's used as an insult. I think the lack of defining the blood status of the magical children of squibs is therefore not something purebloods want to consider a possibility. They generally do not want to think of squibs at all, after all, and calculating in that possibility, that perhaps squibs can have magical children goes against pureblood culture. It gives squibs more worth than purebloods want to attribute to them. So it's better to pretend they do not exist.

Edited to add: if I want such a child to claim having squib parents in my fics, I'd probably have them refer to themselves as "Squibleborns", at least for the ones that can't be bothered to care about their blood status.
