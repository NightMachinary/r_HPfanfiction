I think people's opinions probably vary within the HP universe. Like, the Malfoys might claim that you're only “truly” pure blood if you've /never/ interbred with a muggle (obviously they would have at some point, but they'd erase all records of it), whereas more centrist-conservatives might say that both sets of grandparents is enough to claim you're pure blood. Centrists would say as long as you're magical and raised in the magical world (aka, both parents magical or you're adopted) then you're pure blood, liberals would say that there's only magical and non-magical and that blood doesn't matter and leftist radicals would say that all those POVs assume that Muggles are inferior which is incorrect. That's my pet theory anyway haha.

I can't remember if it was fanon or canon that pure blood kids had to memorise their family tree lol, but it sounds like something they'd do to “prove their good breeding” or whatever bigots say. It would fit with the canon statement that there aren't many true pure bloods left.
