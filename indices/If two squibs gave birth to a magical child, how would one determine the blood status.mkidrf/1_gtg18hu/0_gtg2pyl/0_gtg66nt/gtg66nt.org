I agree with your proposal. The question when does a half-blood really turn into a pure-blood is somewhat lacking in the world of JK. I mean, the idea that you only need grandparents to be magical to be a pure-blood is somewhat of a lax set of criteria. That would mean that there would be quite a lot of pure-bloods in the world as we've seen that wizards usually marry amongst themselves. I'd sooner say that at least all great-grandparents should be magical for one to be considered a pure-blood. In the book it's stated quite often that there aren't that many true pure-bloods left.
