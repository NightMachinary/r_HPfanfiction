  I agree with your proposal. The question when does a half-blood really turn into a pure-blood is somewhat lacking in the world of JK.

People like to make some universal strict rules for that but society doesn't work like that. And in the end you are a pureblood if you can scam other purebloods into accepting you as one of their own. That is really the only criterium that works.

If none of your grandparent is muggle or muggleborn they you have a good chance of getting away with it.
