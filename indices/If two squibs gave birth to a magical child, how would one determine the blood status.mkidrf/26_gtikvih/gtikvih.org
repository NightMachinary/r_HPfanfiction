Assuming the squib children were not disavowed outright upon their magical status being determined, I am going to lean on the idea that the child born of two squibs would likely be considered "Muggle-born".

my reasoning is that, in my reading, I deduce that "blood status" is based as much on magical ability as lineage. If a child of "pure-blood" wizarding status is unable to perform magic, they are not really considered wixen and thus not "counted" and probably "encouraged" to depart for the Muggle world to live out their lives unless they develop a skill or talent wixen deem useful - or to perform necessary manual labour that wixen would consider beneath their dignity (ala Filch). Any child born of two parents from the Muggle world, squibs or not, would likely be considered "Muggle-born" given where they grew up.

that's my input for what it's worth
