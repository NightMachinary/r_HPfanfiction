It's possible a lot of the pureblood families erase squib's from public records but keep track of them privately in case of a threat to the continuation of the bloodline. And for those families who completely cut off squib's and don't track them at all, they probably believe so blindly in magic breeding true that it never occurs to them that their line could die out. Let alone that their inbreeding could be the cause of the death of their line.
