If you solely follow the pureblood definition word by word, they wouldn't be a pureblood since they don't have magical grandparents AND parents. And would likely end up considered a closer to a half blood than a muggleborn due to having magical grandparents, and most likely having knowledge of the wizarding world growing up.

But, I think realistically in a society like that, they would be treated by other purebloods as what would be the equivalent of a bastard child but still a pureblood. None of the respect given that most purebloods would get, but a possible back up heir to keep the family going if absolutely necessary. Because how long their bloodline goes back is so important to them that I think they would choose to recognize a squib's child than let the line die.
