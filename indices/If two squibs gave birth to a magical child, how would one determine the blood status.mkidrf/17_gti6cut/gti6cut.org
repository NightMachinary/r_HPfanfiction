What I find interesting about this post is how you say this “disturbs” you. It seems reasonable to me that you could have a pure-blood witch/wizard with squib parents, because the grandparents are likely magical.

More than that, the issue of “pure-blood” seems to be contingent on distance from Muggle blood, rather than just magic, given that the definition includes Muggle-borns as undesirable parentage.

So even if a child comes from pure-blood squibs, it's still “magical” blood, thus pure-blood.
