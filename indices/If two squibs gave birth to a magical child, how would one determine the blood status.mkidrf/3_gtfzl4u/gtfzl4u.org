Personally, I'd say half-blood because they have both magical and "Muggle" blood even if Squibs aren't technically Muggles. I made a whole ass post a while ago based on my version of bloods that took like five hours to make and apparently it's not accurate, but I might've called them half-bloods. Let me know if you're interested, lol. I went all in dept with charts and shit and how your parentage and grandparent-age determines your blood status.

Because I'm extra and a whore for attention I'm giving you the link anyway, let me know if you have any questions, lol: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/kjahyb/the_ultimate_guide_to_blood_statuses/]]
