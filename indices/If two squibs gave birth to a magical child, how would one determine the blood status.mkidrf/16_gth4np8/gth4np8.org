I think it would depend on which definition is being used to define pureblood. in the case that you use the theory that if all 4 grandparents are magical you are pureblood, then this child would be a pureblood. However, since both parents are squibs, there is an argument for the child being a muggleborn, as some people theorise that muggleborn are simply people that many years ago in their lineage had a squib ancestor who passed on the magical gene. In this which the theoretical child should be considered "muggleborn" eventhough this term is not fully the correct description for the situation described. A better term might be something along the lines of s first generation withx or wizard if this is the approach taken in distinguishing blood status.
