  According to the Harry Potter wikia: "Pure-blood individuals are people who have no Muggles or Muggle-borns as parents or grandparents." The "parents OR grandparents" line is what disturbs me. Because, if you follow the definition to the letter, if a child has wizarding grandparents, then he IS considered a pure-blood, even if his parents are NOT wizards themselves.

No Muggles as grandparents, no Muggles as parents. If either of those conditions are not met, then the child is not a pureblood.

Squibs are Muggles. You say that in the next paragraph, but then seem to ignore it. They're not wizards, they can't do magic, so they're Muggles. They're a special subset of Muggles, but they're Muggles all the same. Ergo, a child of two squibs is not pureblood, as they have Muggles as parents.

The thing about having married a Muggle isn't a definition, it's a description. The definition of Muggleborn is simply "a wizard born of two Muggles." But in either case, as the squibs are Muggle parents and they each married another Muggle, so Muggleborn is the only correct answer for this child

It would be an interesting idea for a fic, sure, but quibbling over blood status would not be the interesting part.
