  I must add, are not mutually exclusive /per se/, a child born to two "pure-blood squibs" would in a way be a muggle-born AND a pure-blood at the same time.

This is basically what half-bloods are. And that's what such a child's blood status would be. Half-blooded.

Purebloods are those with both parents and grandparents being purebloods. Muggleborns are those with no magic in their parents and grandparents. Half-bloods are everyone else.
