While I agree with you about the squibs being pureblood. Technically a grandchild of a halfblood, or a muggleborn could be a pureblood. Halfblood or muggleborn marries another wizard of any blood status. Their child is considered a half blood because of the muggle grandparents, but wizard parents. Their half blood child Marrys a pureblood (or half blood, or a squib). Doesn't matter as long as the new in-law isn't a muggleborn, or a halfblood w/ a muggle parent. Then their grandchild would technically be a pureblood because both their parents and grandparents would be wizards. (Even though they have relatives who are only half bloods/muggle borns). With this method every 3 gen a new pureblood family could theoretically get started. So it's not just what the parents are.

Harry could have married a pureblood, a half blood child of two muggle borns, a half blood child of half bloods, or any combination there in, and his child would be considered a pureblood.

It really makes the whole blood purity thing even dumber, when by their own logic every muggleborn is basically a new pureblood family waiting to happen.
