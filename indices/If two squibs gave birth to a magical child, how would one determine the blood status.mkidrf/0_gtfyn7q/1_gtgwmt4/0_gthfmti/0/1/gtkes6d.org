that explanation would work IF Lily was HALFBLOOD, but she's muggleborn, she doesn't have magical lineage meaning in blood terms, she's basically a muggle.

One example you could use is Teddy Lupin. Grandmother is pureblood, grandfather is muggle born. both parents are halfbloods and yet Teddy is considered Halfblood. A muggleborn grandparent does not allow for a pureblood child, but a muggleborn great-grandchild does.
