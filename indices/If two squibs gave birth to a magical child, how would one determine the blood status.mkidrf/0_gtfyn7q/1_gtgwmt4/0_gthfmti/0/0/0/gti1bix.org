Does she specify pureblood or just wizards? I have seen it say all parents and grandparents are wizards. Even if she bans muggleborns explicitly, like the line in the ops post, it only adds one more generation to the path to become a pureblood. So my whole original point about children/grandchildren of non purebloods could become pureblood still stands.
