Blood status isn't really a legal designation or anything, except during Voldemorts reign. The only people who care about blood status would likely call them a squib or a mudblood as an insult. If they grew up in the muggle world a lot of people may think of them a muggleborns. I think most people would just think of them as someone with two squib parents.

They would be able anomaly because of how uncommon they are.
