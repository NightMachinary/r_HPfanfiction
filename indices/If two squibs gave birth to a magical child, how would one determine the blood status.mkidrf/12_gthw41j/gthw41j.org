Since canon isn't clear on this, the real answer if you're trying to write a fic with this as a plot point, is to make a judgement call, and make it consistent with the rest of your fic.

You are the author. You get to make those decisions.

That said, if you really wish to have this as a major plot point, use all the arguments here as the basis for in story plot elements, and issues.
