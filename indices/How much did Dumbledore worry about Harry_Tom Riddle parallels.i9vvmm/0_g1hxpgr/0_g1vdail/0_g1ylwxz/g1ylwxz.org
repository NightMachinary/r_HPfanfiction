  Dumbledore just randomly assures Harry that despite having been hauled up to the headmaster's office he isn't suspected of anything.
#+end_quote

The assurance isn't random and not 'anything.' He doesn't think Harry attacked anyone, but he also suspects Harry isn't telling the whole truth, which is why he wanted to speak with him.

  in other ways as well
#+end_quote

No. There's nothing for Harry - or anyone else to pick up on - as that's not what Dumbledore said or even suggested. He watched Harry more closely than Harry could have imagined. As Dumbledore has portraits, professors, and the ability to make himself virtually invisible, it's not hard to believe.

Dumbledore has Harry watched and watches him because he's Harry Potter. Not for similarities between Harry and TMR.

  The disconnect between Dumbledore proclaiming how much he cares for Harry while allowing him to remain with the Dursleys for all those years
#+end_quote

Not a disconnect at all. Dumbledore tells us exactly why he operated the way he did:

#+begin_quote
  â€œMy answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but myself realized. Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but his supporters --- and many of them are almost as terrible as he --- were still at large, angry, desperate, and violent. And I had to make my decision too with regard to the years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort was gone forever? No. I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty, or fifty years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure too, knowing him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore isn't simple. He planned an endgame that relied on the behaviors' of damn near everyone involved. The similarities between Harry and TMR are small and more to do with their life circumstances. Not personality.
