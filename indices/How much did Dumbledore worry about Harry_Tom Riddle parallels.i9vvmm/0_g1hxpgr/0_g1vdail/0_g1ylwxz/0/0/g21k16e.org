  Why was he brought up there in the first place?

Because Dumbledore wanted to speak with him. I'd wager Snape, and Harry, were more privy to Dumbledore's thoughts and doings than McGonagall was. And Harry had omitted facts when Mrs. Norris was attacked.

Dumbledore knew enough after their chat before the Mirror of Erised to discern Harry and Tom Riddle had very little in common. I mean Harry needed reassurance at the CoS that he was nothing like Tom Riddle.
