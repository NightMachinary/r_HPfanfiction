  which is why he wanted to speak with him.

McGonagall brought Harry up to Dumbledore saying "it is out of my hands" before Harry had a chance to tell the whole truth, to utterly lie, or anything in between. I agree that Harry did omit key facts that should have been revealed to authority figures, but not until after he was already sitting in Dumbledore's office. Why was he brought up there in the first place? As a witness? Dumbledore and his deputy are clearly not on the same page then because Dumbledore has already decided what has happened (or not). As a suspect? More or less the same thing, /unless/ he /is/ a suspect /until/ Dumbledore uses undetected legilimancy on him.

  Not a disconnect at all. Dumbledore tells us exactly why he operated the way he did

Dumbledore gives us his justification, yes. The problem is that he could have done so many things to change the situation. Look how little it took to scare the Dursleys into giving Harry a bedroom as just one trivial example. But no, Dumbledore will condemn someone, but not actually teach them in any useful way. Oh, he might scare them some. He does that with the Dursleys when there is no choice (when Petunia is thinking about kicking Harry out for example). He does that with Riddle when they first meet. But honestly, the way he does it is more than likely counter productive.

I do agree that Harry and Riddle share nothing of their personality. But then Dumbledore doesn't /really/ know Harry's personality all that well except from second hand reports. It is precisely the content of those reports that I started this thread asking about. What kind of reports was Dumbledore getting, and how much did they influence him?

McGonagall seems to think Harry is James Junior almost as much as Snape does. Her first instinct in /the Philosopher's Stone/ is to assume Harry is playing a prank on Malfoy and that Harry thinks it is funny that Neville gets caught in the cross fire. She's so convinced of that that she doesn't care to hear any other explanation.

Sprout thinks so little of Harry that he notices that she's acting differently towards him in /the Goblet of Fire./ We have no real indication of Flitwick's impressions of Harry, and Hagrid is warm and fuzzy, but hardly a reliable judge of character.

Dumbledore is a deep thinker and meticulous planner. He certainly called the shots across the series with a skill that any chess master could envy. But how accurately did Aberforth describe Dumbledore when he said that Dumbledore (I'm paraphrasing) lived a life of secrets and lies, learned from their mother? Every comment Albus gives is calculated, even if it is also honest.
