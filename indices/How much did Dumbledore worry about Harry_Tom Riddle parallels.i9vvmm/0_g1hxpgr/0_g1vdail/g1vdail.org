Yeah, I remember this, but the conversation in chapter 12 between Dumbledore and Harry after Justin is attacked makes far more sense if Dumbledore is using Legilimancy on Harry. Otherwise McGonagall has brought Harry up to his office for essentially a non-starter of a conversation in which Dumbledore just randomly assures Harry that despite having been hauled up to the headmaster's office he /isn't/ suspected of anything.

Similarly in /Order of the Phoenix/ Dumbledore says "I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined." At this point Harry already knows Mrs. Figg was a spy for Dumbledore, he's admitting that he has watched /more and in other ways as well/ (even though Harry never picks up on this).

I don't know. I guess it really comes down to that conversation. The disconnect between Dumbledore proclaiming how much he cares for Harry while allowing him to remain with the Dursleys for all those years. Sure Harry shows remarkable resilience, but the treatment he experienced, no matter how strictly you try to keep to exactly what the book explicitly states, wasn't acceptable. At very least, even it was arguably legal back then, it wasn't something that someone who "cares deeply" (slight paraphrase) for Harry, who wants him to be /happy/ and /normal/ should have tolerated.

It seems much more realistic to me that Dumbledore is playing Harry here. And if he's playing Harry, he's probably manipulating Snape as well (in the quotes you give). So perhaps I'm off on a total wild tangent thinking that Dumbledore actually listens to much of anyone besides himself, but that still begs the original question. How much did Dumbledore really trust Harry, and how much did he worry that Harry would go wrong?
