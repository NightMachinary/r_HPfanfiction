Since Harry is a child of prophecy, it's likely that event are going to play out a certain way regardless of how Hermione changes things. Harry will be born to those that defied Voldemort three times, etc.

I think that Hermione memory charms the Dursleys and sends them to Majorca after ensuring that they live healthier, less abrasice lives. Then she assumed the identity of Petunia and adopts Harry as her own before raising him in a manner that will allow him to "safely" complete the prophecy before he goes off to Hogwarts.
