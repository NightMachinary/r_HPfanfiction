Yeah, but that's hard to write, just like stable time loops are hard to write. If you are going to throw out stable time loops, might as well throw out self-fulfilling prophecies.

And now that I think about it, was Trelawney's second prophecy self-fulfilling? Seems like Wormtail would have gone back to Voldemort no matter what.
