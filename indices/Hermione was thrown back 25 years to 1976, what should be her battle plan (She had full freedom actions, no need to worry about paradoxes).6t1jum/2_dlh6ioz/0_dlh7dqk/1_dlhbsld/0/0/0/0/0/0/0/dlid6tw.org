Is it? I'm not familiar with British law but I presume Sirius's inprisonment was due to something like Abraham Lincoln's suspension of writs of habeas corpus during the Civil War. Further, the minister/commander in chief personally ordering the arrest of an individual that was previously expelled (but not tried, presumably because he was a juvenile and deemed not a threat with no wand, or something) from the only magic school in the country for indirectly killing another student in similar circumstances (which sounds like probable enough cause to detain someone until you can get a grand jury to indict them or something) is a bit different than sending an anonymous tip to what amounts to a rising star in the police force.

Further, what good does revealing Voldemort's half-blood status do? His followers are radical terrorists that have been branded with his mark. They're not going to suddenly stop following him because it turns out he's a half-blood, they're just going to rationalize it.
