If you want an efficient plan for basically fixing everything, it would have three parts, I think.

1. Tell Dumbledore about Horcruxes and let him deal with Voldemort.

2. Expose Voldemort's half blood heritage and somehow neuter the power of purebloods. Anonymous tips to an up and coming Mad-Eye or Rufus might help take out some of the bigger supporters.

3. Get herself a position at Hogwarts to further eliminate the remaining prejudices as they crop up.
