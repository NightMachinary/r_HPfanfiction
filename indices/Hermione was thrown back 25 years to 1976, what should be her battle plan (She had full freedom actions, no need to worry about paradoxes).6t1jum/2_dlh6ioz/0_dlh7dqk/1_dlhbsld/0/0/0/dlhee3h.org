The prophecy made in Hermione's old time line was meaningless because Voldemort in this time didn't know it. If Snape hadn't reported it to Voldemort, then the last one would have been equally meaningless.

So should she wait until 1980 for Trelawney to make the same one as before? How could she be certain that the prophecy would remain the same? Her very presence in this new time line could very well cause a NEW prophecy to be made.

To be frank, I don't give a damn about the prophecy. I only want to know the most efficient plan to defeat Voldemort and his minions.
