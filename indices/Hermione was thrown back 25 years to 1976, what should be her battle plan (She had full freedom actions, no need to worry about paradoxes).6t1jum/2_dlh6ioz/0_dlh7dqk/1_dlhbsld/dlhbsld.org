You could argue that the prophecy is in effect because Hermione knows it exists. Assuming Hermione went back in time on purpose, she would do so to change what has happened and will be operating under the idea that the prophecy is/has been valid.

She knows it exists, so it does.

That's just my take on it. Could be done a million different ways.
