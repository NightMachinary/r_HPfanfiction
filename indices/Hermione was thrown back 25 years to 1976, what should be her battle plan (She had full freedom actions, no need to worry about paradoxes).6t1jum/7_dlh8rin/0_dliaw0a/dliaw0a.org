Interesting point.

On the other hand, consider it from Voldemort's point of view: he is now mortal again, but he can't make any more horcruxes. It's not clear whether or not he knows the fate that awaits him after death, but, in any case, his pathological fear of death will make him /very/ risk-averse. This means that defeating him personally might be something that won't even be necessary at that point; or, perhaps, a surrender could be negotiated.

That said, a plan that would save lives net-net, but is also very much a "Hard (Wo)Man making Hard Decisions while Hard" plan, might go something like this:

1. Change as little as possible until the Halloween of 1981.
2. Give Dumbledore the knowledge-dump, /but/ don't tell him that Harry is a horcrux.
3. Help him eliminate all other horcruxes.
4. Walk into 4 Privet drive and kill Harry. (Since Hermione didn't kill any of his relatives after offering to spare them, she can do it.)
