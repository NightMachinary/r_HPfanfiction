Stay out of it and let things proceed as canon seems to be the best way to guarantee an acceptable end result. Interference seems to be likely to disturb the unique set of circumstances that allowed Harry to defeat Voldemort. Without that method they would have to defeat Voldemort in a conventional magical duel, which it is not clear is possible.

Even if her future knowledge allowed the rapid destruction of Voldemort's horcruxes and organization, you still have to defeat the man himself. Something that Dumbledore cannot do.
