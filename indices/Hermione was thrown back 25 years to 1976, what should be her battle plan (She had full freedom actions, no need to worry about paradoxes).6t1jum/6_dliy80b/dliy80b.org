  However, it was ALWAYS a good idea to write an anonymous letter to Dumbledore about Horcruxes and their suspected locations

Not if you want to preserve the timeline though.

btw: I still think this is about pragmatism vs idealism though... I'd be way too idealistic and would want to try to save the Potters and as many people as possible. I didn't want to be to hard on fflai, but I don't think he understands idealism, since all of his arguments already were based upon pragmatism ("How can I realistically achieve the most favorable outcome, considering all eventualities?")
