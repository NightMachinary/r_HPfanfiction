tell dumbledore everything give him her memories in a vial, let him use Legilimency and Veritaserum and if nescesarry let him place her her under a unbreakable vow that she will do what ever is necessary to get rid of voldemort.

That is the most logical thing to do for hermione in a situation like that because he is much more powerful than her in every way that matters and she doesn't really have any reason to mistrust him. the only question is how much hermione knows? because I doubt harry told her everything about dumbledore and what effect seeing the resurection stone has on him( I assume that dumbldore could find out the location of the stone by himself) So its probable that dumbledore would die much earlier than in canon and may even become to weak to protect hogwarts on his own. So its possible that even if they manage to make voldemort mortal they wouldn't be able to to kill him once and for all. One way they could try would be to try having voldemort offer somebody(preferably hermioine or dumbledore) a chance to give up their lifes for somebody they love. Voldemort who doesent know about love protection would attack the other(s) anyway and die(or not)
