I think it depends on what age she was when she's thrown back in time. If she's a teenager, she can be the "rare Hogwarts transfer student." Otherwise, if she is older (post DH), then she has to make herself known and try to join the Order.

As a teen, she can influence students around her, causing some to not join the Death Eaters (Snape, Regulus, Peter, Barty). She could easily be recruited after Hogwarts like the Marauders.

If Hermione is older when sent back in time, then she should try to pass off as a Seer to the Order and guide them. This is dependent on how much Hermione knew about the First Wizarding War prior to her time travel. She should still target Horcruxes (with the help of Dumbledore).

Since there is no chance of paradox, there doesn't have to be canon pairings that we know of. I think Hermione would want to orchestrate the circumstances in which Harry would be born.

She would debate letting James and Lily survive, because she has the best chance of procuring Horcruxes while Voldemort is temporarily defeated and weak.
