Time travel is a major genre in the HP fandom, so it makes sense to discuss this topic here on [[/r/HPFanfiction]].

There are mainly three time travel mechanisms:

1. Time turner: travelers' freedom of actions is severely limited. Paradoxes are a major risk, so it's my least favorite form of time travels.

2. Memory: travelers send their memories and powers back to their younger self. The limitation is how far they can go back. Hermione to Marauder Era doesn't work with this mechanism.

3. Alternate dimensions: it offers travelers maximum freedom of actions. They can also retain their original physical bodies. However, the new dimension may differ in minor or major details, and that introduces new challenges for them. Their advance knowledge might not be useful or even counterproductive in cases.

Hermione in Marauder Era is done fairly often. Her advantages in this time are however limited. For examples, most horcrux locations are unknown at this time, and enemy compositions are also less clear to her. On the other hand, she could find new, competent allies in the Marauders, Longbottoms, and Boneses. She could also prevent Peter from defecting and Severus from joining Voldemort.
