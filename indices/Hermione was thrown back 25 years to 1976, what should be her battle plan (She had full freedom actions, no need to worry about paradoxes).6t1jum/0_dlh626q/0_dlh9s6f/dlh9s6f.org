1) working relies on history repeating itself exactly as Hermione remembers, which is pretty problematic when it comes to free will implications. Why would everyone make the exact same decisions as in the original timeline? What if a spell that missed originally hit its target this time and the Potters die before their time? If Hermione isn't required by Time and Magic to not create paradoxes, then the new timeline can diverge without her interference as well.
