Disregard my earlier idiotic comment...

There's a big decision involved in these time travel scenarios (and I think both paths have a lot of merit):

1. Try to change as little as possible, so that you can use your knowledge of the future at the most appropriate time (research how to trap a spirit for 15 years and catch Voldemort when he's at Hogwarts, keep him contained forever, the end)

2. Screw that and just go crazy (make Trelawney go away, offer a lucrative potions scholarship for Snape in the States, accidentally kill a rat and reimburse the Weasleys for their loss, destroy a few Horcruxes... see what other opportunities develop)

I'm really not sure which of these two is better... comes down to pragmatism vs idealism.
