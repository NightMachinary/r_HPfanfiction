I don't think it does come down to pragmatism vs. idealism. You have two kinds of knowledge:

- Knowledge about the state of things right now (1976)
- Knowledge about what might happen.

If you change the state, what might happen will obviously change. However, is the knowledge of the state of things in 1976 enough to win the war? If so: How?

If not, the only alternative is to completely avoid mutating the state in 1976 - this would only be possible by becoming a hermit - and then, at a more favorable point in time (November 1981), go ahead and mutate the history as quickly as possible, and using all your knowledge.

As soon as you start visibly altering the state, you can't really rely on your knowledge of anything about the future.

In 1976 I'd try to remove myself as far as possible from the situation, and hope that James and Lily die the same way, looking for hints that things develop differently than last time.

As soon as Voldemort dies I would try to work together with Albus Dumbledore to remove the Horcruxes and make sure that Voldemort stays vanquished. If I notice things going any different (someone I know to be alive in the future dies, ...) I would try to give a few selected individuals (Albus and Aberforth Dumbledore, Flitwick, Newt Scamader, ...) all the information I have.
