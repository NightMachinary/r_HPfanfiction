Ah, okay. That clears things up nicely. No worries - this is the internet, misunderstandings happen. :)

If you want a change like that made, I'd recommend messaging the mods directly. There should be a big blue button in the moderators section of the sidebar that'll let you ask them if that's possible.

If they say no or don't respond, you could always bookmark the page (if you're on a PC or phone browser). Or save this comment, since I've linked below. The other link is a similar thing that you might also find useful. :)
