Sure. :)

Ah, okay. Yeah, bookmarking is probably the easiest action, unfortunately. Could just make a 'this is my stuff, bugger off other people' folder, I guess. :D

That's understandable, but if you want a change made to the sub itself, the mods are the ones who have the power to make it happen. We users can't edit that sort of thing. It's worth a shot, especially since the creator of the Bot is Tusing, one of our mods. If anyone was going to agree to sharing it, it's them. :)
