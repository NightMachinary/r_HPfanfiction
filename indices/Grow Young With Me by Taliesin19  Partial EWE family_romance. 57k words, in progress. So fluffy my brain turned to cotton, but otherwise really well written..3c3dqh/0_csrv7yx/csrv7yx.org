Gah I'm absolute shit at writing titles on mobile, as half of it disappeared.

Anyway, it's 2009 and Harry is dealing with life: being Head Paper Pusher for the Auror Office (by choice), having three lovely little kids, and coping with the loss of his soul mate three years prior. How will things change when a young waitress pesters and pokes her way into his life?

It is really fluffy like I said but there is potential for plot beyond the trope filled widower-meets-girl but even if that turns out to be the entirety of the plot it is still very well written.
