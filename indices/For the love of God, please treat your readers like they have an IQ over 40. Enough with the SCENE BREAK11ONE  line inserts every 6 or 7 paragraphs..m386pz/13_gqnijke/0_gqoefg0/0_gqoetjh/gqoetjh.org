Well my favorite fics are those that I read like 15-16 years ago when the fanfiction phenomenon was just in its early phases and we had enough information of the direction in which the story was going but we hadn't had all the pieces together and also those coming immediately after DH when writers who wanted to be canon compliant were not as restricted by all the crap JK said outside of the books. Still I never saw that.
