The bit with the "POV" only works in First Person fics, written Light Novel style, which very rarely changes the POV anyway, so you'd have it maybe once at the start of a chapter to let you know that it's not Harry's First Person POV this chapter.

In 3rd person narrative, jumping around POVs becomes wonky.

As for Line breaks, a quick "Two Days Later" in bold on its own line is enough for a break, rather than some kind of obnoxious ######## taking up the whole line. If you're having multiple timeskips in a chapter because Harry is training like for the Tournament, then harmless three words for the Timeskips to let you know that time is jumping ahead repeatedly and prose explaining what happened during the timeskips is harmless.
