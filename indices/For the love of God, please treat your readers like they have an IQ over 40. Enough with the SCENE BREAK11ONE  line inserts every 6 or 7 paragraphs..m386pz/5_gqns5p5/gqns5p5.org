Frankly, I'd rather have the scene breaks. I've seen fanfics where they got removed by accident and I was confused for two paragraphs and had to go back and reread said paragraphs because the scene change wasn't obvious at all.

I don't care if they want to get fancy or 90s cool with the ASCII text between them.
