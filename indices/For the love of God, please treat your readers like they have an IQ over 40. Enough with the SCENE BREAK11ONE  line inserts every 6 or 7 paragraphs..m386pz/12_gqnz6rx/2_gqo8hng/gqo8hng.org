I was always partial to this for parseltongue:

--------------

Harry looked at the snake then said /§Yes yes, your scales are quite pretty, now stop chasing Hedwig before she eats you in annoyance.§/

--------------

I mean even without the /§§/ I know he's going to be speaking parseltongue in that context, but it also helps me keep in mind that the majority of characters around him won't understand what he's saying, or that he's still talking to the snake later on as the conversation carries on.

--------------

/§Stupid fuzzy headed rat keeper.§/ The snake hissed.\\
"What did he say?" Asked Ron.\\
/§Shush§/ "It doesn't exactly translate," replied Harry, blandly.

--------------

I mean, one professional author that I read denotes telepathic messages with double colons.
