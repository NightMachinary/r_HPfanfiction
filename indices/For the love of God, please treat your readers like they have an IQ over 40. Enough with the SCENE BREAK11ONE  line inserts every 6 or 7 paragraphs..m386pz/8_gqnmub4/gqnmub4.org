Kind of the same is when they rehash the main plot points of hp.

Why. We read the books/watched the movies. We know about hp. That's why we're reading this. Don't tell us he fought a Basilisk. We know.

This is generally ok if it's just a paragraph but in my experiences this is a sign about how the story is going to read.
