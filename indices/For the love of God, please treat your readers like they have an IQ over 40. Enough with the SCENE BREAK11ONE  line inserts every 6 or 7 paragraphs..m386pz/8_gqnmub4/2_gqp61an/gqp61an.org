Canon rehashes are bad, but I have an exceptional hatred of how most fics handle the Sirius Black situation in year 3. Like, every time, it boils down to the characters saying "what if Sirius black... is actually innocent!?" and then miraculously arriving at the right conclusion. Like, anyone who knows canon knows Sirius is innocent, so there's no point showing it unless it's a drastically AU story where someone else is guilty.

It bothers me so much that when it came time for that it one of my fics, I deliberately had the characters draw the wrong conclusion.
