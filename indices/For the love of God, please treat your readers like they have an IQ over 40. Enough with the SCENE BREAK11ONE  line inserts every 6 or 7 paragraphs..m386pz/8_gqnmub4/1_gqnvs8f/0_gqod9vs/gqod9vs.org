I went to read a fic yesterday with a good premise but like the first one was saying he looked death in the face as a baby and only a couple of months in to hogwarts when he fought the troll and then just... Skipped everything else saying and throughout hogwarts?

Why bother saying this when your not even going to mention the good stuff?
