I /hate/ canon rehashes.

I'm not saying you should never reuse canon scenes. There's plenty of reasons to do that. Sometimes authors get extremely specific about their canon divergence point, or they don't want to fuck with an important plot point like the prophecy.

Harry/OC fics are the /worst/ about it. I've read a couple that are literally just an extra person and some dialogue related to them being inserted into canon and they somehow make literally zero changes to any canon scenes. That shit is absurd and I hate it.
