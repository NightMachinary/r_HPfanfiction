What everyone else said was true, but also line breaks made in word do not transfer over as of March 2020.

Which means that if you don't want to do extra editing or you upload the actual doc instead of pasting in you have to use self-made line breaks.

That being said I just paste them in now and do it manually on ffn, but not everyone is willing to do that.
