I never said or assumed 50 million people are reading any single fic, including yours. I said "fanfiction". As in all fanfiction.

When you look at actual numbers, making things harder or more annoying for 1.5 million potential readers doesn't make sense, but if this formatting thing is that important to you then it is what it is. If the number of people using assistive reading programs was that insignificant, e-book platforms wouldn't bother and audio books wouldn't be financially feasible to produce, because voice actors and recording studios also cost money.
