Well... 3% is by definition a small minority.

You are assuming there are 50 million people reading my fic. With my most popular fic being 20k views and many of those being revisits (let's say... half which is hella low, honestly it's more likely to be 3/4ish ) you're looking at MOST 300 visits (again, likely from multiple viewers). Taking into account you ALSO have to consider that while some impared readers no doubt love fan fiction, just as many don't ever want to read it, accessibility aside.

And ULTIMATELY what it comes down to is that if someone wants to read my fic that badly, they'll just sit through the zeros. It doesn't magically make the fic unreadable by text to speech. You just have be more patient about it.

So no, I'm not going to change something I've been doing for 10+ years for a very niche subsets mild annoyance. It would take me weeks to go back an edit my old fics. If they don't want to sit through it, cool. Click off. They'll find a ton of fics that use line breaks. Just not mine.
