I mean to me this is splitting hairs. To me this is no more different that someone who can't read my story because there is smut in it. Some times your stuff won't resonate to people. That's fine. It is what it is. I don't write for views (at least not for ff).

  If the number of people using assistive reading programs was that insignificant, e-book platforms wouldn't bother and audio books wouldn't be financially feasible to produce, because voice actors and recording studios also cost money.

For a book I was selling, sure. I'd agree to my editor taking it out, that's a sound business decision. This is not a book. It is a fan fiction and I can assure you, noone is making anything for my crappy werewolf trash romance fic.
