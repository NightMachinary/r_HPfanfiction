Why do you assume it's a small minority? If 50 million people are reading fanfics, and 3% of people have a vision impairment (this is using the super low end estimate, I've seen estimates of up to 8% of the population) then you're still looking at 1.5 million readers who use assistive devices.

And that's only counting people who use screen readers for vision impairments, because they're also used by people with fluency challenges due to TBI or other issues.
