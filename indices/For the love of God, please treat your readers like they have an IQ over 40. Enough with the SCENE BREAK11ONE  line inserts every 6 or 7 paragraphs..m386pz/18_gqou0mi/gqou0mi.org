While this criticism may have some kind of point in there.... others have pointed out the issues with older fics. For the new ones, if it bothers you so much, are you a registered Beta anywhere? Fanfic is FREE after all.... there are not any editors. Authors need Beta readers to work with to improve their skills. If you'd like someone to improve your reading experience, it may be more useful to channel this criticism into ACTUALLY helping a writer? Who again.... writes their stories for FREE! Just an idea.

A.N: I /think/ I get that you aren't being too serious about this? Just trying to poke fun at something silly that mucks up your reading experience? However, I do not abide gate keeping tactics. Fanfic is a free community, that I have always believed should breed togetherness. Mocking writers for mistakes or creative choices does nothing, except discourage a writer from ever posting again.

Have you ever posted something super personal online for the millions of eyes to judge and critique, for free?

If yes, then you come off as a bully know it all author who thinks they are better than everyone else.

If no, you just come off as a choosing beggar.
