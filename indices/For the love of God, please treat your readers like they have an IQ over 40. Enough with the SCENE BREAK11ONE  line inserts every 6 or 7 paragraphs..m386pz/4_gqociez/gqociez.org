  It's as bad as those fics with "HARRY POV".... "RON POV".... shit inserted the same way.

I've had it far too often people whinging about "Put the name of the POV character at start of the scene, otherwise we won't know who it is." Meanwhile, if you paid a modicum of attention to the story context will make it clear.

So in other word, it's shit but readers actually ask for shit.
