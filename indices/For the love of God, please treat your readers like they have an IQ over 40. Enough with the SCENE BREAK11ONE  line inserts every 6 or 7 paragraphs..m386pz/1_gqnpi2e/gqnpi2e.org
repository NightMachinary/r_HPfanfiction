FFN is over 20 years old. It used to delete line breaks. Now it supports them. I suspect some of the stories people find predate the change. Others are just following the pattern they've seen in countless other fics, never questioning why.

As humans, we learn by observing other humans, identifying patterns and repeating those patterns. Babies don't learn to speak by memorizing definitions. They watch the people around them very closely and start to pick up language from context and repetition. Over time, they start to develop rules for how language is used. That never really changes. It just becomes more refined over time as you gain experience.

Your brain is constantly building and changing the rules in your head based on your experiences. When you go into a new environment, you're trying to figure out how to behave in that environment. If you read a bunch of fanfiction where the line breaks are random characters, you may implicitly start to think that's just how we do line breaks in fanfiction and never question it again.
