Yeah that was totally a thing you had to do to have line breaks and it was often the only way to have line breaks when writing fanfic on forums too. It became almost a personal signature or way to show your artistic cleverness by having the most decorative line breaks. And even when they stopped being needed, that desire to be artistic by making your own fancy line breaks kinda stuck around.

Kind of an extension of ASCII art in a way.
