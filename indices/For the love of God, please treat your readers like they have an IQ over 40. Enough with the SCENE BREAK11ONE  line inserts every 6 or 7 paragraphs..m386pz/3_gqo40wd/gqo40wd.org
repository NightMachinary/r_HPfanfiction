It's a holdover from the days when ff.net used to delete line/scene breaks.

Years ago, most people used 3 asterisks like this: *** as a line break.

Then ff.net decided to delete those. Asterisks, lines, tildes, anything that isn't part of the alphabet or normal punctuation marks got automatically deleted.

So, people had to get creative. Otherwise, you'd get one scene rolling right into the next without any breaks in-between. Some people, though, got a little /too/ creative.
