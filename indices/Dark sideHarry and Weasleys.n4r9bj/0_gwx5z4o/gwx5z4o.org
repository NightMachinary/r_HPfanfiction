[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] looks like a good fit. He's basically Voldemort here, but his goal is to teach DADA forever. In order to achieve that, he must eliminate all competition, including his other versions. He sees Ron as his worthy minion, and Hermione as his successor and trains her accordingly:

  “I glanced around, casually checking for listeners, before admitting. "Hermione, much like you, my nature is also somewhat evil. But I channel that evil into constructive aims like murdering the Dark Lord. We should probably get back to that, by the way. It's been a few weeks."

  "But what if I'm the next Dark Lord?"

  "I don't think You-Know-Who will like that very much. You'll have to kill him anyway," I said.

  Hermione giggled, smiling up at me. I don't know what was funny about that, but I took it as a good sign.”

Another fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes, I am Harry's Brother]], also has Harry, Hermione, the Weasleys, AND the Longbottoms all firmly on Voldemort's side. Needless to say, this Voldemort achieves total victory in the end.
