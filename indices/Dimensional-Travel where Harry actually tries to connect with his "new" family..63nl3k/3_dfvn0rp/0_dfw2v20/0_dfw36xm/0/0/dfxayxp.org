Yeah man, I think that too. The reveal kinda makes it less relevant to this question, but the very end in particular, I did not like. I've seen similar endings in fics, but I find them to be unnecessary to say the least.

Still, it's hardly enough to keep it out of my list of favorite fics or to keep me from suggesting it.
