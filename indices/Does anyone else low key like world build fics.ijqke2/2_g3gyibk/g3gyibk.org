I think a better descriptor is probably empire building, rather than world building. There's a couple like this that I've enjoyed -

non crossover-

- linkao3(24850216) pretty good, updates weekly. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24850216/chapters/60115636]]

- a certain Noodlehammer fic that I don't believe I'm allowed to link here. Say what you will about this guys admittedly horrible opinions, but his empire building and magic systems stuff is top notch. Just search for the user Noodlehammer on fanfiction.net, it's his only HP only story.

crossover-

- linkao3(4629198) pretty good, though I think most of the crossover elements here are unnecessary. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4629198/chapters/10555032]]

- linkffn(13569941) I don't think there was really a big focus on the empire building, but they touched upon it a bit. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13569941/1/What-s-a-Gungan]]

If you're interested in Game of Thrones fanfiction of a similar type, I've found the following to be good-

- linkffn(13496554) star wars x GoT, good empire building [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13496554/1/Song-of-A-Northern-Sorcerer]]

- the sequel to the above stated Noodlehammer fic that I'm not allowed to link to. Same issues, if not worse than his previous fic, but again great world building.

Edit to add -

- Xerosis by Batsutousai. Personally, I think this fic is garbage, could barely make it through. Plus HP/LV slash is just... dumb. Regardless, it does still have some degree of empire building a magical moon base, towards the end, so I guess it counts. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/209494/chapters/313282]]
