That's interesting!

My view is that while magic is reality breaking, how wizards understand/use it may change over time. This "understanding" is what results in new innovation. For instance, apparition, portkey, and floo travel are all different ways of travel, and judging by their effects, they seem to have different magical properties. It's also reasonable to suggest that they were all invented at different times.

Do you feel like it's possible that wizarding society might find some new magical ways of traveling? I guess this also brings up the question on whether or not there exists a better way of magical teleportation that is undiscovered. Or is apparition/portkeys the absolute best that can exist?

Or, for flight, there's brooms. Yet, Riddle was able to demonstrate self flight, which was pretty innovative in my opinion.

Side note: I have this idea, that in the future a new commodity would be winged footwear that allows for limited flight or floating(inspired by Hermes). I can imagine a business like Weasley's Wizard Wheezes selling these.
