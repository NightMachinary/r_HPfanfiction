Fusion of muggle science and magic by enterprising muggleborns coming from improved muggle education standards (as those at least are always going up). Potential Magic of Mass Destruction when one of them figures out how to magically split (or fuse) the atom, allowing any mage to be or create extremely cheap nuclear weaponry. If the wizarding world is discovered and the integration goes sour, it'll only take a few days at most before some pureblood snaps, apparates into the centre of London/Beijing/New York and casts the nuclear detonation spell.

Even if the MMD never gets invented, you still have a population of people capable of smuggling literally anything through muggle customs with magically expanded pockets and a confundus charm or two. Not to mention, if they didn't care about being magically detected, they could simply apparate over international borders before fishing an old, active Soviet warhead out of their trunk in downtown Moscow.

After a certain point, any war between magicals and muggles will be extremely bloody and likely an extinction-level event for the whole planet. It's not easy to say who will be the winner, as the muggles have numbers, whereas the wizards have unparalleled global guerrilla strike capabilities and can strike infrastructure/command with impunity, but each wizard lost will be a relatively heavy blow.
