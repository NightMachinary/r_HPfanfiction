All it takes is for someone to plant subconscious legilimency suggestions or memory alterations in a big enough muggle political figure and suddenly you've got a war brewing.

Also, I never got why the killing curse was so terrible: it's probably the cleanest killing spell in the entire series. No pain, just instant lights out and moving on. Not to mention, it's relatively slow-moving (compared to a bullet, as it can be dodged), is bright green (crappy for stealth warfare unless cast point-blank so that their body muffles the flash), requires an incantation (I'm not sure about this, but I don't think anyone's ever cast a wordless AK in canon) and has a limited range (so no sniping someone from two miles away).
