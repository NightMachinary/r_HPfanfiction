Killing Curse is just a single target attack with quite limited range. I would be far more worried about some crazies smuggling nukes in those magical trunks and detonate them during the Quidditch World Cup. 20% of world's magical population could be wiped out in a single instant.

The primary security concern of magical governments should be the safety of Muggle nuclear weapons and defense against mind control attacks. These two threats combined could lead to world-ending events.
