Hm...

Call me an asshole if you wish, but:

Not at all probably (minor stuff excluded), I mean the magical world looks like it has been the same for hundreds (if not a thousand!) years, so it appears pretty stagnant with only minor tweaks to some spells made every now and then!

I mean tampering with "muggle artifacts" is more or less forbidden (so no fusing of muggle and magical stuff), magicals don't need computers, cars etc. (they have instant teleportation and pens that write by themselves or with voice recognition (that actually works, unlike voice recognition on modern computers which is not always accurate!)) and after Voldemort is defeated nothing really changes, the stuffy purebloods that survive get away with murder mostly (for example the Malfoys! They should all be in prison, not all of them for life, but for a long long time and they should be fined heavily, but they weren't!) and muggleborns are still second class citizens (not Hermione of course, she married a Pureblood after all and is a war hero) and the world still kind of is stuck in the victorian age (robes? really?...) :(
