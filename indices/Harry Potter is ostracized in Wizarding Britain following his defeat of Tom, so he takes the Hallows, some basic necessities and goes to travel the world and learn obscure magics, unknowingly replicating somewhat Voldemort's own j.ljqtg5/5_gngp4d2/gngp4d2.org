Harry could be Anti-Villan and this could be his title [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK0iQlKXxEk][track]]:

I've been awaySearching for a reasonAnother purpose to findI've sailed the seasFought my many demonsI've looked to gods in the skies

I've stood in hellWhere many had to sufferI stared the devil in the eyesWalked many roadsTo witness ancient idolsAnd found the great gates of fire

Had many stormsQuestion my convictionGave armies reason to riseThe hangman's searchingFor bones he can borrowWhile I escaped in the nightFight or flight

Live again, all roads endI'll be coming homeTend your light 'cause on this nightI'll be coming home

My story endsNot far from where it startedMy weary limbs have grown oldI've seen the world through the eyes of a nomadHome is where the heart is I've been told, so I go

Live again, all roads endI'll be coming homeTend your light 'cause on this nightI'll be coming home
