Okay here's a combination of a few things that /might/ work:

- The Prophecy isn't widely know about - Harry is seen as important solely because of the Boy Who Lived thing and because of his other clashes with Voldemort.\\
- Anti-Harry propaganda is more widespread than in canon.\\
- I feel like I remember Voldemort sending some message that he would be “merciful” if Harry gave himself up? Well whether or not that actually happened, it doesn't happen in this version.\\
- When Voldemort displays Harry's “dead” body, he says Harry was a coward that tried to flee (like in canon).\\
- Harry's “I died to pass the protection on to them” thing isn't revealed.\\
- Harry's fight with Voldemort is less climactic - maybe Harry just attacks him from behind while invisible.

So thus we have a relatively distrusted Harry who supposedly tried to flee to save himself, then was discovered and pretended to be dead until he killed Voldemort from behind. Still not a terrible image for Harry, but a bit worse than in canon.

Then, in the aftermath, people's opinions can be split. A few people - mainly those who knew him - think he's actually a hero, whereas most see him as more of a lucky opportunist “taking credit” for a victory he “barely earned”. Harry, tired of everyone's preconceptions about him, decides to leave on vacation, to try to get to be just a person for a bit.

While traveling, he learns his first piece of magic from another culture, and finds he loves the experience. He chooses to extend his “vacation” into a career traveling the world and researching obscure magic.

Then, years later, he decides to return to Britain to find... little has changed. It's still pretty close to the same inept system. Sure, some advancements have occurred, but not as much as should have.

So Harry decides to try to campaign for positive change... only to be met with scorn.

Some people have used his sudden departure to further insult his image and claim that they had much more of a role in slowing/stopping Voldemort's plans, even if Harry is the one who killed him. Additionally, the remaining not-arrested Death Eaters continued to cause trouble for a bit, which further worsened the way Harry leaving looked.

But Harry doesn't give up on advocating for his beliefs. And some of his more “radical” beliefs - like support systems for Werewolves and the decriminalization of some borderline-“dark” magic - continue to net him disapproval from many in power. Until eventually, Harry is declared a dark wizard seeking to overthrow their “righteous” government.

Unwilling to back down on his beliefs and with no other way forward, Harry somewhat leans into this image. He still tries his best to be a good person, but he's now openly fighting the government.

Thus begins the takeover of Dark Lord Harry Potter.
