Voldemort would be very jealous. With but a few carefully placed words, Harry is well on his way to catching up with Voldemort's years of hard work in a minuscule fraction of the time. In fact, Harry's already won half the battle; people are beginning to fear him, especially those who have been caught in the position of opposing him. Because Harry is already a household name, unlike Voldemort was in the 50s, his influence is spreading very quickly.
