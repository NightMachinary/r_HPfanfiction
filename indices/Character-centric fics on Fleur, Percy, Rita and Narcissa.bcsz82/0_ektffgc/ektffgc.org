- linkffn(Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities) (pandan to linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities) focusing just on Percy & Audrey Weasley) --- this story made it into my a very firm headcanon that Audrey is a Muggle), both of these stories are AU from OoP, and I am not completely enamoured to it (also it is a Harmony story, which is minus for me), but particularly Percy & Audrey characters are lovely.
- linkffn(Order of Mercy by MandyinKC) Â­--- this is mostly Bill & Fleur story, but Percy & eventually Audrey are prominent as well (OK, one minus for this story is that here Audrey is a witch). Slightly too much explicit sex for my taste, but the story is well done.
