They didn't scared me off (and yes, I was skipping over them), but I think it is one of many stories where the overabundance of sex actually harmed the continuity of story. I don't like them but from the literary-technology point of view I can understand sex-oriented stories (if I don't call them pornography outright) and there are certainly its readers, but the stories which have actual plot and are otherwise well written are IMHO really not well served when whole chapter is dedicated to the detailed description of parts of anatomy in action. Only real masters of writing can do such interrupted or multi-layered stories (e.g., Herman Melville in the Moby-Dick with inclusion of the Handbook of Practical Whaling) and most fanfic authors are not these. Although I am certainly not an expert on such literature I don't think that such stories work well even as a pornography.

I was trying to find a good story even in linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao), but there I guess it is my fault: this is clearly meant more as a pornography (including all those stupid tropes of magic-leads-to-increased-libido, Hermione-lost-it-with-Krum-in-15, and everybody-is-sleeping-over-whole-castle, and this is even BDSM), so my efforts to find a story there were probably misguided and if anybody tried to made a cleaned-up version there is not much remaining there (but I still think I could like it).
