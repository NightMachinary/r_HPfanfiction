I second the rec above for /Order of Mercy/, I just finished it last week.

linkao3(7811107) has Draco time-travelling to prevent the war, it shares POV with Narcissa and there's bits about how she grew up, how it shaped her that I liked.

linkao3(6551137) the other Draco time travel fic by the same author is Narcissa POV about the first meeting at Madam Malkin's shop.
