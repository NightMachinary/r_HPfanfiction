The main premise itself of Potters abandoning/neglecting one kid while caring for the other. In real life, bias exists, but it has some basis behind it, nobody just decides that I'm going to igone one of twins.

Might be believable if there's magic involved, or it's massively AU with some solid reason (can't think of any, but then I don't write fanfics :)

The stories I remember who did this well are Harry Potter and the boy who lived, and the whole saving Connor saga, but it's just too much angst for my taste
