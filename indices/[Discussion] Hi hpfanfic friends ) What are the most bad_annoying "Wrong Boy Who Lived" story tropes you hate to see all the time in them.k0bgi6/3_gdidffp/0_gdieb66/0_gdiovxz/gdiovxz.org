I have a story I'm planning where Harry has a twin (and isn't living with Lily and James or the Dursley's). They don't get along so when Hagrid arrives and takes them to Diagon Alley the not BWL gets very jealous. I think a lot of it will depend on if the twins are in the same House, if they grow closer or further apart.
