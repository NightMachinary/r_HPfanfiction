My number one thing is the abuse and/or neglect by the Potter parents. We know very little about James and Lily in canon, but one thing we /do/ know is that they both gave their lives to protect their only son without a second's hesitation; it was their first instinct to lay down their own lives to protect their kid's. Yet, for some reason, there exists a whole-ass /genre/ predicted on the idea that they're shitty parents and shitty people who, at best, willfully neglect one of their children for not being special enough.
