I don't think PoS is trash, personally, but I do think it's a pretty bad story, and I wouldn't argue with anyone who said it was.

Its dreadful relationship writing, /miserable/ pacing, litany of pointless side characters, whitewashing of several Death Eaters, bashing of James, egregiously simplistic understanding of the House system, homogeneous characters even among the main cast, worshipful attitude towards Hermione, apparent unawareness of the utilities of a flat character, fixation on the minutiae of canon, and /many/ other shortcomings are all valid issues which prevent it from being anywhere near the pedestal on which many of its readers seem to place it.
