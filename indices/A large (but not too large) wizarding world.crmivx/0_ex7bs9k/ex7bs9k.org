How about fics that include the international wizarding world? I'd be interesting to see how muggle politics unknowingly influence the magical world, for example what happens to magical governments when borders shift? Also, how is the situation like for wizards in North Korea? Did they all flee to the South? Is there a tyrannical magical government cooperating with Kim Jong-Il? Do they all live in hidden places that the muggle government is unaware of? Or is it a tyrannical wizard controlling the country, and Kim Jong-Il is just a puppet?
