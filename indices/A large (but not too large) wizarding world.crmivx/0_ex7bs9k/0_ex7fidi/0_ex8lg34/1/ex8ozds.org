It would make more sense to just have the Wizarding and Muggle Wars run parallell to each other. I imagine that by the time the duel between Dumbledore and Grindelwald takes place the latter already has control (like a Wizarding Emperor) over multiple Wizarding nations including that of Germany and Austria. It would make the most sense if Grindelwald just saw the Muggle WWll as an advantage to decrease the Muggle population but that he actually never affected the actions of Hitler and the Third Reich and instead just stood by and let it happen without intervening. What do you think?
