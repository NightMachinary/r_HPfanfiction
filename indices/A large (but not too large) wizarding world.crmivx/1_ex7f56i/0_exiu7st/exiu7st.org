  60-70 000 wizards in Britain isn't unlikely considering that birth rate in wizarding Britain is low due to Voldemort, hence why we see so few students at Hogwarts.

With this population and even taking into account the higher average age of wizards, a birthrate ten times lower than observed anywhere. 10 thousand seems to be a more likely number.
