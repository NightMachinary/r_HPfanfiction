I have been always thinking that Hemrione's relationship with Lavender and Paravati (and possibly any other Gryffindor girls in their year, or perhaps even in other years) was much more interesting that nothing we have in the books. Perhaps there were some stories/adventures which never made it outside of the girls' staircase of the Gryffindor tower.

1. Hermione went to the Yule ball dressed to the nines. It took her three hours to be prepared for it. I am a man, but I don't think it is normal for women to prepare for such big action alone. And with the ball gowns it is common for somebody to even help her to get into it. Who did help Hermione? The only two possible choices are Ginny or her room-mates (or somebody completely else, but that would be exactly that missing story). Is it more probable she was helped by rather tomboyish a year younger Ginny, or by her robes-obsessed room-mates? I would for the latter.

2. There is that scene during the Battle of Hogwarts when Lavender Brown was attacked by Fenrir Greyback (let's put aide the question whether Lavender survived the attack or not; my headcanon unequivocally contains that she survived and she is now famouse [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/104579][Auror Werewolf]] [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/107123][Lavender Brown]], but that's another question). Hermione tried to defend her and by using some hex she threw Greyback over the whole hall of Hogwarts. I am not sure whether I subscribe to the intent-based theory of magic, but if it is so, then there must be A LOT of intent to save her. Was their relationship (putting aside the Ron/Lavender dating disaster) truly so completely non-existing as the books would make us to believe?
