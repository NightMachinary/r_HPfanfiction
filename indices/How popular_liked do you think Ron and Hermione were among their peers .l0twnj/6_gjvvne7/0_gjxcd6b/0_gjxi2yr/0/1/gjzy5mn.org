  And again, her hypocrisy with the centaurs and the Veelas make her initial SPEW attempts seem like a white savior thing

She never said anything against either groups. Sure, she said she doesn't like horses very much after Parvati told her she must be jealous that a hot centaur is teaching them, but they are /literally half-horse./ She's hardly racist (speciest?) for not being attracted to them.

That's a bit of a false dichotomy, no? Just because someone is apart of an oppressed minority group doesn't mean they don't have their own prejudices. There were freed slaves in America who purchased their own slaves later on in life. Do you now think American slavery was okay? Also, slavery wasn't very common in Britain, so bringing Dean into it is a bit weird.
