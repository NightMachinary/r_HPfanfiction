  A centaur is not a horse, so calling him one was somewhat hypocritical
#+end_quote

Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't seem very hypocritical. As a muggleborn, she thinks of them as half-horse, and is disgusted at the thought of being with them. I'd be disgusted too.

#+begin_quote
  That directly ties in with her being called out by them in the forest at the end of OotP.
#+end_quote

How was that hypocritical at all? She was a teenager who was just leading Umbridge into the forest to stop her best friend from getting tortured, stumbled upon the centaurs, and wanted them to help her. She would do the same thing if she stumbled upon a group of wizards.

Also, if you were in her position, what would you do? Let your best friend get tortured out of respect for the centaurs? She literally had no other option. If you think that's hypocritical, then that's your prerogative, I guess.

  For the House Elf thing, I am referring to the one of the main arguments in the fandom in favor of Hermione being black: that she feels strongly about house elf issues because she connects it with the mistreatment of Black people.

Hermione was obviously meant to be white in the books. It's just that I felt your arguments were not very good.

  The reason I used Dean as an example is that he is both black and raised by Muggles in canon

First of all, as I said before, slavery wasn't very common in Britain. Him being black has no bearing on his views on it. If the books were set in America, him being black would be important, but they're not, so I don't know why you're mentioning his race so much. Second of all, I really feel like you're generalizing black people way too much. Two black people can have opposing views, even on issues like slavery. In real like, freed slaves were somewhat split on the issue too. Some purchased their own slaves and supported it, while some became revolutionaries and activists who denounced slavery.

  However, SPEW clearly didn't resonate with him. Not him, not the other students in marginalized groups, and certainly not the entirety of the Hogwarts population.

You don't know that. It's said that multiple students in Gryffindor were interested in the cause, but refused to enter, some because of the entry fee, and some because of unknown reasons. He may or may not have been one of those students., so I don't think you should spread around misinformation.
