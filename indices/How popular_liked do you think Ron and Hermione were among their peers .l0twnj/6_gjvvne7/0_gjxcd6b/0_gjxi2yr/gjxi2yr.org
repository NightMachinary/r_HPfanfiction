I agree, I am not saying they were the best buddies, more than friendship I would expect honour and respect.

Angelina is also a possibility, true.

Concerning the blackness of either Hermione or Lavender, I am firmly on the fence. Knowing how many black actors and actresses play daily white roles (have you tried to arrange Shakespearean theatre in Africa? why would you limit yourself just to white actors? not mentioning Othello, while talking about Shakespeare), I have zero problems with a black actress playing white Hermione, and I don't know why JKR had to start post factum making Hermione black (aside from her politics, of course).
