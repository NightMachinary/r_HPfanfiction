I'm rereading the books now and have only gotten into the 4th so maybe I'm forgetting some things,

I think ppl respected Hermione but didn't like her. I wouldn't like her if I went there I think we would clash a lot. Harry and Ron only became her friend because of the troll situation but found her annoying at first. She seems very dismissive of the other girls in her year and their interests so I think she probably rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. I don't think they hated her but they likely weren't seeking her out to hang with her. We also never hear Hermione say oh I'm hanging out with so and so.

Ron I think was well liked enough. He seems to get on with the boys well enough.
