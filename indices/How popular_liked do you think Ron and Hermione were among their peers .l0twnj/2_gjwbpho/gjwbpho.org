speaking like as if theyre normal teenagers no voldemort murder team bullsh*t

hermione was probably known. she wasn't like a total nobody and blended into the background but she definitely wasn't super popular. shes smart, so people knew her for her grades, she helps people with homework so theres that too. shes usually nice and knows people from other houses so id say shes that girl in your ela class that youve talked to about whats due next week, she lent you a pencil, probably told the teacher they forgot to assign homework and everyone knows her grades so... id say respected.

ron has a ton of cool brothers and a pretty sister so id think hes pretty popular. he plays quidditch and is good at it---although its an expectation set by his siblings---but it doesn't matter because he plays and hes good. hes funny and charismatic---he made friends with seamus and dean particularly /fast/ after he and harrys fight---so yeah, hes a nice bloke.
