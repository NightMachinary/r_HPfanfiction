Putting aside the heroics for a sec because that's not relevant. And I'm assuming this is just as classmates so not best friend level, just that other person in your year level of friend.

Hermione was respected. But even I don't think I'd have liked her. She doesnt really have any likes or interests outside of agressive studying. Does she like music? Does she have a sense of humour that isn't sarcasm? I don't think I could even discuss books with her because she'd have a 'correct' opinion you know? She isn't very personable. But I'd respect her and keep out of her way.

Ron is such a bloke that I'd say the lads liked him but the girls would have thought him a fucking idiot. (at least till hormones properly kicked in). Good fun, funny, has a personality with likes and interest. Bit of a laugh. Can be a bit mood-swingy though.

I'd gravitate more towards Ron than Hermione though I don't think I'd particularly like either of them.
