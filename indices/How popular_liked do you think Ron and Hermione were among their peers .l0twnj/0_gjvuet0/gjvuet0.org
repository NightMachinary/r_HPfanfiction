Agree with others that Hermione was respected. She was probably seen as 'that annoying girl who's top at everything.' But she definitely helps others, so I think once people see that side of her they'd like her. Think everyone would *know* her but not everyone would like her.

Think Ron was pretty well-liked but people would compare him to his siblings. I think he'd be kind of popular. He has that typical boyishness.
