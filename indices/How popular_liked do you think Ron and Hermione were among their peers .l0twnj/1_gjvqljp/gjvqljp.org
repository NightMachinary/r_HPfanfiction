Ron seems to be relatively popular among the Gryffindors, but is never shown to interact with people from other Houses very much.

Hermione seems to be disliked by the Gryffindors, although Ron implied that she was more popular than Neville, and the Ravenclaws, since they refused to join the DA until Ginny convinced them and they accused Hermione of having ulterior motives for creating the DA. The Hufflepuffs seem to like her, since she's shown to be friendly with Ernie, Hannah, and Justin.
