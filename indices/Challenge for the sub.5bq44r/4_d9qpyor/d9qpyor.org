Er . . . Could I suggest hopping over to [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]]? That's a lot more of a writer concentrated place. R/hpfanfiction is mostly us readers arguing our pants off about characterisations, tropes & fics, and helping other people find stories. We don't really do challenges here.

Over on [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]], though, there are 3 active writing challenges */right now/*. You might have more luck there.
