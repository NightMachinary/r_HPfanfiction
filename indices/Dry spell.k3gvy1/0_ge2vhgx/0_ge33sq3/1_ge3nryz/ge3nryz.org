Back in march-may there was a noticeable uptick in activity but since summer it has been much slower. Not that that is a surprise really, people are back at work (or looking for a new job), have to look after their kids homeschooling and juggle normal live. And if my author's notes lately are representative of the broader community we also have a lot of teachers and (college) students who need to prepare for classes more than usual among us.
