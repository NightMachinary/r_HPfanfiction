Same. I'm in a Harmony fb group and they just did a prompt fest a while back. Tons of people put up a few chapters of their stories and then it seemed like they collectively just decided to stop updating. I know real life happens but it's kind of a bummer when you get into a story and then it stops getting updated. The curse of WIPs.
