It depends.

I find it hard to enjoy fics where Harry acts like a complete idiot and thus gets into trouble. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion and it grates on my nerves. However, I'm also quite sick of super!Harry fics where /everything/ is solved through magical prowess. Fights can be fun, but they kinda wear out, and right now I prefer to read a clever Harry with average magical skills who goes for some actual subtlety in his actions.
