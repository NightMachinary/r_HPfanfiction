You're right, there's no way I'd read /most of a 300k word fic/ that does everything it can to stop me. If the writer gets better, hey, good on him - but that's like barely surviving 3 seasons of a bad show just because it gets bearable in the end. My benefit of the doubt just doesn't expand this far - I believe most people would have better things to do.
