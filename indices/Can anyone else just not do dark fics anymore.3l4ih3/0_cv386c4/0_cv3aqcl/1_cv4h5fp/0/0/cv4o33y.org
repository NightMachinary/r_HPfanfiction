I can only ask how far you've read it as I don't think anyone should be able to come away reading most of the story and thinking Harry is a Gary-Stu.

Other problems with the fic aside, I do think that Harry in his Third Year proves - [[/spoiler][unable to see the big picture, willfully denies his past abuses which impairs his current emotional state, doesn't understand the political ramifications in engaging in every battle people provoke, invades other's minds for personal gain, refuses to trust his house to do their duties, and in general - can be an unceremonious prick to those who he deems lesser.]]
