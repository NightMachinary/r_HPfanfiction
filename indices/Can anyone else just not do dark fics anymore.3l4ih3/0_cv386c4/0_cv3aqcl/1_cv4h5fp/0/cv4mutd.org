You remind me a bit of those people who go "Yeah s/he can do anything well and is super brilliant and has great personality and humor but it's not really a Mary Sue because their perfection itself is annoying".

The fact that from chapter one, /one peer/ in the castle can beat Harry solely because she takes it /seriously/ and /plans appropriately/... makes for an an awful, awful setting.

And let's not forget his own brilliant mind, always finding the perfect solution, having witty last word, analyzing problems to the point of hilarity, noticing everything around him that happens to be relevant, we can go on

Check this out:

  Deciding to intervene on her behalf, Harry said: "You mean the charm to unlock doors? I know you had trouble with it, Draco, but it's called Alohomora. Do you want it in syllables? A-lo-ho-mo-ra. Kind of.. kind of like it sounds!"

  "Potter, leave the humor to Zabini. You're not as good at it as he is."

This perfectly shows /the lenghts/ the author has to go to, to prove to us that Harry isn't perfect. *He literally has to tell us.* Pathetic. Bad characterization is bad.
