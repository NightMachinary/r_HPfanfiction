/One peer/ that is incredibly intelligent, capable of planning on a level beyond almost anyone, and (from canon) having perhaps the most analytical mind of all. In HBS, why should Harry plan to evade the potentiality of such a peer when he's won every single battle, gone undefeated in his glory? There's no threat to him. He doesn't even know she exists.

Hell, that arrogance is the first obvious, glaring piece of evidence that Harry is /not/ a Mary Sue. And he certainly pays for it - /unlike/ a Mary Sue.

Harry is not the end-all-be-all of planning, social skills, and intelligence, and I'm not sure how you could read past the first chapter and still think that.

  And let's not forget his own brilliant mind, always finding the perfect solution, having witty last word, analyzing problems to the point of hilarity, noticing everything around him that happens to be relevant, we can go on. Check this out: [snip]

So is being witty the same as being a Mary Sue, now? And where are you getting "noticing everything to the point of hilarity"? Last I checked, that's one of the things Harry is /struggling/ with.

  This perfectly shows the lenghts the author has to go to, to prove to us that Harry isn't perfect. He literally has to tell us. Pathetic. Bad characterization is bad.

Great characterization is /great/. I'm confused as to how you think that's the author telling us Harry isn't perfect - it's witty banter between Harry and Draco. I have intelligent friends that make sarcastic, witty comments. Are they Mary Sues, now?

*So far, you haven't countered a single point of mine,* instead telling me how I remind you of a fangirl. You seem to judge the fic off of barely skimming past the first chapter, seem to replace every incidence of "character dynamics" or "witty banter" with "Mary Sue".
