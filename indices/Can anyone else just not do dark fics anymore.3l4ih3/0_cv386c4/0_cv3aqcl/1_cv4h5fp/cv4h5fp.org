There's much more to being a Mary Sue than being good at magic. Harry in HBS certainly is not a Mary Sue. He's ambitious, capable, and smart - that doesn't mean Mary Sue.

Hell, the fic is a fun read precisely /because/ Harry is not a Mary Sue. Challenges are scaled to his ability. The struggle is certainly there, and it makes a very enjoyable read.

I'm not sure how you could say Harry is a Mary Sue if you've actually read the fic. There are massive struggles, absolutely massive plot-centric trials Harry is going through. Just because he's good at magic doesn't mean he's a Mary Sue.
