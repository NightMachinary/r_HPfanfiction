Hmm. I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree, then. I feel that the spells Harry performs are much more complex than "being guns", and the concept of magical exhaustion makes sense with the scale of magic being executed - I, personally, felt it was well-done, and never felt arbitrary at all.

The setting, I thought, was incredible - one of the most interesting portrayal of Hogwarts and Hogwarts professors I've seen. The combat scenes always got my heart thumping - it was action-packed and generally well-done overall, with creative solutions for nearly every problem Harry faced.

And Harry's emotions were handled beautifully, I think.

The story certainly is worth the hype, in my eyes. And it may not be to everyone's tastes, of course, but I certainly thought it was far, far above "better than the riff-raff".
