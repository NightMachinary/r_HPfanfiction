I am, actually. I find the writing to be okay, but the setting.. isn't very good. It applies magic to combat quite poorly - or rather, it applies combat /to magic/ poorly.

The Hermione in that fic and her interactions with Harry is not very well done, either, I'm sorry to say. It's above the general riff-raff of fics, but it isn't worth the hype the fic gets.

And for a fic with a focus on magical combat, it does it very very poorly. If your characters run around like maniacs using their wands like guns, and you have /magical exhaustion/, I'm going to have to say you failed. Should have just written an Ender's Game fanfic instead, because this isn't very good HP content.
