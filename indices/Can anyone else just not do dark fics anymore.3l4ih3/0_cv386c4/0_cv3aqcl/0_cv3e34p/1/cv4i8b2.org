Really? This fic really has one of the best Hogwarts setups in my humble opinion.

Even though it has been a while since I checked it out, I will disagree with the wand-gun trope. Unless I remember incorrectly, a lot of different magic spells and tactics were being used.

I am curious. If you don't think this is good, then what is?

Edit: Ok, just got to admit something though. The particular fic has strong dystopian qualities and can be pretty depressing. Could that be what is annoying you? Cause the other things you mention are a bit nit-picky.
