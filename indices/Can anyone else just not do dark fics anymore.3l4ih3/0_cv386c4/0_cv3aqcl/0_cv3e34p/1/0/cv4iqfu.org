It does use a lot of different spells and tactics, but it still boils down to treating the wand like a gun. Limited reserves, rather straightforward fighting, dodging, rolling, running around for cover and preserving energy.

This isn't how skilled duellists fight in the HP universe. If Voldemort even bothers to move, he walks casually. When Sirius and Bellatrix, or Molly and Bellatrix, fought, they weren't throwing themselves into rolls and hiding behind cover - they duelled like their wands were swords, or better yet, an extension of themselves.

The only ones that run around like Battle School makes out is the best tactic in the HP world is school-kids when fighting skilled adults.

Finally, if you limit magic by "energy" or "reserves" or what have you, I'm going to have to tell you to kindly go fuck off and write a sh≈çnen fic instead. This isn't /magic/ and it definitely isn't HP magic.

The dystopian qualities I'm fine with. It's not that strong, and it works for the story. Snape's a bit of a disappointment though, as he always is in fics.

I think this is a good story as a fic. I've yet to read a single fic that holds a light towards actual good writing - but to be fair, neither does the HP books.

I'd say there are far better examples of writing in the fandom, however. Just recently, Resurrexit was pretty good, even if I didn't much like the story and hook. A Black Comedy is a fantastic example on how to write comedic fiction. HPMOR is a study in episodic writing and (arguably shoehorning) educational overtones into a well-written story.
