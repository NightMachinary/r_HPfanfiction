What longer fics do you like with Harry that's not super OP or annoying? Personally I really enjoy reading about him succeeding in general, but my problem is that it usually means no visible effort and struggle.

I have recently started The Hogwarts Battle School because I liked the idea and thought it's going to be entertaining in that Harry is going to be forced to compete and improve. But it turns out he starts out hilariously talented and smart, and it looks like the only thing that's wrong with him is underestimating his opponents and some lack of creativity, which feel very forced. It's a an obvious "look, see, it's *not* a Mary Sue, he *struggles*" move from the author and I don't know who's convinced by that..
