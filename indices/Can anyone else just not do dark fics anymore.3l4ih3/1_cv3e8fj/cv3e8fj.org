I can do dark fics. Fics that display war in all of its horror and sadness.

But I can't stand angst anymore. Where Harry goes all noble and thinks "we love each other but we can't be together". I've read it often enough, and it gets annoying. You have to get the angst right for it to enrich the story, but most of the time it's overdone and it overshadows the plot too much.
