Most of the time I stick to fairly fluffy, low-angst, oftentimes romance-ish stories. Because there's enough bullshit and depressing stuff in real life.

That's not to say I dislike darker, angsty-er stories. Often they get left on my to-read list for a while and then I binge them until the feels are overwhelming, before going back to the fluffier stories.
