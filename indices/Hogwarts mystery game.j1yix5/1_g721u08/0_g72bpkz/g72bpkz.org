Merula's an interesting character; the child of two Death Eaters, and while she might hold similar (though possibly to a lesser degree) anti-muggleborn attitudes, there seems to be a fair amount of evidence that she hates Voldemort because she sees him as the reason her parents are in Azkaban. Or at least, that's my interpretation of her.
