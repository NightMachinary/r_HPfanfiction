Like with any idea in the fandom, it could be awesome if it's done well. I get the impression that a lot are self-inserts (which makes sense given that it's a video game designed to let you imagine yourself as a student at Hogwarts), with all of the associated problems and stigma that come along with that. Even if you're writing the PC as a well-rounded, flawed OC, people - especially people on this subreddit - will probably assume it's a Mary Sue/wish fulfillment type thing and not have an interest.
