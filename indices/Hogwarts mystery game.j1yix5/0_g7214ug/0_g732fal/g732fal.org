To be fair, the "Student" you play as in Hogwart's Mystery is completely OP, especially if you do all the events (spoiler of the game beyond):

- Fought a Werewolf in 2nd year
- Friend with the Bizarr' Sisters
- Became an animagus in 3rd year
- Master the Patronus in 4th year
- Became a Prefect and Head Boy/ Girl
- Is a Master Prankster
- Joined his House Quidditch Team and was undefeated while playing at different positions
- Never lost the House Cup

If someone just wrote the plot of the game without mentioning where it is from, people would (and should) yell at the wish fulfillment.
