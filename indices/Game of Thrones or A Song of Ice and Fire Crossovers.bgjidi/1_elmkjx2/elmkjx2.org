To be honest, I dislike the idea of GoT characters in the Harry Potter world, and ignore those whenever I can discern that that's what's happening from the summary.

However, Harry Potter characters in the GoT world does something akin to a goddamn explosion in my brain, and I can't get enough of it.

In the spirit of your post, I'll share some of my favorites!

(I'm not going to recommend any fics that I can remember overtly sexualizing children, but given the nature of the GoT universe, I'm not going to link directly to any of these stories simply to be on the safe side.)

The Difference One Man Can Make

The Black Prince

The Wizard of Harrenhal

The Winter Witch

The Song of Builders

A Discordant Note (Sequel to 'For Love of Magic', by noodlehammer.)

God-Emperor of Essos and beyond (harem-wank, IIRC, but it has a lot of words.)

--------------

Unforuntatly, I don't think any of these stories are complete, but that's just the unfortunate trend for crossover stories, it seems.
