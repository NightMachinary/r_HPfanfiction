Sure!

Here's her profile: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2093991/Epic-Solemnity]]

You can find her old works archived under the pseudonym Dark Cyan Star on Ao3 ([[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Dark_Cyan_Star/profile]]) and even /older/ works through her ancient yahoo group -- though you might have to do some googling on that front.

Happy reading.
