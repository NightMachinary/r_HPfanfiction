I have a...story that sort of (?) fits this. It isnt necessarily the historical timeline of Tom-Riddle's-Rise-To-Power, but it is an elaborate examination of Tom Riddle and his possible perspective on evil etc. It's a time travel story where Tom comes to the future due to a botched ritual, and shit ensues. The story is pretty dark, there's no ships.
