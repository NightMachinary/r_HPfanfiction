I personally feel like Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff both are just automatically dismissed by the fandom. Slytherin is the edgy choice, they use it to delve into the more stereotypical views of magic ie. Dark vs light vs. Grey and rituals and chasing power and the character not allowing themselves to be "controlled" by an authority figure. It's the same MO every time which is why I tend to use the exclude option for the Slytherin Harry tag on AO3 because there's nothing unique there.
