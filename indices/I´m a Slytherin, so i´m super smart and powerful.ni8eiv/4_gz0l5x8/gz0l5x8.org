  You see, I love reading Powerful! Harry, but most fanfictions tend to put him in Slytherin, as if he couldn't be powerful in other houses. And as if it weren't bad enough, all the other houses look stupid compared to sly. The Gryffindors speak loudly, have no manners and it seems that being a good person is suddenly a horrible defect. The other two houses are - I don't know, they are just there.

But isn't that precisely one (not the) appeal? Your latter point is POV bias: In Canon, the two prototypes (Draco and Pansy) are cowards, backstabbers, cheats, liars and bigots. And, in accordance with Gryffindor morals, those traits are shown as bad, their actions as morally wrong, their characters as repulsive.

Conversely, if you invert this for a Slytherin!Harry, Draco and Pansy are self-preserving, sly, "use any means to win" and defend traditional order. And according to Slytherin morals, those traits are laudable, their actions commendable, their characters appealing. And in turn, now /Gryffindor/ is bad, wrong and repulsive: reckless (== bold), stupid (== brave), narrowminded (== having and standing up for strict ideas of what is "right") etc, you get the drift.

Precisely this is why I read Slytherin!Harry, or any other House takes, for that matter: Because the implicit moral framework is shifted, and the story can explore the resulting world view; the same world, seen through a radically different lens.

As for the former ... "power" is vast term. In the broadest sense, any House will produce powerful alumni. I guess the difference in Slytherin is that there, an inherent will to /use/ that power is assumed, because that is "ambition". And so, the more you want power in order to use it, the more of a Slytherin you are -- and in want of other traits being stronger than this one, I guess people in those cases just naturally end up in Slytherin.

As for the rest, YMMV. Hit and miss, but I'm not begrudging you your rant. Been there, done that. :)
