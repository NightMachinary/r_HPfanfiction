I'd love to read a well done Hufflepuff Harry some time. He really was an incredibly loyal kid, even as a very young kid. He has some powerful loyalty to parents he can't even remember, and to new friends even after he barely met them.

Dumbledore told him that only a true Gryffindor could have pulled the sword out of the sorting hat, but it was his unwavering loyalty to Dumbledore that summoned Fawkes in the first place. That's pretty impressive strength of character for a 12 year old kid.
