Yes, I understand although I don't like the aspects I mentioned above. And it's obvious that slytherin is the most used house in fanfictions (since Rowling didn't develop sly characters other than villains) and it's an interesting house to explore ... and more importantly, I think a lot of potterheads today are Slytherins, so it's easier to write about the characters in their house
