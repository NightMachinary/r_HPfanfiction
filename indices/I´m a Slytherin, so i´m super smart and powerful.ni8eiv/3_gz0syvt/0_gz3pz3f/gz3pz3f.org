In those cases I would say the house depends on what the character values or admires in others. Crabbe and Goyle value power, what little they have as thugs and what Malfoy enables them to do. Pettigrew was jealous of how brave and charismatic his friends were, as well as how they inspired loyalty to each other.

Snape had some bravery and loyalty, but at his sorting he wanted to accrue skills and connections that would help him escape his parents.
