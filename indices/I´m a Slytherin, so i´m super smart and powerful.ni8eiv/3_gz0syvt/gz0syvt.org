Well Gryffindors are biased too. Dumbledore says that they sort people to quickly when Snape says he won't return to Voldemort if he comes back.

In fact the houses of Hogwarts should be no more than the colleges from Oxford/Cambridge. Yeah... they value some qualities over others but it's just a priority list and not a definition of your personality. Pettigrew is always referred to as a coward and he was a Gryffindor, Crabbe and Goyle were of course the epitome of cunning intelligent Slytherin (/s for the Crabbes and Goyles of reddit), we meet few other people from the rest of the houses but Cho seems pretty dumb as a person (although she could have been smart academically) despite being a Ravenclaw.
