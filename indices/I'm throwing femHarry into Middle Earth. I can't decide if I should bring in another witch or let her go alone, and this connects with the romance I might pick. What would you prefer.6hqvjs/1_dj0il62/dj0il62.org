A fem Harry femslash? Woot!

I'd prefer fem Harry go with someone else because there's a glut of stories where Harry time or dimension travels on his own and is incredibly (but understandably) angsty about losing everyone and being totally isolated at first. A second witch accompanying fem!harry would be refreshing because then the reader can enjoy seeing their contrasting methods of dealing with losing their world and their disagreements over who and how much to open up to in the new world.

Luna would be a fun character and I think her brand of emotional insightfulness and quirkiness would mesh very well with the LOTR universe (and her theories about where they landed could be entertaining). Luna's an INFP character and Tolkien was an INFP author whose works reflected that sense of internal morality and "be true to yourself at all costs and you will triumph" philosophy. Gandalf is just like her, minus the gullibility.

Also: Include in your first author's note the fact that readers can download your story and search and replace Yennefer's name with a name of their choosing. A very common complaint with fem!harry stories is readers dropping the story because they hate the name the author picked, and picking it up later once they realize they can do search-and-replace for names. Yennefer is definitely going to be a loathed name choice, so it's probably a good idea to preemptively offer a solution to that problem. (A few people won't even read a story with a /Harriet/ name!)
