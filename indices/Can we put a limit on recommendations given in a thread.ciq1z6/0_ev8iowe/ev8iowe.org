If you want people to only rec a few fics at a time, then when /you/ are the OP you can make that part of your request.

I remember a thread this past year in which the OP requested at least a paragraph with each recommendation to explain how the fic fit the request and what made it good. Surprisingly, that turned out to be a very lively request thread with many great responses.

Each OP has different preferences. Many people prefer to receive more on-topic recs rather than less. Thus, there's no point in making a general rule about this sort of thing. It's up to the OP to say what they do and don't want.
