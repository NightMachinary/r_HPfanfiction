There was a fanfiction where Harry's parents sent him to live abroad with Sirius to protect him, and Neville was the BWL. Harry came back to england when he was 11 and was sorted to Slytherin. I wish I could remember the name of the fanfiction because I really want to read it again. But it does have what you're asking for. If someone knows it, maybe he or she can drop the link?
