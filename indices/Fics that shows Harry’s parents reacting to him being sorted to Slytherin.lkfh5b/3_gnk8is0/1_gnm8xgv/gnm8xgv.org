Lmao James makes one off the cuff comment about Slytherins and suddenly he's all "slimy snakes die". He was very ok with Sirius' entire family being in Slytherin and didn't start cursing Sirius right then and there or start frothing at the mouth.

James' reaction to Snape wanting to be in Slytherin is pretty in line with Manchester United fan reacting to a City fan. Or a USC legacy reacting to a UCLA student. 11 year old James didn't know if his new friend would be in Slytherin or Gryffindor and he was very accepting of him. Somehow 30 year old James will treat his son less because Harry's in Slytherin.

Meanwhile, Snape calls James and his dad brainless idiots for being in/wanting to be in Gryffindor. If anything Snape is the more prejudiced one here.

Also I find the idea of holding Lily in any way responsible for Snape actively wanting to be a death eater pretty misogynist. It's not up to the girl to "save" the evil boy. Lily didn't say all Slytherins are evil. She said Mulciber and Avery are. And she was correct. Snape was free to befriend other Slytherins but chose those two because they shared the same goal of wanting to serve Voldemort.

If your friend starts hanging out with murderous racists and you don't, you aren't allowed to call out that these people are murderous racists? It's your fault for showing disapproval of these murderous racists? Give me a break.
