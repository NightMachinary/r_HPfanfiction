I'm thinking Lily would be slightly upset because in her mind, Slytherin took her closest friend and turned him into a bad guy. Massive oversimplification cause there were other factors to why Snape fell in with the death eaters, Lily being one of those factors whether she can admit it or not. How much she pushed him is open to interpretation but constantly telling Snape how bad his housemates were and holding her own as better certainly didn't help. James is someone I have a very low opinion of and don't see him getting over his own prejudices towards Slytherin and accepting Harry's placement. Sirius I can totally see getting over it because of his own family
