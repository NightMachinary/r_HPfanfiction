I don't think Lily would treat him differently, she was Snape's bestfriend for 5 years after all and always defended him against the marauders. Sirius would be an asshole but would get over quickly, after all his own brother and uncle were there and he cares about them. James, I don't know, he will be an asshole but I don't know if he would eventually get over it. I always viewed him as a very complex character.
