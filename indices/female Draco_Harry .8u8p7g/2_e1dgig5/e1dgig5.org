I remember reading one, I think that it is call 'For the sake of a name' in AFF.net. (At work and that site is blocked).

The premise is that while at a detention from Snape, Draco knocks over (and thusly gets coated in) a bunch of random potions. The effect is to (semi-)permanently change him into a her.

Draco and Harry hook up because he is the only one nice to her (he is aware that Draco is a girl), and they reveal that they were interested in each other when they were both guys, but they were afraid of speaking about it. So they decide they want to be in a relationship.

It is unfinished, but what exists is pretty good.
