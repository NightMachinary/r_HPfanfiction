Either dead, in prison or soul sucked out by a Dementor. I like it when his crimes are revealed to the whole Wizarding world and they find out that he is partly responsible for the deaths of James and Lily and other crimes commited as a Death Eater . Dumbldore can't save him and justice is finally served
