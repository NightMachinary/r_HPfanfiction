oooh, shit I love this version of snape, I've only really seen it in a difference in family: the snake chronicles by rannaro ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles]]) are there any other fics w/ this characterisation that you've found?

P.S if ur scrolling down the comments u are now legally obligated to read this fic. it is so good, you won't regret it (unless you do).
