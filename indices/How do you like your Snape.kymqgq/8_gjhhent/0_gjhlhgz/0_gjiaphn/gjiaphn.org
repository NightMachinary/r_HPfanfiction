I prefer Snape time travel to go to the Marauders' era, so Harry will never exist. Not just butterflying away the breakup with Lily, though; my favorite is The Peace Not Promised, which goes back to a point after that, and linkao3(Come Once Again And Love Me) is good too (grittier plot, but superb prose quality).
