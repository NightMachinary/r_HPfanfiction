This doesn't fall under your categories but I like sarcastically funny snape.

And I like Snape in time travel from what I've seen in fics. I also find it exciting when he's confronting Black or Lupin. Maybe because he and Black are such strong personalities but Snape has that under-the-surface cunning while Black is more bluster, and Lupin tries to be nice.
