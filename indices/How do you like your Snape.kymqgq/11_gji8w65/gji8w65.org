I like an arrogant, acerbic, Snape. One that is unlikable no matter what side he's on. One that gets angry over personal slights that don't matter but still dies for his cause.

In general I like characters that defy peoples expectations of 'good' or 'evil'. Snape can be an asshole and still fight for good team. He can still take sadistic pride out of tormenting teenagers and still be a war hero.

It takes a special fic that can take that essence and still wrangle respect out of Snape
