Terrible but not evil. He's a miserable, nasty fucker. I love that in canon he is an important part of the victory over Voldemort, but he's still such a bastard. He did a few good things in his life for terrible reasons. Mostly he's a mirror to reflect different philosophical questions while still being a realistic character because the world is full of people like Snape.

He's a great foil for Harry. A line I really liked in DH was where (paraphrasing) it pointed out that LV, HP, and SS (also Albus Dumbledore but that wasn't part of the line) were poor sad unwanted children who found home and a purpose at Hogwarts.
