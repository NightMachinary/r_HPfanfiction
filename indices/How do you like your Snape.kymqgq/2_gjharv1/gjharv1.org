I prefer him as an spiteful antagonistic prick. I'm fine with him working for either side or simply looking for vengeance. And I like him absent from any romantic involvement. I just cant get into anything related to Snape romance. Maybe there are good ones, but I just can't get past that picture of my least favorite teacher I always associate with him. Makes it even creepier that alot of those have a large age gap.
