I'm piggybacking off [[/u/adreamersmusing][u/adreamersmusing]]'s response since I really liked it. Specifically this section:

#+begin_quote
  In short, he is vengeful, loyal, bitter, brave, emotionally-stunted, guilt-ridden, and jealous.
#+end_quote

He describes a very compelling character and I hope to see more fics using this characterization.

Personally I have a hate-hate relationship with Snape in large part because a lot of the fandom likes to portray him as a better man than he is. If I had to choose a defining moment for him, it would be in /Prisoner of Azkaban/ where he knowingly lies to Fudge about Sirius. He effectively condemns a man he /knows/ is innocent, a man that has already spent 12 years in a living hell, to a fate worse than death. And he does this over a childhood grudge.

I'd replace "loyal" and "brave" from the section quoted above with "petty" and "selfish." I like to see him portrayed as someone who spent his time deliberately terrorizing children, a man who couldn't forgive a boy for surviving when his mother didn't, someone who was willing, eager even, to see a family (any family) destroyed so he could "have" a woman that wanted nothing to do with him.

I like to see a Severus Snape who is talanted, driven, and knowledgeable, but is fundamentally a horrible person where any good he does is purely incidental to his revenge against Voldemort.
