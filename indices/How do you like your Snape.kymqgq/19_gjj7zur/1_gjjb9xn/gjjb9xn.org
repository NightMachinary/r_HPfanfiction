Yes, but the thing is that he is loyal and brave as well. I purposely included those two because I think those are his defining characteristics. His loyalty and bravery ultimately helped save the wizarding world.

In the end, his loyalty towards Dumbledore supercedes everything else. He knowingly sends Harry to his death because of that loyalty, even when it meant throwing his atonement away. And as for his bravery, I think he is one of the bravest characters in the series, constantly lying to Voldemort under the threat of torture and death. We praise Narcissa Malfoy for one lie but Snape had to do it consistently, particularly when other Deatheaters like Bellatrix didn't trust him.

I also don't agree with his motivation being revenge against Voldemort, my reading of him is that his entire arc is one of atonement for Lily's death. He doesn't blame Voldemort as much as he blames himself, and his actions after her death are primarily about atoning for getting her killed.

I think he did show some character growth towards the end. He wasn't the same selfish, depraved young man who went to Dumbledore to beg for Lily's life. He tried to save Remus Lupin by aiming at a Death Eater, he genuinely regretted not being able save lives ('Lately only those whom I could not save'). Saving lives didn't really benefit Voldemort's defeat, but he did it anyway. In the end, he did manage to grow morally while still being deeply horrible.
