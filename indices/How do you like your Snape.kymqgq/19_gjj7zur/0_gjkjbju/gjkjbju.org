  If I had to choose a defining moment for him, it would be in Prisoner of Azkaban where he knowingly lies to Fudge about Sirius. He effectively condemns a man he knows is innocent, a man that has already spent 12 years in a living hell, to a fate worse than death

But this isn't true. He was unconscious when Sirius and Remus reveal Peter. He thinks Sirius betrayed the Potters (like the rest of the wizarding world believes) by the time he enters the Shack. You can double check your PoA copy. He is knocked out by Stupefy on page 361 of the American editions of PoA. Then, on page 366, Remus and Sirius cast the spell that forces Peter out of his animagus form and reveals Scabbers to be Peter. Snape didn't hear any of this or see Peter, so he doesn't know Sirius is innocent when he speaks to Fudge.

No wonder you accuse the fandom of portraying him "as a better man than he is;" your version of Snape is going to be vastly different from most people's because you are judging him on a completely different level than what's in the books.
