I'm in no way trying to vilify Lily, to be clear. She was very upset that he called her a mudblood. As she should be.

The fact that he's used it before, however, doesn't negate the fact that he's also in a very ‘toxic' environment. I know from experience that you can't help but pick certain things up, even when you hate them with all your being. She's his closest friend and confidant. She could and should have been a little more understanding, knowing full well his situation.

As I said above, too, (in my headcanon) his heart wasn't in the whole Death Eater thing until after the ‘Mudblood' incident, at which point, her reaction, justified or not, caused him to internalise a lot of horrible, negative things, essentially convincing himself that he was a Death Eater.

I know where you're coming from. I think the books leave a lot to the imagination with his story. Some things, I have taken some creative liberties with to fit my story and create the Severus Snape I want and need in my universe. I'm not going to sit here and argue about whether Snape or Lily was in the wrong. Neither is infallible.
