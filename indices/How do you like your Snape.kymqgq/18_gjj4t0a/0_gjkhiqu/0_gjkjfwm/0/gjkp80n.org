Sure. Your headcanon is your headcanon and mine is mine. No point trying to convince one another.

I think Lily was plenty understanding though. Imagine being a black person in the 1960s and trying to defend a person who casually throws around the word "nigger". Or a gay person in the 80s.

If Lily were to be more understanding, she'd practically be a saint or have some serious issues with internalized racism.
