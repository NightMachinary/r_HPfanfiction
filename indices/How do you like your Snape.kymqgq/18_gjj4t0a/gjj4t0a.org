I like reading most versions of Snape, although I hate the bashing and borderline-bashing versions where he's just evil incarnate. I think there are a lot of things that went wrong for him to put him in the position he's in.

In my work, I write him as a man whose youth was heavily influenced by those around him, with little choice but to let it happen and try to use them back, due to his home circumstances. He was more-or-less swept along into Voldemort's following, going where the money and influence were so that he could get the education he wanted and become a man better than his father.

What stopped him, initially, from taking the dark mark was his friendship with Lily. When that ended, and he saw that she was unwilling to forgive him, he blamed himself. There was a lot of, “Well if this girl, who is the most lovely, forgiving person I know, can't forgive me for what I have done, maybe I really am just a piece of shit Death Eater. That must be the only path for me. I'm irredeemable.” Lily's reaction to that one slur was disproportionate. Have you ever called someone a c*nt without meaning to? It's like that. You hear it so much around you, it just slips out in the heat of the moment. Even if you hate the word and everything it stands for, sometimes it comes out. She knew he was in that environment, hearing that slur all the time. She knew it was an honest mistake, a matter of the brain short-circuiting out of embarrassment, anger, fear, and all the other emotions he was probably feeling.

I'm not saying he couldn't have gone the other way, but a lot of circumstances led to him taking that mark.

Additionally, the whole ‘Eternally in Love With Lily' thing is.. inaccurate. I think he realised, at some point along the way, that he wasn't a Death Eater; he didn't believe in their values, didn't want to be a part of the upcoming genocide. When he told Voldemort about the prophecy, he suddenly found out just how fanatical and insane Voldemort really was. It was a wake-up call for him. I think a lot of his friends and housemates were in similar positions, especially those whose families were already heavily involved (similar to the situation with Draco and his generation.) The difference between Snape and, say, Lucius Malfoy, is that Snape had that connection on the ‘Side of the Light' through Lily and his presumed love for her. He realised that he could use that connection to get out. He also probably realised that nobody in the order would believe he was genuine unless he claimed to be in love with her. Love is their big thing, after all. Proving it was probably a matter of using his friendship with Lily as the fuel for his patronus, and the rest was acting the part; bitter/heartbroken over Lily's death, heavily biased toward Slytherin, and specifically against Harry, to keep up the appearance of being a Death Eater. Partly to keep from being found out as a spy and traitor, partly to keep Dumbledore's trust.

Of course, saying all of this within the story itself is no good because there's no need to mention all of this so explicitly. It has to be shown through his own words and actions to be at all effective.

Sorry for the massive, long analysis. It's just good to tell someone other than my editor about my headcanons!
