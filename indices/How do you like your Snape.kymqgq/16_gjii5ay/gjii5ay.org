Lol, I just so happen to be writing a time-travel fix-it fic where Snape happens to be 1) reformed, 2) protective of Slytherins, 3) still a bit of a dick, and 4) Harry will semi-befriend him. Funny how that works out. ðŸ˜ƒ

But, yeah, I prefer fics where Snape's not ridiculously evil or anything and is "reformed" or whatever that means.
