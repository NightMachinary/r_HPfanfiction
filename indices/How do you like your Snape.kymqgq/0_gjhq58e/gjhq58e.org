Bitterness and anger are his go-to emotions. He hates everyone and everything, but he hates himself most of all. He's attracted to goodness and does good but is too damaged to become a Good Person himself. The only quality he sees in himself as having any worth is his cleverness, which is why he hones his skills tirelessly to make himself the perfect weapon. He's also a bit of a faker, constantly trying to make himself someone he's not: an impassive, polished, pureblood, but ultimately he will always be the hotheaded working-class half-blood from the bad side of Cokeworth. He also has a dark and sarcastic sense of humour. In short, he is vengeful, loyal, bitter, brave, emotionally-stunted, guilt-ridden, and jealous.

I can read Snape in numerous situations, but one of my favourite kinds of fics is him confronting Harry--the physical manifestation of his sins, his flaws, and his failures-- and achieving some kind of understanding with him. It's a compelling conflict and I prefer it if Snape is dragged into becoming a better person kicking and screaming.
