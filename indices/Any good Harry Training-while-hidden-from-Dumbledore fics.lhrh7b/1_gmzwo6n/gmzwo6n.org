That is the main plot for linkao3(Of A Linear Circle) if you're up for a big read? It really goes out of its way to specifically point out all the reasons why Dumbledore is a big ol manipulative asshole, it's so very cathartic to read ,ðŸ˜Š. One chapter is just an itemized list ðŸ˜Š.

It's also incredibly written with a lot of lore and history and world building it's my absolute favourite story ðŸ˜Š
