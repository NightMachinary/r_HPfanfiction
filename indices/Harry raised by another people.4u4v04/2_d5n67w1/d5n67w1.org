The classic "Harry is raised by the Addams Family" story is the Harveste series by kyaru-chan (and if it's not that, it's Perfect Slytherins by jeconais) - but my favorite is [[http://ishtar.fanficauthors.net/Family_Values/index/][Family Values by Ishtar]].

And I'm not sure it counts, because it's a total crossover and pretty much crack (even more so than the above), but there's always [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-series-of-crazy-random-happenstances-hp-dc.14620/][A Series of Crazy Random Happenstances]] (also known as the crazy random adventures of Clark Joseph Kal Harry El-Potter Kent... he usually just goes by Clark Kent).
