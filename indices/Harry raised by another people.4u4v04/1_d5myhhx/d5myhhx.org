Shameless self-plug incoming: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11727180/1/HP-Raised-by-the-Tonks]]

Anyways, no idea if it's your cuppa tea as the Intro Arc was written primarily from the adults POV, and not all that much attention on Harry in this Arc as I did not feel all that comfortable writing from the POV of a child of six. And the next Arc will jump straight to the summer before first year.

So, maybe you'll like it maybe you won't :) just thought I'd tell.
