Linkffn(5087671) - Runic Animagi is cracky and doesn't have the best writing, but it's one of the very few stoner Harry fics and the only one that does it somewhat well. In which Harry fucks off during the Summer after his Godfather's demise, finding his Mothers old rune notes. He ends up finding a talent in it, going as far as creating unheard of runic scripts to do a variety of things including the titular idea of using them to become various animals.

Linkffn(5077573) - RuneMaster does a better job both in writing and story, in which Harry finds out he's a runic prodigy and does amazing things revolutionizing things like potions with them- then decides to deal with Voldemort and the deatheaters himself. It's crack but it's rather funny and an interesting story. One of my favorite HP stories and definitely contains my all time favorite Harry Potter epilogue.
