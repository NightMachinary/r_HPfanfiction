I totally agree. Shiva's character was brilliant and their relationship was different (in a good, interesting way) from what you normally see in adoption fics.

The romantic side felt weak and heavy-handed at times, like you said, forcing a harem simply for a harem's sake. I think the biggest miss for me was 'how many' it ended up. That Harry's personality didn't jive with "harem master". If you really want to keep the "keeping the family lines separate" trope, then I think that holding it to only 2 wives would have felt more in character for that Harry.
