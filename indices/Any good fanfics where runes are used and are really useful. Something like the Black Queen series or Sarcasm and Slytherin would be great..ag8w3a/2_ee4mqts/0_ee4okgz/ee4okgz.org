That story has outstandingly good and rather bad/bland aspects. The whole mentor/mother relationship with Babbling is the best I have read so far, with nothing even coming close to it. And the twists regarding Lily are nice as well. But the whole "pureblood culture" arc with Tracy and Daphne was just bad and a badly disguised attempt at justifying a harem when "we were horny, had a four-way and ended up caring for each other" would have done the trick. And Harry's interactions with Tonks and Fleur can be very "white knight-y", which is not a good thing.
