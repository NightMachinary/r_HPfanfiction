Hi there. Thanks for the critique!

I agree that first conversation was a bit forced- I was writing at great speed.

Desmond Scott was named after the Anglican Ministers, Desmond Tutu and Ted Scott. I imagined he'd be named at the hospital he was eventually brought to. (I may exposition that.)

I like the idea of some foreshadowing for the dream. Perhaps have Sister Olive mention the child insisted on going there once, and comment on his independence.

When I was eleven, I used to ride city busses all the time to get from one town to the next, going to the library and such- but that might just be my experience growing up (I grew up in Israel, and kids tend to mature a lot quicker and have a lot more freedom there.) I also assume that this Harry would be a lot more independent and used to doing for himself.

I agree that having more conflict by not having Snape be at home at Spinner's End would add some nice tension, rather than Harry just finding him there. Perhaps I'll have Harry find him on Knockturn Alley, working at an Apothecary.

I'm not going to edit what I've written too heavily, as that's anathema for NaNo month. But I will refer back to this comment when I am ready for that stage. I'll also reply again when I've got a more complete story.

Thank you for the feedback on this! Very much appreciated.
