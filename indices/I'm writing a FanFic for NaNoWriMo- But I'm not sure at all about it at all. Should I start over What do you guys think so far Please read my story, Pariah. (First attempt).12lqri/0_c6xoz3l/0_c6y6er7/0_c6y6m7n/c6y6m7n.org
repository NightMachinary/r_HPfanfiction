  I may exposition that.

I always love brief author's notes and the end of chapters. If, in your final posting/draft, you gave a short explanation as to why Desmond was chosen, I as a reader would probably would be more accepting! haha.

  Perhaps have Sister Olive mention the child insisted on going there once, and comment on his independence.
#+end_quote

Yes, something like this would be great! It gives you more time to flesh out his childhood a bit, which would be good since you've put Harry in a semi-Tom-like situation. Also, maybe I was just a sheltered child. d: I was rather shy as well. But I think Sister Olive mentioning his independence (and implicitly accepting his independence) would would make his travels more believable.

  I'm not going to edit what I've written too heavily, as that's anathema for NaNo month.
#+end_quote

Good for you! Keep writing on, and save the editing for after November for sure. I commend you for doing this. And I'd be very interested in seeing how things turn out, so do reply! I'd appreciate that a lot. (: Good luck!
