  Hey fellow Snape fan!

Hello! Some people on this site can be rather odd about their disliking of him. As though liking his character makes you a bad person, when it doesn't. I just like characters like him. Plenty of people enjoy asshole type of characters.

Don't get me wrong, I can understand perfectly well why people don't like, or even hate Snape, but still rather unfortunate that they sometimes judge you, if you like him.
