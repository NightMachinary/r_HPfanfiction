that's fine I'm not worried about downvotes lol. The point I was and am trying to make with this post is that this is a romance fic with a lot to offer besides romance and trying to give it exposure to an audience which would have normally passed it over due to the fluffy story summary.

As far as being vague about it being Harry/Fleur I kind of figured it was implied with “Flower” and her being the second character after Harry.

But believe it or not, a lot of people on the subreddit will actually pass over fics just for being romance-centric, which I get, sometimes you have to be in a mood.
