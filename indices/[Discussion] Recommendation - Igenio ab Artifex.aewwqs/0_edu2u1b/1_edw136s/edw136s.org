This is a good example of how not to write a summary.

#+begin_quote
  Everything has to start somewhere, and this is where my story begins, my love; where our story begins.
#+end_quote

No clue of who tf is speaking here, or who he's speaking to.

#+begin_quote
  Know that I will never forget my roots
#+end_quote

Is he/she a tree? Actually a sentient tree would be cool.

#+begin_quote
  and that magical night
#+end_quote

If you're a magic user, aren't all nights magical? Or perhaps this refers to the night Voldemort attacked the Potters.

#+begin_quote
  The story of a love between a broken prodigy and a beaten down flower
#+end_quote

From this I get that the "broken flower" is probably Fleur? But in canon Fleur was not "beaten down" and Harry (if the broken prodigy part refers to him) was not broken, nor a prodigy, so all that stuff exists only in this story... so this part refers to things that only someone who has already read the story can deduce.

#+begin_quote
  of a war between two prodigies
#+end_quote

The only two prodigies that exist in canon are teenage Tom Riddle and young Albus Dumbledore. Hermione and Snape probably come close but don't make the cut.

#+begin_quote
  a boy burdened by fate and a monster with hidden faces
#+end_quote

Harry and Dark!Tonks?

#+begin_quote
  of a family of misfits
#+end_quote

Weasleys or Blacks?

To summarize the above, the only thing one gains from reading the summary is confusion. People don't like feeling confused, so they probably give the story a pass.
