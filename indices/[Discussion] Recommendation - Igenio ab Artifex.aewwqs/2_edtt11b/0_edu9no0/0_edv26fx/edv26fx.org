Awesome, I love hearing directly from the author about it like this. Thanks for replying!

Mind answering a few more?

1) How many "books" do you expect this story take to completely finish?

2) Will each "book" contain a relatively standalone story arc (like Canon), or will it be more of a single overarching story split up by year simply to make it more approachable?
