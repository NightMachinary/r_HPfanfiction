I think 3 books or however I end up signifying the three main plots will suffice for the story, though the last one will be the shortest.

Each 'book' will have a single story arc but I plan to deviate from the canon quite a bit and even throw in a small CoS type adventure/mystery to propel the character arc.

Thank you for the questions! And feel free to ask any time.

Ps: I have published a new chapter if you'd like to check it out.
