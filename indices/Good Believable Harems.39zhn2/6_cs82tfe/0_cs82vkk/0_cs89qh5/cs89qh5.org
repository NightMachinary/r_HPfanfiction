Ymmv with this story, the set up is extraordinarily weak, with the author literally using divine intervention anytime anyone questions the harem. Hermione and Daphne also completely lose their characters and just become Harry's yes-women very quickly. Harry also is in complete control of his life, including giving massive long speeches to wizards about how terrible they all are. Personally I found the story painfully weak and disappointing, but give it a shot.
