Any time this story is mentioned, I'm reminded of a scene in the West Wing episode 'Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc':

#+begin_quote
  Sam Seaborn: About a week ago I accidentally slept with a prostitute.

  Toby Ziegler: [pause] Really?

  Sam Seaborn: Yes.

  Toby Ziegler: You accidentally slept with a prostitute?

  Sam Seaborn: A call girl.

  Toby Ziegler: Accidentally?

  Sam Seaborn: Yes.

  Toby Ziegler: I don't understand. Did you trip over something?
