I really, really want there to be negative consequences of the girls dumping this on him. He's the textbook example of an abused child, was a soldier in a war at 17, and is facing huge life decisions with no family to back him up. I want him to absolutely cave when he finds out about the impending harem. Something in his mind just goes "they all love me but I can only love one of them therefore most of them will hate me [and/or] I'm not good enough" and that is the absolute most horrific thought he's ever had, and he has a complete meltdown. Of course, I've worked with children with Down Syndrome, one with severe non-autism/abuse related anxiety, abused kids, and many with Autism Spectrum Disorders, and you really can't put those types of meltdowns into words and properly convey the visuals or emotions. Even adult PTSD episodes are hard to describe. Still, 98% of harem stories end with "oh alright, this will do." and happy-ever-afters. Boo, I say, boo.
