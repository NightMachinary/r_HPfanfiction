My point was not that I don't want it to ever be a happily-ever-after, I just meant that it generally goes "Oh shit, I guess I have a harem." directly to the happily ever after with the only hiccups being a couple well placed right hooks to Ron, Dumbledore, and Rita Skeeter. Never any signs of regret or jealousy or disagreements. Most of them just write all of that off by involving some sort of bond where those feelings are magically prevented or contract where they're legally forced to give up those feelings. The Stockholm Syndrome is kind of icky. Plus they almost always wind up with all of the girls being perfectly okay having sex with each other or being in bed with the boy while they're having sex with another girl. That's kinda demeaning.

The only one that didn't have those that I can think of off the top of my head isn't even a "harem" as its only two: Heart and Soul by Sillimaure.
