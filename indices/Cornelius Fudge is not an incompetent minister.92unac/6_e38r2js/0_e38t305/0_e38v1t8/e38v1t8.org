  He had no reason to believe he had returned. There was no evidence. For all he knows, Cedric might have been killed by an imposter.

No reason? Other than the man he had trusted to advise him telling him so, along with a former Death Eater (whom he had once gone as far to try and honour-who was also able to show him the mark as evidence) and Harry-someone he has met and knows. He should have at the /very least/ taken Dumbledore's suggestion semi-seriously and undertaken a full investigation.

Certainly, at the latter escape of the Death Eaters to continue to deny Voldemort's return is borderline idiotic.

  A man returned from the dead? Yeah, I'd make sure to try to kill him again. He likely used the darkest of magic. That is what Fudge was likely thinking.

Fudge once again showed his cowardice. He had McGonagall and Severus Snape at his side, two of the most powerful characters in the story, both second only to the likes of Voldemort and Dumbledore. He could have waited long enough to at least hear the testimony and record it.

  And how do you know that?

He doesn't sound like he believes it, he's just doing what he thinks will keep him in power:

  “Look at it from my point of view,” said Fudge, fidgeting with his bowler. “I'm under a lot of pressure. Got to be seen to be doing some- thing. If it turns out it wasn't Hagrid, he'll be back and no more said. But I've got to take him. Got to. Wouldn't be doing my duty ---” “Take me?” said Hagrid, who was trembling. “Take me where?” “For a short stretch only,” said Fudge, not meeting Hagrid's eyes. “Not a punishment, Hagrid, more a precaution. If someone else is caught, you'll be let out with a full apology ---”
