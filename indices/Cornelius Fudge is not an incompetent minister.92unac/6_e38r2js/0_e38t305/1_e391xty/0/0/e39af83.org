There's also the (admittedly, post-canon) info that a lot of people expected that Harry was a Dark Lord as well--how else would he have survived? Clearly we know why but horror and tends to surround Harry. The general populace did not, however. If you can believe an infant is a vessel of future intense dark magic then why not believe he killed his classmate in a competition for glory and lots of money?

I feel like those who know Harry should have believed him but I understand his grief. It's easy to lash out.
