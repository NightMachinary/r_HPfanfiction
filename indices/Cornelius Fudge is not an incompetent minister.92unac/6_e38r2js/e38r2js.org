Fudge started out as potentially a very good minister.

But his determination to deny Voldemort's return and paint Harry and Dumbledore as mad is a cowardly move-as is his decision to jail Hagrid. He was too swayed by the likes of Lucius and fear.

Dumbledore did have evidence and Fudge essentially killed Barry Crouch Jr rather then hear it. Fudge was in denial-he did believe that Voldemort had returned but didn't want to face that reality (as fairly terrifying as it is-notably Scrimgeour did die as minister).

Jailing Hagrid is a cowardly decision. Fudge knows as well as anyone that Hagrid hadn't been doing it. If he didn't believe in it, then there's other options-outside of jailing him-that would have worked. The decision in the original expelling is that Hagrid had unwillingly exposed Hogwarts to dangerous creatures (entirely true), if that's the case again-what creature? what can they do to get rid of it? But Fudge didn't ever want to put his head on the line (figuratively and quite literally later on).

Fudge is pretty believable person at the end of the day, he's not meant to be evil or bad, just cowardly and ambitious.
