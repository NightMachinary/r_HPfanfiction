Fudge is based off of Neville Chamberlain, who is one of the most hated British Prime Ministers of all time, because of his policy of appeasement to Hitler and Nazi Germany. Honestly I can see where Chamberlain was coming from. WW1, the bloodiest and most devastating war of all time, had ended just decades prior, and he was understandably terrified of getting Britain into another war. This isn't to say that he wasn't incompetent though. It was pretty clear at that point that Germany would not stop at Poland and Austria and Czech. He was far too concerned with keeping the peace and the status quo rather than making the hard decisions that were right for the country. Like Fudge, he was soon replaced with a competent wartime PM.
