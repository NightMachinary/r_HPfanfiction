There was no evidence for Hagrids imprisonment. Also since when its the job of the executive (and lucius?) To apprehend a criminal?. It should have been an Auror, and foloow procedure and investigations.

Most of your arguments are not that strong.

Its like the prime minister showing up to make an arrest. And not giving him a trial... and not investigating...

Barty Crouch execution, same example its not his job, at most it should have been Amelia Bones's or Scrimgeour's.

See the pattern?
