From Sirius's explanation in book 4, we know that the legal system in wizarding Britain functioned about the same as the muggle one until the war with Voldemort, at which point Crouch Sr. used the desperation of the populace as an excuse to get rid of many of the legal checks and balances that protect human rights.

  â€œWell, times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others. Crouch's principles might've been good in the beginning --- I wouldn't know. He rose quickly through the Ministry, and he started ordering very harsh measures against Voldemort's supporters. The Aurors were given new powers --- powers to kill rather than capture, for instance. And I wasn't the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial. Crouch fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects. I would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark Side."

Crouch basically implemented a corrupt form of martial law. Under his leadership, the police could kill without proving any wrong doing (sound like something that's a big deal in America right now?). Anyone, guilty or innocent, could be given a lifetime sentence in prison without trial. and torture was allowed against captives.

After the war was over, the checks and balances were never put back in place. As a result, corrupt and self-serving politicians like Fudge could kill or incarcerate innocent people with impunity.
