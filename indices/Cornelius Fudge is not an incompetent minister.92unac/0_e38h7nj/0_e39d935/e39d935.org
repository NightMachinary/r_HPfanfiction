I'd argue that it's irrelevant whether or not Fudge believed in Hagrid's guilt.

In the muggle world only corrupt and tyrannical governments incarcerate people without first giving them a trail. Remember that Hagrid wasn't just put in a holding cell: he was sent directly to Azkaban where he would suffer what the Muggle world would consider "cruel and unusual punishment."
