Hmm, never actually stated if he is or isn't. He has quite obviously surrounded himself with people who are (Lucius Malfoy, Dolores Umbridge and so on) so he might as well be.

And that's actually a valid point, if it worked to expel Hagrid once before then logic says that it should work again. Though one would wonder why Hagrid would wait all those years at Hogwarts and just suddenly decide to continue killing people...
