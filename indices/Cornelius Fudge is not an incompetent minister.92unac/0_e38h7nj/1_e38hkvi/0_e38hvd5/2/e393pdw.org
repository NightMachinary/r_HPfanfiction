Here's what I don't get- if there's enough evidence to expel Hagrid, why not put him in jail? Someone died!

But if there's not enough evidence to show he did it, why expel him?

Does the wizarding world really scale punishment up based on the amount of evidence there is? So if there's only a little evidence, and they're only 10% sure he committed a crime, give him 10% of the punishment?
