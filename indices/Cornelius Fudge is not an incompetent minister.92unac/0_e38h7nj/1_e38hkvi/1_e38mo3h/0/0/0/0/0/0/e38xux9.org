That's /differing opinions/ on what's canon, not "dubious". They make their position on the matter very clear; it's not as though they /claim/ that they're only calling Rowling's word canon, and /then/ add a lot of game or movie info.

I, for one, fully share their notion of canon, and knowingly.

Concerning the Disarming Charm, it seems someone got his levels of canon confused, and I'll go see what can be done about that.
