That it's from an old CoS game doesn't make it not-canon by default. To say it is not canon, you must prove that there is a claim from a /higher/ source of canon (the hierarchy is "Rowling (interviews + books) > movies > games & alt") which contradicts it. This will be easy in this case, but you /must/ do it, on the talk page.
