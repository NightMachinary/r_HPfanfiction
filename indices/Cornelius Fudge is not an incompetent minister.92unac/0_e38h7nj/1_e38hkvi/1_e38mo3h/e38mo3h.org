Do we know for sure if Hagrid /didn't/ have any Slytherin blood? The Wizarding World is small enough, and the original Professor Slytherin old enough, that it's likely most every non-Muggle-born wizard is related to him in some way.

As for whether Fudge was a blood-purist, it's complicated. He wasn't a hardcore bigot, and didn't /despise/ Muggle-borns like the Death Eaters did (nor did he have anything against half-bloods to a meaningful degree). But he was "old-fashioned", influence by the general wizarding snobbery. e.g. he wouldn't deny a Muggle-born a high-level position if they proved capable, but he would consider it "an unusual achievement, considering his ¨cough cough¨ parentage" (only to change the subject if someone like Dumbledore asked precisely what he meant by that).
