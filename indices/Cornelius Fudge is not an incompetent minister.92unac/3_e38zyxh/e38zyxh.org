I don't read Fudge as incompetent. The most incompetent things about his term are the fact that he kept pestering Dumbledore with questions for his first couple years, and setting dementors to guard Hogwarts. The main problem with Fudge is that he is /corrupt/, and gets more /corrupt/ as time goes on.

In Book 2, Fudge jails Hagrid without trial just to score political points. To be sure, there are serious questions about Hagrid from the public's perspective, but those questions should have been aired out decades ago when Dumbledore hired him. Why would Dumbledore hire an underage boy as caretaker who had /just/ been expelled for a good reason (illegally keeping a class XXXXX creature on school grounds) and was under suspicion for killing a student?

Fudge is being sensible--competent--in wanting Hagrid off school grounds. But he's being corrupt in shipping him straight to Azkaban instead of putting him on trial. He's also being sensible in disagreeing with Malfoy about Dumbledore leaving. Note that he still more or less likes and trusts Dumbledore at this point.

In Book 3, putting dementors around Hogwarts was a very poor decision, which may be a sign of incompetence. Yes, Fudge trusts them to obey the Ministry absolutely, but everyone ought to know that dementors should not be allowed around children. Also, Black escaped them before, so how would they help. Even if we allow this, the fact that he left them there after they attacked the Quidditch match makes him look very incompetent.

Other than this, though, I still say it's corruption. It's true that Fudge has no evidence for Harry's claims. He might not even know that Sirius was sent to Azkaban without trial. (It's plausible that only Barty Crouch knows that.) But Dumbledore believes Harry, and when a distinguished national hero like Dumbledore makes a claim like that, one whom Fudge himself considered an important advisor a year ago, it's a good idea to take a second look at the case. Fudge refuses to listen because it would reflect poorly on his administration now, especially after the Dementor mess, and on his handling of the case back in 1981.

I would also draw attention to what I think is the most telling quote about Fudge in the whole series:

#+begin_quote
  "Good gracious, Minister, he isn't trying to rejoin You-Know-Who, is he?"

  "I daresay that's his--er--eventual plan," said Fudge evasively. "But we hope to catch Black long before that. I must say, You-Know-Who alone and friendless is one thing...but give him back his most devoted servant, and I shudder to think how quickly he'll rise again..."
#+end_quote

In Book 3, Fudge believes that Voldemort is still out there! In light of this, that he changes his tune when it actually happens is even more alarming.

In Book 4, it's a little harder to determine his motives in regard to Barty Crouch Jr. Why did he bring a Dementor with him when he visited the castle? Was he truly that afraid of an Azkaban escapee? Or was he /intending/ Barty to get Kissed. I tend to think it's the latter. McGonagall said the Dementor attacked Barty immediately upon entering the room. If that was not Fudge's intent, he should have been far more alarmed by the Dementor disobeying his orders, and yet he still insists on the Ministry's absolute control over the Dementors in Book 5.

It's possible that Fudge was simply implementing his Kiss on Sight policy for Azkaban escapees, but seeing as he had to know that Barty was a critical witness in the death of a student, there was good reason to keep him alive, and besides, if that was what he was doing, why go up to the school on the premise of interrogating him? Was it because Barty Jr's testimony or his even being alive would hurt his administration by ruining the reputation of Barty Sr?

Finally, his denial of Voldemort's return. Again, he changed his beliefs from Book 3. Why? Yes, there's no physical evidence. Yes, as far as he knows, it's impossible to return from the dead. Yes, as far as he knows, Dumbledore is old and possibly senile. But he doesn't go to any of those explanations. Instead, he accuses Dumbledore of trying to steal his job! That strongly suggests something more sinister than mere disbelief.

Similarly, he doesn't try to give Harry equal treatment despite his celebrity status at his trial. He goes out of his way to railroad Harry into being expelled, calling in the full Wizengamot and changing the time at the last minute.

So no, I don't believe Fudge's actions are those of an incompetent man. But they are also not the actions of a competent man who is trying to do the right thing. To me, they show deep corruption in his administration, completely independent of everything Malfoy and Umbridge do.
