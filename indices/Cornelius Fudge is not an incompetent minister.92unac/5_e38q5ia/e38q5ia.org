Arresting Hagred could be a sensible move, but note sending him to Azkaban or not making any effort to investigate what was happening.

The same at the end of book 4, not believing Harry is understandable but refusing to investigate someone's death isn't. And remember that Cedric was a pureblood who's father worked in the Ministry. At that point he's either corrupt or incompetent.
