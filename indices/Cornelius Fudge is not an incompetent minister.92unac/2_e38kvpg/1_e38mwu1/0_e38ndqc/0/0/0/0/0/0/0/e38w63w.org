  it wouldn't be proof that Fudge is incompetent. All that would make him is gullible.

A nation leader who's that gullible and self-centered is /de facto/ incompetent at being a nation leader.

  You really think Fudge is that bad? I mean he ran the ministry for years.
#+end_quote

Yes, I /do/ think he's that bad. Or, rather, that clueless. I don't think Fudge is fundamentally dumb, but I think he's too self-centered and small-minded to really be able to handle being "the man at the top" in a crisis. He was fine as a mid-level bureaucrat, but got elected Minister even though /he/ didn't even think he stood a chance (with his prospected opponent being Dumbledore), and, at that point, lost it, trying to keep appearances while relying entirely on other people's advice.

At first it was Dumbledore's (through the letters we see him get bombarded with from Fudge), hence why the Wizarding World mostly didn't fall apart for the first few years; but then Fudge's fearful nature took over, he worried that Dumbledor was just manipulating him for his own end, and he started listening to the advice of his old school friend Lucius, and of his ever-so-charming and loyal Undersecretary Dolores, and of those nice Msr Jugson, Rosier and Macnair...

Result: 2nd Wizarding War.
