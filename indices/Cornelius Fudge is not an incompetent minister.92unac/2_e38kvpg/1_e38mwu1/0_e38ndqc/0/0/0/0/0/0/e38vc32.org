The important thing there is Umbridge handing Fudge the flowchart. I didn't consider it could be possible before because there's nothing in canon that really points to that as what really happened. It's supposition. But even if it's true, it wouldn't be proof that Fudge is incompetent. All that would make him is gullible.

MY feeling is that Fudge actually knows how to do his job, and Malfoy (and maybe Umbridge) acts more like devils on his shoulder rather than puppeteers who actually have him bound by strings.

Is there anything in the books that you think would be proof that Hagrid would actually be as good a MoM as Fudge? You really think Fudge is that bad? I mean he ran the ministry for years.
