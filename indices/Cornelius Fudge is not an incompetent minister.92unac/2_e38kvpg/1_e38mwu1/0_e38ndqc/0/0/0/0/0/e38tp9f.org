My feeling with both Umbridge and Malfoy is that they're manipulating him very skillfully, both pretending to be nothing but a loyal subaltern and a friend. Umbridge may even doublethink that Fudge /really/ is in charge, but she's more than happy to "act in his best interest" behind his back.

One must remember that there's little question Malfoy is bribing Fudge (in a way he likely plays off as gifts between friends, but Fudge, a Slytherin, probably sees past /that/). Fudge considers Malfoy a friend more than willing to help out with whatever /he/ needs as long as the Ministry does him a few favors along the way. So first, over a series of friendly talks, Malfoy (and Umbridge, and any number of other "Imperiused" Death Eaters and sympathizers) convince him that Dumbledore is /definitely/ out for /his/ job and needs ousting. Then Fudge begins to ponder the specifics, and panics, because he has no idea how to achieve this. Then Umbridge, with a modest smile, hands him a nice flowchart of what to do, and Malfoy very kindly slips Fudge the necessary galleons for his little "enterprise of mutual interest to him, to Malfoy, and to the Wizarding World at large".

And I am entirely convinced that if Evil-Hagrid's circle of friends was also reversed --- if an evil Dumbledore was in Malfoy's place, and an evil McGonagall in Umbridge's, say --- you could very well have gotten identical results.
