You mean Fudge as an actual puppet of Malfoy and Umbridge? Well, it's possible but I personally think that's unlikely.

Umbridge for one was in Hogwarts for most of 5th year and she's very deferent to Fudge.

Malfoy on the other hand was not a ministry employee. He had no authority to do anything official. Also he couldn't really afford to over-step his relationship with fudge because in Fudge's understanding he's a just a "friend", a benefactor working for the good of the wizarding world. More than likely Malfoy is just there to steer Fudge in directions beneficial to him. He can't have been actually doing Fudge's job for him.

All I'm saying is Fudge is far from incompetent. Imagine for a second Hagrid was actually evil. Put him in place as MoM and have him do the smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore. Do you think Hagrid would do a good job at it? No, because Hagrid would've actually been *incompetent* at that job. As a comparison, Fudge is far from that.
