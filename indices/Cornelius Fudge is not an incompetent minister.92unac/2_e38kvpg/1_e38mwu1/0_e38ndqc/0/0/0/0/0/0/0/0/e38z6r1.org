  A nation leader who's that gullible and self-centered is de facto incompetent at being a nation leader.

I agree. I've said before he's not a very good leader. Only that he's not an incompetent politician.

All the things you've mentioned makes him a bad leader, specially for wartime because he cracks easily under pressure. But that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying he's not incompetent at being a /politician/. He can pull strings, he can handle all the bureaucracy, the bribes and political factions all that stuff. That's why he was able to pass all those Educational decrees and practically supress and silence the media to an extent. Give me solid proof that Fudge can't do these things himself.

You say all those are Malfoy and Umbridge puppeteering. That's supposition.

  At first it was Dumbledore's (through the letters we see him get bombarded with from Fudge)

That's also supposition. All I remember reading is Albus gave him /advice/ from time to time. Doesn't mean he ran the whole bureaucracy in his stead. There's nothing bad about getting advice.
