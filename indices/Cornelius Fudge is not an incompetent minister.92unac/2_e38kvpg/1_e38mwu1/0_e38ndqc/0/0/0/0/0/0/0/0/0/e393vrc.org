Say what you will about the rest (it is more up to interpretation, though I always thought from first reading that the implication of the "keeps asking Dumbledore for advice" thing was that Fudge was a hypocrite who bragged that he was much better than Dumbledore at ruling the country, but actually had no clue what to do and had to ask Dumbledore as politely as he could), but I find it extremely clear that the Educational Decrees were /Umbridge/'s idea, politely ratified by Fudge; they furthered /her/ scheme more than his.
