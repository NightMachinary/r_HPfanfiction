They probably meant incompetent as a leader as opposed to a politician. When you look at it that way, he's not a very good leader because he let his insecurities and fear affect his duties, to disastrous results.

When people say he's incompetent they probably meant all of what he did in book 5

#+begin_quote
  Him disbelieving the rise of Voldemort.

  Neither Dumbledore nor Harry had any actual evidence.

A good leader would investigate. Actually, any leader in his right mind would investigate first. Fudge just immediately buried his head in sand. He got so scared he got Barty Jr. kissed on the spot, which is one of the most irritating things he did in the series. It took away all the information they could've gotten from one of Voldemort's closest operators.

So yeah, he's not an incompetent politician, but I'd consider him an incompetent leader considering what he did in book 5.
