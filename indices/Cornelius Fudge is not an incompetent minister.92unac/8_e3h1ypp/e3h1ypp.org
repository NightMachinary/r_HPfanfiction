You also claim that Dementors was a good argument. Really?

Let's bring it to non magic context... Its like placing Lions(any dangerous creature) to guard a school.

There are many many reasons why NOT to put dementors in a school of children who can't defend themseleves.

Put Aurors, or Hit Wizards.

If you are specifically worried about Black going after Harry you put only him in place.

Hell you can use a polyjuiced Auror as a bait.

Anything /but/ dangerous creatures.

You are just excusing Fudge by his political decisions, but their /execution/ its humongously horrible.

Yes he has to so something, but he does the most amazingly stupid things.
