Wha?

Seriously, no!

At best he is a partially competent (and I'd debate that!) peace-time minister, but he's a miserable excuse for a leader in war!

Hell, his denial of Voldemort's return (he could have had Harry questioned under veritaserum or watched the memories in a pensive!)? Criminal negligence if not outright treason!

ps: "But Harry's memories could have been manipulated/he could have seen an illusion" - I bet that that can be checked (have someone legilimence him!) and even if not:

Best to be safe than sorry! If nothing happened you can still say that the recall of all retired aurors etc. was "a training exercise" because "It won't do that we become sloppy like before/during the last war!"
