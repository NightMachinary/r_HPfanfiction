Actually, no. I think you've forgotten about the scene in PoA when Rosmerta, McGonagall, Hagrid and Fudge are all having a drink in the bar (see below.) In Book 3 at least it's general knowledge that Voldemort isn't fully dead...and will be back.

/“But what do you think he's broken out to do?” said Madam/

/Rosmerta. “Good gracious, Minister, he isn't trying to rejoin You-/

/Know-Who, is he?”/

/“I daresay that is his --- er --- eventual plan,” said Fudge eva-/

/sively. “But we hope to catch Black long before that. I must say,/

/You-Know-Who alone and friendless is one thing . . . but give him/

/back his most devoted servant, and I shudder to think how quickly/

/he'll rise again. . . .”/
