Fudge's government doesn't function like a peace-time government. By muggle standards his administration is corrupt and tyrannical.

In book 2 he presides over [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indefinite_detention_without_trial][indefinite incarceration without trial]] with an additional side of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment][cruel and unusual punishment]].

  “Take me?” said Hagrid, who was trembling. “Take me where?”

  “For a short stretch only,” said Fudge, not meeting Hagrid's eyes. “Not a punishment, Hagrid, more a precaution. If someone else is caught, you'll be let out with a full apology ---”

  ...

  “Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days, Hagrid,” said Mr. Malfoy. “I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that. They won't like it at all.”

In book 3 he attempts to commit [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_execution][summary execution]] of a man who had been incarcerated indefinitely without trial.

  “The Kiss will be performed immediately?”

  "As soon as Macnair returns with the dementors. This whole Black affair has been highly embarrassing. I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to informing the Daily Prophet that we've got him at last."

In book 4 he was directly involved in the summary execution of Bartemius Crouch Jr, thereby denying Crouch's victims justice and silencing his testimony regarding Voldemort's return.

  “The moment that --- that thing entered the room,” she screamed, pointing at Fudge, trembling all over, “it swooped down on Crouch and --- and ---”

  Harry felt a chill in his stomach as Professor McGonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened. He did not need her to finish her sentence. He knew what the dementor must have done. It had administered its fatal Kiss to Barty Crouch. It had sucked his soul out through his mouth. He was worse than dead.

  “By all accounts, he is no loss!” blustered Fudge. “It seems he has been responsible for several deaths!”

  “But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore. He was staring hard at Fudge, as though seeing him plainly for the first time. “He cannot give evidence about why he killed those people.”

In book 5 he breaks the law by ordering the confiscation of a minor's wand without first proving wrongdoing. He then orchestrates the trial of said minor while attempting to deny the defendant access to a lawyer and the benefit of witness testimony.

  “The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students, Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August,” said Dumbledore. “Nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven, again, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August. In your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself.”

  “Laws can be changed,” said Fudge savagely.

  “Of course they can,” said Dumbledore, inclining his head. “And you certainly seem to be making many changes, Cornelius. Why, in the few short weeks since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot, it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic!”

Also in book 5, Fudge's administration enacted a broad reaching campaign of state censorship and propaganda.

#+begin_quote
  "What's more, the Ministry's leaning heavily on the Daily Prophet not to report any of what they're calling Dumbledore's rumor-mongering, so most of the Wizarding community are completely unaware anything's happened, and that makes them easy targets for the Death Eaters if they're using the Imperius Curse.”

  ...

  “Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry if they started shooting their mouths off,” said Sirius.

All told, Fudge's crimes before and during year 4 are horrific breaches of human rights. His corruption in year 5 onward is just the icing on the cake.
