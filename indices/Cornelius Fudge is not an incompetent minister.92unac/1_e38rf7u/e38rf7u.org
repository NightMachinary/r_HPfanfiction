That is all well done analysis however Fudge is at best a peace time minister. JKR modeled Fudge on Chamberlain aka the Prime Minister who thought appeasement would stop the Nazis: [[https://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/j-k-rowling-talks-cornelius-fudge-in-new-interview-53897/]]

Fudge prior to the end of year 4 is fine I dislike him but he is doing his job but then at the end of year 4 he decides to bury his head in the sand rather than accept the possibility that the 'darkest wizard of all time' managed to cheat death.
