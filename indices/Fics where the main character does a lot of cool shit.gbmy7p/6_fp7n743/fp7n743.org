Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

So, Malfoy's hosting a Death Eater recruitment ball? Plastic explosives are easily duplicated, so let's blow it up! Brutal war with plenty of cool explosions.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Harry and Ron are aurors, catching escaped Death Eaters and trying to figure out who the mysterious thieves are. Meanwhile Hermione and Sirius do politics to reduce corruption, and on occasion they break into the manors of their political opponents and steal everything they can. Every heist a new challenge, a new strategy, a new action scene.
