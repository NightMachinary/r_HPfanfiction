(assuming you're talking to me - I wrote the snippet but you responded to the prompt itself)

I've responded with little snippets like this to various prompts on here, and I'm currently outlining a full-length fic based on the same "Harry is an owl animagus and a wholesome nugget" concept that this prompt uses. That one isn't actually written yet but I'll probably be posting it to AO3 if I ever get around to writing it.

Other prompts I've responded to, or started out with little fic-lets:
