Thank you.

With Nagini in crimes of Grindelwald being shown having the maledictus blood curse when I read this it just popped in my head. Plus provides potential plot with Harry slowly getting stuck as an owl as well or eventually breaking the curse and now Lily is back.

Edit: realized after posting that the curse passes from mother to daughter. But its fanfic so that can be adjusted
