I am kind of toying with the idea of writing a full-length fic along these lines - Harry being an owl animagus, lighthearted tone a la Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay (I plan on part of the conflict centering around leftover Death Eaters and dark artifacts, but Voldemort himself having permanently died the first time), and a lot of interaction of this kind between Harry and Hedwig. I have some very, /very/ rough notes ready.
