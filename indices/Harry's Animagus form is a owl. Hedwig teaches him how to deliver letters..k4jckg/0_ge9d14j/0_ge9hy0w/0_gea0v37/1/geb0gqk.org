I'm surprised I don't see more of this. Presumably it was more popular before the horcrux reveal, but it's such an obvious way to make room for telling your own story.

Even fics that largely do their own thing will still end with a few "oh yeah and lemme take care of those horcruxes real quick" chapters.
