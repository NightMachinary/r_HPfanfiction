There was a very short, unfortunately long abandoned fic about James giving Harry some sort of animagus potion before the attack and as a result shortly after being dropped off he turns into an owl. It'd be neat to see another one in that direction. Except of course chances are until he turned 11 he'd have no idea he was a human, but that could be interesting as well. If you do ever end up writing that I'll be sure to give it a look
