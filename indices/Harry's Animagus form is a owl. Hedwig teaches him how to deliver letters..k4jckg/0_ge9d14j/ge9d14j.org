On the various perches in the Owlery of Hogwarts, many owls were hooting.

Two in particular, Snowy Owls both, were hooting back-and-forth, each having a letter tied to its talon. If anyone were there, they'd notice that the owls almost seemed to be in conversation. A particularly observant viewer would notice that one of the owls had round, glasses-like markings around its eyes, and it had a distinctive lightning-bolt shaped mark on its forehead.

One of those owls was, in fact, Harry James Potter. Harry had just gotten the hang of flying, and was now being taught by his faithful companion how to use the seventh-sense that magically-bred owls had to always find the recipient of their letters.

"No, Harry. That's your hunting instincts telling you there's a nest of mice at that spot in the grounds. The castle is to the west, not the south, remember?"

Hedwig nipped Harry's head gently, in the spot where his ears would be if he were human. She'd always done that, as a way of showing affection. Harry suspected Hedwig's mothering instincts had always seen the potential for Harry's animagus form, hence why she'd accepted him as if he were her own young - which, at this moment, looked as if it could have actually been the case.

Harry re-focused, tuning out the vague pang of hunger he felt - it was almost dinnertime, students were expected to flock to the Great Hall in little over an hour. He focused on the letter on his talon, bearing the name "Ginny Weasley" - Ginny had just gone through a bad, somewhat-public breakup with Michael Corner and wasn't talking to anyone much, so Harry had written her a letter to cheer her up.

Slowly, his head turned in the direction of Hogwarts Castle. He had a vague sense that it wasn't time yet, that whomever needed this letter wasn't free to get it. His feathers ruffled a bit.

"I see you're getting it. Good, young Padawan. You may have an owl-treat."

Harry didn't know where Hedwig had picked that one up. Must have caught Dudley watching a movie he wasn't supposed to. Dutifully, he flew to the bowl of owl-treats that the House-Elves always kept available to returning owls and snatched up a treat - they were surprisingly delicious in owl-form, and Harry could see why Hedwig liked them so much.

Waiting this way for an hour more, Harry felt his neck-feathers crawl and his wings starting to get ready for a flight. Beside him, Hedwig seemed much calmer, but Harry knew she'd felt the same thing - she was due to deliver a letter to Professor McGonagall, explaining that the Animagus transformation Harry had been working on for extra credit was complete and asking her for a time in which to show it in action.

Together, they flew off towards the castle. Letters to deliver, adventures to have - whether rain, wind, sleet or Snowy Owls.

--------------

This was /fun/. In my head, Harry's Animagus form has always been an owl - a stealthy, usually-nocturnal bird of prey with keen instincts and something of a territorial streak (or a temper). This prompt let me explore that a little, as well as Hedwig's motherly relationship with Harry, so thanks for that.

EDIT1: Owls have talons, not paws.

EDIT2: Snowy owl males have fewer black feathers than females, but Animagi tend to have distinctive markings. I'm making it a little more ambiguous what the scar-marking looks like so the reader is more free to imagine things.
