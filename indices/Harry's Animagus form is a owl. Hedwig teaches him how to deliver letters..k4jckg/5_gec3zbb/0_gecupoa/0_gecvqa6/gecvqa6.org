Unless you going for a crack story - be careful about making a kid too smart or too powerful. Becoming animagi is said to be very complex and dangerous process. While there are few unregistered animagi around - I think the fact that only 7 are officially registered speaks volumes to the difficulty. In canon, people have died or ended horribly disfigured attempting the transformation.

And no decent parent would let a 10yo boy fly off hundreds of miles from home without supervision.

Also please don't cheapen Lily's sacrifice into some parody. Not saying giving away magic can't work, but ... if you want to write a quality story - consider very carefully what that means, how it works. And how exactly is her magic worth more than Harry's life?

As for James - I think it would be out of character for Voldemort to let him live. So to make it canonically more believable - have James visiting Dumbledore that evening or something.

Good luck with your story!
