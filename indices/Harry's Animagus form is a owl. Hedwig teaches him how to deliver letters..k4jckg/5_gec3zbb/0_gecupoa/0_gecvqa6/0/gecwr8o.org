- I'm going for mostly fluffy and light-hearted, bordering on crack at times. Think "Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay" (or the snippet above) in terms of tone, but it's "Harry Is An Owl Animagus, And That's Okay".
- Harry's situation will be rare, but not-unheard-of in children of known Animagi throughout history. I plan on it being a bit of a side-plot where Harry finds out about that, and what makes it work.
- The point about "no decent parent..." is fair. That's why I'm debating it, I haven't decided quite yet. I might just mention the idea and have Lily talk Harry out of it, or have James follow him on a broom (the image I have is of a parent teaching their child to ride a bicycle - eventually you'll have to let go).
- My plan is to give them more forewarning about the Halloween attack, so Lily and James have time to plan ahead and start a complex protective enchantment that would have taken her, James, and Dumbledore to fuel without consequences.\\
- There are consequences long-term - Lily ends up re-upheaving her entire lifestyle (and possibly having mild health issues), she's a pariah in proud-pureblood circles (giving up your magic is a /big/ no-no, but she's a mother first dammit), and James gets fired from the Auror Office through a combination of injury and political reasons. They end up living a mostly-Muggle lifestyle.\\
  As for "how exactly is her magic worth more than Harry's life"... Does it need to be? There's no real concept of equivalent-exchange in canon magic. I could also 'justify' it as a /metaphorical/ life (magical lifestyle, future career etc) for a /literal/ life.
- James does get heavily wounded, if that helps - heavily enough that at the time, Voldemort basically thinks he's inches away from dying and he doesn't need to make sure. I could also have James be fetching Dumbledore at the moment of attack - the story's still in the planning stages for a reason.
