I am officially adopting this idea for my first full-length fic. I'm currently in the outlining phase, planning out OwlAnimagus!Harry's early childhood (he gets his Animagus form via accidental magic. I plan on addressing the normal "potion" method and having Harry's accidental magic latch onto the effects of that potion).

... Debating whether I should have Harry deliver the response to his Hogwarts letter himself, in owl form. I reckon James would think that's a hilarious inside-joke and he's alive in the outline I have (Lily sacrifices her magic instead of her life, James just gets KO'ed and heavily wounded but survives).

EDIT: James would probably follow Harry under the guise of "training the new post owl" if I decide to go through with it.
