Hell yeah, go for it. Rowling didn't exactly establish any rules for her magic system expect for Gamp's law, so this is plausible enough. Plus, the animagus transformation is holding a mandrake leaf in the mouth for a month and taking a fiddly potion, so accidental magic could reasonably do so. Plus it'll be fun and if he's a kid it's super in character!
