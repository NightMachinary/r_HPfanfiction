I'm writing a canon rehash where Lily's ghost accompanies Harry through life. It's a Good Things Happen to Harry fic. Very little teenage drama, since I find that boring, and some of the canon drama is glossed over so I have had a complaint that things are too easy for him.

It's called Well That Just Won't Do - Book 1. I'm working on Book 3 now and update pretty frequently.
