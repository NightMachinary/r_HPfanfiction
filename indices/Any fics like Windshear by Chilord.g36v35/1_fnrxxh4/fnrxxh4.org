Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat)

This fic has good Dursleys who don't abuse Harry and who raised him like their own son. He's blind due to Voldemort's killing curse on Halloween 1981 but somehow gained the ability to see magic and souls. This ability grants him an insight into magic that nobody else has. He also never attended Hogwarts so there's little to no emotional anguish either.
