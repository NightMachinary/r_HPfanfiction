The Former one is pretty much as similar to Wind Shear as it gets.

While the latter is by the same author and has a very similar vibe to it.

While I wouldn't call it 'effortlessly' he is rather powerful. The only emotinal anguish that would stick to these fic's is the usual Harry Potter /I-lost-my-parents/ shtick, but there is no everpresent sadness or depression involved.
