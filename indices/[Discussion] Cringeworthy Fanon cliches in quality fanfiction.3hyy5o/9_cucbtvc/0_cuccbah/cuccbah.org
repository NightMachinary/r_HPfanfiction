The 'magical core' thing really puts me off when it is portrayed as some sort 'glowing anime light in their chest.'

I think a magical core (which definitely needs a new name as to not be mixed up with the one I described above) should be a bit like a muscle, you can excercise it by using it often and it will become more powerful, you barely use magic and it will gradually weaken. Also, maybe casting magic is a good way to burn fat and that is why you barely ever find overweight wizards and witches. Slughorn and Neville were the only two I remember as being even slightly flabby, and Neville had thought he was a squib up 'til that point and Slughorn makes a lot of potions, so maybe he doesn't do as much wand magic?
