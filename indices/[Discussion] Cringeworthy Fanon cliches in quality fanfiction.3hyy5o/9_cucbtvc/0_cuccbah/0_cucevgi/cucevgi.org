The muscle analogy is too one-dimensional.

I think that a better analogy (which I can't take credit for, but I don't remember the source) is that casting a spell is like playing a piece on a musical instrument, but the instrument are the wand and the wizard's mind.

There is no "musical core", but different musicians have different degrees of talent (physical and cognitive) and skill obtained by practice, and they have some control --- within the constraints of their skill --- to play the piece to slightly different effects, and even improvise and modify it on the fly.

Learning to play a particular piece does not contribute to a measurable "skill level", but it does help learn more complex pieces, particularly those that are similar, and this also holds for spells. A sufficiently skilled and talented musician might be able to sight-read a sufficiently simple piece, and a sufficiently skilled and talented wizard might be able to look up a spell description in a book and cast it on the first attempt.

Dark Spells are a bit different in this respect, since they /want/ to be cast and require a merest excuse to cast, which is a part of what makes Dark Arts tempting and dangerous.
