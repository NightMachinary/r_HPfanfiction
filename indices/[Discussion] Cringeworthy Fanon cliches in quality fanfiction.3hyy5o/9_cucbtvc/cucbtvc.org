- "Magical cores" and different wizards at the same age and comparable skill level having vastly different "power levels" (almost always going out of the way to point out how powerful Harry's is) in fics that don't really have a need use that plot device and aren't even /about/ Harry. linkffn(Palimpsest by Larry Huss; For the Only Hope by ausland); linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer) for a rare non-Harry example.
