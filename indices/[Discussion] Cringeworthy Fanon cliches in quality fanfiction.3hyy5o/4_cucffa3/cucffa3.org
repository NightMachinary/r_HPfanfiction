I always cringe at gentleman/chivalrous/classy!Snape. I understand that for most pairings (including many of my favorite pairings) the characters will be a little OOC just by virtue of them getting together but with a lot of Snape/Anyone he becomes a completely different person. And it's always done in the most cringe-worthy ways. He's always all the sudden this amazing dancer who pulls out chairs for "his woman" and dresses in Hugo Boss/Armani/something else super fancy and enjoys candle light dinners and walks on the beach. I guess the real issue is that I see a whole lot of fics where Snape becomes "generic!Tall-Dark-Handsome Romance Novel Man" and it just makes me wanna roll my eyes out of my head.

The other one is the "Slytherin Sex God" trope (and this applies to Snape too!). I don't really see it as often anymore and I'm sure plenty of Slytherins are great lovers but I've just never seen this written in a way that didn't remind me of a cheesy porno!

And finally, any detailed description of what a character is wearing. Mention them throwing on a Weasley sweater? Alright. Go into detail about the micro-mini chrome halter dress with cutouts, fishnet tights, and platform heels Hermione is wearing? Please, no. The worst offender of all this, of course, is all the "Golden Trio (Minus Ron) Goes Goth" fics I used to read when I was 11...
