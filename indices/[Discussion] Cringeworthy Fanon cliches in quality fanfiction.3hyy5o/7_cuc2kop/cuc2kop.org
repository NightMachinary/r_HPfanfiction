To be fair, I'm kinda with [[/u/UndeadBBQ][u/UndeadBBQ]] on this one. I didn't really get the Dan and Emma thing until someone pointed it out and long after I started reading H/Hr. It's become pretty normal at this point, and isn't that unusual if you tend to separate the characters from the actors that played them. You'd be surprised at how long it took me to figure out who all was in Mean Girls, but I never thought of, say, Tina Fey playing the teacher but just the teacher.
