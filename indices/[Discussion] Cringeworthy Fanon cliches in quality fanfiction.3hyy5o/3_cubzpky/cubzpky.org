A sampling of my cringe list:

- Magic is Arthurian and pretentious, magical oaths (the 'so mote it be' kind), life debts, various "bonds" and "family magicks"

- His Lordship Potter

- Family rings

- Animagus form turns out to be a power animal of some kind (mountain lion/regular lion)

- Basilisk animagus form/patronus

- Goblin "culture"

- Wizards are Wiccans

- Catholic Hermione

- Getting married at 15 after 2 months of dating

- Sex is a /huge/ deal (this may just be a cultural thing that I don't get not being from the anglosphere though)

- Molly is a mastermind manipulator

All of these can be found in otherwise quality fics.
