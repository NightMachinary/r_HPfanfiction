I don't know if this makes me a horrible person, but I've got this deep urge that started after I took a crack at the recs on a different thread. The recs turned out to be about how, after Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts, Hermione tries to run and/or hide but she obviously can't succeed on her own merits, so a NotEvil!DeathEater hides her in his domicile, things happen, she becomes pregnant, and sits the rest of the conflict out... The urge is therefore to read /just one/ fic where Hermione finds herself pregnant in the middle of a war, decides that it's not a good time to be pregnant or have a baby, casts /ABORTIFACIO!/, and moves on.

*Edit:* Clarity and sentence structure.
