Recently I found one that makes me cringe. I was reading 'Harry Potter and the Arcana' and I relized I hate it when Harry at 11 years old, overwhelmed by the new magical world his in, finds out his godfather betrayed his parents and immediatly asks about the trial.

Almost never does Harry rage, feel betrayed, or just accept that he is a criminal. He imediatly asks about the trial, even though in real life I have never heard anyone do that. It usually plays across as:

"You remember that guy Cliff from high school?"

"Yeah, how is he doing?"

"Well, he got caught dealing cocaine and is in jail."

Never once is someone's first response: "What are the details of the trial?"
