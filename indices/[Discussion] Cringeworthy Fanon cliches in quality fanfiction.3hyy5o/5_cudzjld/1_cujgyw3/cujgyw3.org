I really liked the latest chapter of linkffn(Sympathetic Properties by Mr Norrell), where Harry's bailiff (sort of inherited from his grandfather) tells him that Sirius Black betrayed the Potters to their deaths but he has a feeling something's odd since he didn't get a trial, and Harry tells him that frankly if all the heads of the government all thought he was guilty at the time, as does everyone else, the bailiff can fuck off with his 'feelings', since it's not like he's ever shown concern about any other prisoner in Azkaban.
