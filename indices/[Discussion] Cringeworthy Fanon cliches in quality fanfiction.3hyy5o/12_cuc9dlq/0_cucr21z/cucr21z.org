For me it just jerks me completely out of any immersion I had in the story. It's like they went on and just said Daniel Radcliffe Granger and Emma Watson Granger. I can't not think of the actors. I don't mind the pairing of H/HR at all, I just don't like to be thinking of the real world when I read.
