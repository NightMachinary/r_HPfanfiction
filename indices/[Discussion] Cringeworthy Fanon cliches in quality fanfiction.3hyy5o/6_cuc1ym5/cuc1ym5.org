I've just read Equal and Opposite by Amerision. A mostly great fic but it has a few annoying cliches such as LovePotion!Ginny. It gets a pass though because:

- The few cliches are relatively minor parts of the story.

- It's an otherwise great story.

- It's 9 years old so they probably weren't cliches at the time.
