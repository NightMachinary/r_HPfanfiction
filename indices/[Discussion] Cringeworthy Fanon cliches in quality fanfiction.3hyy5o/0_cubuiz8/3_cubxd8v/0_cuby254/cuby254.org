I really don't know. Maybe because I always saw the movies and the books as two different things? At least that would be one possible explanation. While I only watched each movie once, I read the books several times (the most being GoF with 6 times). Also, Daniel Radcliffe never established himself as "the face of Harry" in my mind. Emma Watson came closer to how I imagined Hermione, but even here the years blurred the image.

I also don't really read author notes, so even if authors explain their choice of names, I wouldn't know of it.

So, in the end, Dan and Emma were perfectly normal names for me.

In some way I gotta say: FUCK YOU OP!

Now I'll always think of this when I read those names.
