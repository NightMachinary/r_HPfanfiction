There was one ff that had ancient, enchanted lemon drops. When the last lemon drop was voluntarily taken, something good was going to happen.

Of course, if you tried to vanish them, they doubled in number. Which happened several times. I think they gave them to Grawp in the end.

Can't remember which ff, though.
