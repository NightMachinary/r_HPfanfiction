There's Black Coat which has something of the kind.... Harry and Tom are not in love but they end up as frienemies with Tom caring for Harry as a friend. Harry does not really turn Tom good but Tom is disgusted of what he becomes in the future (still the timeline is unaffected). I thought it was a really cool and well-written friendship story with some really awesome original ideas, especially that the author at the time was fourteen, yet still mature enough to stay away from romance if they had no real life experience with it back then.
