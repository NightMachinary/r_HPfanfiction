linkffn(The Girl Who Loved by Darth Drafter) is a three-way cross with Ranma 1/2 and Sailor Moon. It has a completed sequel that contains a large number of small cameos from other anime. Ranma fanfiction is where I started, and a lot of it gets crossed with Sailor Moon.

linkffn(Eldritch Asylum) is good but unfinished, and likely to remain so. It's primarily a Ranma 1/2 story crossed with Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos.

On my "get around to it someday" list, I have:

linkffn(Gods Among Us by arturus) which is crossed with Stargate and Battlestar Galactica: 2003, and

linkffn(A Jedi, a Wizard, and a Scooby walk into a bar), which is, obviously, a cross with Star Wars and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
