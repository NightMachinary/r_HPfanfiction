I stumbled onto SuperPotterLock during a crossover binge I was on. It had a /lot/ going on, what with all the characters in the story. No smut, but it did have a bit of the obligatory JohnLock predestined slash (literally). Might be something going on with Cas. I'm pretty sure his sister's the devil. It's still going on too, around 4th year.
