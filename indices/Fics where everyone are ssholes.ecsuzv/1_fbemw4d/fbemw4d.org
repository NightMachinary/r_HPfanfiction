*Imprisoned Realm* By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/245967/LoveHP][LoveHP]] linkffn(2705927) absolutely fits this request- even characters who are completely 'good' are driven to being assholes when they feel justified.

I second *Hail Odysseus* By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus]] linkffn(10645463).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5265569][Seven Names]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/angelholme/pseuds/angelholme][angelholme]] absolutely fits the bill as well. It's got a confusing start, but I think that is intentional and it all comes together in the end. The moral of the story is that everyone does shitty things in war.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189][The Changeling]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Annerb/pseuds/Annerb][Annerb]] and the sequel series that follows [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/766017][Armistice Series]] isn't as clear of a match. I think, in general, Harry is the golden good boy we expect but he's not overwhelmingly in the first one and after that he is certainly flawed. Most of the characters are really complex though and the main character, Ginny, absolutely does shitty things.
