Hey - I've read through all the fics you've linked and I've found them rather enthralling. The Magnate, Wit of the Raven, and Black Luminary were of particular interest to me. Alexandra Potter is at the very top of my all-time favorites.

Given that it seems like we have similar tastes, do you have any other recommendations?
