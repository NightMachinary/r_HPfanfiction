I understood it in the sense that Draco has lived by the expectations of his parents and Slytherin stereotypes and being a "Junior Death Eater" all his life. One could potentially see where Draco would feel he'd been forced into all those circumstances.

[[/spoiler][Since Harry fell in love with Draco first, for Draco to just go along with the relationship would be just living by someone else's expectations and hopes again. I think it was really important for Draco to come to terms with his feelings outside of a relationship. Harry following Millicent's advice to give Draco space allowed Draco to assess his feelings independently.]]

edited in spoiler tag, just in case.
