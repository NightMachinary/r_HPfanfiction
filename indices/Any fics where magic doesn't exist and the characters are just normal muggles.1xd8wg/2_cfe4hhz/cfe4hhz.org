I'm a fan of this one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9185028/1/Scarred-Roots][Scarred Roots]]

#+begin_quote
  An AU story set in a world with no magic. James and Lily were killed by Peter's deceit; Sirius imprisoned, Remus tortured for a long painful year. Now, they raise Harry. Sirius dates every girl that crosses his path and Remus concentrates on surviving one day to the next. It all changes when a red-headed cop trips into their lives. Will Remus see her love before it's too late?
