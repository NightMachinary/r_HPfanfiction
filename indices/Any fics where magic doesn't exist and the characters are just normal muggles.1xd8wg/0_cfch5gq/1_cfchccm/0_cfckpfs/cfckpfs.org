But their characterizations are very heavily intertwined with the existence of magic, to the point that separating the two makes no sense. I'll just go over some of the main people to demonstrate:

- Harry Potter's life is heavily determined by him being a wizard that lives with his magic-hating muggle family. There is also the whole "boy-who-lived" thing that influences how people treat him. Without any of that, he is just.. a kid. no magic, no prophecy, nothing special about him... he wouldn't be Harry at all.

- Hermione Granger is the muggleborn witch that tries to prove her best in a magical society that looks down on people like her. Without it she's just some dentist's daughter...

- Ron Weasly is the son of a pureblood wizarding family who stumbles with trying to understand what all the muggle-things his friends keep talking about mean. Without it he's just another random kid.

- Draco Malfoy is a pureblood supremacist that looks down on muggleborns and dabbles in dark magic. Without magic he's just (yet again) another random kid with nothing special about him or the way he interacts with the world....

The list just goes on and on. I just genuinely do not see how one could possibly separate the two.

EDIT: people seem to misunderstand this post: I'm not "judging" stories without magic, I'm just genuinely confused how they could possibly work. So don't downvote, but respond and try to explain what such a story would look like.
