I actually made up the titles of 14 of the books - 1 every year between the ages of 2 and 16 - for a story I'm writing. Harry escaped Britain and didn't grow up there, but found the books anyway and owns a complete set of them. The thing that he finds the most disturbing is the fact that the author has his appearance correct, down to the scar. This Harry wasn't seen by anyone before he was 6 years old, so that means whoever is writing them either knew his parents and helped condemn him to the Dursleys or helped to murder his parents.
