I'm working on a story where Harry is no longer living in England, and along the way, he learns about a popular children's book series and radio show called "The Adventures of Jamie Walker, Boy Wizard." They are loosely based on the British books based on him; the reason he hadn't heard of them until he left England is that they are banned in Britain because of accusations of plagiarism/copyright issues. But they are quite popular in Europe, Australia, MacUSA, etc.

Characters include Jamie, of course; his best mate, the teenage werewolf Alfie; the clever halfblood witch Tamsin; a centaur who he has ridden to battle; and the Evil Overlord (with corresponding mob) he fights in about half the episodes. Interesting enough, a few have made their way to Britain despite the ban and may be the source of the phrase "The Golden Trio."

Harry hates both series.

I doubt I will develop them much further as it's not an important part of the story; just a bit of color, so to speak.
