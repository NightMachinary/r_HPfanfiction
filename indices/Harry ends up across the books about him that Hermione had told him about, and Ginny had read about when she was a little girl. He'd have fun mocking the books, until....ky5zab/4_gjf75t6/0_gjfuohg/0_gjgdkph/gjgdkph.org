I mean, Harry hates being the Boy Who Lived because he only holds that status due to his mother having died for him; it's something that he hasn't earned. On the other hand, he, not anyone else, was down there killing a basilisk, nearly dying, and dispatching the shade of Voldemort to save Ginny. Before that, he stopped Voldemort from stealing the Philospher's Stone and returning from the dead, again nearly dying in the attempt. He may not like the spotlight, but he also doesn't like that his achievements and actual bravery are ignored and swept under the table.
