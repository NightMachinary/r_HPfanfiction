First book in the series; Harry Potter and his stalwart friends solve a series of dangerous puzzles and Harry does away with the Dark Lord and his evil but bumbling apprentice.

Second book in the series; Harry Potter and his friend go into the hidden dungeon to save the fair maiden. Betrayal most foul, and Harry is forced to face the evil beast and it's Dark Master alone.

And so on, with Harry's life being almost perfectly predicted in print. The books are highly metaphorical, as is the hallmark of Divination. For example, one book depicts him taking to the high ground to avoid a monstrous beast; this serves as a metaphor for the incident where Ripper chased Harry up a tree.
