There are a few categories these can fall into and some are the Dumbledore is evil others are Voldemort gets redeemed types.

Life Renovations by Windseeker is a long 3 part story with a Harry injured by Dursleys rescued by Snape and Draco and eventual good Voldy and bad Dumbledore. I liked it but it's heavy on AU.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/451982/chapters/775208]] this is just one sample of the many Voldemort is reformed by a relationship stories, I personally like him paired with Hermione as in this story. This is post Deathly Hollows (he escapes but doesn't die at end) and he is still kind of a Dexter kind of psycho with a bizarre relationship with Hermione. This author has some fantastic Voldy/Hermione if that's your thing.
