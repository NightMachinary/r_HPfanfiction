One of the interesting ones that I've encountered is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/27/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] by Lady Khali, though you don't see much Tom Riddle until part 2 of the story. Part 1 features Harry being mentored by Barty Crouch Jr. It has several interesting ideas that I've not seen done before, casting the Magical world in a much different light than most tales, yet doing so in a manner that's (mostly) consistent with canon†. For plot necessity, some characters (Dumbledore, Ron, James Potter) aren't portrayed sympathetically, though I don't recall overt bashing.

  On Halloween 1994, Harry learns his mind isn't his own. On Samhain morn, he vows to question everything. Armed with logic and an unlikely ally, Harry makes a last ditch bid to reclaim his life. The goal: survive at all costs.

The story hasn't updated since April and the author says it's on hiatus. Still, at 180k+ words, there's a fair bit to read.

† - Up to the GoF divergence point, that is.
