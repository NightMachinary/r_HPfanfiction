Sam Storyteller's [[http://sam-storyteller.dreamwidth.org/97242.html][Reclamation]] is a very good AU one-shot where Tom Riddle chooses not to don the mantle of Voldemort and becomes the Hogwarts Defense Against the Dark Arts professor instead. (Warning: implied Remus/Sirius slash in the background.) While he's not exactly a good guy in the fullest sense of the word, neither is he a mustache-twirling, trope-spewing villain like canon-Voldemort.
