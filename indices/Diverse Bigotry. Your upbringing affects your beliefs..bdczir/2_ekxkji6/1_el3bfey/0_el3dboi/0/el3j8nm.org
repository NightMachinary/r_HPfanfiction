I said quaint, cute and stupid for a reason. Arthur's reaction is like: "Oh, look at these adorable little apes and their cute workarounds to magic. I wonder what this rubber duck does?" To wizards, normal people look like what apes look like to us. I guarantee you, if we were able to ask apes anything and get an answer, the question: "What is the function of the stick that you lug around all day?", would be asked before the question: "What is the hierarchy of you tribe?", mostly because we already know most of these things through observations.

Bigotry, mild or otherwise, implies negative emotions toward another group of humans or ,in this case, another group of wizards. Most muggle supporting wizards want to protect muggles the same way you and I want to protect rhinos. They like muggles and understand their significance, but they recognize that they're not the same.
