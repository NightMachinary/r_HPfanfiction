Is it bigotry though? I mean, imagine how you would view a tribe of Homo Erectus(Erecti?) humans if they existed today. To us, it would look like a quaint and cute, but essentially stupid group of people that fumble around with no idea of how the world works. Not that we know everything, but the feeling of superiority is as normal as it is expected. And the Sapiens-Erectus comparison is about intelligence mostly, while the wizard-muggle comparison is about the control of, essentially, a superpower, so the feeling of superiority is equally amplified.
