I know it was a throwaway joke, but the line where Mr. Weasley asked about the purpose of a rubber duck really shows his biggotry. Because he sees muggles as a novelty, as something amusing with amusing little things.

He made no effort in actually learning anything about the non magical world. The best stories with him is the ones where he is seen by the wizarding world to know a lot about muggles and is sent out to go undercover, and he ends up being the most ignorant simply because he is so patronizing.
