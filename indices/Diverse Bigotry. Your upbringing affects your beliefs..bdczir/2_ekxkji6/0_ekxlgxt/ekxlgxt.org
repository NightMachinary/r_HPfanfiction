I'm on mobile, so forgive me. I had to stop playing BotW for this.

"Are you sure about this?"

Arthur laughed, "I've been studying muggles for years! I'm certainly the must suited of us."

The two sat in silence as he finished pulling on his tanktop. Molly bit her lip and said,"I've never seen any muggles dressed like this though. I've been out there with Hermione, so I've seen them as well."

The patriarch hummed to himself as he toyed with the straps on his heels. The boots he tried before were a tad small, so this would have to do. "You haven't seen the muggles I've seen. I am quite certain I've seen many of them dressed just like this."

Molly continued talking, but he was too busy untangling some sort of fishnet to really hear her. He realized she stopped talking about the time he finally pulled them up to his thighs. "I absolutely love these! They feel like someone is hugging my legs!" He felt a tad upset they ended so soon, but his shorts made it look like they went higher.

Molly groaned and grabbed his arm in a final plea," Arthur, this is just indecent. If Ginny sees you-"

"Then she'll finally have a good sense of fashion."

With a final look in the mirror, Arthur Weasley went out on his mission, but he needed a muggle who knew how to drive first. He loved this one little shop - it was filled with all sorts of muggle bits - and he saw people dressed just like him being picked up all the time. He was certain it must've been the Tacksies he heard about.
