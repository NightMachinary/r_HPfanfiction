The general assumption that Muggles are inferior to wizards (and can therefore be abused, insulted and obliviated without a second thought) is an underlying theme in most of my fics because my OC is a Muggle. But to be fair, that's canon anyway. There aren't any real positive representations of Muggles or squibs in canon.
