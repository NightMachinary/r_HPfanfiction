So I think essentially what you're asking for is microaggressions?

here's some examples of possible microaggressions towards muggleborns that I am making up/parodying with a wizarding flair

- assuming you either took muggle studies or that you got an OWL in muggle studies
- you don't act like all the rest of the muggleborns
- i don't see you as a muggleborn
- you're pretty good at magic for being a muggleborn
- when i look at you, i don't see blood status
- i'm not a blood purist, i have several muggle and muggleborn friends
- oh, you're muggleborn? i bet you'd get along with [name of another muggleborn]
