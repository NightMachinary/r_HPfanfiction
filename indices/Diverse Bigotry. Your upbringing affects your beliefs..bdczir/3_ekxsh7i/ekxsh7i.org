Slughorn is a good canon example, acting so surprised that Lily, a muggleborn, was so talented. At least he wasn't bigoted enough to be blind to her talent.

One of my fics will have Sirius remark that “Muggle girls are so passionate and exotic,” but I haven't posted that chapter yet.

I'm working on a fic that shows Tonks's conventional anti-werewolf bigotry before Remus is outed. She commits a lot of microagressions before she finds out.
