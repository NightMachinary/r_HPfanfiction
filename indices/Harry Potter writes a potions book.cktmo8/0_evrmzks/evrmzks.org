Not sure if this is what you're looking for: Crumbling Pedestal

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1922112/1/Crumbling-Pedestal]]

It's an HP/SS slash, and Harry time travels to the founders era. He changes his name to Heru Slytherin, and when he comes back he writes a series of potions books under that name. He sends them to Hogwarts for consideration, but I don't remember if they were actually used.
