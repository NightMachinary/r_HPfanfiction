I guess I can understand it. I don't know if you've read it or not so I'll try to keep it spoiler-free, but on some level there is the implication that most of the stuff that will happen past the story that makes the ending happy isn't because of Harry but because of others, which can make one feel that the protagonist was nothing more than a puppet for others from the beginning to the end. Considering how Harry behaves over the course of the story I can see how people can see it as a let-down.
