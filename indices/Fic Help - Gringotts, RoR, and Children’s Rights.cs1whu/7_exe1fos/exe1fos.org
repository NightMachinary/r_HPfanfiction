Concerning Gringotts, from what we saw, it only provide "Vaults". Wizard pay to have a vault (I would guess a pretty important inital cost, and then either nothing or some really low upkeep cost) and Gringotts promise to them that anything inside won't be stolen.\\
Also, since the money is stuck inside the vaults and not "working", it cannot earn any interest. Anyways I doubt Goblins would earn interest for wizard because :

- The whole magical society does not have the size to support a modern economy with things like stock market, it looks more like a little town where investment and loans are made between 2 individuals.
- Wizards and Goblins seem to, as best, dislike each other. I don't see wizards trusting Goblins with "using" their money, and even if they did, I imagine Goblins could just make "bad investments" just to spit on him.

If the bank is making money, it's probably thanks to its other services (exchange between magical and muggle currencies, curse breaker expeditions . . .), though I personally dislike the whole "Gringotts is the one that deal with will and magical contract and also happen to be able to take care of living Horcruxe without killing the host even if Harry is supposed to be the first Living Horcruxe).

​

For The Room of Hidding Things, I think everything inside is either useless or broken. Most of the "lost things" are probably of little value or people would have looked for it seriously enough for the elves to notice, as for the hidden one, the owner would have come back for it. But the main reason for it is Voldemort. He probably plundered the room during his time there. So anything still there is either pretty new (like than 40/50 years old), or so broken Riddle considered it useless.

​

Finally for the children. I think we do not have enough elements to judge. Most of what we see in canon is from Harry's eye, and even if it was for a reason, it's not like Harry's situation is a normal one. I would guess that the principe of child abuse exist (when abused children can turn into some kind of crazy magical monster, you try to limit it), but it is very different to Muggles one, for example, wizard d'ont care for physical injury since they can heal almost anything is a moment, also scaring a children half to death to make him use accidental magic seem to be socially acceptable (Neville).\\
Concerning children's job, I don't think it really exist. Since anything a children could do can be done a lot faster thanks to a wand or a House elve, what would be the point? I guess some children could de simple work like maning the counter of a shop to earn a little money, but it would be more of a allowance than a salary.\\
Also, children shopping alone seem to be acceptable (starting 11 at least, can't be sure before). While he didn't like it, Dumbledore left Riddle shop alone before his 1st year without fighting the decision too much, and Harry could live alone in the Leaky Cauldron for 2 weeks when he was only 13.
