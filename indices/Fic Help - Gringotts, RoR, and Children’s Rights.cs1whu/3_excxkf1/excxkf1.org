Generally speaking, law will have progressed somewhat faster in muggle society, and even there Children's Law is at best described as a fledgling field.

That said, child abuse as a crime is a somewhat older concept, and I would expect it to have filtered through to the wizarding world, but given that Umbridge got away with having her methods called 'medieval', it does not yet appear to have the same level of stigma(or didn't in the 90s) as would be ascribed to it these days.

Admittedly she was in a somewhat unique and powerful position, but it would take a rather large amount of populist or political capital to get away with it if it were as stigmatised as it is in our society these days(provided, obviously, it gets discovered.)
