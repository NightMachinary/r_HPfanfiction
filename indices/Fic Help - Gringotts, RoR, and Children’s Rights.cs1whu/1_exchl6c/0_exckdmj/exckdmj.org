I really like your theory on Gringotts and honestly it probably makes the most sense - especially if we're going with the general folklore around Goblins hoarding wealth.

I suppose my only worry with the Room of Hidden things is making it too much of a power source. A room full of important and useful magical items seems a bit too convienent, but I think there could be a good crap to awesome ratio for the stuff in there if that makes sense?

Thanks for sharing your ideas!
