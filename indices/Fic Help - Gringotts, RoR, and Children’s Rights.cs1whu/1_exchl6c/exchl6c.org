I suspect my headcanon around Gringotts is different than most peoples'. I don't think there is a charge for a vault. For one, I don't think the more bigoted purebloods would deign to give Goblins money. I believe, for the goblins, simply being the sole possessor of the accumulated wealth of the wizarding world would be worth housing it. They make their money through the other activities we see them engaging in: we know they employ cursebreakers, who could either be hired out or employed by Gringotts itself to aquire more treasure; they are the sole means of currency exchange in the magical world, and they are the finest smiths in the world. I should clarify that I don't necessarily think I'm /right,/ but it's what works for me.

I always pictured the room of hidden things as a sort of lost and found for Hogwarts. I think most of what we see in it when Harry visits it is things that have been left behind or (poorly) hidden by students that the house elves found and decided to store instead of simply vanishing away. The good thing about the Room of Requirement, in general, though, is that its very nature means that whatever you as the writer want to be in there can be.

Lastly, I think it's important to separate the "wizarding world" as a whole from the Ministry of Magic. Functionally, what the wizarding public wants is only as relevant as the Ministry of Magic chooses to make it. Would the Ministry have the standing to intervene for muggleborn kids?

There's a lot of opinions on /how/ abusive the Dursleys are towards Harry, but we know he is routinely denied food as punishment, Petunia threw a frying pan at his head, and Vernon choked Harry, so it's clearly not a healthy household for him. There's no indication that the Ministry has any clue about how Harry's treated. And he's /Harry Potter./ If they're that clueless about how the literal most famous wizard in the world is being treated, it's unlikely that they're concerned with how muggleborns are treated.
