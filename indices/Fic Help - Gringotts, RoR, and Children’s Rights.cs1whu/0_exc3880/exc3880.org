I have no idea about banks so I can't really help you with that besides saying that the Goblins probably won't grow your fortune for you. Especially when they don't have strict orders to do so. (looking at you trillionaire Harry)

I always thought that the room was used by students to hide things and a lot of the time they couldn't retrieve what they hid because they couldn't find the room again. Perhaps it could also be used by House Eleves as a place to store things that can't simply be vanished because they're enchanted or otherwise magical.

Wizarding law seems pretty backwards to me. But I think with how low birth rates are, especially in pureblood circles every magical child would be protected and cherished (and spoiled rotten.)
