Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions is loaded with them.

Chapter 2:

  Harry's friends cruelly abandoned him to talk to Draco, on the theory that it was his own stupid plan.

  Traitors.

  (A small voice inside his head pointed out he'd never had friends to be traitors before, and he should be grateful. The little voice that told him he was ungrateful for things always sounded like his Aunt. He tuned it out, with long practice.)

  “I will not be shown up by /Minerva McGonagall/,” Professor Snape hissed at him, over a cloudy potion that stunk of regret and elderberries.

Chapter 94:

  Dear Professor Snape,

  /I know you do not like to be bothered during the summer holidays, but I thought I would/

  Harry crumpled up the note and started over.

  /Dear Professor Snape,/

  /I achieved an Outstanding on my Potions OWL, as instructed. I hope your summer is/

  Harry tore that one in half. Hedwig, sitting on her perch, hooted at him.

  “I'm working on a letter for Professor Snape, Hedwig. I'll have it for you in a minute.”

  /Dear Professor Snape,/

  /How are you? I am fine. I hope you are recovered. I was pleased to receive my OWL results and look forward to seeing you at Hogwarts/

  Harry studied that one, then crumpled it up too. Hedwig, bored, soared out the window.

  /Dear Evil Nose,/

  /I got an Outstanding on my potions OWL, so you're stuck with me. Everyone has been asking me how I am, and I look forward to returning to school so you can tell me I'm being an idiot. I've been trying to figure out what to put in a letter to you for an hour and this is sadly my best attempt, which I am now going to ritually burn./

  /My last myrtle potion demonstrated that if you're overenthusiastic about the tapping it explodes amusingly on the unwitting student./

  /Harry/

  Harry crumpled it into a ball and threw it out the window, where Hedwig caught it and flew away.

  Harry made a noise approximately like ‘gnk.'
