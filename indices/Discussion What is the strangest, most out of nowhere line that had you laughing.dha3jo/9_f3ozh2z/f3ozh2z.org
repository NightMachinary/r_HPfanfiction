I mean this whole scene had me in stitches.

“Sirius gave her the kind of hapless grin she probably expected from him, and Narcissa nodded, satisfied. She held out her hand. "Draco, come here and meet your cousin."

Sirius was pretty sure that he stifled his snicker. So Narcissa won the battle about what to name the kid, huh? He watched as a pale little boy came strolling to Narcissa's side. He was trying to hold his nose up and look accomplished and adult. He mostly succeeded in looking pointy.

"This is my son, Draco Malfoy," Narcissa said, as if she hadn't already announced that, her hand on Draco's shoulder.

"He's very...blond."

Narcissa shot him a sharp glance (still not as sharp as her son's cheekbones), and then looked around. "We had heard you were raising the Boy-Who-Lived, Sirius. Where is he?"

"I actually traded him for a map to buried treasure."

Draco stared at him with his mouth open. Narcissa's glance this time was disapproving. But Harry laughed from behind a nearby rack of trunks and gave the game away.

"It would have to be at least two maps, Sirius, otherwise it wouldn't be a fair price." Harry stepped into sight and gave Narcissa and her son a polite if unenthused nod. "How are you, Mrs. Malfoy? Draco."

"You're Harry Potter," Draco said, a vibration of awe in his voice.

"He's also very Slytherin," Sirius whispered to Narcissa.

She glared at him, but Harry answered before she could say anything. "Yeah, I get that a lot. It's the fringe, isn't it?"

Draco blinked, puzzled in a way that no nine-year-old boy should be. Sirius sighed. He was probably growing up in an environment with no jokes. What a sad thing. If Sirius and Narcissa managed to get along well enough, then perhaps Harry and Draco should play more often, and then Sirius could maybe ensure the poor boy had a sense of humor.”
