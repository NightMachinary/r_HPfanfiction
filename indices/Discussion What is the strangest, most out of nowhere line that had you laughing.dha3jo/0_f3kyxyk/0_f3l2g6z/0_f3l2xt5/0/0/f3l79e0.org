To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand HPMOR.

The plotting is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of history and political philosophy most of the story will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Harry's political outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation -- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Machiavelli's Il Principe, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the plot, to realise that it's not just a story -- it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike HPMOR truly ARE idiots -- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the history behind Malfoy's catchphrase “As soon as I'm old enough, I'm going to rape her”, which itself is a cryptic reference to mid 18th century French feudal politics. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Eliezer Yudkowsky's genius unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools... how I pity them.

And yes, by the way, I DO have a HPMOR tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the witches' eyes only -- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin' personnel kid.

Spoily spoiler: You'll only understand this if you've read the story, teehee. :)
