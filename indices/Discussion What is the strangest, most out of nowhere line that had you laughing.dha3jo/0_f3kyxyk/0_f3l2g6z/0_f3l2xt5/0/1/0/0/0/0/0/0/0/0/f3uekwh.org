You mean someone as charismatic and intelligent as Tom Riddle with high morals is not high praise? Better than all the Mary Sues that plague ff.net. this harry at least struggles and makes mistakes and suffers and accepts it. And i don't mean on major stuff like someone dying (that he does suffer with Hermione). I mean that stuff actually happens to him because he was wrong and not because something happened to him. (Eg. Voldemort killing someone because he had a better plan vs Harry being scolded like a child because he actually hurt someones feelings) the last example is what is actually missing from fanfictions in many many levels. That imperfection of the character that you are calling out is actually /shown/ in the fic. He is a smug bastard and he is shown suffering for it. . Ultimately in the end everything works for him, but not without sacrifice on his part.
