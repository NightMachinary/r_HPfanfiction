Of note, nobility in the Middle Ages did /not/ treat rape so blithely. Nobility was heavily intertwined with the ideals of chivalry - and that meant that things like rape were at least supposed to not be done by the nobility. That doesn't mean that they didn't partake in it, particularly after the sack of a city - but they wouldn't joke about it in the open. There's some discussion about it on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/37s04q/a_game_of_thrones_depicts_violence_against_women/][this askhistorians thread]] and other linked ones in those comments.
