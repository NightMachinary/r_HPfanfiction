  In the fic, when Harry hears Draco say this, he decides to befriend Draco
#+end_quote

That is grossly misleading. Harry's reaction is to choke on his soda and have to cough it out, then ask about what Draco's said, with a growing sense of horror and desire to tear down the whole society that enables that kind of behaviour.

He does eventually befriend Draco with a view to changing his ways, because he takes the view that Draco is largely just a product of his environment and he is largely successful in the end, with a lot of work and some considerable pain. But it's not at all his first reaction to hearing the rape plan. He first asks questions about the court system, trying to understand how Draco can expect to get away with that (and wanting to introduce things like DNA testing), and upon hearing about how corrupt things are, his internal reaction is /Note to self: Overthrow government of magical Britain at earliest convenience./ And his opinion doesn't improve from there.

Feel free to dislike this Harry for being arrogant, dismissive of others' feelings, and careless at times with forces beyond his comprehension, because all of those are true. But it's /not/ true that he shrugs his shoulders at rape.
