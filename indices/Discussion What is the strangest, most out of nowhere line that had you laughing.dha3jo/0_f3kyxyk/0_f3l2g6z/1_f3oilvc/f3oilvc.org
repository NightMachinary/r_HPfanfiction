Sadly not. He used a silencing charm first, and explained to Harry how he would be able to evade justice by selectively wiping his own memory and having his father apply the right political pressure. And went on to explain how, if Harry testified against him, the same pressure could be brought to bear to destroy Harry.

Note that they didn't have the same instant animosity as canon, and at this point Draco was still thinking Harry was more or less on the same page as himself, while Harry was silently freaking out about the kind of society that produces kids like this.
