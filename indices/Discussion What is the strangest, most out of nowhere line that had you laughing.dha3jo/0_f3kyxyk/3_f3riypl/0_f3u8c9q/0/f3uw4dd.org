People can hate it if they want to. For example, Harry's behaviour toward pretty much every adult is certainly disrespectful, he's condescending toward his peers and he exercises some shockingly bad judgement on a number of occasions; I can well understand disliking him, and by extension disliking the story.

What bothers me is when people misrepresent the story, like suggesting that Harry was impressed by Draco's intention to rape Luna and immediately wanted to befriend him. That's not what happened at all.
