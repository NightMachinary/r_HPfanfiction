Yea he does dive into some psychology topics now an then. It made the fic interesting to me. Its sad that many people prefer mindless fics. The hate it gets its really overwhelming, for a fic that i wage it has been the best for me. Right there with nonjons's and the firebird trilogy. I read HPMOR 3 times and i actually find more things each time. It got me reading about biases and fallacies. So forgive me but i don't understand all the hate.
