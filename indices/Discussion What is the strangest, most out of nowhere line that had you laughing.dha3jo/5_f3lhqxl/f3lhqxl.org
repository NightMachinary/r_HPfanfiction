A Black Comedy by Nonjon, Chapter 21, [[https://pastebin.com/K3S03bDq][this scene with Tonks, Lily, and Sarah eating ice cream.]] I had to use Pastebin because it was too long to post here.

The whole scene always cracks me up. Yes it's lowbrow juvenile bodily function humor but it never fails to make me laugh, especially the end of the scene.

  Tonks pat her chest a little bit and let out a loud echoing belch. "Wow. That even tasted good the second time."
  Lily raised a curious eyebrow. "Are you challenging the champion?"
  "Let's see what you got," Tonks taunted.
  Lily opened her mouth and swallowed a gulp of air. She raised her hand and repeated with another gulp before letting loose a deep reverberating burp, more than twice as loud and long as Tonks' had been.
  A house elf appeared with a pop. "Did youse call for me, Missum Potter?"
  Tonks had to look away, because she was struggling to hold back her laughter.
  Lily waved off the confused and curious elf. "No, Irma. If I did, I didn't mean to."
  "Okays," Irma the house elf happily replied and popped away.
  Tonks gave up holding back and outright laughed at Lily.
  Lily raised an arm in victory. "Still the King.

After many expulsions of gas (from both ends)...

  The two female Potters were all set to pounce on Tonks, who was increasingly feeling as if she were cornered. She was saved by the appearance of James Potter.
  "I've been doing paperwork for seven hours straight," James complained as he walked into his wife's quarters. "And Iâ€¦ good lord. What's that smell?"
  Lily flashed a look at Tonks and Sarah, calmly answering, "Your son let off a dung bomb earlier."
  James shook his head. "I swear it's those Lord Blacks. They're a bad influence on him."
  "You know what? It's late," Tonks said jumping up. "I should get going. See you tomorrow, boss. Night Lily, Sarah."
  "Good night, Tonks," James said as she hurried out the portrait. He walked back towards the bedroom taking off his wand holsters as he went. He stuck his head back in the front room and added distastefully, "It was a super dung bomb, wasn't it?"
  Lily had to gulp and cover her mouth to hide her amusement.
  James smiled at his wife, turning back towards the bedroom. "You and your dainty little burps."
