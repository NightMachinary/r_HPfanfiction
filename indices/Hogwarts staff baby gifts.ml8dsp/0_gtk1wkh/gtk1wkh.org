Harry got a toy broom as a gift when he was a baby. It was from Sirius, which is kinda poetic considering Sirius gave him the firebolt later.

But I also don't see why dolls and soft toys wouldn't be an option. Dolls enchanted to walk and talk, stuffed toys that can come to life. Exploding snap with animals or the alphabet on them. Chess sets in novelty shapes. Puzzles that move and change shape every time you solve them. Tea sets that whistle and smoke. Trains that pump smoke out of their chimneys.

Balls that bounce magically high and change colour. Bubble bath where the bubbles can be picked up and thrown into the air - and then they float.

Play mats where the pictures move about and make sounds when you press them. Think - elephants and monkeys and stuff. Animated farm sets.

Books. Picture books with moving pictures.

An enchanted lullaby box that plays the baby's favourite song.
