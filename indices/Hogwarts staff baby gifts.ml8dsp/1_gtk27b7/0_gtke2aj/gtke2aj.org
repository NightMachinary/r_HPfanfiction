I just died at your idea for Snape's gift xD Idk, maybe he'd think of something sweet and proper, like a colour-changing blanket that grows in size as s/he grows that smells like something calming. Lavender, maybe?

I'd love to see your idea for Filch's gift, imagining he miraculously liked the kid and wanted to give something. I imagine a tiny Mrs Norris plush that'd come to life and cuddle her/him.
