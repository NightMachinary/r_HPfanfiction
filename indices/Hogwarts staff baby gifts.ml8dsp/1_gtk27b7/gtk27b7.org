--------------

Snape: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Sprout: Some sort of magical flower--maybe something that has color-changing petals or a vine that can play patty-cake or tickle the baby

Hooch: A toy broomstick

Hagrid: Insert pet of your choice here

Kettburn: Insert another pet of your choice

Flitwick: A super-duper bouncy ball that can bounce off the ceiling and the floor and the walls and it turns color with every bounce

McGonagall: Something practical...or perhaps a little kazoo that plays bagpipe music
