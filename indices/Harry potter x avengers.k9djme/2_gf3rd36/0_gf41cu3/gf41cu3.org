Yep, thats the one that came to mind for me too.

To OP: The scene where Fawkes makes it to the other dimension happens inside Harry's trunk where he also has a kind of picture of Hogwarts, Fawkes looks at it sadly and Harry says something like "Yea, I miss it too."

Maybe that will give you a better idea if it is the one you are looking for.
