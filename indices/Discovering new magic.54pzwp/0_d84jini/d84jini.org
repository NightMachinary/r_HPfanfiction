Ascension of the Scorpion Sorcerer linkffn(2353966) was a very good story for me. He doesn't care about repercussions, he just obliterates his enemies. And the fact that it's ancient magic is a bonus. Only drawback for me was that the first bits of knowledge come from a snake (kind of clich√© in dark fics).
