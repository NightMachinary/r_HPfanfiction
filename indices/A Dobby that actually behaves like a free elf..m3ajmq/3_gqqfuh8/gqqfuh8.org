There was a fic I read a while back where the house elves were an engineered race that actually needed the contract to survive. (As a benefit, learning about this was met with appropriate horror, not "oh well, slavery is cool actually). Dobby decided that even if it meant a painful, drawn-out death in less than a decade, he would never be a slave again.

I wish I remembered that fic, I adored the way they treated the "they have to be slaves" BS. Bioengineering a sentient slave race isn't ethical, and the reaction from a diehard abolitionist isn't "oh well, slavery's cool now", it's "can we undo the modifications".
