Aside from Dobby? No, I don't think so.

Some say, Dobby was an anomaly among House Elves. They're fantastical race that are different to us and think differently, perceive the world differently. What we would consider being essentially a slave, in fairly bad -possibly the worst- form of slavery is not considered as such by the House Elves. Or at least it's a necessary (for House Elves benefit) evil.

And some others say pretty much what Hermione said. In that, they're not so different or even if they're we should act as if they're not. Dobby might be the lone example of a House Elf we get to see that had a such a desire for freedom but that doesn't mean he was, necessarily the first or the last. All House Elves don't revolt for freedom mostly due to brainwashing. There's no benefit inherit for the House Elves -if there ever was one to begin with- in the current system that can't be granted by less slaver-ish better alternative system.
