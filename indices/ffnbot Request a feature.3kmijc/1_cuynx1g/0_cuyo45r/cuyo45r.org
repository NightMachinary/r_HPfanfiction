A new feature of the bot is ffnbot!refresh with should do quite nicely for updating the bot on edits. [[/u/tusing]] and I are currently thinking about automating this process (at least for sufficiently new comments). ([[https://github.com/tusing/reddit-ffn-bot/issues/89][Click Issue Link Here]])

As for narrowing down the fics: The bot just googles everything that does not look like a link or a number. Narrowing down should be easy by adding additional things to the query like

#+begin_quote
  linkffn(30 Minutes in Harry Potter by Radaslab)\\
  linkffn(Harry Potter 30 Minutes that changed everything)
#+end_quote
