Would be nice to be able to put in the fandom to narrow down the fics. I know a few times people have put in linkffn(Insert The Fic Title Here) and gotten some random fic from a different fandom with the same name. I know we can put in the ID# in the URL, but it would be nice to be able to put in the title.

So: linkffn(Harry Potter; Insert The Fic Title Here)

Or something like that.

Also being able to pick up on comments where another link is edited into the comment later. Not sure it's possible.
