This somewhat reminds me of Fortnite. In the beginning, people would mainly engage in gunfights and build walls every now and then for cover. Then people started learning rapid build strategies and were creating towers and forts while fighting. The playstyle completely changed and it was all about outsmarting your opponent by creating an environment that favors you. The gunfights on their own are just people jumping around shooting at each other. It's when people can build like pros that you can see some really interesting plays and strategies and the skill ceiling of the game increased so much.
