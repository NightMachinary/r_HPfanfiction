Oh, and there is also Linkffn(Prodigal Delinquent) which goes more or less on the same thread with the differences that this Harry is extra op and rather oblivious, there was also another one which I can't remember the name where he started stealing before Hogwarts and got himself semi-adopted by the Flamels after getting caught stealing from them (plus a /lot/ of other stuff of the same degree of ridiculousness such as accidentally getting the Hogwarts' staff stoned) though on this Dumbledore is portrayed as being manipulative it is played more as a running gag rather than an important part of the plot and he never really got half as bad as other manipulative!Dumbledores, even letting Harry move out without any fight whatsoever upon finding out about the cupboard. There was also another like that which I've been tried to find again for ages in which Harry learns small bits of wandless magic alone (small stuff only, the one I remember the most accurately is that he could turn a pencil in metal with lots of effort), goes to Ravenclaw (Not Noodlehammer's “for the love of magic”) and travels Europe after his first year, eventually going to the Caribbean (Bahamas I think) and doing a ritual where he killed a dragon, if anyone knows it I would love I link haven't been able to find it in years.
