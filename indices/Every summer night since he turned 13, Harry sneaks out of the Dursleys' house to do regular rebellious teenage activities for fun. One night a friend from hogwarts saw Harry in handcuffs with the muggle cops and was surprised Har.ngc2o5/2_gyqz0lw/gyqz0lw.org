So I had a go at it and it became so big that I thought to actually post it to Ao3. It's not quite finished yet, but after I'm done I'll update the post with a link. Here's what I have so far, maybe consider it an introduction?

It wasn't so much teenage rebellion as it was him just doing what was expected of him. All his life Harry had been the one that was pushed and toppled, the one who got the short end of the stick, miserable while alone but thankful for being alone because he knew that as soon as Dudley showed up he was in for pain. His aunt and uncle had called him a violent degenerate, and he had cringed because it only made the high and mighty middle aged tossers who lived in Privet Drive turn their nose at him with disapproval. When he was small he had hoped and wished and cried for someone to come in and take him away, he had hoped that a Teacher would see the bruises that Dudley left or a kind stranger would notice that his clothes were 3 times his size and someone would call help. Smart as he was, raising himself and becomming self sufficient it wasn't until he was in Hogwarts that he realised just how things were.

He had had the most wonderful year of his life where he actually felt himself liked and where people didn't scoff whenever he opened his mouth and returning that Summer had been the hardest thing he had ever done. He had minimised things in his letters, not wanting his friends to see him in pain, painting it as funny little annoyances rather than the misery that it was. Not that it had mattered anyway, Dobby might have had good intentions but he made his letters wasted ink and pen...or parchment and quill.

​

People in Little Whinging didn't care about him and in fact they took the Dursleys as saints for doing the bare basic of providing him food and shelter. No, most of them did not care for anything but themselves and when they cared for him it was to shake their heads and tell him what filth his parents were and that he should be thankful to be raised by respectful people. Respectful...that was something that he was not in his scruffy clothes which served to his neighbours as proof that there wasn't something quite right with the Potter boy. Nevermind the fact that his baggy clothes were the result of the Dursleys, did they think he wanted to look like that?

​

Harry could get into trouble at Hogwarts but he was generally thought of as a good boy. He had his spats with Malfoy and wandered the halls at night sure, but it balanced out and he at least tried to do the right thing. He was a good person, intent on living up to the image his mum and father would have wanted him to be. He assumed at least, he saw Hermione's parents fill her with praise whenever she got a good grade rather than being chidded for embarassing Dudley by doing better and he knew Mrs Weasley. That was how normal parents acted right? With love?

Maybe it was the hormones that made his blood boil or made him want to shout, maybe it was just that he had had enough but Harry found himself not caring. Why should he worry that he stepped on the flowers of their pretty little lawns or that he loitered? He had been called all but a thief by them for daring to need to be supported as a child by the Dursleys so what was different when he stole something?

​

It was never things that he actually wanted or cared about because Super Nintendo games didn't much matter to him and jewellery was something that to him was given to girls, and at 13 he didn't see the point but in a way he found it satisfying. It wasn't about the objects he took, not really, it was about making others feel bad for being....well bad didn't quite seem to cover it, and neither did gits. They were something else entirely.

​

It was very easy too, for whatever reason that Harry couldn't quite fathom he had gotten no more letters from the ministry, even as his magic reacted to his wants and opened doors, to him it almost felt like encouragement, like they somehow approved.

What use did he have for being polite and just taking the abuse? Harry was done with that...
