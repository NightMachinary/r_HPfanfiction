Thank you for the idea;)......

Justin Finch-Fletchley griined as he shimmed down the drain pipe behind his older cousin Dylan who was 15 and finally said Justin was old enough to go with him to "the Dairy"... It didn't sound very exciting or nefarious but it was legendary in Surrey. Even Justin who when to bloody hogwarts and could to do honest to merlin magic was envious of the older kids who went there.

Dylan also made him go home when ever he tried to follow him in uears pervious, Justin stayed with his mother sister Dolores for a few weeks every summer when his parents went to Bali to have another Mini honeymoon they seemed to do that in the middle of summer every year like clockwork since he was 3 but he didn't mind he got to spend time with Dylan And that was precisely why he was now wandering the back streets of Surrey at 11:00 p.m. on a Wednesday dodging dogs, Curious foxes and even a few coppers who were rolling slowly down the suburban streets of little winching.

It was July and the heat from the 95ï¾Ÿ day was still emanating from the pavement he could feel it through a snickers as he jogged along behind his older cousin who dragged him behind yet another decorative topiary shaped like Margaret Thatcher S faFavorite docson Stewie.

TheThey had another block to go crawling behind a tool shed to not activate the floodlights and mrs o'learys back garden and climbing over a few more chainLink or picket fences That glowed faintly in the moonlight that way only a newly painted utterly white wooden sense can glowGloomily under street lights as if it was by a luminescent deep in the Atlantic without a spark of sunlight rather than dividing property lines on a suburban street in Southern England.

Justin got his jeans caught on the tip of one of the particularly more pointy pieces swearing as it tore into his pocket after checking he wouldn't have a splinter he tore off the rest of the fabric just in time for his cousin to pull him behind a parked car on the corner as another copper rolled by and then they saw it Susan his cousin Dylan's girlfriend a year older that had a brother with a license they were sitting on theBonnet of a decrepid old pick up truck that looked like it was more at home in the Yorkshire countryside rather than in Surrey but Susan's older brother Derek had bought it 3rd hand from a friend that went to Cambridge so it was kind of grandfathered in acceptable because the residents of Surrey had been seeing it since sometime in the early seventies. So like mrs figg's tall shed the by laws allowed for it even though it sparked a bit of grumbling from the neighbors periodically.

Dylan started walking across the street with Justin behind him introductions were made curtly before Justin was scrambling into the back seat and Dylan was telling him not to embarrass him before he started attempting and failing to engage in cannibalism while devouring his girlfriend's face the tongue work was quite impressive and made Justin turn a similar shade to freshly picked rhubarb and glance out the window to avoid seeing it.

They drove for what seemed like an hour but was really most likely 10 minutes before they came to an old stone building one of the few fields still standing around new constructions there was a cemetery on 1 side a churchyard on another and a decrepid old farmhouse with stone buildings behind it Susan's older brother Derek told him helpfully when he looked at it a bit too long that that was the old dairy it had been converted sometime in the 1800s when the church was still in use and they started walking quickly even though Justin tried to walk across the field Dillon grabbed him by the back of his coat and dragged him towards what looked like a metal door in the middle of a field.

When Justin looked at him questioningly his brother just said dad's army used to use it as if that was sufficient explanation for his cousin who had stopped attending mugh Mughal school when he was 11 they didn't get to that bit of history just yet World War II was typically covered lightly in 2nd grade and then avoided until students were about 12 or so and could understand it more thoroughly.

So Dylan Derek Susan started prying up the rusty door before conscripting Justin into the effort he took the bottom right hand corner and pulled they managed to get it hoisted open just enough for each one of them to slip in Derek waiting for the last of them with Dylan pulling just in behind him they climb down the shaft and Derek slammed the lid behind him plunging them into darkness making just and panic for a moment before Dylan pulled out a torch and well they started walking he could feel the vibrations from the music already.

It was barely a minute before he sSaw the flashing strobe lights and hood heard cheering.

Before he knew it they were in the thick of it teenagers everywhere bottles of wine beer and soda Coca-Cola precisely because it was dark enough to cover stolen rum and not get stopped by the coppers littered the area green silver and gold cans littered the ground some crushed under boots and others taken over by small insects or other critters living in the corners but that didn't matter because there was a live band playing calling themselves doctor fluffy and the moobs, And old school British punk scene it seemed and Dylan was dragging him towards one of the camping coolers in the center of the Room fishing out a couple beers and handing 1 to his cousin who grinned it was the 1st 1 anyone besides his dad when he asked for a taste when he was about 7 had willingly given him . The Justin's parents had spent most of their formative years in America so they had a much more reserved approach to alcohol than most of the British population when it came to teenagers it was bloody annoying when he asked for a glass of wine with dinner and he was told not until you're 15 like your cousin.

Quickly Justin cracked it open before dealing could change his mind and down a few sips before making a disgusted face and looking around them as if he couldn't believe they were willingly drinking the foul tasting liquor and it made his cousin her brother and his cousin the girlfriend laugh at him making Justin impersonate rhubarb once again and well walk away from them for a moment. At the time he turned back they were gone disappearing into the crowd and he had been absorbed into a dancing group one of the girls most likely 17 grabbed him by the shoulder her pupils dilated to the size of saucers and screamed she loved this band before dragging him with her into the crowd Justin half panicked half shocked stumbled after her and ended up jumping to the beat in a sardine can formation with about 20 others for almost a quarter of an hour before the band took a break and then he saw it on a busted table that was still standing with only 3 legs someone iIndustrious had sawed off the good leg and duck taped it to the center of the opposite end so it was mostly balanced like a tripod they were playing beer pong on it until the boy that had climbed up shouted for attention his black hair was damp with sweat he wore torn jeans and a bit too big T-shirt dirty trainers but it seemed everyone knew him and he was shouting for their attention people grew quiet waiting in anticipation for what was next it seemed with this circus the boy might be the ringmaster.

And then it registered when he got a good look at him green eyes sparkling under the flashing multicolored laser lights, Harry fucken Potter was a dressing a crowd of partying teenagers in Surrey in an underground bunker, He was holding what appeared to be a rotisserie chicken in one hand and a beer in the other before declaring loudly, With a slightly drunken slur" Let's give it up for the paltry effort of our entertainers Simon I got you dinner."

Making everyone laugh and the rather large fellow who was the lead singer of doctor fluffy stepped from his smoking area to collect the chicken and the beer that was offer before grinning as if that was his payment for performing for the evening maybe they had some kind of arrangement where the band would play for everyone's entertainment and someone would feed them in exchange for it it wasn't unheard of even Justin knew about that kind of thing from watching the news and hearing about the early days of The Beatles and The Sex Pistols.

With that Harry laughed and then promptly jumped off the table before those standing around him in close proximity caught him and he started making his way under not his own power but various hands pulling him forward on the crowd towards were just in withstanding making people laugh and bellowing" kings Potter"

To Justin's write another table was set up and someone was pulling out beers and a stack of cards willing participants were meandering forward more laughter and then justin was pulled in another direction by the 17 year old girl that seem to remember he still existed saying something about her sister pilfering a bottle of champagne for the occasion justin didn't know what champagne was his knowledge of liquor consisted of small beers and his mother's wine coolers he hadn't really been paying attention to the different classification but nonetheless grinned when the girl popped the cork on the bottle and they were both drenched in the Amber explosive liquid it reminded him of hogwarts when Dean Thomas had accidentally blown up his pumpkin juice In 2nd year.

Out of morbid curiosity after having a few swigs he took a turn
