Out of morbid curiosity after having a few swigs he took a turn of pulling the 17 year old girl with him through the crowd towards where Harry Potter was playing a game of kings with what looked like 2 bikers or guys who wore way to much itEyeliner and 3 girls who could probably either be classified as delinquents or aAngels who, And if depending on which of their mothers you asked Only if it was on Sunday Only if it was during Sunday dinner.

Harry was laughing talking to one of the guys before leaning forward and kissing 1 of the girls on the shoulder she giggled and kissed him on the cheek afterward Potter had clearly done the dare before the boy that had spoken to him earlier took a swig and said something making a few boos and Cries of coward echo through the underground chamber they were currently in habiting.

As Justin made his way towards the table maybe 5' from Potter his drunken schoolmate caught a glimpse of him and Harry turned to give him his full attention for a moment grinning and shouted his name Justin before turning back to the people at the table and informing them happily enough apotHarry Potter appeared to be a happy drunk which was useful information just in filed away for later before Harry informed rather loudly the entirety of the table he was sitting at that Justin from hogwarts was here and he wanted a few people to verify he wasn't a wHallucination brought on from a bit too much from the bottle... Justin couldn't help it His inner huffle puff demanded retribution, So just for that moment Justin told the 17 year old girl he was with whose name he still hadn't gotten he should probably ask for that he added as a mental note before telling her to walk like an Egyptian just as the collective eyes of Harry's companions focused on them just in with a completely solemn face as if he was at a funeral at Saint mark's started doing the traditional dance of the in Intoxicated sorority girl approaching Potter at an upbeat pace with the girl he was with behind him mirroring his motions and from the crowd after a beat they heard a chorus of walk like an Egyptian and a few of the drunker members of the crowd of the party started following suit they got a laugh and a rather worried look from Harry before he is drunken brain caught up with the circumstances and he laughed. Telling Justin he'dOffer him a chair but they bolted the 6 the 1 to the ceiling and hadn't gotten it down yet Justin looked up to see a solemn oak chair with a red cushion hanging rather securely from the roof over the tunnel chamber thing they were in and laughed.

With that Justin was dealt in and he found out the 17 year old girl he was with was named Mary and went to miss Alicia school for gifted young ladies in North hamptonshire she was visiting her sister for the summer.

They spent a good hour alternating between playing kings dancing when the band decided they had recuperated enough until Dylan came to collect him the only question he got after his cousin approached him was the words how the hell do you know Potter as if Dylan was jealous of him for a moment.

Justin just told his until that moment cooler more sophisticated older cousin who just in was now realizing was just another teenager like him a simple one word answer school.

And then laughing in a slightly drunken stupor before climbing backup the tunnel and Derek in front of him pushing open the rusty hatch that opened up into a field there were a few mostly sober other teenagers milling about and Derek paid one of them to drive them home so nothing that would happen.

That was the evening the1st of many that summer in Surrey where Justin hung out with Harry Potter made Dylan jealous and learned a bit more about life outside of mughal London.

He Went back the next night with Dylan this time actually making conversation with Derek who was an alright bloke once you got to know him and you looked past the grumpy exterior marry the girl he had been with the night before sought him out the moment he arrived and kissed him about 10 minutes into the evening he had a stupid grin on his face the rest of the night while talking to Potter and one of his overly eyeliner friends named Drake who worked at a kebab shop in London on the weekends
