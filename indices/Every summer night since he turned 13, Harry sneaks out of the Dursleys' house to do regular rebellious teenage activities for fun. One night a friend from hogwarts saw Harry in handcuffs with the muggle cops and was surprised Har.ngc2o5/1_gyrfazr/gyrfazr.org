Justin Finch-Fletchley was bored.

He HATED his fathers fancy dinners and meeting with pompous brats who thought that because they both came from money that they would both think the same way or have the same interests. Ignoring magic, which really would be enough on its own, Justin's mother was a commoner and raised him with humility and grace that his father found bemusing, if nothing else. These rich tits never seemed to understand that he would rather rough it for a week in the woods or walk through the city on a clear night than eat fancy food, in fancy buildings, wearing fancy clothing, with other fancy people.

Lucky his father more often than not let him wander as he would. There was always a bit of fun to be had, some new shop to explore, or someone new to meet.

Tonight though he was stuck in Surrey, with NOTHING to do but walk and look around. Off to one side he could hear the raucous laughter of others, young sounding too, along with the sound of breaking glass.

With nothing else to do he followed the noise.

It was a bunch of teens, his age or a little older or younger. He could see cans and bottles in hands and the one in the middle currently chugging, one arm around a young girl with boyish short hair. The group was chanting as he drank... And then he pulled the empty bottle down and Justin saw a VERY familiar sight: Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived.

Not only was Harry one of Justin's classmates, but also another wizard.

Also currently throwing his empty bottle into the windshield of a nearby car to loud cheers.

Then he heard it, the sound of the police, saw the flashing lights.

To Justin's bemusements Harry got the others to run, gave the girl one last kiss, and sat on the hood of the car, lighting a cigarette as he waited. With no more than thirty seconds he called out, "Harry!" and the boy froze as his head turned, lit cig between his lips.

The green eyed boy just stared, a smile beginning to crawl across his face, but saying nothing. He tried again, "What are you doing? Run! I can take you to hide with my father." Whether or not said father would turn Harry right over to the fuzz was a different story, but worth a chance.

The boy just started laughing, pulling free a small flask and offering a cheer to Justin before taking a swig and throwing the flash as hard and far as he could towards the oncoming car with flashing lights. Even as he ran the boy could hear the 'tink' as the metal bounced off the police car.

From the distance, barely able to see as a female officer slammed Potter into the hood of the car whose window he had smashed, all Justine Finch-Fletchley could hear was jovial laugher.

It was another six month before he got to ask Harry, whom had on returning to Hogwarts been the same trouble magnet he ever was (though oddly NOT a trouble maker, as much as Snape and Justin's own memories would say otherwise), why he had stayed and get picked up by the officer.

The boy had gotten the same grin on his face he had seen that August night, "How could I let my mates get caught? I bought them enough time to get away AND I got to embarrass my family, that's a win-win!"

Justin just stared, trying to comprehend...
