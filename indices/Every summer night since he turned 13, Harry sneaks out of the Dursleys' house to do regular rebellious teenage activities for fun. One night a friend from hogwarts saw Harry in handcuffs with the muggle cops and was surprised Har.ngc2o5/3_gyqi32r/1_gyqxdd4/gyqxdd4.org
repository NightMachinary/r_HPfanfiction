There are 2 Harry/Daphne fics I've read recently that are similar to this concept

There's a Harry/Ginny fic I read that deals with her following him when he sneaks out of the Borrow one night. He goes to a magical tattoo parlor under an alias and then a muggle dance club. It's been a while since I read it and I can't remember the name.
