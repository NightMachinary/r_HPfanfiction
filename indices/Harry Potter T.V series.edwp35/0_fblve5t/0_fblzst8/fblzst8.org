Huh, I can see JKR allowing something in the Mauraders Era. Not necessarily along the lines of the linked story but in general. It would leave most of canon untouched and let her try curating scripts for a full season or more of television.

So far she has books (original) and movies (Fantastic Beasts). TV seems like a natural further step, and is something people would probably love, and seems very doable after Game of Thrones and Witcher....and all the other book settings turned into TV.
