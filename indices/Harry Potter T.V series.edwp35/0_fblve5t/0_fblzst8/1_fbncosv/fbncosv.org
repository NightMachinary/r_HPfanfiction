What if it was set with a (say, 15 year old) Tonks as the main character? That would be old enough to have the Harry Potter world backdrop & some of our familiar supporting cast & lore, while also adding depth to things briefly mentioned in the backdrop, while also avoiding stepping too much on canon's toes and at the same time avoiding the Problem of Pettigrew.

Tonks as a clumsy yet talented person with a unique/rare talent & defined ambition would be a good lead too - she's also halfblood of Pureblood and immediately muggleborn stock for a foot in both worlds vibe, and if we could see her dating other people it would soften her eventual relationship with Remus. Also a soft focus on Andromeda would set us up for welcoming her into Harry's family post-DH. (I think I've convinced myself, I hadn't thought of all of these when I started writing this comment!)
