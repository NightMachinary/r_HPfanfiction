I am waiting on Witcher until I have a few hours in which I can focus on it. But I have heard a lot of good reviews of it.

I never considered Founders' Era....I have read almost no fanfiction for it, admittedly mostly because I have no emotional interest in it to spend the time to try it.

One huge benefit of it might be the ability to bring in all sorts of 'ancient' magic and concepts and traditions and such which have been lost to current magicals.....it could even have themes of deminishment ala Tolkein which would add some darker background theme that could be presented almost subliminally.

Huh, you have my imagination spinning up all sorts of scenarios! I might have to do a dive into Founders' Era fic soon...
