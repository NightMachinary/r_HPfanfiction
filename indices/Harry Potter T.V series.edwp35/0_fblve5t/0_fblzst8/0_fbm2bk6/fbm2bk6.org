Oh yeah, I just watched the first episode of Witcher. Seems great! And it kind of makes me want a TV series set in the times of Hogwarts founding too (not as much as I would love to see the Marauders), but it would pretty cool to see some destiny-themed story where the four founders start out with their own stories and are eventually brought together. Would be cool to see some fight scene with the basilisk. Or maybe baby basilisk? lol
