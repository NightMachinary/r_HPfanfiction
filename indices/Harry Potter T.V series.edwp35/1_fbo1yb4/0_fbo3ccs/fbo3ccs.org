I feel like I wouldn't want it to end after the war. Imagine how cool it would be if it continued and went from first year through to seventh year then showed them getting jobs and all the weird stuff young adults do in their spare time.

I know I'm probably getting ahead of myself but it would be so cool to watch them get over the war, study, move, get jobs, go out shopping, weasley weddings, night life.

This is honestly more fantasy than "it could really happen"
