I could be into one focused on those collecting info for and reporting on the resistance radio news in DH. Something which concerns me w TV shows is that is if they don't have a very obvious end-point they will go on too long and ruin themselves so I'd want it to be something somewhat contained like that - war ends, TV show ends, done.
