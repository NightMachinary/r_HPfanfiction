Given that Hogwarts is implied to have about 40 students per year (yes, other years and houses could be bigger, but especially with magic flying around much more than 20 per class is stretching it I feel), that only allows for a wizarding population of a few thousand. I head canon it as there are several schools in the country with Hogwarts being the most prestigious.

Those who send their children there are in the upper tier of society. Lucius is rich and influential in government, the Longbottoms were decorated Aurors, the Potters were rich and historied. Even Arthur Weasley is a department head and incredibly well connected at the Ministry (see the World Cup, both how many people he knows and getting top box seats).

The exception are the muggleborn. I assume that there is some sort of historical quota for muggleborn which is then allocated somehow, maybe by money or school performance or randomly.
