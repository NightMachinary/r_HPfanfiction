I just think that Hogwarts has figured out 'one person, one value' concept that so many real-world social reformers try to achieve. The son of a low-level government worker like Ron Weasley attends the same class as an aristocrat's son like Draco Malfoy - because wealth inequality has been separated from the opportunities given. I think the only requirement to attend Hogwarts is to possess magic (‘We believe he has qualities we are looking for.' - Dumbledore to Mrs. Cole), and the school itself takes care of all the fees and equipment cost if the attendee themselves cannot procure them.

Isn't this what Dumbledore tells to Tom Riddle?

  When he had finished he turned to Dumbledore and said baldly, ‘I haven't got any money.'

  ‘That is easily remedied,' said Dumbledore, drawing a leather money-pouch from his pocket. ‘There is a fund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes. You might have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on second-hand, but -‘

Easily remedied... That's what Dumbledore says to Riddle's financial problem. Of course the school fund isn't going to allow him any more money than is necessary (second hand books and robes, but a first-hand wand), but it is still /enough/ to attend the school and classes.

I think the reason why the Weasley family, and Ron in particular, had to go through yearly financial crisis for books and robes was simply because they refused to go to the Hogwarts fund for money. Had they done that, at least Ron wouldn't have had to enter Hogwarts with a second-hand wand.

If Hogwarts is super luxurious then I don't think Weasley family would be able to afford it at all, they barely keep their heads above the water with little to money in reserve. In fact, I'm certain that St. Mungo's in all likelihood also has similar system for the under-privileged in need, because I don't see how Arthur and Molly could've afforded that Nagini treatment in fifth book. Also, I don't think dentistry is a luxurious job. Comfortable yes, but I don't think Grangers are swimming in gold like Malfoys.
