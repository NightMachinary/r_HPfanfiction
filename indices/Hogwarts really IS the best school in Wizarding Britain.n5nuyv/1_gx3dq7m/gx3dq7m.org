The fic I'm working on (but haven't posted) uses this concept.

Muggleborns are allowed to go to hogwarts for free. It's a reason why many purebloods have some resentment towards muggleborns.

Otherwise, your acceptance is determined by your legacy (if your parents went) and a very large fee from before you are even born.

It explains why hogwarts is primarily pureblood and muggleborn even though the majority of the wizarding world is halfblood (or so Rowling says)
