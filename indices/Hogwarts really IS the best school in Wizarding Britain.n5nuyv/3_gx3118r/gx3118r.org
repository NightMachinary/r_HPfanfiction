I've seen multiple fics using some combination of that (though sometimes with the insinuation that it's not actually giving the best education). Loose Cannon, for instance, uses something resembling your "option 1", with the caveat that Muggleborn are all assigned to a school by the Department of Mysteries, so Hogwarts is the "best" school in the sense that it's the oldest and wealthiest and has all the Ministey connections (but other schools have been basilisk-free for longer). That Glorious Strength goes darker with it: Tom Riddle gets Ministry permission to found his own school as a way of keeping mudbloods and uppity half-bloods from trying to get into Hogwarts. New Blood I think was more #2, with most magical people attending minor regional schools or apprenticing at a magical trade (and a whole class of magical peasants whose children don't go to school at all). I don't think I've read a fic where the other schools are intended to be as good as or better than Hogwarts and fail...

Personally, I like stories where there are other schools in Britain and they give their students more skill and knowledge more effectively than Hogwarts, but the value of a Hogwarts education is greater because of its admissions selectiveness and alumni network (exactly like how the value of a Harvard diploma comes from the admissions office and alumni office, not the classrooms in between).
