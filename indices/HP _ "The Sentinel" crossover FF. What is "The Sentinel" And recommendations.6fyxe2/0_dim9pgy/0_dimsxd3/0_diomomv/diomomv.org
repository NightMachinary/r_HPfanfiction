Well, part of the mythos is that since they're "protectors of the tribe", most are male. Usually upwards of 90%, depending on the story. So it would follow that when you pair them off, you get a lot of slash. Some stories make a point of having all or some platonic bonds, but most of the authors are basically treating it like a soulmate trope, but with extra abilities.

Tl;dr: most are slash, if you don't like, search for platonic.
