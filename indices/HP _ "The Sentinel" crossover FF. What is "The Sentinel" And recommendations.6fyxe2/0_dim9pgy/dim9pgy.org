Yeah, it's the Canadian tv show. A sentinel/guide semi-coherent fanfic trope loosely inspired by that show has circulated slash fandom for a number of years. It's like the a/b/o fanfic trope or soulmark trope or other-fandoms-characters-in-Hogwarts trope - you can sort by it on AO3 and it transcends fandoms. [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Sentinel_AU]]

Basically, the sentinel has hyperextended senses and in some fics super strength, but needs a guide to help him manage it. The guide also has super senses, other abilities vary, and sentinel/guide pairs bond specifically to each other like soulmates (the trope is usually used for romance) and sometimes fight evil. There's usually worldbuilding around the sociopolitical aspects of sentinel/guide relationships.
