Keira runs a challenge site on which Sentinel crossovers are quite popular. In fact, one challenge was specifically for Sentinel crossovers - that's actually what Duality was written for. Many were reposted later: [[http://archiveofourown.org/collections/littleblackdresscollection]]. There are at least a few HP ones.

Keira has another one, Ten Years After the War, on her site as well. It's linked on that page.
