Draco had no reason to fight against his family and Draco didn't live in fear of his parents' disapproval. "Terrible shit" amounts to being given orders and having his parents' lives threatened. In other words, Draco did terrible shit because Draco was a terrible person. And he did terrible shit /before/ Voldemort returned and /after/ Harry saved his life.
