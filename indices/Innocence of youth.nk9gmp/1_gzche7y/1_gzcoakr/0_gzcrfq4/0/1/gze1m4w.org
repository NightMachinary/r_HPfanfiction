"He had Morals, just no backbone" And how is that any different from not having morals? Also, Draco wasn't just a passive observer in the war, he actively engineered Dumbledore's death, and wished for the death of his /classmates/ at the age of 12, solely because of his blood. He didn't take sanctuary with Dumbledore even after being offered to, and even tried to straight up murder Harry and Co in the final battle, and still claimed that "he was on your side", your being the DEs of course. And you saying "his family was abusive" is completely false, that's one of the things emphasized in the books. No matter how Horrible the Malfoys are to the "mudbloods", and how prejudiced, bigoted, and reactionary they are, they do love each other. Remember Narcissa in HBP? And the classic "My father will take care of this?" Doesn't sound like the things an abused child would say. Also, btw, I despise the double standard where people downplay Draco's misdeeds and demonize literally EVERYTHING Sirius done. That's a general statement btw, not in response to something you said
