  He had no reason to fight against his parents?

Yes, for the same reason Narcissa had no reason to fight against Voldemort until her husband became a colossal failure: they gave him no reason to.

  Draco wasn't without morals
#+end_quote

Draco wished death on all muggleborns, attempted to get an innocent animal killed because he could, bullied students, and attempted to murder several people.

Had Dumbledore died from the necklace or the mead, Draco would've been just fine. Draco's issue was that he had to look at Dumbledore.
