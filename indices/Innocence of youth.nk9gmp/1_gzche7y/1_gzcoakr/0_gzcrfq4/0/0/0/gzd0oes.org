Agreed.

Draco was a little shit because he was a little shit, not because he was some tragic character. He was a cunt, period, just like how Snape was a miserable excuse for a human being that should've been shot in the back of the head.

People confuse Alan Rickman and Tom Felton for Snape and Malfoy, just like how they do Emma Watson for Hermione.

The only reason he "changed" after the War was because not only did Voldemort treat his family like shit, he saw that the epitome of his beliefs weren't the sunshine and rainbows he believed them to be, and he had a whole load of proverbial cold water dumped on him.

Hell, even his parents after the War, despite Narcissa saving Harry, were implied to still be such shitty people due to their "disagreements" with their daughter in law over muggles and muggleborns -- Astoria, and likely the rest of her family, were bigoted too, until she similarly was changed by what she saw during Voldemort's second rise (Cursed Shite).
