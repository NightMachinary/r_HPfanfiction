You admire Draco?

He was racist. Spewing racial slurs left and right. Do this in real world, scream the N-world everywhere at the top of your lungs and let's see how many people will admire you.

He was a mentally deranged individual that would not care about collateral damage as long as he achieved his goal. That's how Katie almost got killed.

He brought terrorists into a school full with children on order to kill an old man. He sided with a terrorist organisation and I'm pretty damn sure you don't get to be one of them without having a few tortured or killed muggles/muggleborns on your record.

You people need to get your heads out of your fantasies and remember the damn canon. Draco was never the tragic character that needeed to be protected. He was very much his father's son. A snake that would always go to the winning side and eliminate whoever stood in hid path. Even in the final battle he stood up against Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

This goes to show how shallow some of you people are. Loving a horrible character simply because the actor that played him was a cute guy.
