This. I have always considered the realism of description of teenage stupidity one of the best traits of the books. Jealousy, bigotry, stupidity of boys about girls and vice versa, crushes, blind following of the parental examples, all of it.

If you are not ashamed how stupid you were when you were sixteen, then you are no more than seventeen.
