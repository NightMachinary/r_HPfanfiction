I've tried to implement this in the (only) hp fic I wrote, and I completely agree with you. There is no question that Ron and Hermione were Harry's steadfast friends, and there never will be.

I think the reason that many people apply this scenario is to show Harry as completely alone in the world or to introduce another character (or an oc) to be Harry's sole emotional support.

In my experience, fic authors who use the first scenario, use it well, and extremely well. They use it to cut off Harry's emotional ties to Hogwarts (his respect for Dumbledore will be gone because of some scandal brought to light) so that we get a lot of Harry being self-sufficient in magic and others.

If it's the latter, it's probably a cringy self-insert. Self-insert authors do this so that the blame falls on Ron and Hermione (and whoever else is getting bashed) instead of on the oc or Harry for leaving them.

(I know this isn't the discussion, but I've thought about this topic a lot and Harry being self-sufficient just so happens to be one of my favorite fanfic topics)
