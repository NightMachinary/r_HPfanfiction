Wut.

I like an arrogant tosser throwing his name around to make things happens as much as the next (slightly off-colour taste) person, but that doesn't change the fact that he's an arrogant tosser. In fact, that's the whole point. Why'd you make him a misunderstood emo?

As for the rest, sure. Never is never, which is to say, Tom Riddle could have done that, so you're wrong, but naturally neither Hermione nor Ron were Tom Riddle, so I guess the point is academic.
