So this is a little offbeat, but linkao3(Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce) is a great fic where Ron's character shines through and he gets to step out of the trio and expand his horizons. It doesn't make any of the trio seem ooc or mean either to make the point. Gordon Ramsey is of course a bonus.
