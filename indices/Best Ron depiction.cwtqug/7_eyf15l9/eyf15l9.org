There aren't a lot of Ron Centric stories.

He's used as comedy relief or a traitor simply because he's so well placed for those parts if the writer wants to use him that way. I mean, face it, making Draco the bad guy is a bit redundant, and trying to make Neville into a bad guy takes a whole lot of work, I've only seen it done well once, in JBern's To Fight the Coming Darkness. (To be clear, Nev wasn't THE bad guy of the story, he just became one through circumstances and grief.

I've used Ron as a non-idiot, not comedy relief lead character twice.

The first was a 'Marriage Law' one-shot I did, mostly because I hadn't done one. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4070610/79/Thrilling-Tales-of-the-Downright-Unusual]]

The other is Speed, where we hear about Ron gaining access to the Speed Force when visiting the cousin the Weasleys don't talk about who turned out to be Wally West's father, from his own words after he's being debriefed by a version of the Justice League after basically saving the world.
