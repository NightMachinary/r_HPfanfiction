*Harry Potter's most excellent adventure* - linkffn(11619134) Stargate/HP Crossover\\
Humor/Crack - After the final battle in the timeline\\
Harry ends up crossing paths with SG1, antics happen. Ends up "borrowing" a mirror that connects to alternate realities. Finds one where he died on that Halloween, but parents survive. Voldemort is still alive, but hidden.

Prior stargate knowledge is helpful, but the majority of things is explained as needed.
