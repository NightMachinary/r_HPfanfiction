I've avoided this story for so long because I didn't care for the synopsis, or the fact it was Dimensional AU. I find it to be very well written, intensely enjoyable, and to feature perhaps my favorite ever portrayal of Luna Lovegood. It's relatively heavy on angst, but it's essential to the story in my opinion.
