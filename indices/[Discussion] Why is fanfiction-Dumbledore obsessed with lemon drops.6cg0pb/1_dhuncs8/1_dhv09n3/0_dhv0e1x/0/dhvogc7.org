Storytime!

When I was in school, primary, I used to suffer from anxiety and I would be fidgety when dealing with people I didn't know. I was headstrong and dealt with all the issues and faced them, but I would often shift and it was rather distracting to other people.

One of the teachers noticed and handed me a mentos that was covered in colourful plastic.

The thing was fucking impossible to open.

I would sit there all lesson trying to get it open. At the time I didn't realise that I could still pick up information and not be distressed by the twenty other people near me. I focused on getting that goddamn plastic open and eating the sweet.
