Making him a manipulative bastard who gets nothing done and relies on a bunch of kids to win a war he could have prevented is a 100% canon accurate representation of Dumbledore. He had one scene where he actually did something besides being incompetent and that was the Ministry Battle, which would not have occurred if he was a competent leader or actually gave some people vital information ("Hey Harry, Voldemort can get into your brain and mess with you. And he wants something from the DoM so better not go there.")
