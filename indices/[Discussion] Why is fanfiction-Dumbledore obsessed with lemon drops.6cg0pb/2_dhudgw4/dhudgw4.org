  McGonagall opened the door and stepped into the Headmaster's office, then stopped and stared.

  There was a /poodle/ in the Headmaster's chair. One with white-grey hair, and had distinctive markings around its eyes in the form of Dumbledore's usual spectacles.

  "Er..." McGonagall started, lost for words.

  The poodle barked and wagged his tail.

  "This is going to be a difficult budget planning meeting..." McGonagall sighed to herself.
