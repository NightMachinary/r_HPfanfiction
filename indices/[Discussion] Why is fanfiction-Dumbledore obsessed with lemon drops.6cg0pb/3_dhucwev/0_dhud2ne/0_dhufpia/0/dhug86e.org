That's exactly it. Honestly, in my opinion, canon Dumbledore wasn't evil in any way, but alright, that's interpretation maybe.

But I haven't ever seen a well written Bad! Dumbledore, to the point where I actively avoid fics with them, which seem to be all of them right now. It was so refreshing to see a good Dumbledore fic, and that was so long ago I don't remember it anymore...
