  canon Dumbledore wasn't evil in any way
#+end_quote

Other than leaving a baby on the doorstep of his magic hating relatives (in november), then never stepping in to stop the obvious neglect (don't tell me he didn't know, Mrs Figg should have at least noticed the hand me downs and malnourishment)

Or and setting up a trap for the dark lord in a school. Or not closing the school when there's a magical death glare snake loose.

Other than that he's squeeky clean.
