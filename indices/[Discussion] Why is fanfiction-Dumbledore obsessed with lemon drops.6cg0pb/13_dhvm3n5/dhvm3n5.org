I think it's because Minerva was so disapproving of him eating sherbet lemons at what she considered a solemn occasion. So I guess someone first used it as a way to highlight Dumbledore's frivolous indifference to the seriousness of the characters plight.

If Dumbledore has a lemon candy, he's an inconsiderate ass hat who disregards other peoples wants and needs, and this is illustrated by his fussing around with sweets instead of being serious.

For the record, I just don't think Dumbledore was very upset. Firstly, he's very old and has known lots of people and lost lots. He wouldn't have known James and Lily very well. McGonagall would have, but Dumbledore barely spoke to Hermione and Ron - James and Lily would not have been close to him. He would have been sad, yes. But, Voldemort had just unexpectedly been defeated, after some very long, hard, dark years. Sadness that yet more people had died, would have been overtaken with relief and gladness.
