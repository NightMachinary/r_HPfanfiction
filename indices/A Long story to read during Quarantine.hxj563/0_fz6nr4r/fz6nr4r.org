It has some really good fanfictions of its own. Just search for hpmor, or the longer title if you search for fanfictions. (I think that's an accomplishment in itself, to have fanfictions of your fanfiction).

Someone rewrote the first 5 chapters to a little better style after the whole story have been finished to fit into the later chapters more smoothly. You can start with that if you'd like to.
