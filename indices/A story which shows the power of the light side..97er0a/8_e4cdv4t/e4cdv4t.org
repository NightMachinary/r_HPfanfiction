If you think about it, purely from a perspective of putting down the other guy, stupefy is probably the best spell - short, simple, and essentially guaranteed to put down the other guy in a fight. Dark spells are all well and good, but injury doesnt stop a person from casting spells, and the killing curse isnt really a short incantation, not to mention it's apparent difficulty.

Dark magic is destructive, but perhaps not necessarily all that effective when it comes to actually fighting :p
