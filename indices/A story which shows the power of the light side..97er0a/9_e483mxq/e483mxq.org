Well, there are some very intimidating light wizards in linkffn(Significant Digits), including destroying Fiendfyre with hard vacuum, aerial bombing Azkaban using Phoenix travel, and Hermione /ripping a backup wand out of her own arm, disguised as an ulna/, but it's a sequel to Methods of Rationality, so if you haven't read or didn't like that, you probably wouldn't enjoy this.

And yes, they have a Patronus charm that can destroy Dementors.
