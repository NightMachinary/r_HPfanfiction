There was a story where Harry dropped a boulder that was reduced to the size of a pebble and after entering the wards it took back it's size. Don't remember which story it was but I'm pretty sure time travel was involved.

It's not really light side magic but it's not dark. More like neutral one. But what is dark and light? For example I wouldn't put love potion under light magic as it is mind control.
