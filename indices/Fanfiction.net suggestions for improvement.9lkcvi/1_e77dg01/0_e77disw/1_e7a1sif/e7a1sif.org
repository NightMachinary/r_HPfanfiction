I don't like to get email notifications for stories as I'll see the notification and get distracted from things I need to do. Instead I keep a found of bookmarks for the fic I'm waiting for updates to. In that folder are sub folders. They are titled. Slow to update, Possibly abandoned, likely abandoned. Things that only get one update once a month or more go in the slow to update folder. After six months of nothing they move to possibly abandoned. A year of no word and it moves to likely abandoned. Given this, when I saw your suggestion I laughed since it lines up pretty well with how I already sort.
