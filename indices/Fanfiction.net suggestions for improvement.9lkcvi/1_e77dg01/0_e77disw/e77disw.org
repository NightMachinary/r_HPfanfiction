I agree completely. It's just a thought I had. I was thinking something along the lines of no updates in 3 or 6 month gets a "slow update" And maybe nothing after 12 months gets an abondoned. And as soon as the author posts again the tag will come off.

It's not so much for the posters as it's more for readers.
