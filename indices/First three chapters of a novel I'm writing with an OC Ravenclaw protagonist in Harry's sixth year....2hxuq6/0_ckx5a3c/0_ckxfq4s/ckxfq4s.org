Thanks so much for your insight and for giving it a read!

The name has come up repeatedly in reviews - everyone finds it very annoying! Is it the full name, or is Sapphire irritating, while Sapphy is ok?

The funny thing is that I have a friend named Safi so I think I'll be keeping this whole thing a secret from her to spare her feelings :P
