  Sirius Black twirled his wand between his fingers, eyes making a lazy sweep over the panicked denizens of Diagon Alley. Timid shopkeepers peered at the group of Death Eaters from windows and doorways, a woman screeched and flailed under the Cruciatius, and Nagini sprawled in the sun, a humanoid bulge in her stomach.

  Black groaned. "Right, five minutes and I'm already bored. Any chance we can head back?"

  Voldemort said, "I'm surprised at you, Black. I distinctly recall your enthusiasm for raids."

  He shrugged. "Eh, I've got papers to grade and six kids in for detention tonight. Having a job kinda sucks."
