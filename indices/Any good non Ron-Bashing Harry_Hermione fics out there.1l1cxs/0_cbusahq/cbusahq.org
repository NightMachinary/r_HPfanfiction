I'm on my phone right now so I can't link it to you but if you look through my history there's a thread I started a whole back asking for favorite H/Hr fics that got a reasonably large response. As far as fanfic preferences, I'm in the exact same boat you are so any of the fics I posted in that thread should have very little to no Weasley bashing Happy reading!
