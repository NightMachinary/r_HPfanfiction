I admit it's been some years since I read this, but if there is Ron bashing, I remembered it as having been rather low-key and not the overt character assassination we normally see in bashing fics. If I recall, the author's venting her distaste for Ron plays out as a much-diminished role in things. Dumbledore, I remember, is treated sympathetically.

Thank you for the reminder though. I apologize if anyone was disappointed by the consequences of my faulty memory.
