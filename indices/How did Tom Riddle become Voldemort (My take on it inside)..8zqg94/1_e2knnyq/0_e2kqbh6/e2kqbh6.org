I think we overlook the time period he grew up in. He was a boy in an orphanage during the Great Depression. That can't have been easy as orphanages would have been grossly underfunded.

Then when he discovers magic he is sent back to an orphanage during WW2, powerless against the bombs falling around him.

He knows that he could easily be defended from the muggle weapons either by magic or by being allowed to stay at Hogwarts, but yet he is alone and in danger at an orphanage. He can't cast a single spell to protect himself.

WW2 in my mind was the biggest part in defining who Voldemort would be.
