Yes.

*Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), Harry went back to 1975 and turned Bellatrix. I was very skeptical at start, but thought to give it a try based on 9000+ favorites. Now it has become one of my favorite HP fanfics. The story is creative, credible, funny, and contains tons of intrigues. [[/spoiler][There are a fair amount of actions involving the Marauders, including Lily competing against Bellatrix for Harry's affection, and Bellatrix pranking the Dursleys.]]
