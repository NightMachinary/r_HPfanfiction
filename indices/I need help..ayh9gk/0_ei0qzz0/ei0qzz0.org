It sounds like you are trying to pad out your story beyond what is needed. My suggestion is do the exact opposite.

Instead of worrying about adding more Quidditch or something else to offset the massive amounts of fluff you already have think about editing and reducing the fluff you already have to maintain the balance you are looking for. You will avoid unnecessary padding and hopefully identify and keep the best of fluff you have already included.
