Maybe instead of Fluff for Fluff's Sake, you can consider another approach? Generally, multiple characters in a big story have arcs going on. You'll get a close focus on the protagonist, but through their perspective you'll learn what's going on with their friends/family/rivals too. And sometimes those arcs interact with the protagonist's arc too.

So if Fluff A is “these two characters are having a sweet rom com,” maybe Fluff B is, “these two buddies are trying to maintain a friendship despite pursuing the same romantic partner,” and Fluff C is, “so-and-so's sibling has their first crush!” Except the B and C plots have some bearing on A, too. Like how Hermione and Ron's drama over Crookshanks and Scabbers tied in to the main plot of PoA.
