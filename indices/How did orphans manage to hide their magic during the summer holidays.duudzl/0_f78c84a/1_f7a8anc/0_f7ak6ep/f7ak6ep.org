Theres really different evidence in multiple sources of how many students there are at hogwarts. At one point Harry says 1/4 of students are wearing green when going out to play quidditch in book 3 and says theres 200 slytherin students which is where I got the 800 number. I like to think that Harry's year is abnormally low because it was during war time and people weren't having children.

I like to think theres around 800 students because otherwise the british wizarding world is just too small when extrapolating from the number of students to the entire british wizarding population.
