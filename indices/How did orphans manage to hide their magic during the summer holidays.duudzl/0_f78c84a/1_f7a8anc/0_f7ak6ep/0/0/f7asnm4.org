“While I imagined that there would be considerably more than forty students in each year at Hogwarts, I thought that it would be useful to know a proportion of Harry's classmates, [...]”. -JKR

And 40 students per year means extremely low population. It means only 40 births per year, takeout 20% as muggleborns then you've 32 people born in to magical families. The Average global birth rate was 18.5 per one thousand, so total population would be around 2000. A government with multiple departments, a bank, a shopping district and a jail for 2000 people? I don't think that was viable.
