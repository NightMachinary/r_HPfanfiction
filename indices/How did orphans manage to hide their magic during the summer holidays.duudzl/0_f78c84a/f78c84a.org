Well for one, orphanages dont exist in the UK anymore. The closest youd get is group homes. And I believe most kids in the fostercare system are placed with a family rather than a group home. So in that case, the parents and family would know about the magic stuff.

Harry's year is apparently 20% muggle born based on JKs class list. Let's assume theres about 800 kids in hogwarts at any one year.

In the UK in 1990 the population was 57 million. Roughly 20% of this is children. A statistic that I just googled is that theres about 65000 children in foster care in the UK and that's probably recent so I'm probably overestimating here. Anyway 65,000/(57,000,000*.2) = .0057

Now I just googled and in the US for all foster kids only about 1 in 5 are in group homes. Let's assume that's true for the UK as well.

So between 1990 and let's say 2020, that's 30 years and assuming 115 students per year that's a total of 3420 students. 20% of them are muggle born and they have a .57% chance of being in foster care. 114×30×.2×(.0057)= 3.9

So rounding up about 4 kids and we can assume only 1 of them was in a group home.

So probably someone made some magical arrangements for the kid to be cared for by either a magical foster family or a muggle family.

True orphans are extremely rare, especially muggle borns whose parents wouldn't have been involved in the wizarding wars. I mean technically Voldemort wasnt really an orphan. His biological father was alive.

Anyway my point is, voldemorts situation is probably so statistically rare that I dont even think the scenario is possible.
