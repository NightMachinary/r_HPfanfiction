"I bet she'll be in Gryffindor," Ron said, "bossing everyone around like that," as Hermione bustled out of the compartment, still in search of Neville's toad.

"Gryffindor? Is that bad?" Harry replied. He'd rather fancied the House of the courageous, imagining solving mysteries and fighting dragons.

Ron was incredulous. "You-Know-Who went there!"

After Hagrid's story, Harry had thought of Voldemort as a monster, coalescing fully formed from the shadows, murdering for the sake of murder. Had Voldemort been a child once? Would Harry be taught in the same classrooms, maybe sleep in the same dormitory? It was a little unsettling.

Seeing his confusion, Ron went on. "You-Know-Who wanted to rule the whole world, Muggles included. You can't get much more brave or show more nerve than that. It's the House for people who don't compromise their principles, who think they know best."

"Is Gryffindor all Voldemort supporters then?" Harry shuddered to imagine a whole House of people who hated him. Would he have to go back to the Dursleys?

Ron shook his head. "You also get Muggleborns like her," he waved his hand vaguely in the direction Hermione had left in, "thinking the Wizarding World needs to be improved." His voice turned scornful. "Made logical! Modernized! Turned into a copy of the Muggle world! I read in the 70s there were pitched battles in the common room between different factions. Neither could back down because that would be cowardly."

"So what House do you want?"

"Hufflepuff of course! The house of the average, of people who accept their limitations."
