If you have a conversation with a group of people, then just use their names. Real novels generally don't use "the blond" or "the brunette" to identify who is speaking, and fanfic doesn't have to either.

With regard to making dialogue easy to follow, you only need to put a "he" or "she" or "Harry said" or the like every once in a while to remind the reader. It doesn't need to be every single line.
