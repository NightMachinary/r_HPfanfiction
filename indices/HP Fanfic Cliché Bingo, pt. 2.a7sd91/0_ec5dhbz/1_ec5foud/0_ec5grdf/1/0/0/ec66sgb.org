Sure, but they also have height and weight requirements, as well as vision tests. I just wanted to offer a parallel that /flying/ is not immune to physical requirements. Astronauts have to be physics-wizzes as well as physically fit. Quidditch is a sport, and anyone who has grown up playing sports will know that physical activity will keep them somewhat in shape. Being physically fit can only make you better at your job.
