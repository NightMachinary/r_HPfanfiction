Oh great. Now I want to write a fic where the Dursleys are /actually/ the family from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Instead of living on Privet Drive, they live in that shack where they hid from the letters in canon. Dudley has a habit of wearing and consuming human flesh and has a chainsaw fetish. Petunia goes door to door, asking for cups of sugar. After getting invited in, she subdues the family and forces them to kill each other. Vernon stalks targets in the streets, axing targets in alleys.

All the while, poor Harry is dumped on their front door by a well meaning Dumbledore. He grows up absolutely hating the people he is forced to grow up with. Not because he is appalled by what they are doing, but because they're doing it so /badly/. He views himself as more of a Jigsaw Killer-esque individual, using intelligence and engineering ingenuity to keep his own hands clean and getting people to effectively kill themselves. A far more elegant method of killing, in his opinion.

And then he gets his letter.
