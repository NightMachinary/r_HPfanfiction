Because of a certain combination that some acid-molecule has in some areas of your body, you can suddenly break all of physics, including conservation of energy.

I'm sorry, but I don't find that all that logical, and harder to believe. It's much easier that there is a meta-physical (read: magical) component already involved somewhere else.
