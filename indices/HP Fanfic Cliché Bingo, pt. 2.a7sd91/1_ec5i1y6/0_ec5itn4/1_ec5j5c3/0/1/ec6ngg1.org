New headcanon: "Soulmates" are people who got got so emotionally intimate with each other that their souls /mated/ and made /soul babies/. A woman develops a close emotional connection to a wizard and suddenly all her kids are magical even if she never had physical sex with that man. And since I strongly believe souls are beyond anatomical sex (because emotions don't need physical parts), if any witch or wizard forms an emotional connection with any man or woman, the resulting children from the muggle might be magical.
