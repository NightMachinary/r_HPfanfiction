Souls are on a separate plane of existence, and "being alive" means that something physical (a body, usually) is connected to it. Generally, you need a mind to handle that connection.

Every living thing has a soul, but some souls also have the property that they can (locally) manipulate the physical world around the wizard.

If you die, the connection is severed, and the soul will move to yet another plane.

When two humans have sex, the souls are heavily involved, and sometimes can produce a child. (Basically, both souls merge a little to produce a new, independent little offspring)

The child's soul might be "magical" randomly, but it has a very high chance if one of the parent's souls was magical, too.

Most of the plot-holes could probably be filled by longer explanations, but I'm too lazy to go into it. And when it comes down to it, the model is heavily inspired by some mathematical and physical ideas that I'm definitely misunderstanding. However, for my fictional story I made them mine.
