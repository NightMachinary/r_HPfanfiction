Ok but that trope being canon has WAY more problems than it being fanon. Namely, in that it means purebloods are right, and muggles literally are a different race than magicals. Like, if magic can't arise in muggles, period, than the only other option is being two closely-related species with a common ancestor. How else could there be a race of “humans” with magic, if it didn't just pop up from a non-magical world?
