There's always expressivity and penetrance of a certain genomic trait to consider (you could inherit a dominant trait and randomly not express it because biology, fuck yeah). Also, if it's a one-gene trait, and has two alleles, it's possible that the "magic" only manifests when the host is a heterozygote, and the trait goes unexpressed in either dominant or recessive homozygotes.

Ot it's the other way around.

Or there's also letality, which, let's not.

Obviously, Rowling doesn't have a degree in genetics, the ratio of squibs and magicals is nowhere near Mendelian (or squibs are shoved so deep into the dark that we've no chance of discovering the true numbers) and this is a children's book.
