I believe her exact words was that it's a "resilient, dominant gene," which makes no goddamn sense considering the fact the two purebloods can have a squib and basically anyone born with a magical ancestor should be magical themselves. It would work better as a recessive gene, but really if we wanted to bring genetics into it it should just be described as a "magical gene" that hasn't been studied enough to be fully understood.
