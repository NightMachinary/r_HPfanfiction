The second part I definitely agree that's bad wording. But inbreeding (which, look at the Gaunts) seems to be a factor considering how small the wizarding world must be---I mean, we see over and over how inept wizards are with anything muggle (Quidditch World Cup), so they can't live in muggle towns, and there's only a few magical villages....

And inbreeding could easily explain squibs born to pure bloods. Especially since we don't know exactly how common squibs are. We see what, 3, 4 in the entire series?
