To be fair we don't really know how small the wizarding world (in Britain or otherwise) is. We only see what Harry sees, and we're never given an exact number in canon. I think JKR gave some ridiculously small number but she's never been good with math. Also, I only recall seeing a bit of inbreeding (mainly in the Black family tree) and it seemed to mostly be cousins, which shouldn't have a negative impact on the genetics.

Then again I'm not an expert so I could be completely wrong.
