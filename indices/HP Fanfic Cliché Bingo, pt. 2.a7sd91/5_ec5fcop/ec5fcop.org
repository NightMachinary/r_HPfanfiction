Here's something I just thought of: Sirius as some horny, sex-crazed manchild. I don't really get that characterization at all from cannon, but it seems like he's commonly portrayed that was in fanfiction.

Perhaps because of the popularity of "A Black Comedy?"

Also, "Eyebrows raised into his hairline" --I mean, what? I've read this line in several different places, and it seems physically impossible. It's a weird exaggeration, in any case.

Anyway, love these. Keep 'em coming!
