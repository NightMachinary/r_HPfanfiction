There's fics that portray James (and the rest of his friends) as people obsessed with pranks, brilliant at Transfiguration but average at everything else.

Canon James is seen from only one scene, which is from fucking Snape's POV - the most unreliable narrator of them all - and even there, James and Sirius are talking about how laughably easy they found their OWLs. This is the person who became an animagus at age 15, enchanted the Marauders' Map, and the mirror sets around the same age, survived Voldemort 3 times without any +silly+ ridiculous Deus Ex plots, and fought the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters for over 2 years, until he's forced into hiding for the sake of his wife and son.

But nope, he has to be average at everything else other than Transfiguration.

Even when they pick on Snape, we see enough from Snape's later memories to form a conjecture that they could be getting back at Snape for his use of the Dark Arts on fellow muggleborn students. In the memory where Lily tells Snape that she thinks James is a toerag, she's also calling him out for using Dark magic against a girl named Mary Macdonald - which Snape says he did for laughs. It's not assuming much to think that Snape had been cursing muggleborns as stress reliever or some shit, and James and his friends thought it was time for a bit of payback.

But nope, James has to be a "prankster" and a "bully".

There are also a lot of fics that call Voldemort a bully. That's just so...ugh. Honestly, I want to read an anti-trope where the fucker who says that crap gets slapped by a passing parent/teacher who lost family members in the war for making light of a megalomaniac.

Also, Lily being portrayed as a fanon pre-Hermione or something - a perfect girl with no real negatives, other than maybe her temper. Fun fact : Lily is a terrible judge of character. She was friends with fucking Snape for five years. It took a yell of Mudblood to finally open her eyes.
