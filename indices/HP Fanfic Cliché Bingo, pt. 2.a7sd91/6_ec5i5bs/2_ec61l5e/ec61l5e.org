A fic following Tom Riddle through Hogwarts and he slowly goes from rational sociopath with goals of making the magical world better (rights for non-humans, etc) into the chaotic, paranoid madman that is Voldemort would be interesting. Something like The Sum of their Parts but from Voldie's perspective.
