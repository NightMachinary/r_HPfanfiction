  Did he fight, and if so, was he on the defensive?
#+end_quote

Raids are, by very nature, offensive. The Death Eaters participated in raids. So this is clearly a no.

#+begin_quote
  Did he see torture happen or take part?
#+end_quote

Definitely both. Under Snape's term as Headmaster, the Cruciatus curse became the preferred form of punishment.

#+begin_quote
  Did he kill, or only help others to kill?
#+end_quote

This is mostly irrelevant. Helping others kill a man makes you an accomplice, and you'll be given the same punishment as the ones who did the deed themselves.

#+begin_quote
  Did he torture, or did he brew nasty things, create spells and keep lookout for others?
#+end_quote

Yes to creating spells. Sectumsempra is his own creation - at 16, I might add.

There was also espionage involved, as Voldemort thought Snape to be on his side. For Snape to actually keep his place without losing his head, he'd have to provide information of some kind or the other to Voldemort.

Brewing potions is almost definitely a yes. He's not a potions master for nothing, and Voldemort would be a fool to waste talent that's just there. In the first war, Voldemort was no fool.

As for the murder, torture and everything else - Voldemort had a finite number of followers. If one of those followers consistently did nothing but sit on his hands during planned attacks, that follower would come under greater scrutiny and eventually be disposed of. Snape, for all of his faults, is a brilliant wizard. He wouldn't do something as stupid as not kill while being a part of the Death Eaters.
