Most people can understand that the Muggleborn Registration Committee slaughtered muggleborns in Azkaban/other camps even though it isn't explicitly stated anywhere.

Just like that, most people can understand that Death Eaters in the First War did fight, raid and murder a lot, even though it isn't explicitly stated. Voldemort's name, followers and mark didn't become as feared as they were because Voldemort liked to brag about his power, or host tea parties, after all.
