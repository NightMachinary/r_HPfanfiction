  nothing suggests he survived voldemort, the thrice defied didn't necessitate him even being in contact with him- it also refers to things like refusing him, getting a follower arrested etc.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore says they thrice defied Voldemort when he's describing the prophecy to Harry - he's directly comparing Harry's exploits with his parents', so it is a reasonable conjecture to state that their defiance did not involve refusing him (like Voldemort would ever take a refusal to the face in good spirit and walk off).

  because we never hear or see him do it
#+end_quote

Going by this logic, we never see Snape murdering anyone, but it's quite clear that he murdered and tortured several people during his years as a Death Eater before his supposed "awakening to the light", but anyone with a brain knows he did those things. Voldemort and friends did not plan to take over Wizarding Britain by hosting tea parties and holding debates.

Snape hung around Mulciber and Avery who cursed people for laughs - it's extremely unlikely that he wouldn't have indulged in those same things from time to time, or he wouldn't have been close to them in the first place. You'll lose your friends in school quite quickly if you're vehemently disapproving of their activities. Snape even attempts to defend Avery and Mulciber, you know that?

  lily flat-out says calls james a bully, blasts him for hexing people for no reason,
#+end_quote

Lily is a terrible judge of character - she was friends with Snape, of all things. You know, the same Snape who makes a fucking tree branch fall on her sister's head because she said something he didn't like? The same Snape who almost said, "She's only a muggle," regarding Petunia's feelings at age 11? She was friends with that Snape for five years.

And before you say accidental magic, Lily shows that accidental magic can be more or less controlled in a memory.

  hagrid likens them to the weasley twins- pranksters
#+end_quote

The Weasley twins aren't "pranksters", in spite of the best efforts of ff authors. They do a grand total of 3-4 things across 7 years that come off as practical jokes - giving Dudley ton tongue toffee, giving Ron a canary cream, and the show against Umbridge. That's it. 3-4 jokes across 7 years does not make them pranksters.

  their detection records that harry sees in 6th year attest to what they did
#+end_quote

Going by this argument, when Harry's sons see their father's detention records, will they too think that HP was a prankster? Harry gets detention for months (until the end of the book) after the Cruciatus/Sectumsempra incident. Harry spends weeks in detention under Umbridge's tender care during fifth year. His first year - his first year! - he gets detention in the Forest after a whopping 50 point loss in one swoop.

If you think that detention records make the man, well...
