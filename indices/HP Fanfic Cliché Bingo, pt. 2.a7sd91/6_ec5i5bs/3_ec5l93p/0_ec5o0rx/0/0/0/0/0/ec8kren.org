nah, most of what /you're/ saying is fanon, assumptions, or just changing canon/making things up (like with the hexing mary thing)

  definition of a prank: a practical joke or mischievous act.

distinguishing between pranks, practical jokes, trouble-making etc. is being ambitiously obtuse. the twins create an entire shop around selling joke objects. it's their entire brand and legacy. that's their reputation

from canon:

  “Precisely,” said Professor McGonagall. “Black and Potter. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both very bright, of course --- exceptionally bright, in fact --- *but I don't think we've ever had such a pair of troublemakers* ---”

  “I dunno,” chuckled Hagrid. “Fred and George Weasley could give 'em a run fer their money.”

  “Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape?” he said. “Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?”

  So yeah, don't give me the BS about Snape not torturing or killing anyone.

...the /carrows/ are the ones leading the punishment. we see that snape tries to avoid that, like sending ginny and co. to the forest with hagrid. we don't know how much sway he had over voldemort. even then, this is snape at 38, we're talking about him before his defection, where no one accuses him of that

that's /your/ headcanon about what the DEs/snape did. snape could have been mostly a spy/intelligence. he could have been their medic. also, we have no idea when snape joined the DEs at all. for all we know, delivering the prophecy was his first mission
