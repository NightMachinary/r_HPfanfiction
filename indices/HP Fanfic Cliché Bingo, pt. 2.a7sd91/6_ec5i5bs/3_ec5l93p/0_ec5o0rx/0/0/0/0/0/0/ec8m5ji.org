  distinguishing between pranks, practical jokes, trouble-making etc. is being ambitiously obtuse

  but I don't think we've ever had such a pair of troublemakers ---”

  “I dunno,” chuckled Hagrid. “Fred and George Weasley could give 'em a run fer their money.”

The only one who's being needlessly obtuse here, is you.

Mouthing off teachers, getting into verbal/physical fights with other students, wandering in areas that are out-of-bounds, breaking curfew, skiving off class, sneaking into Hogsmeade on school days, getting drunk/providing drinks for other students in a school, stealing Snape's potions --- none of these can be called practical jokes or pranks. All of them can, however, be called trouble-making.

Compare those things with charming Percy's Headboy badge to say Bighead Boy. Or giving Dudley the toffee. The difference ought to be clear, although you'll probably come up with something obtuse again.

And before you start, those are /examples/ of what trouble-making /can/ be. It doesn't mean that Fred and George do all of that, even though they do check several of that list.

  Inspired by Fred and George's example, a great number of students were now vying for the newly vacant positions of Troublemakers-in-Chief.

Again, with the same thing. That "example" of theirs is one of the only legitimate pranks that they actually do.

  the twins create an entire shop around selling joke objects. it's their entire brand and legacy. that's their reputation
#+end_quote

Opening a joke shop makes them entrepreneurs and businessmen, not pranksters.

They market minor love potions in their shop too. According to your logic, although it's getting difficult to call it that, Fred and George no doubt dosed girls with love potions. And pygmy puffs - no doubt Fred and George were raising those during their days at school.

  .the carrows are the ones leading the punishment. we see that snape tries to avoid that, like sending ginny and co. to the forest with hagrid. we don't know how much sway he had over voldemort.
#+end_quote

We know exactly how much sway he has over Voldemort. He's the fucking right-hand man of Voldemort. Voldemort trusted Snape enough that the task of killing Dumbledore would have fallen to Snape, in the event of Malfoy's failure. He trusted Snape enough to make him Headmaster of a school where every single witch and wizard were educated. He trusted Snape enough to take his suggestion over Yaxley's regarding the Order's extraction of Harry. He held Snape in such a high regard that he waited several hours after his resurrection for Snape to show up and report - in spite of Snape's actions against Quirrel, and indirectly, Voldemort - while he swore death upon a few others that failed to show up. Heck, he even takes Snape's begging into account and offers Lily a couple of chances to move aside.

The Carrows answer to Snape, not the other way around. If Snape wanted to stop the Cruciatus punishments, he could have easily stopped them, and the most the Carrows would have been able to do was grumble.

  for all we know, delivering the prophecy was his first mission
#+end_quote

Right, Voldemort would task someone to bring information on something he doesn't know exists yet.
