  You like double standards, don't you? It's perfectly alright to give Snape the benefit of the doubt, but not for Fred and George.

...because fred and george have an established reputation as pranksters. regardless, i *am* /assuming/ they prank people in their spare time, because they enjoy it, and people call them pranksters. and we do see them doing pranks, you just argued it wasn't enough. no one ever mentions snape hexing muggleborns, killing anyone, or torturing anyone

and 'give fred and george the benefit of the doubt' lol. they'd be offended that you're denying their status as pranksters, and probably that you're denying MWPP, the makers of the map, were also.
