Most of what you're saying is fanon.

Fred and George have no established reputation as pranksters. They get up to mischief, like wandering around the Forest, or being in kitchens, or ribbing their siblings - but none of that can be described as pranking, except maybe the Bighead Boy moment. They joke around a lot, but that isn't pranking FFS.

  and we do see them doing pranks, you just argued it wasn't enough

Yes, it damn well isn't. 3-4 pranks across a span of 7 years doesn't make anyone a prankster. Imagine an analogue - you do the bucket on a door prank on three separate people when you were 13, and people keep calling you a "prankster", when you're 20. Just think how ridiculous that is.

  no one ever mentions snape hexing muggleborns, killing anyone, or torturing anyone

The Cruciatus curse became the preferred form of punishment under Snape's tenure as Headmaster. Snape was Voldemort's right-hand, he could have changed/averted that easily if he'd wanted to, and Voldemort would have listened to him. So yeah, don't give me the BS about Snape not torturing or killing anyone.

Snape was a Death Eater for 2-3 years before Voldemort decided to hunt the woman Snape was wanking off to. If you think that a halfblood Death Eater was refraining from participating in raids, torture and murder during all that time without drawing Voldemort's attention and suspicion, well, you need to stop wearing kiddie lenses.

Even though it isn't explicitly stated anywhere in the books that muggleborns were slaughtered in camps like Azkaban, it can be inferred quite easily by anyone with a brain. It is the same thing with Death Eaters who willingly joined Voldemort in the First War - you'd be have to be incredibly naive to think that they were just chilling out in black robes and face masks during the First War.

  what in canon contradicts her statement that defying doesn't necessitate confrontation?

I've already said that Dumbledore directly compares Harry's defiances with those of his parents. You can only compare those things if they're on the same level - no one is going to say Mundungus Fletcher defied the Dark Lord when he apparated away like a coward. But since you asked for it, here:

#+begin_quote
  'The odd thing, Harry,' he said softly, 'is that it may not have meant you at all. Sybill's prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys, both born at the end of July that year, both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix, both sets of parents having narrowly escaped Voldemort three times. One, of course, was you. The other was Neville Longbottom.'

  'He chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him,' said Dumbledore. 'And notice this, Harry: he chose, not the pure-blood (which, according to his creed, is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing) but the half-blood, like himself. He saw himself in you before he had ever seen you, and in marking you with that scar, he did not kill you, as he intended, but gave you powers, and a future, which have fitted you to escape him not once, but four times so far-- something that neither your parents, nor Neville's parents, ever achieved.'
#+end_quote

As you can see, there's a direct comparison between Harry's escapes and those of his parents'. That the escapes were preceded by confrontations is easily inferred, since it is a direct comparison.

  they'd be offended that you're denying their status as pranksters, and probably that you're denying MWPP, the makers of the map, were also.

By far the most irrelevant thing in your comment.
