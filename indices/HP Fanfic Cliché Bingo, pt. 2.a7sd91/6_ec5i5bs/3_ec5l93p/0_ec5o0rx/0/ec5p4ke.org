  (like Voldemort would ever take a refusal to the face in good spirit and walk off)
#+end_quote

voldemort didn't have to request them to join in person, or if he did, that could have been one of their defiances. the refusal point was stated by jkr: it didn't necessitate confrontation. dumbledore was speaking generally.

  Snape hung around Mulciber and Avery who cursed people for laughs - it's extremely unlikely that he wouldn't have indulged in those same things from time to time, or he wouldn't have been close to them in the first place.
#+end_quote

maybe. you said lily said snape hexed mary, which is straight up false. which is my point- that snape hexed muggleborns is an /assumption/, because there's no explicit canon for it. if there's no explicit canon, you can only assume. and it's not clear that snape tortured or murdered several people at all, lol. we don't know what his role was, or what he did.

  And before you say accidental magic, Lily shows that accidental magic can be more or less controlled in a memory.
#+end_quote

no, lily shows /lily/ can control it. we only ever see tom riddle control his magic pre-hogwarts like that. lily is a terrible judge of character- that doesn't mean everything she says is wrong. she's describing something she observes: james hexes people for fun, /which is confirmed by lupin/

  That's it. 3-4 jokes across 7 years does not make them pranksters.
#+end_quote

we don't follow the exploits of the twins. who knows what they do all the time. they had the map. denying that the marauders are pranksters/bullies is one thing, but the twins? lol

#+begin_quote
  If you think that detention records make the man, well...
#+end_quote

this is being obtuse. /mcg calls them troublemakers/. they make trouble. their detention records, described as 'petty misdeeds', harkens back to that
