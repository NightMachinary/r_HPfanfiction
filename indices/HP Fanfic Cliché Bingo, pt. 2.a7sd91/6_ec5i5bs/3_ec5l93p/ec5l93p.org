it being snape's POV is irrelevant, because pensieve memories are objective

nothing suggests he survived voldemort, the thrice defied didn't necessitate him even being in contact with him- it also refers to things like refusing him, getting a follower arrested etc.

lily never says snape attacked mary, she says avery and mulciber did. it /is/ an assumption that snape cursed muggleborns, because we never hear or see him do it

lily flat-out says calls james a bully, blasts him for hexing people for no reason, which lupin also confirms. harry challenges sirius that they attacked snape for no reason, and he doesn't deny it. their detection records that harry sees in 6th year attest to what they did. even mcg calls them troublemakers, and hagrid likens them to the weasley twins- pranksters
