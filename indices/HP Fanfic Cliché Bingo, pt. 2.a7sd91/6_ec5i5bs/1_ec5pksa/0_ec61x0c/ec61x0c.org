10 year old Snape gets so angry at Petunia saying something he doesn't like, he makes a tree branch fall on her. You could call it accidental magic, but Snape and Lily (along with the Marauders) are always said to have been brilliant wizards, and if Lily can control her accidental magic, it isn't a big leap to assume that Snape could as well. But you can overlook that if you want to - for the sake that it's accidental.

11 year old Snape almost says, "She's only a muggle," regarding Petunia's feelings, which is something you'd expect to come from Draco Malfoy's gob.

11 year old Snape makes a jab at James' father before he even knows James' name, for no particular reason other than the fact that he's an asshole. Sirius asks James which house he'd want to go, and when James responds, "Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart! Like my Dad!", Snape snorts and says, "Sure, if you want to be brawny rather than brainy..."

Snape even attempts to defend Avery and Mulciber after Lily calls out on their use of Dark magic on a girl.

Lily "the great crusader against bullies" Evans can overlook all of that just fine.
