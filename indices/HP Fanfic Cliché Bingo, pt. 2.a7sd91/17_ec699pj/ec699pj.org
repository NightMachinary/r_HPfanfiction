Having recently dipped a toe into the AO3-ier side of HPFF,

- brown Harry with Indian ancestry, mentioned once and never relevant again

- gay marriage has been accepted and common among purebloods for hundreds of years; heteronormativity is muggle nonsense

And I saw one instance of Harry getting really angry about Ludo Bagman ogling Fleur, because ~sexualizing teenagers~, which seems to be from the same Tumblrey memeplex but hasn't become a pattern yet. It was jarringly anachronistic for something that's supposed to be set in the 90s, though.
