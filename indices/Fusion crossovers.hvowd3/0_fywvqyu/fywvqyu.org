linkffn(A FILFy Teacher) One of my favorite long fan fics.

linkffn(The Godslaying Wizard)

Linkffn(The Spider's Web by Merrick Mayfair)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Invincible TechnoMage)

linkffa(Horus Goes Home - Saga 1 :Back Again by SamStone) Cool concepts and generally entertaining story with a god mode Harry. However, the prose is really rough, it winds up with a bad case of harem bloat (despite an MC that has lots of casual sex and little reason to add to the actual harem), and the ending drags a bit.
