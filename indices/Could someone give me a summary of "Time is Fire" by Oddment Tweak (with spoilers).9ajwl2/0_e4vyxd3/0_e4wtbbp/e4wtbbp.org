To add to that:

After future Hermione convinces future Harry to stop meddling, her timeline is erased. Thus Harry and Hermione admit their feelings to each other during the horcrux hunt, but in the process create a timeline in which Hermione inevitably dies.

Future Harry eventually becomes MoD finds a way and sacrifices himself during the Malfoy Manor escape, thus granting Hermione the same protection that Lily gave to Harry and saving her from Bellatrix's Avada Kedavra during the final battle.

This ends up breaking the loop in which Hermione is destined to die. In the end they get their happy ending.
