Not sure about a memory charm. Hermione realises that her world isn't "right" and that Harry messed with it. Harry went back to the past to convince his younger self not to start dating Hermione to save her life. Then future Hermione meets/seduces time-travel Harry to stop him from meddling

Something along those lines. Long while since I've read it.
