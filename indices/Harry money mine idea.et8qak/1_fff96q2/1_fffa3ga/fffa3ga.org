You are thinking about thermodynamic losses in a heat engine, which doesn't apply here. Also combined cycle gas turbines can be over 60% efficient in current plants.

Harry is probably just spinning a dynamo. Those are 95+% efficient. The primary loss is in converting statistical motion into ordered motion, once you have general order converting it is really quite efficient.
