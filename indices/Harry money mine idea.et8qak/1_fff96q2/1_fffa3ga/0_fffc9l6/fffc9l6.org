Regardless, its one dude working as a battery. Even at 100% efficiency Harry must be somehow producing it directly. I mean, JKs magic system is pretty soft. They violate the laws of thermodynamics constantly since first year, but here the spell involves spinning the damn thing constantly to power a city. I think you'd need more layers of magic hand waving for the concept to have legs. Make something up with runic arrays and a new spell or something.
