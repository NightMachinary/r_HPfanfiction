Lazy or not I agree it wouldn't work out like that. The spells wear off eventually in canon except for Transfiguration, which is permanent in canon. Enchanting things to do stuff however is canon, even if it's never explained how enchanting works.

So he could cast a feather-light light charm on a turbine and then cast some type of spinning charm every few minutes/hours/days or however long it lasts.

The easier option would to be just enchant the thing and forget it about if for a few decades. Maybe come back once a year and throw around a few reparo spells at most.

Soft magic allows for game breaking stuff super easily if you want to do so.
