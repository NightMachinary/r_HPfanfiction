That's what I meant with the magic system being soft and hand wavy. And I also added the "if magical exhaustion is a thing". Once you start to combine technology with magic you need to add some layers of fantasy so you don't break the suspension of disbelief. You have to admit it's a bit lazy to have someone wave their wand once and create infinite energy.
