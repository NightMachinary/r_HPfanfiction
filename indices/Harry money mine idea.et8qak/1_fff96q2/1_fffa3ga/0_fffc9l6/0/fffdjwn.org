It's magic. There is no limit to JK's magic. People trying to explain it using physics always amuse me, because they assume some form of energy transfer or anything like that, when it's not. The mechanics of the spell are whatever, but the end result is indusputable - infinite motion without clear cause.

Magic in JK's world doesn't have physical limitations like power levels, people don't run out of mana or spell slots, there is no limit to the amount of magic you can cast beyond your knowledge. If you know how to draw upon and cast a reductor as large as your house, then you can do that.

In your model, the "energy draw" could very well be applied to the spell affixed to the rotor, which means Harry doesn't have to contribute anything, and makes it not he a perpetuum mobile anymore, since it's then just a magical power plant converting magical energy into motion into electricity.
