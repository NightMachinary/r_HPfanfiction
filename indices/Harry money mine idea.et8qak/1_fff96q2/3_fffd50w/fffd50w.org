You just do "Turbinius Spinnum" (or whatever spell that makes it spin) on the shaft (don't even need a turbine, you could probably replace the physical one with an illusion), and it begins to move. That motion translates through the shaft into a reverse electromotor, which uses the motion of magnets to induct electricity. electricity = money. If the shaft is long enough and doesn't conduct magic, then there's no problem.
