A turbine: [[https://energyeducation.ca/wiki/images/2/2c/Hydroturbine_schematic.jpg]]

As you can see in that image, a turbine is a set of +rotor+ blades mounted on a shaft which spins depending on the force exerted on the blades. The /other end/ of the shaft sticks into the generator where the actual electrical wiring is located which generates electricity via. electromagnetic induction.

Thus, the turbine is purely mechanical and the length of the shaft keeps it at a distance from the electrical wiring.
