  The magic is only on the turbine and can be kept completely away from all elctrical wiring but still Harry can make a fortune.

How would the electricity generated get to the power grid if the turbine is away from all the electrical wiring? If magical exhaustion is a thing, that means that the energy to move the turbine is, at least in part, coming from the caster. Which means that even if you take it to an extreme, there has to be a limit to how much energy a single person can produce. The caster would be constantly drained to keep the turbine going and turbines are /very/ inefficient, so something like 70% of the energy required to spin is lost as heat and sound. That means that Harry would have to produce about 333% of the energy required to power a city. By that point you might as well take the turbine out of the equation and invent a new spell or something .
