Magic doesn't mess with electricity.

Seriously, it doesn't. Look at all of these HIGHLY Magical locations smack dab in the middle of muggle society:

- The Ministry
- St. Mungoes
- Diagon Alley

If magic really interfered with electronics as they said they do, those areas would be electrical dead zones. And then the muggles would investigate. The magicals would obliviate. The Muggles would go back to investigate. This logic loop would eventually end up with the statute of secrecy getting broken and maybe a muggle vs magical war.

What I do see happening is some bigwigs making wards to prevent electronics from working and propagating the "magic hates electricity" myth.
