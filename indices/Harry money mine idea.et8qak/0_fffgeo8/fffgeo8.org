I'm all in favor of using clever ways to (ab)use magic to trick the system, but you you gotta stay under the radar.

You can't just buy and operate a fucking powerplant without anyone asking questions... Not only would the muggle government find out immediately that this doesn't make sense, you would be too public to hide it from the aurors as well.

The trick is to remain low-key and not draw attention. Here's how I would do it:

â€‹

1. pick up old and broken junk from the scrapyard.
2. "Reparo" it to fix it up
3. Sell it as an antique in mint condition to collectors.

That's easy, low-key and doesn't attract the attention running a powerplant would.
