People might notice if a power plant isn't getting any shipments of coal. Better spend some money buying a fusion startup first and pretend that they managed to get it working as cover story. Then make big profit, hire more wizards and build thousands of power plants around the world, solve climate change and the ICW is probably okay with it since you have a good cover and if secrecy ever ends and muggles ask wizards to fix their problems the wizards can be like "what do you think we have been doing the past few years? Where do you think your pollution free power comes from?"
