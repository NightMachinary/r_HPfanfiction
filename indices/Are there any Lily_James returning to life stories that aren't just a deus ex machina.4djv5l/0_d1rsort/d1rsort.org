I've actually been thinking about this same idea for a while and have been planning on writing one like that. I've always wanted a story where after Harry learns of magic he refuses to believe what people say is impossible and dedicates all his time, even if it takes years, to bringing his parents back to life. It could become like an obsession for him. I never understood why he never even thought that in canon. It would have been the first thing on my mind if I were him. He sort of did that after Sirius died in a way.
