I haven't completely figured out that part yet. What I have planned is to have Harry sort if figures out how to do it but can't complete the process yet and then he sneaks into Shapes private quartets to retrieve the marauders map that was confiscated from him and accidentally happens across a hidden room where Snape has the work he has done so far. What he finds allows him to finish the process. Im thinking maybe Snape is working in the room when Harry finds it and he overhears him talking to himself. Because of circumstances that will be elaborated upon in the story, harry can only bring back his mother. Eventually when Harry sneaks back in and completed the process, Snape figures out what happens and has some kind of mental break down I'm guessing. Lol.
