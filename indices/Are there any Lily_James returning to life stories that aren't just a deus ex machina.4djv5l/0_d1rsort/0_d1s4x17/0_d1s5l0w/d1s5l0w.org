OK cool. My idea was for that to start after Voldemort offers to bring then back at the end of PS. Harry obviously doesn't believe that he would, even if he could, but it plants that idea in his head. My idea though, based off something i read on another fic, is that Snape is also has been working on the same thing for years. He is obsessed because he somehow convinced himself that if he brought Lily back she would realize she is in love with him and eventually Harry figures this out and gets really creeped out. I should probably check out the The Art of Self-Fashioning though.
