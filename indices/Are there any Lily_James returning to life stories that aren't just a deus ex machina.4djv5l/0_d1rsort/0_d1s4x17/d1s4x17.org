That's pretty much exactly where I am. I've begun writing a little of it, and it pretty much starts when Harry sees them in the mirror or Erised. Massive revelation occurs, Harry becomes obsessed with death and all sorts of dark magic etc.

Basically, it would be pretty similar to The Art of Self-Fashioning. Harry would delve into dark magic, or magic that people say is incredibly dangerous or even impossible. But he doesn't care because it /might/ help bring his parents back.
