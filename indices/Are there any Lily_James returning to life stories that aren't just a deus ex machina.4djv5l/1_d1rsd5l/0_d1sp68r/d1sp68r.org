Actually, Muggledad is a husband and father - twin girls and a son, if memory serves. So "Real Life" is interfering with writing, not schooling.

But he's still around - saw a review from him on someone's story a few days ago.

I agree that "Last Casualties" is good. He's one of the more consistently better writers out there. "The End and the Beginning" is also quite good - a really gripping start, too, though the end is more than a bit anticlimactic. When you build up the bad guy so much in a story, you need to give readers a more cathartic fight with him at the end.
