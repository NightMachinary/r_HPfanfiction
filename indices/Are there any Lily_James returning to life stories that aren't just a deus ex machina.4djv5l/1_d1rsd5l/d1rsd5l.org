The Last Casualties is really good. Like stay up late into the night reading good. Fair warning though, it gets a bit slow and preachy at times. Believe it's by muggledad. It's super long and not even finished with updates taking a while but I suspect that may be because author is in school. Another good one is Society of the Vesta Accolates. Sorry but I don't remember the author. Also taking a while with updates. James and Lilly haven't been brought back yet but if you read it you'll see what I mean. Be warned: there is dumbledore and Molly bashing in the second one. Edit: The Society fic also has a really interesting take on the Malfoys.
