Thank you! I have been reading more about the story and writing down the ways I can think of merging it to my own plot. I thought this would be easier, but it's a whole lot of work lol still, it's entertaining and makes me want to play the game.

  I think the game does a decent job of making all of the options equally viable.

Now that you mentioned, it made me realise that there will be big inaccuracies no matter the house and gender I choose. As you said, all options have to be equally viable. So, I'll take your word for it and feel more comfortable choosing which house to put them in, rather than looking for clues in the game.

  I think the Merula subplot plays better if Jacob's Sibling is male, but that Rowan makes more sense as a female, and that Barnaby's friendship-dynamic with Jacob's Sibling makes more sense if Jacob's Sib is female.

When I first started reading about it, I thought Rowan was a girl too until I realised her gender is undefined. Now, I'm thinking that they don't have to be the same gender, and this could even influence on the sibling's relationships with other characters.

  I see Jacob's sib as a Gryffindor girl. Partially because we don't meet any Gryffindor girls for the first five years... so maybe it's the main character who fills that slot? And of course Jacob's Sib has that Gryffindor reckless bravery.
#+end_quote

These are good arguments. As I read about Jacob's time in Hogwarts, I thought of him as a Gryffindor, but of course his behaviour changed due to R's threats. Still, his sibling seems to have the same behaviour, as you said.

Though, I've seen people say the sibling should be a Slytherin because they spend most of the time manipulating other characters. To be honest, I have three main characters, one in each house - the only house missing so far is Slytherin, so I'm taking that in consideration.

  But if I were writing, I think I'd write Jacob and Sibling as Hufflepuffs. Because Hufflepuffs raising that much hell amuses me.)

Tonks is definitely getting in trouble in my story (and getting poor Charlie and my Ravenclaw OC in trouble as well), but I like this idea. She might as well bring her two best friends into this mess to help a fellow Hufflepuff.

Well, I have a lot of work to do, but thank you for the insight! It helped me understand this confusing this confusing game some more.
