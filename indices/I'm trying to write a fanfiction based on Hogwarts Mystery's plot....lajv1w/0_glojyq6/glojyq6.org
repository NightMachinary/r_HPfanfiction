  Who is in the same house as Jacob's sibling? As far as I know, it's Jacob, Rowan Khanna, who is their best friend, and Skye Parkin, who loses its spot in the quidditch team, and apparently Jacob's sibling replaces her. Is there anyone else? Are any of those incorrect?

Not only Skye, but two other "Quidditch characters:" Orion Amari and Murphy McNully.

  What house and gender do you think fits best the characters? It seems like Badeea Ali takes a while to acknowledge Jacob's sibling, so them being a Ravenclaw girl wouldn't be very realistic. I know the Quidditch Cup might give an indication of how to agree with canon, but JK herself messed with canon in this part, so I was planning on choosing who wins the cup every year by myself.

  Apart from that, can you think of another detail that strongly indicates which house and gender Jacob's sibling is or isn't?

I think the game does a decent job of making all of the options equally viable.

Ravenclaw makes sense because Rowan fits best as a Ravenclaw. Slytherin makes sense because of all the cup-winning. Hufflepuff makes sense because of Penny's prominence, especially in the Quidditch story. Gryffindor makes sense because the main character goes to Potions with Slytherins and Herbology with Hufflepuffs just like Harry does.

Many of the same-age characters who show up later make it seem like the main character couldn't have been in that house. It's not just Badeea, who you mentioned. A Gryffindor main character doesn't know what house Jae is in in fifth year? A Slytherin main character doesn't know who Liz is by fifth year? A Hufflepuff doesn't know about Diego and his dueling obsession until fifth year? And don't forget that a Gryffindor boy gets to be prefect even though Charlie is also a Gryffindor boy prefect.

I think the Merula subplot plays better if Jacob's Sibling is male, but that Rowan makes more sense as a female, and that Barnaby's friendship-dynamic with Jacob's Sibling makes more sense if Jacob's Sib is female.

And there are probably people who would argue all of these points with me. I think you are 100% safe choosing the house and gender you think fits your story best.

(I see Jacob's sib as a Gryffindor girl. Partially because we don't meet any Gryffindor girls for the first five years... so maybe it's the main character who fills that slot? And of course Jacob's Sib has that Gryffindor reckless bravery. But if I were writing, I think I'd write Jacob and Sibling as Hufflepuffs. Because Hufflepuffs raising that much hell amuses me.)
