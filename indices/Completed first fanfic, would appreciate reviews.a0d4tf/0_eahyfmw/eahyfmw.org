  The figure she had spoken to inclined his bald head. His skin glowing like pale scales, his eyes an unsettling crimson, only two slits where any other face would have had a nose. "Report!" he demanded in a low voice. Immediately, one of the supervisors spoke up. "We are almost done with the runework. Your skills in arithmancy are nothing less than marvellous! We will prepare the Source and the Sacrifice in about ten minutes." "Good. Ensure our success and I shall reward you for it greatly."

I hate to be that guy, but let's start with the golden rule of dialogue: new speaker, new paragraph. See [[https://eznguide.neocities.org/][Ezn's guide]] for details. (Sorry for the ponies; once someone makes a Pottter-themed guide to writing fanfic that's comparably good, I'll link that instead.)

(I'm given to understand that fanfiction.net sometimes eats formatting. If this is what happened, please clean it up posthaste.)

Failing to adhere to rules like the golden rule of dialogue makes your fic more difficult to read, largely because this makes it harder to follow who said what. Because it's difficult to follow what's happening, I expect most people (e.g. the discerning denizens of hpfanfiction) will simply give up.
