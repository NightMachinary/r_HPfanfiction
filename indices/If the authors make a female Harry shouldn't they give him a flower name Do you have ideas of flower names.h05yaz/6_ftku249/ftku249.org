It could make sense to do so. For instance I remember reading several fics that had the granger family use the middle name Jean for the first born girls in tribute to some long ago matriarch of the family. I've seen other fics where the middle names for the first born son is his father's and the second born is the grandfather (hence Sirius Orion and Regulus Arcturus).

Which could be another reason why so many people believed that James was Dorea and Charlus' son prior to JKR putting out on Pottermore the Fleamont and Euphemia names. Where Fleamont's father is named Henry (which Harry is considered a nickname for).

Also IRL, I know lots of couples where the father has the ultimate veto power for the son's name, and the wife has the ultimate veto power for the daughter's name. So even though Lily is a muggleborn it is quite possible that there is a naming convention for girls in her family. Which would then make sense that she names the fem!harry with a flower name.

And even though James is a pureblood I could see him letting lily name any girls simply due to how hard he chased after her. Eg he's so besotted he'd do anything to make her happy. Plus I believe there would be a bigger likelihood of a naming convention for males in James family.

Well you could go with any bright flower so Iris, Tulip, Rose etc
