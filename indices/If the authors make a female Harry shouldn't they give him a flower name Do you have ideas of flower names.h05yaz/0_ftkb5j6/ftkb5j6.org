By every you are talking about the two named in the series? A couple naming their kids after a theme doesn't make it some sort of ling running tradition.

Plus the whole 'boys named after father girls after mother's thing isn't really that realistic. Honestly, I'd say it is more likely naming/heritage is more important to one side of the couple than the other, rather than split by gender.
