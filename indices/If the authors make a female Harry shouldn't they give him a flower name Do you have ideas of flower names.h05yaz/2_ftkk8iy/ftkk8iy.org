1. There's no indication that there's an inter-generational Evans family tradition of flower names, as opposed to Lily and Petunia's parents having that specific preference (and keep in mind that children often deliberately depart from their parents' naming preferences due to changes in naming fashion between generations).

2. Even if there was an Evans naming tradition, the child of James and Lily is a Potter, not an Evans. So you wouldn't necessarily expect the Evans tradition to be continued.

3. For me, the best evidence of James and Lily's naming preferences is Harry himself, the only canonical example we have of the kind of names they like. So I believe that the name of a female Harry should reflect the same naming preferences as are exhibited in Harry's name.
