I've seen many flower themed choices in fics (Rose one of the most favored) but personally I prefer Harriet as I don't have to get used to new name for main character. Harriet is close enough to Harry to be easily interchangeable (tho shortening if to Harrie isn't my favourite).

Flower themed naming of girls don't seem to belong to only one family: we have Narcissa Malfoy (whose family favours mostly astrology themed names), Poppy Pomphrey, Pansy Parkinson, Daphne & Astoria Greengrass, Lavender Brown, Parvati Patil, Fleur Delacour, Rose Weasley, Delphini. It almost seems the wizards like to have pretty wall-flowers on their hand so they name their daughters so.

I think James and Lily could name their daughter flower-like for different reasons - Lily for sentimentality sake due to her estranged sister Petunia, James just because it's something that many purebloods do and he is very used to it.
