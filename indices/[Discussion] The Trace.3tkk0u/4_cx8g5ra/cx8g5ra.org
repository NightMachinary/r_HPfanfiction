Regarding the graveyard, I'd say it's raesonable to argue that Voldemort isn't stupid and put up protections, enchantments, wards, or whatever you want to call them to prevent Harry from being found. Something like that would either automatically prevent underage magic from being detected or that was added in (his duel with Harry was likely planned well in advance).

At any rate, I incorporated that into my current fic, since Voldemort has Potter for a longer period of time, making protections all the more necessary.

Abyranss' explanation works, but comes with the problem that /every/ spell is being monitored at all times by the Ministry. Even though only underage magicals who are alone get alerts, every spell is monitored and theoretically recorded. Yet somehow, unforgivables aren't getting caught - if this "Trace" can be used to catch kids, how can it not be modified to catch unforgivables?

Even if we ignore that, the "Trace" is still incredibly Orwellian, and while not a reason why it can't exist, it still strikes me rather too large. How on earth did anyone cast any sort of magic that monitors every single spell on the entire island?
