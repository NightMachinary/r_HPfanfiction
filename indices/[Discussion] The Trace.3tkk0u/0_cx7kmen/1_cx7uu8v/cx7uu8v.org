Thanks for sharing! About the Fred Weasley quote... I don't take that too seriously. It think it's more wishful thinking on his part. A "If they don't tell me, then I can say I didn't know." kind of thing...

The theory above, posted by Abyranass actually also makes sense with the Tom Riddle/Morfin problem.

If the Trace is a spell that only alerts the Ministry when it can't find an adult wizard in vicinity, then it would make sense that the Trace never alerted the Ministry concerning Tom Riddle's presence The Trace found Morfin and was satisfied.

The different wording in the letters Harry received is curious. My theory now is that maybe while in CoS the Trace couldn't find an adult wizard in vicinity, the presence of another being capable of using magic confused it, and that's why it was worded more neutrally, while in OotP there was only Harry and a muggle it could find...
