I think JKR didn't think much about the details of it when she first decided to have underage magic forbidden/tracked, and only really came up with 'the Trace' when she needed a reason not to Portkey/floo Harry out of Privet Drive in DH. I certainly don't have any good answers for your questions. It's conflicting, because CoS notes that "a Hover Charm /was used/", suggesting that magic is detected without detecting WHO (which we're told repeatedly), yet OotP says "/you/ performed the Patronus Charm", implying an ability to distinguish the caster. (This is, perhaps, just the Ministry being presumptive and assuming Harry was the one to cast the spell.)

Then you've got HBP:

#+begin_quote
  "[Riddle] was under age at the time, wasn't he? I thought [the Ministry] could detect under-age magic!"

  "...they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator [...] They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic [...] They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring's obedience while within their walls."
#+end_quote

- If the Ministry detects /any/ magic cast in the vicinity of an underage wizard, why didn't they know that one had been present at the time of the Riddle murders?

  - Even if they did detect an underage wizard was present at the time of the murders, and were just really bad detectives who failed to ask about it when questioning Morfin (entirely possible given what we've seen of the MoM), it begs the question of how big the distance of "in the vicinity of an underage wizard" is. The Riddle Manor is across the valley from the hill where the Gaunt hovel is, with the entire village in between. So... a mile between them, perhaps?

- Why did the Ministry never detect Mundungus Apparating from Privet Drive in OotP and blame that on Harry? I can't believe he was more than a mile from Number 4 when the noise of his Apparition is described as being as loud as a gunshot.
- Slightly unrelated, but in PS it's said that Harry is no further behind in his studies than the pureblood kids. I know Gryffindor and Slytherin only shared Potion classes at that time, but nevertheless it's implied through the book that Malfoy is no more skilled in magic than any other first year. Are you really telling me that Lucius Malfoy, Death Eater extraordinaire and all around snob, did not take advantage of a Ministry that cannot determine a spell's caster and teach his son any magic before Hogwarts?

But one theory I did come up with once was that the Trace is some kind of spell that's applied to students every summer when they leave Hogwarts. In PS:

#+begin_quote
  notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays ("I always hope they'll forget to give us these," said Fred Weasley sadly)
#+end_quote

This makes me wonder if a spell is attached to the note that activates when the children touch it (or just from having it, but most of them are going to throw the note away ASAP so that theory doesn't hold up well), especially given that Fred's comment implies that, without the note, they would be able to use magic.
