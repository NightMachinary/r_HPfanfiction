I like that theory, thanks for sharing! For it to make sense with DH though (Moody saying Thicknesse/the Ministry would know if Harry or someone in his vicinity cast a spell) there would also have to be a way to control that spell so that it tells you everything cast around a specific wizard. Otherwise Moody's fear wouldn't make sense, as according to this theory with adults around him, the Trace shouldn't alert the Ministry anyway.
