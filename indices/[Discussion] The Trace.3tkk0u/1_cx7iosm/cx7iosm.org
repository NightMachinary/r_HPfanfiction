I think it was explained well in... Potter vs Paradox? I think it was?

The Trace is neither on the wizard nor the wand; it is on the spell. When a spell is cast, the Trace centers its detection radius around it and if it detects an underage wizard in the vicinity without finding an overage one as well, then it alerts the Ministry.

Elf magic is completely different from wizard magic; it doesn't set off the Trace, that is why Harry never got a letter for Dobby Apparating into his room. Dobby, being the tricky elf he is, was able to replicate a wizard spell that he'd watched Draco practice and used that as his final resort to keep Harry out of Hogwarts.

You can't go back if you're expelled after all.

And now that I think about it, during The Order of the Phoenix when Harry was surrounded by overage wizards guarding him, he could have used magic and he might not have been detected.
