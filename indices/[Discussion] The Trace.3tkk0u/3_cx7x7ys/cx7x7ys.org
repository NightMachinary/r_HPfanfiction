My theory is it's cast around the homes of muggle-born students only.

I know there is some canon quote about how the ministry doesn't bother tracking homes with adult wizards, they instead trust the adult wizards to keep the kids in line.

In fact, reading the Wiki entry on it, I think that it's possible that Moody and other adults are spreading misinformation about the trace to make kids think they are tracked all the time, when really only muggleborns are tracked in their homes once they become Hogwarts students.
