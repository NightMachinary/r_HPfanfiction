I haven't read an entire FF by myself in like a year, Siri swipe down/highlight read with the male British character is awesome. Not to the same level as a professional reader and sometimes you miss some of the exclamations and what not, but it's free (if you ignore the need for an iPhone) but it does allow for multitasking and feeds my addiction well enough.

Btw. It's a bit robot-y but Siri's accent is good at pronouncing non-made up words.
