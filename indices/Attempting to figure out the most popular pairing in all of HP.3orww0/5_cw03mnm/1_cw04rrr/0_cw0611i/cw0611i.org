I'm pretty sure tumblr is too obsessed with slash ships to bother with something like Harry/Fleur.

Which is basically why it's impossible to figure out what the most popular pairing in the entire fandom is. Fans of different ships tend to congregate in different locations and, combined with the size of the fandom, it makes it next to impossible to actually get accurate numbers. Polls taken in different locations will bias different ships. As [[/u/Lord_Anarchy]] said, H/F is popular over on DLP, yet [[/u/slytherinight]] picked H/Hr as the most popular non-canon, whilst in my own experience H/D takes the lead, with Sirius/Remus also being exceptionally well-liked. I've noticed that the pairings people often claim to be the most popular are either their own OTP or, conversely, the pairing they loathe, but that makes a certain bit of sense: we notice the things we love and the things we hate, whilst paying little attention to the things about which we don't care.
