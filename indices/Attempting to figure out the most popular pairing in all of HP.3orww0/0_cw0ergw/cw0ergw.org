The problem with much of this 'research' is that the internet is like an invisible echo-chamber. Thanks to the fact that we're only shown the stuff we search for (and the results of those searches are crafted by things we have previously searched for) we quickly come to believe that /actually/ most people believe the same things we do.

But that's an illusion brought about by Google and others corralling people into neat little groups of shared interests.

The best example of this is your Google search test. Of course you see Romione taking the lead, that's /your/ ship and Google knows it. When I do the search from an incognito browser I get Hermione paired with Fred (don't ask me why, I have no idea), Draco, Ginny or Snape. If I search for Draco all of the suggestions are Harry or Hermione. If I search for Ron I /do/ get Hermione, but that's simply because there are no other Ron ships.

So, by all means have fun trying to confirm your own preferences. It's unlikely to mean much, though.

Also, I did find the comment about DLP having died years ago to be amusing.
