I got into fanfic a few years ago after I discovered JKR had "endorsed" a new series called The James Potter Series. She hasn't really endorsed it, but she did mention it something along the lines of being compliant with her series. Anyway, I loved the first two books but fell out with the third one.

Then a while back I offered the then top mod here CatholicGuy any help for his subreddits if he should need it. He automatically made me a mod here in addition to several other HP associated subs. It was a huge deal and no one liked me. It made me sad and I almost left, but ended up sticking around since [[/u/denarii]] was very kind and encouraging. I mostly just do behind the scenes mod stuff. My most recent fic was finishing A Difference in the Family which I LOVED! I've asked for more canon compliant fics, but got super busy with work and haven't gotten around to them yet, but I will soon since school is going on break meaning there are no more papers and exams to grade. I'm not sure which I'll read next, but I have a bunch saved. Link me to your recommendations if you wish! I like canon compliant and wanna try something marauders era next. =]
