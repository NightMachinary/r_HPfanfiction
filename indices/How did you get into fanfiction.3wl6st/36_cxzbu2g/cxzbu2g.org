Everyone here is making me feel ancient. My first fanfics were in the Star Trek fandom, ffs (Next Generation, though. I'm not quite old enough for original Kirk/Spock). I read them on /Usenet/. I think I found them simply because the fanfic group was a sub-group to the regular fan discussion group, and easy to discover.

Then there was a several-year break until I discovered Buffy fics. And then I learned to search in every fandom that sounded at all interesting.
