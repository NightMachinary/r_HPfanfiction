About four years ago my youngest sister (I'm five years older and the eldest) started getting into Percy Jackson fanfiction. The only exposure I'd had to fanfiction before that was through The Weird Kid at school who wouldn't shut up about it, and I was a little worried for my (at the time) 11 year old sister. So I checked it out a bit and ended up getting hooked myself. Never got into Percy Jackson myself, but I spent a few years jumping from fandom to fandom - anything where I was familiar with canon - then was pretty into Sherlock for a while, and finally moved to Harry Potter a little less than a year ago.
