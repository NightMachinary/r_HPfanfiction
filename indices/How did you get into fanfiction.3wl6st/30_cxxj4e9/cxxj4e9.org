For me it was a fake of the second to last (and last!) book (pdf-files on the internet) and it was in a lot of ways better than the last book (which I never had the stomach to finish (didn't get past page 50) as I HATE authors destroying their heroes (in favor of characters - like Hermione - which I don't like) - Harry is a clueless idiot (much more clueless than usual, he wasn't the most stellar of heroes to begin with, but at least he had potential!) in that book -.-) so I stayed :)
