I wound up finding a link to HPMOR (the story, not the sub) on an unrelated blog. I read the two paragraph excerpt, thought to myself "Hmm, that's an intriguing premise", and have been reading it ever since.

In the roughly 1.5 years that I've been reading fan fiction, I've read waaay more different types, styles, and pairings. In contrast, I haven't touched canon since shortly after buying a copy of Deathly Hallows following its release in 2007.
