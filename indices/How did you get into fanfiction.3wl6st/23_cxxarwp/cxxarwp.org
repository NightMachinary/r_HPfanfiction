I was reading different Harry Potter fansites for fun, veritaserum.com was the first one, and I saw they had a section called fan fiction and I thought I'd check it out. The way chapters were listed there was terrible so I moved onto mugglenet fan fiction right after. This would have been in early 2005 I'd say.
