I watched the movies one last time. [[http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2013-09/enhanced/webdr06/27/17/anigif_enhanced-buzz-6346-1380317135-14.gif][This]] is the final shot of the film epilogue. Ron and Ginny are notably absent, so I googled Harry and Hermione and found [[http://www.harryloveshermione.com/fanfic/][this site]]. The pairing gels more with my value system than the canon pairings, so I haven't looked back.
