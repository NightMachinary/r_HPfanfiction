First there was Methods of Rationailty. I merely stumbled upon it and didn't even realize I was reading fanfiction till a good dozen of chapters in. It really is more of a parody and comedy than a fanfiction in its purest sense.

Then, well, I became curious. Despite what people think of HPMOR, its an entertaining read and current fantasy releases bored me. So I began to read Vox Corporis, The Firebird Trilogy and Harem Wars (yea... I know).

Never finished the third, but I had a blast with the former two. So now, I'm here.

Unfortunatly I feel like I already read everything by now. 700k fics and so little that I find interesting.
