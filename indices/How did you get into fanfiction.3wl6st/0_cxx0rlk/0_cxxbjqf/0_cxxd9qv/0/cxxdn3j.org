I agree with you on all of them playing a significant part of Harry's life but what about Ginny and Ginny's life. What about the people Ginny loved, lost and was inspired by. If there's one thing we know about the Weasley family it's that they care deeply about family. The idea that Ginny wouldn't have anyone she wanted to honour or didn't want to honour anyone is (to me) absolutely ludicrous.

This bugged me when I was seventeen and it still bugs me today.
