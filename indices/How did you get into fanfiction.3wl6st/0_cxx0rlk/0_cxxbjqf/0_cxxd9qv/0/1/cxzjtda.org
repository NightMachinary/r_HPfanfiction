Ginny's not someone who would agree to something she didn't want, so I've always assumed that Ginny, out of love for Harry and out of respect for the fact that he had no siblings to pass on family names, agreed to the names. I like to think she suggested Luna. We do see that George's son is Fred and Percy's daughter is Molly, so some of the names Ginny might have considered have been used there.
