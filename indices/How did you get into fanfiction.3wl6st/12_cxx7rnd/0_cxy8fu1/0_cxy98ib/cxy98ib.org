Not specifically but I can probably find it again. Ikr! My favorite show of all time. Watching the episode Chuck vs Sarah drove me crazy. I came to terms with the ending eventually because it was hopeful but the first time I watched it I died inside. So many seasons of will they wont they. Finally to have them overcome the odds and then it's all ripped away from us in the span of 2 episodes. When they first realized that Sarah was losing some memories, all I felt was dread. I'm like they wouldn't do that to us would they? They won't end the show like this? Anyway, I can rant about the ending forever. At least one good thing came out of it. I got into fanfics which lead me to this amazing subreddit.
