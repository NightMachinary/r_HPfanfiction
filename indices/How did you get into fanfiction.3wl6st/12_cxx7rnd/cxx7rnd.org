I had read a couple Harry Potter oneshots over the years but never really got into it. Then last year I binged 5 seasons of this show called Chuck on Netflix in 2 weeks but was very unsatisfied with the ending. On this one blog about the series finale I saw someone suggested this long fanfic that was written to help some people get closure with the show and I gave it a chance. The next month I read a whole bunch more Chuck fanfics but eventually read all the good stuff and got bored. I really liked fanfics by this point though. I read a few about different shows I'd watched and books I'd read. I've always been a Harry Potter fan and had read the series several times over but tried to move on and focus other stuff which I did for about 2 years but that all changed again when I realised I should check out Harry Potter fanfics. I was dumbfounded by the amount that I saw out there. I started out reading post DH stories, then H/G missing moments, then full on H/G AU, then finally broke down and tried other pairings, time travel fics, dimension travel and everything else.
