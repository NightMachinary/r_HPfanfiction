I read Worm, was disappointed it wasn't longer, and ended up branching out after I read all the stuff in that fandom.

For those who don't know, Worm is the heartwarming story of a girl who gets superpowers and decides that she's gonna become a hero. She makes lots of new friends and defeats lots of villains with the help of a beautiful angel who loves to sing.
