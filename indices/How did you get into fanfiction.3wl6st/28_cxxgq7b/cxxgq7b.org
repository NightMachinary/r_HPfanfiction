I was browsing for porn on 4chan and accidentally clicked on /lit/. There was this thread in the catalog with a picture of Harry with that stupid quidditch fanhat he wore in the forth movies. The guy posting had the name "fanfiction_guy" and linked a giant pastebin filled with great fanfiction of hp. I read "The lie i've lived" and that lead to me reading another ~100 in the last two years. Sadly he has discontinued updating the pastebin. ([[http://pastebin.com/wwtmhSKY]])
