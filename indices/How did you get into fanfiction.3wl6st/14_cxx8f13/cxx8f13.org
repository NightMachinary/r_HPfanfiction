I was watching a video online of someone's Harry Potter collection. In it, they had sent out and bound the James Potter series, and i thought it looked cool. After reading those I googled Harry Potter stories, and found HPMOR (liked it at the time, not a fan now). Once I started having trouble finding more Harry Potter fics to read, I started with some Naruto because I had always loved to watch Naruto back in the day.
