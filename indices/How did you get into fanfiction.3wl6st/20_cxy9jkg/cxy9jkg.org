Someone printed one out one day, a dracoxhermione fic, and I got hooked. I was into angst fic back then and pre-teen me loved LeatherPants!Draco. Though people had manifestos and everything, even then I was pretty sure it was never going to happen on canon, so fanfiction was my only source for DHr.

Eventually I branched out to other pairings, and moved on to non-romance centric fiction, but basically I started reading for my ship.
