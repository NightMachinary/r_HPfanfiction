Around 08-09 I was looking into Ahsoka Tano from the clone wars cartoon, and I found a story on ffn about her after the events of episode 3, after that I read a few more Star Wars fics. I left it alone for awhile and then I really got into the idea of dramione, and ended up branching into fanfics for like eight or nine different fandoms. Like one commenter said I also read chuck fics, and I am now really into PJO as well. It's hard to read fan fiction and not get into HP, it was actually reading some early fan fiction that made me want to go back and actually read the series all at once as an adult back in 2011.
