Firefly was cancelled.

I went looking to see if more stuff was available in book form and stumbled onto a Jayne/River fic on literotica. Searching for more brought me to Browncoat, Green eyes which is a crossover to HP. This story was much better than most of the Firefly fanfic, and I reasoned out that ~300,000 fics for the fandom would give better odds of finding good stories than ~2,300.
