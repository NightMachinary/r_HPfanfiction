So many remindme's... I don't think I've ever read any Harry/anyMalfoy (with the exception of Narcissa) but there is one Neville/ocSisterMalfoy that its actually really good. Also really long, some lemons in it, good plot, really heartwrenching indecisions and general angst of being in love with the "squib blood traitor". She's called Graces Malfoy btw (not Grace.) The only issue is. I don't remember the fucking name. I know its over 600k words, so that should make it pretty easy to find. Imma take a look, just a sec.
