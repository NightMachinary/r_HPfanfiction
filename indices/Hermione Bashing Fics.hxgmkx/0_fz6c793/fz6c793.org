These are the common forms of Hermione-bashing:

- Can't let go of authority-figures (bashed!Dumbledore) or is outright in league with them.
- Bossy know-it-all who happens to be /wrong/ more often than not (her books are wrong and she can't admit that).

See also: "Grey/Dark!Harry", "Independent!Harry".

It's less common than Ron-bashing because of two factors:

- She's an author insert, so she's usually shown in a positive light (her flaws are made to seem forgivable more often than not).
- Movie!Hermione is barely flawed at all, and the movies are a more common first-point-of-contact for the franchise than the books.
