It's what was the most salient thing for Harry at the time. I don't think Harry is very good at objectively assessing relative balance of harm.

Anyway, I am not sure what you are looking for here. It's not like any of the characters sit down with a therapist to calmly discuss their flaws. And, canon is not exactly short on giving Hermione consequences for her behaviour: off the top of my head, for her hectoring of Ron, Hermione is humiliated and almost killed by a troll; for the Firebolt, she is ostracised by her only friends for a good part of a year. She endures being a laughingstock and loses valuable time for her SPEW efforts.
