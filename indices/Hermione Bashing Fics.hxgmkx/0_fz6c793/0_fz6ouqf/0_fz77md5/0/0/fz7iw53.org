While it's true that she sees consequences to her actions, when I really think about it (in the instances you mention) she ultimately ends up being told she's right, rewarded, or otherwise benefitting from her actions, even if she suffers momentarily. After the troll, she gains two best friends. After the firebolt incident, if I'm remembering correctly (which I may not be, so forgive me if I'm wrong here), it's admitted that she wasn't wrong in being cautious. As for the SPEW thing, even that gets justified in a way with Dobby becoming the trio's savior and in a very quiet way serves to highlight how the wizarding world at large is bigoted and that the injustice is ingrained so deeply that nobody even notices it at all.
