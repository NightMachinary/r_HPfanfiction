Correct me if I'm wrong (pretty possibly that I am projecting), but do you mean in the sense of breaking apart from the so common fandom pattern in which Hermione is regarded as some kind of patron saint of reason and knowledge that has omniscience and is always treated as being right and so the unruly children around here should do as she says?

If so then I can recommend linkffn(Prediction, no thank you! by sonotalady), it actually treats the situation in a realistic form without bashing or otherwise making her some kind of monster, linkffn(rise of the wizards) does go into Hermione bashing, but it is really well done and more along the line of extreme arrogance instead of being the same old adage of her just being an awful human being, and linkao3(Say a Prayer by mad_fairy) has in the first parts of the series her being pushed away from the group for her behavior and personality, though it is limited to her just being unlikeable instead of actual bashing. Otherwise most fanfics that are Indy!Harry bash her somehow.
