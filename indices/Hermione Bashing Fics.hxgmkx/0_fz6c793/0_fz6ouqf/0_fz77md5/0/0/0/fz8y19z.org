You are moving the goalposts here. To paraphrase Keynes, /ultimately/, we are all dead. Most actions have mixed consequences.

One could argue that in even longer term, Hermione's "best friends" are people with whom she had next to nothing in common and who get far more from their friendship with Hermione (schoolwork help, general knowledge, level head, spell arsenal, planning) than Hermione from them (emotional support, sometimes?), and it's a friendship that is very conditional (as we see in Year 3) and repeatedly puts her life in danger.

Even if we suppose that someone admitted that Hermione had been correct about the Firebolt---and I don't remember such a thing either---as a consequence of the stress she suffered from losing that friendship, Hermione loses the time-turner.

Since SPEW within Hogwarts didn't go anywhere, the wasted time and the humiliation that Hermione suffered was completely in vain. Her SPEW efforts are in no way connected to Dobby saving the Trio, since Dobby was loyal to Harry since more than a year prior.

If you are concerned about Hermione being proven right in principle, would you rather for Hermione to not have fought for House-Elf rights, or would you rather for canon to have found ways to justify their slavery and mistreatment to show Hermione wrong?

The bottom line is, I am hearing vague complaints with limited factual basis, and I am still not sure exactly what you would have wanted to see.
