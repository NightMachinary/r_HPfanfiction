Nothing specifically that I wanted to see aside from other people's viewpoints and opinions on the subject :) I find it really interesting to consider the varied takes on the topic, and it's good to be able to consider all of those sort of different perspectives. Especially when reading fanfiction, because it all comes from different places and you never know how one perspective can change an entire narrative!
