There's a Harry-is-sent-back-to-his-younger-body fic where he decides to not befriend Ron and Hermione because in the alt-future, they go along with the decision to execute him since they're convinced that he's a Horcrux and that as long as he's alive, Voldemort will come back. So he comes back (along with Voldemort since their souls are linked) and becomes a Slytherin. And the fic kind of leans into the huge difference that makes in Hermione and Ron's lives. It's a negative enough portrayal I feel it's bashing:

  ​ “Excuse me,” a most unwelcome voice sounded behind them.

  “Miss tattletale,” Harry said with his most pleasant smile. “I assure you this has nothing to do with you. So naturally you will now go and report it to McGonagall anyway, am I right?”

  Hermione frowned at him. “I was perfectly within my rights to -- “

  “Yeah, I have no desire to spend any time near you, Miss tattletale. Neville, just stay in bed tonight and you'll be fine. See you tomorrow.” And with that Harry turned around and walked toward the dungeons, Blaise and Theo hurrying to catch up.

  “What did Granger do?” Theo asked as they climbed down the stone stairs.

  “Told McGonagall our official study group refused her. I clarified the situation and then McGonagall still insisted I make friends with her. I firmly refused.”

  “I wonder if Granger even realizes her behaviour is making her own Head of House treat her like a charity case,” Blaise said with a proper amount of pureblood scorn at the idea of accepting charity.

It's Tom/Harry but it isn't very blatant until later, though.
