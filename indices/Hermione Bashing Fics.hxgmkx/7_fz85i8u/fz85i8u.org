She's a teenager. Everyone does stupid things as a teenager. I remember people who got into catfights (or fight fights) in my school and by and large they turned into normal adults.

We don't see much criticism of Hermione's acts because the book tells Harry perspective and he agrees with her. In any case, Hermione not having consequences relates more to a) a lack of staff supervision and b) nobody reporting her. It could well be that Hermione does feel guilty.

Also, I don't see why the firebolt thing is a sign she needs a consequence? She's 14 at this age, in a situation where she believes that unless action is taken immediately then her friend might die.

Personally, I think bashing fics have lazy writing. By all means, write nuanced characters with strengths and flaws, but if you need to drag a teenager down (fictitious or not)...
