Let me start of by saying I like Hermione, but she definitely has some rough edges that need sanding down. I think she is largely friendless because some of her behaviors that she could stand to tone down. She especially when younger needs to learn about being right vs being happy.

I sadly don't know of many fics where people try to help her rather than just trying to break her down and discard her. Two examples are toning teacher petness and learning to help in a humble well received manner. Given how she stood with Harry during the tri-wizard tournament it's hard for me to stomach discarding her.

That all said, it's hard to call for any real punishments for her when the wizarding world is fundamentally unjust. None of the adults have spent time in jail when a vast number of them should've for actions taken before the start of first year. The death eaters are mostly free and the Hogwarts staff never go to jail for child endangerment due to the Philosopher stone trap. For school level stuff there's Draco, who literally gets away with attempted murder. Justice selectively applied is injustice.
