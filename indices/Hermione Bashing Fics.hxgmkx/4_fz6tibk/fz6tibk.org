Bashing of Hermione in fanfic tends to be a bit be more about subtle degradation than about the comic exaggeration and physical harm that is more common for Ron. A lot of it is not even intended: I think that usually, it's because the author has read vastly more fanfic than they have canon and has a certain degraded view of Hermione. Something similar goes for the GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

Take, for example, this passage from linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6049450/1/]]). This is a post-Voldemort fic in which the Wizengamot passes a Marriage Law and Harry fights back. The following shows the Trio, Ginny, and miscellaneous Gryffindors reacting to the news:

  So softly that Hermione and Ron had to strain to hear it, Harry said, "I didn't fight him for this. I fought and defeated him so my friends could enjoy life, but I not do it for something like this."

  "Harry," Hermione called sadly, "even though we all know it's a power-grab, it's the law now. We don't have a choice."

  He continued to hold his girlfriend tightly and rock her gently. "An unjust law is no law at all."

  "Harry..."

  "Hermione, not now. I need to think." He closed his eyes to concentrate better, and to hide what he really felt.

Did you see what the author did there? From being someone who never hesitated to break laws in the interests of justice, and from someone who does pretty much all the planning for the trio, Hermione has been degraded into the authority-worshipper portrayal. In the rest of the fanfic, she is treated well enough, and even plays an important role in executing Harry's plan. The author clearly does not dislike Hermione. And yet, they wrote what they wrote.

Hermione is also subject to a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect][Worf Effect]] of sorts. Basically, suppose that a writer wants to show you how good their Smart!Harry (or Smart!Fem!Harry, or Draco, or Daphne) is at magic, or generally how smart, competent, creative, or knowledgeable they are. Having them publically upstage Hermione with ease or correct her on some bit of knowledge is a convenient way to do that---but that inevitably comes at Hermione's expense. In particular, since the author generally doesn't want to portray their protagonist as a bully, it is left to Hermione to initiate the confrontation that culminates in the demonstration of the protagonist's superiority, compounding the bashing.
