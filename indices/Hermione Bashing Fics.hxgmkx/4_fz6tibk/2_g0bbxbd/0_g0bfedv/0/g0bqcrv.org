Just to be safe, this is my subjective opinion. I won't take it personally if you disagree :).

So, Hermione actually gets the least amount of real character development in the trio /in my opinion/. Rowling uses her as a way to forward the plot.

So book 1 Hermione is initially shown to be the most annoying kind of 11 year old. Once the troll rescue happens, she literally relaxes and shows social improvement.

My issue with this is that Rowling tries to use Hermione breaking the rules for a good cause as ooc in the series for development.

Rowling also dropped SPEW as a plot point, which is really odd, because Hermione had a point, though her activism was ineffective.

Hermione is also jealous of Fleur. This could be used to develop her character as it's mostly unfounded, but again, it's dropped.

I like having Hermione, an intelligent, borderline genius, loyal girl make mistakes, be socially awkward. Rowling nixed the social awkwardness after book 3 and handwaves away the mistakes.
