I'd say you've just provided some examples of Hermione's development: when you say that this or other character trait was never followed up, that's because Hermione grew out of it.

When Ron called her a "nightmare", Hermione realised that the things she thought she was doing to befriend people (keeping them out of trouble by telling them when they are breaking rules, providing unsolicited advice in class) was actually antagonising. She learned from that, and toned it down a bit (a bit).

Hermione tried the SPEW approach to house-elf welfare, and it didn't work very well. She tried the "underground" approach of knitting tiny clothes. It didn't work either. So, she went into government instead, which did.

More generally, I think that she is far more empathetic and somewhat less judgemental by the time she gets to DH.

I don't remember how Hermione related to Fleur, so I can't speak to that.

Also, I wouldn't call early-canon Hermione socially awkward. In fact, she was very outspoken and gregarious. She was bad at winning friends and influencing people, but she never displayed a lack of confidence that I would associate with awkwardness.
