I disagree about early canon Hermione not being socially awkward, but I personally don't think the degree is that much.

I just feel most of her development was in the earlier books and the development of her character stagnated a bit.

So yes, I feel her character definitely grew up by deathly hallows. I just feel too much of it is offscreen.

Like the example with the house elves. We only get told by supplementary materials she works in government to free the elves. I would have loved some sort of precursor to that in the books.
