How does her social awkwardness manifest itself, then?

I don't know about her development stagnating in the later books; frankly, I kind of wish that her "developments" in HBP never developed. What sorts of developments would you have liked to see for her?

House-elves? In Chapter 10 of DH, Hermione gives a whole speech to Harry about house-elves and Kreacher:

  ‘I don't understand you, Kreacher,' [Harry] said finally. ‘Voldemort tried to kill you, Regulus died to bring Voldemort down, but you were still happy to betray Sirius to Voldemort? You were happy to go to Narcissa and Bellatrix, and pass information to Voldemort through them ...'

  ‘Harry, Kreacher doesn't think like that,' said Hermione, wiping her eyes on the back of her hand. ‘He's a slave; house-elves are used to bad, even brutal treatment; what Voldemort did to Kreacher wasn't that far out of the common way. What do wizard wars mean to an elf like Kreacher? He's loyal to people who are kind to him, and Mrs Black must have been, and Regulus certainly was, so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs. I know what you're going to say,' she went on, as Harry began to protest, ‘that Regulus changed his mind ... but he doesn't seem to have explained that to Kreacher, does he? And I think I know why. Kreacher and Regulus's family were all safer if they kept to the old pure-blood line. Regulus was trying to protect them all.'

  ‘Sirius --'

  ‘Sirius was horrible to Kreacher, Harry, and it's no good looking like that, you know it's true. Kreacher had been alone for a long time when Sirius came to live here, and he was probably starving for a bit of affection. I'm sure “Miss Cissy” and “Miss Bella” were perfectly lovely to Kreacher when he turned up, so he did them a favour and told them everything they wanted to know. I've said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat house-elves. Well, Voldemort did ... and so did Sirius.'

After that, Harry is finally able to get through to Kreacher and win his loyalty.
