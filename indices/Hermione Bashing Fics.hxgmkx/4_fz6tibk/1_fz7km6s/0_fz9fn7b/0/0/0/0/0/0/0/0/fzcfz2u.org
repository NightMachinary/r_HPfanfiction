Repeatedly? He tried for the Stone, and got beaten by Lily's blood protection. Then he realized what the blood protection was, and effortlessly trapped Harry, came to life, and barely allowed him to escape - again, by an unforeseen and obscure but known magical reaction.

By Voldemort's count, Harry got saved by two flukes that have nothing to do with Horcruxes, and he's been spelunking Harry's brain and finding nothing about Horcruxes. Why would he ever check? As far as he's aware, the prophecy has been played out. He marked Harry, and Harry has a power that would allow him to defeat Voldemort, that Voldemort didn't know about. That's the only part he heard about.

If Harry were part of a concentrated effort by the Ministry, that would be a different story. The public sees Harry as a savior. Harry would be even more of a political problem than he is, and he'd have the resources to back it up. Instead of being a relatively powerless idiot who lucked out three times, he'd be a threat who's already interacted with one of Voldemort's Horcruxes, and in the presence of Aurors and Unspeakables who could recognize what it was. Voldemort had no reason to believe that Dumbledore knew about Horcruxes, and - from his perspective - Snape surely would have informed him if he did. Harry with Dumbledore is not a threat to his Horcruxes. Harry with the Ministry at his beck and call is.
