...So not literally being either the leader or alone in everything you do is blindly worshiping authority to you? Harry isn't smart enough to fight Voldemort on his own. He needs to pick someone's plan. Scrimgeour is in charge, but Harry chooses to reject him in favor of Dumbledore's plan by telling him, straight to his face, that he respects Dumbledore more than Scrimgeour, the head of the country.

And you're saying that's "blindly worshiping authority."

I guess Macbeth blindly worshiped authority when he murdered his king, right? After all, his wife told him to.
