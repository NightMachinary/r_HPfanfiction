The most common Hermione bashing is found in pureblood fanboy and Death Eater apologist stories. There she's usually portrayed as the "ignorant mudblood" who needs to be taught that "Slavery is fine because elves need to be slaves" and that "she can't really learn the real magic/pureblood culture, only purebloods born into it (and Harry when taught by a pureblood princess) can do that". It's usually stuffed full of fanon stuff to bash the Weasleys as well. It often goes hand in hand with "She's not really smart, just hard-working" bashing, usually by people who are still traumatised by that kid in their class who was smarter than them. That usually crops up in "Harry is the real genius, he was just too lazy to apply himself properly because of Ron" stories.
