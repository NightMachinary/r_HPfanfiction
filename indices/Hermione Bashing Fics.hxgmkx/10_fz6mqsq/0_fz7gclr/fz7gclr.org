If you had read my post you'd have seen I wasn't asking for recs, I just wanted other people's thoughts and to have a discussion on the topic of a seemingly rare thing in fandom. Not to mention one of your recs is a fic I actually mentioned in my post, I'm thinking you didn't even read my post, you just saw the title and got annoyed.

Anyhow, if other people are suddenly asking for recs of Hermione bashing fics, and it's not something that's written very frequently, then I would think it warrants a discussion. I've personally really liked hearing what others think/observe/theorize on the subject. It's a good way to broaden your own horizons and look at stuff from different angles.
