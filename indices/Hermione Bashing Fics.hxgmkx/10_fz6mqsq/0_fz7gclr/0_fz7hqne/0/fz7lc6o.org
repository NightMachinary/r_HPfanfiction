  It is rare, true, but there's been discussions about this.

  Again, there's already been discussions about this. There's been people asking for recs. The problem is that there just aren't a lot of people willing or able to write a fic that bashes Hermione in a realistic manner. If you looked through my recs you would see my fic that is Hermione-critical in nature. As for the rest it's basically a reflex to copy/paste/comment whenever someone asks for Hermione-bashing fics.

However justified you may feel in snapping at people for opening discussions on a discussion forum, I'm afraid we'll just have to agree to disagree. I generally search a topic before I post on it to see if my questions or thoughts have been expressed before and how recently. In a search for Hermione bashing, the results returned that I saw were for the most part either very old, or were discussions/requests for general bashing, not Hermione specifically.

So be ticked off at me all you like for not being on this forum daily to take note of every single thing that's posted, I'm quite certain both you and I will survive. I do make an effort to avoid posting things that have clearly been hot topics in the last few months. The people who don't do that are likely not on the forum constantly; maybe they don't know they can search within a subreddit, or any other plethora of reasons for not having taken note of all discussions on here.

Even with all of that being said, there's such a thing as just not coming onto a topic that annoys you for the sole purpose of talking down to people for posting. Especially when you aren't even going to read said post before acting like you've been inconvenienced.

As people seem to be engaging in some really interesting discussion on this thread, I think I'll take my leave of this "argument" so I can pay more attention to those posts. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
