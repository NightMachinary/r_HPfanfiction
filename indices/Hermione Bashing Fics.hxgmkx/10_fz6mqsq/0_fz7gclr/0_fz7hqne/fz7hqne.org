  Not to mention one of your recs is a fic I actually mentioned in my post, I'm thinking you didn't even read my post, you just saw the title and got annoyed.

Okay, let's clear this up right now. I'm a big supporter of every character in HP fanfiction having fics depict them in a good and bad light. The probem is that Hermione tends to get a lot of good and not a lot of bad. Everyone that's been reading fanfic has noticed this. I've posted multiple discussions featuring this and the overabundance of Ron-bashing. It's not new. It's oversaturated. We've gotten thread after thread of it for the last few weeks.

  If you had read my post you'd have seen I wasn't asking for recs
#+end_quote

Yeah, my bad on that front.

  I just wanted other people's thoughts and to have a discussion on the topic of a seemingly rare thing in fandom.
#+end_quote

It is rare, true, but there's been discussions about this.

  Anyhow, if other people are suddenly asking for recs of Hermione bashing fics, and it's not something that's written very frequently, then I would think it warrants a discussion.
#+end_quote

Again, there's already been discussions about this. There's been people asking for recs. The problem is that there just aren't a lot of people willing or able to write a fic that bashes Hermione in a realistic manner. If you looked through my recs you would see my fic that is Hermione-critical in nature. As for the rest it's basically a reflex to copy/paste/comment whenever someone asks for Hermione-bashing fics.
