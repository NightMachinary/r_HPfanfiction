Most of the bashing usually has her reciting facts and cutting people off to deliver her “well I read that...”

Her reliant and trust of authority is often used to bash her as well

In stories where Harry is a Slytherin and spend times with Daphne, I often see this bashing

I've also seen stories where Harry studies dark magic and Hermione is usually the one who opposes him
