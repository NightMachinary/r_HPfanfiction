Plenty of H/G fics bash her because the author wants to make a point about their OTP. She is also often bashed in IndyHarry fics where she betrays him in some way and he ends up with Daphne, Susan and the like. And I consider the mere thought of Hermione betraying Harry as bashing since her loyalty was her best quality (outside of darkHarry fics where he is legit a monster and ought to be stopped).
