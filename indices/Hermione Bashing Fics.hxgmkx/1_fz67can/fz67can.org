She's just not bashed that much. Stems from being an author self insert. She wasn't told she was wrong or to shut up often and it was usually a minor thing or said by the wrong person. Like I don't disagree with Xeno's analysis, a conspiracy nut who called Death Eaters on them was the wrong person to say it.

I've never liked Hermione, but as a kid I found her tolerable until DH. As an adult I don't like her at all. She's one of the favs of the series, but I've come across a few who've re-read them as adults and they at least see more of her flaws.
