What do you mean by "fades into obscurity"? Sure, they didn't appear or were mentioned in the epilogue, but only about half-dozen Hogwarts-era characters were named there in the first place. Everyone else "faded into obscurity".

Marietta and Umbridge, sure, but they were aiding and abetting Voldemort, and Hermione did what she had to to stop that. What's the problem with that?
