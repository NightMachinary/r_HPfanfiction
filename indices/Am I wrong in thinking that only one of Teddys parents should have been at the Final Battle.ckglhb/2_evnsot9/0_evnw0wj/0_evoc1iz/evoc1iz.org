It wasn't about prioritizing Remus over her son. It was about being at war and doing what she felt was necessary. For Tonks to remain at home safe while others fought and died would've been against her values. It's not like she chose to orphan her son, she didn't have hindsight to make a decision with. She acted according to her character, she made a noble decision even if it ended in tragedy.
