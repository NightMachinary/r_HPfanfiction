Yeah you shouldn't send two new parents into a battle. That's just begging to make an orphan.

But JK seemed to do character deaths via a spreadsheet - saved Arthur, better kill Remus. Percy's back, better kill George. She appears to have decided there need to be some deaths to create emotional weight, but then assigned them more based on what would cause the biggest reaction - the last of the Marauders and a fan favourite, splitting the twins up etc - without too much worry about logic or satisfying story arcs. Hence how Percy returns and then boom the wall explodes, killing Fred and leaving everyone else unharmed, conveniently right when Fred, Ron, Percy etc are all in the same hallway and right as Percy and Fred bond.
