I get the impression that that was their original plan--- Remus went to fight and Tonks (who was barely post partem) stayed with the baby. But when the battle was starting, Tonks couldn't stand not being there and she broke the agreement.

In her defense, she WAS the only person selected for the Auror program in years, and had a better chance of making a difference than most. Though I do wish JKR had made her entrance line “I don't want my child (or any child) to grow up in a world ruled by Voldemort, I trust my mother to raise him as well as she raised me, and so I have to be here because one more skilled wand could swing the battle in Harry's favor” rather than “I can't stand not knowing about Remus.”

They were probably wrong to do what they did. But with the future of the world at stake, and their unique skill sets, they get a free pass from me.
