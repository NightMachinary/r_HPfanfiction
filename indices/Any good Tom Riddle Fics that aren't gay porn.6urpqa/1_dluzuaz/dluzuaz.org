The Right Hand Path - Fairly tame AU at first, but gets quite exciting towards the end. linkffn(3221511)

insurgere - Uses the rather fanon-y idea of Hufflepuffs having potential to be super dangerous. Great prose, from what I recall. linkffn(5846518)

A Very Secret Diary - Scariest Tom Riddle in the fandom, hands down. linkffn(10705988)

The Difficulties of Avoidance - Has certain plot contrivances, but I'm impressed with both Tom and Ginny's characterisations. linkffn(3833975)
