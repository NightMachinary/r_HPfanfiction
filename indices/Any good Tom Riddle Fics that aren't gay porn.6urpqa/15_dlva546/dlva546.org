I recommend provocative envy's War Paint linkffn(10402749) and Nightmare linkffn(8618289). They are both Tomione pairing, but they're both SO good! I love the way Tom Riddle is portrayed in each of them, the author truly does the character justice. All of her writings are VERY smart and thought out and truly brilliant. (I've read both of these multiple times.) The moment you said Tom Riddle I knew I would be linking these!
