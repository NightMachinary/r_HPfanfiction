linkffn(The Evil Overlord List by boomvroomshroom) is always amusing, as, of course, is linkffn(Seventh Horcrux). My own linkffn(Tom Riddle and the Sorcerers' Stones by Achille Talon) has the premise that after the Forbidden Forest scene in Deathly Hallows, the Scar-Horcrux's piece of soul is sent back in Harry's body instead of him. linkffn(Rectifier by Niger Aquila) is pretty good too.
