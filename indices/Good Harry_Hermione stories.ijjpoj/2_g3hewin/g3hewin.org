Alrighty, time to remember all the good Harmony fics. Been a while since I touched these.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6067357/1/A-place-called-home][A Place Called Home]] - A fic that has great character dynamics and interactions. Plenty of cute fluff. But this fic has a lot of flaws regarding past plot and stuff. If you don't let that bother you too much the story is enjoyable.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13635950/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Arsed-Tournament][Harry Potter and the Half-Arsed Tournament]] - A pretty good fic about Harry and Hermione and how Harry doesn't really want to care about the tournament. It has good relationship building going on.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5093897/1/H-J-Potter][H J Potter]] - An excellent fic that is quite old now. If you liked RobSt stuff then you will probably like this. It being written around the same time as his works.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5901283/1/Lily-s-Plan][Lily's Plan]] - An even older fic that was quite good. It's been a long time since I've read it but I believe it should be enjoyable.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6652537/1/Quoth-the-Raven-Nevermore][Quoth the Raven, Nevermore]] - A really good fic about Harry living in the Tower of London and how that affects his life.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13405869/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Paradigm-Shift][Hermione Granger and the Paradigm Shift]] - A really good on-going fic that is certainly worth reading.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13577616/1/Live-Forever][Live Forever]] - Another fic done by the same author as above. Really touching scenes and is certainly a worthwhile read.

I am sure I can pull up more Harmony fics if you ever need more. Just PM if you do
