I don't know, if the squib is going to go through all that effort, take all those risks, just to shove a jar of fairies into a biologists face, I think the squib won't let a little thing like a lack of funding get to him.

"So, when you say, 'There's no funding for this.' what I hear is, 'You're talking to the wrong guy.' Fair enough, I didn't know how these things worked. Now, give me a name, and a general location, for these people who can fund your research, and I will shove this jar of fucking fairies in their faces, and I will get you some goddamn money."
