They wouldn't necessarily need to actively try to live like wizards to know where to find flobberworms, fairies, bowtruckles, etc. I imagine that wizarding hikes and picnics in wizarding parks might include the wizarding parents pointing out to their children what sorts of magical creatures live in the general vicinity. It is my understanding that squibhood isn't caught until around 7, 8 years of age, and for some children, not until they fail to receive a Hogwarts letter. Our hypothetical disgruntled squib might be drawing on fond memories of childhood to remember where some harmless and obviously magical creatures might be found.

Good thought about a squib becoming a biologist themselves.
