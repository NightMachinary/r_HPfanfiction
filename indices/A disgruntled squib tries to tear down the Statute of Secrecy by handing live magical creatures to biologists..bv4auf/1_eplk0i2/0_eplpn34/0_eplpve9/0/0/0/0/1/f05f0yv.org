Can someone who has seen something like an Ant die see a Thestral, or just seen a human die? If it's the second, 1. Does it have to be a mage. 2. If it doesn't have to be a mage in every case, does it have to be a member of another race.

Also, are Thestrals able to see other Thestrals? If not, are they able to see themselves?
