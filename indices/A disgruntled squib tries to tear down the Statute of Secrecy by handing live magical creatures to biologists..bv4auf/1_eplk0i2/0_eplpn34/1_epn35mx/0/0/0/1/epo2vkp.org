I thought they raped the soulless husks of their victims to reproduce. Unfortunately, the demeanor baby takes a full eight days to birth, so unless there's a human around to give the body water, it will die while carrying a signal offspring. The baby dementor needs that death to be born tho', so saving the body is a non-option.

Besides, nobody knows how to kill a dementor yet, (and I assure you, the Unspeakables have been trying) so why would you want to make MORE?
