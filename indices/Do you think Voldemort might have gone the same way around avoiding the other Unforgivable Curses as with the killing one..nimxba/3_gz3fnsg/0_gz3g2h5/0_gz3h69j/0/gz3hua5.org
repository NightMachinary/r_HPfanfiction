Why are they demonized? They have a nervous system that is less sensitive than that of humans. That's it.

If there's someone demonizing reptiles it's the bible which associates the snake with the devil and by extension JK, whom we don't know why she chose to associate Slytherin with snakes or why she chose to make Voldemort have snake-like features.

I just put out a theory. You can offer suggestions if you want but I'm not here to discuss the nervous system of reptiles.
