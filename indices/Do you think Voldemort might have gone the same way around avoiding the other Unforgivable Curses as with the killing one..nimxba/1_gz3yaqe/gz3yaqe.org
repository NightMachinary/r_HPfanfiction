I have an intertwined theory that could fit with yours! It is that he made a deal with a demon or a similar being. However, there's always a give and take. So maybe for his 3 wishes he asked to be made immune from the Imperius, Cruiciatus and Avada. They made him immune to Imperius by mangling his mind so no-one would ever understand his thoughts. They made him immune to Cruiciatus by imbuing him with those snake like qualities so he couldn't feel pain but also couldn't feel any other emotion. And Avada... well, you can't kill something that isn't alive. And can Voldemort really be considered alive?
