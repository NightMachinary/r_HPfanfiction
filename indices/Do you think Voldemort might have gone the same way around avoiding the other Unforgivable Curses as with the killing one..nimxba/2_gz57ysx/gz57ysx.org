I've made this comment before but I think it bears repeating

The killing curse just seems to be an instant death status effect curse, it doesn't eject the soul from the body

Because dementors do that, they take away your soul. And yet you don't die instantly when that happens, your body keeps on living you just need assistance with basically everything

So the killing curse is not really affecting the soul

Now, you could change that in a story or AU or whatever you want to write, make it so that the killing curse actually harms the soul and this is why the death is instant and why it has such a harsh punishment on the caster and such.

You can re-write it how you like I suppose
