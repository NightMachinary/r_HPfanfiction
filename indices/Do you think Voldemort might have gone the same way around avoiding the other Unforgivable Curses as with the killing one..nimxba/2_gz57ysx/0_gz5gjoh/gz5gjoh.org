Fair. Yet it's still the soul that is attacked since the body remains without any sign of damage. That is my interpretation. A soul eaten by a dementor still remains on the human plain and thus your body continues to live, just like with a horcrux. But in the case of Avada Kedavra your soul is elected into the afterlife.
