Oooooof. I mean, I know of a fic that I'm pretty sure was actually just a fever dream because I fell asleep while reading fanfiction.net. i have an entire whats that fic post to see if it was actually a thing. If it isn't I might just make it tbh my subconscious actually did something right and I liked it.
