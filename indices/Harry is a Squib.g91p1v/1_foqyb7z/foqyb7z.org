Can answer pretty succinctly, for once:

1. Yes he is still the Boy-Who-Lived. Harry's magic, or lack thereof, is irrelevant since it was /Lily/ who made the sacrifice that killed Voldemort. In practical terms, Harry still becomes a horcrux, people don't know any the wiser just like canon. Maybe he cannot go to Hogwarts, but his blood protection at the Dursleys probably works either way.
2. Yes, Horcruxes are still a thing. Why wouldn't they? Voldemort had already made five by 1981, with the intent of making his last one with Harry's death.
3. Yes he is raised by the Dursleys. /Why wouldn't he be?/ The protection is still there, Voldemort would inexorably feel the need to kill him at some point (because prophecy), and possibly need his blood if the Philosopher's Stone doesn't pan out well (he still wouldn't get it out of the mirror without help).
4. Really, the major changes aren't the dynamics of Harry and Voldemort (the difference in ability is hardly affected by Harry's magic or not, and their personalities are largely the same). Rather, it would be how Harry could survive a confrontation beyond the first attempt. There is a good chance he would survive the first time, since he is still protected from Voldemort via Lily's sacrifice. And of course how the Wizarding World deals with discovering their savior is a powerless squib. Or whether Harry is even introduced to it at large.
