Aggressive love is the sort I'm talking about but preferable longer. In it Lily does a ritual at birth and sacrifices herself. This ritual protects Harry with semi sentient magic. This only works on females due to his physiology. Dumbledore binds this but during the ritual to raise Voldemort it is released. However it also changes Voldemort into a female and creates an obsession for Harry. Basically any female becomes obsessed with Harry when they are close to him and changes them permanently.
