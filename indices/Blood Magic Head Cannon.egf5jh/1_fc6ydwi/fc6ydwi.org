A source of inspiration I quite enjoy in regard to making limitations is making the definition pointless thematically but still broadly functional. So, the Prissy Bruiser or the Overlord that nobody listens to. Blood Magic could degrade your genetics or morph them somehow, perhaps.

For limitations, you could look into actual blood conditions like Haemochromotosis and attach them as possible side-effects to misused blood magic. Could also have that stored blood you mention in another comment 'go off' as the storage spells degrade and cause those conditions if the decaying blood is used.

Regarding blood magic proper, I'd note that Blood is most often associated with life and death, familial connectiveness, and pain. Some cultures link it to sacrifice (willing and otherwise) while modern Wicca would take a more... vegan-pacifistic path decrying use of anything more than a couple drops of your own vitae.

I'd say illegality most often came from that sacrificial association. Aztecs bled a sizeable number of people over their 90-something years of activity, for instance, which tends to make people rather twitchy on a sheer conceptual level. On a practical base, most Humans have a psychological aversion to seeing blood outside the body. It stinks, it's sticky, and it's generally an unpleasant sensation to be in proximity to it on top of the obvious comments of 'blood keeps us alive, seeing it outside a body is fuckin' weird', thus we dislike it and we stay away from or regulate and ban things we don't like.
