Oh that's so cool. I love it that blood magic could be primarily in the hands of women. And that obscurity of it as a remnant of Seither magics just lends to the mystery of it all.

And Goblins capitalizing on wizard stupidity by offering magic as a service within their sovereign territory because, unlike wizards, they are neither too lazy nor too squeamish to be competent at it, just makes sense.

Both points very well taken.
