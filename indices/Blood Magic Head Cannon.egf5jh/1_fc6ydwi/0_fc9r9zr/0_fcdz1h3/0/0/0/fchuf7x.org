Glad I could help. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. I'm a culture nerd, so I'm full of random historical-social knowledge like that. :)

I will say that if you want interesting twists, uses, or limitations to magic, look at older cultures and they've generally done all the work for you. Check your local library/pirate books website for anthropology, sociology, psychology, philosophy, or history texts and you'll find a wealth of ideas for inspiration. Centuries-dead people were cruel, and also are no longer around to sue for copyright infringement. So, have fun. :)
