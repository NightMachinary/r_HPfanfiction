If you want a practitioner-limitation other than the Goblins, you could also take a slightly nordic approach to the matter. They had two forms of magic: Seithr, which were high magics practiced by women and 'unmanly men like Odin'; and Galdr, which (while not terribly well understood due to largely-lacking evidence) seemed to refer to magic of incantation and runes (ie. the magic studied in Harry Potter). Could have blood magic being one of the last remnants of the Seithr magics in modern society and thus more powerful and more dangerous all at once. Could even have that affinity be mostly in the hands of women, if you want to throw an interesting socio-cultural influence in there.
