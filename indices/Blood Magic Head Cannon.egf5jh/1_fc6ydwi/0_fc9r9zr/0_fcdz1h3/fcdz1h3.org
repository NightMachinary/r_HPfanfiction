Sure. Always happy to help with worldbuilding. Delightfully fun part of storytelling, despite how little of it goes directly into the actual writing.

That affinity idea is quite interesting. While this isn't specific to your fic, it could be used as an explanation for why things like blood binding or adoptions (ie. the heritage-type magics) are so commonly attributed to the Goblins. Mayhaps they, as the more martial, bellicose race have wider instances of that affinity and the Ministry Magicals saw the opportunity to outlaw themselves practising it (motivated by that fear, envy, and Light-politics you mentioned) in order to push the danger towards the 'lesser races' - if anyone is going to do something that might harm themselves, why not let the Goblins do it so that anything going wrong wouldn't hurt 'respectable wizards'. Hence why the Dark might agree with it. After all, the Goblins didn't sacrifice a large portion of their citizenry to fight Grindelwald, did they? :)

Would make as much sense as any explanation for using that nigh-cliche'd trope. :)
