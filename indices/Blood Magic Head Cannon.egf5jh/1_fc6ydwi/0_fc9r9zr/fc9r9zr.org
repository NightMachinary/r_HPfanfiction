Thank you so much for engaging with me on this topic. I particularly appreciate your point on dangers of using blood that's 'going off'. That, and the point that I can create any arbitrary limitations I like. I suspect I'll require an, at minimum, grey magical affinity with a specific gift for blood magics to be able to do more than simply use blood based enchanted objects or participate in a blood adoption or religious observance. Without the gift, wielding blood magic would curse the caster, perhaps causing the condition you suggested.

Outlawing blood magic came, in part to protect the lazy public from attempting blood magic without first confirming both affinity and gift. Also, in part, due to envy - 'if I can't play, ain't nobody can play.' And fear, 'I don't want people to be able to use magic against me that I can't use. I won't be able to defend myself.' Add to that the 'squick factor' you mentioned, and outlawing it was probably the easiest of the 'so called' dark magics to be made illegal. As to timing, in the period just after the defeat of Grindelwald, the political ascendency of the light and their attempts to outlaw all things dark.
