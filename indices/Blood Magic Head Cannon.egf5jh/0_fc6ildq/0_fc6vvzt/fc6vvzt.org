Excellent points. A fic I'm following featured members of a dying house leaving blood in stasis warded location inside their abandoned manor house in the hopes that some future mage would revive the house via blood adoption. Time traveling Harry uses it to create a new identity and have a completely secure base of operations in the unplottable Kent family home (known to him from discovering it in his original timeline). The Veiled Vestiges by NeatStuff ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20552285/chapters/48785528]])

Suggests that, well protected, blood has a near indefinite shelf life. At least for the purpose of blood adoption.

On the other hand I'd be surprised if blood from a deceased person could be used to curse their line. Certainly it would be too late to curse their person.

I'd like to think blood adoption requires willingly given blood from a living person at time of collection.

Unicorn blood has several aspects, live Unicorn - forcibly taken or willingly given, dead unicorn - natural death or killed. I think blood from a unicorn that died a natural death would be almost as good as willingly given live blood, but post mortem blood from a killed unicorn would be just as cursed as forcibly taken live blood.

There would have to be spells that identified the status of a given sample. They themselves would probably be classified as blood magic, as they required the blood to test.

Excellent points! Thanks again.
