I think there would a sliding scale of usefulness. Forced/Neutral(Natural)/Willing. Did the resurrection spell Require the blood letting to be forced? Would it have been affected if Harry was willing?

I recall at least one fic where Harry indicates his blood is willingly given, as its added to the spell, despite how it was collected. In turn, weakening the ritual.

He was also already bleeding. Collecting blood from an unrelated wound might have been Neutral in this case.

For blood adopting, how vague can we get? Willingly giving blood for the future of your line, regardless of the recipient? Do personal and/or family ties or feuds factor in? Like say a blood feud between the Malfoys and, say, the Longbottoms. Malfoys die out and the 4th Longbottom in line to inherit decided to revive the Malfoy line. Can it fail? Just a rejection or can it be fatal?

How exact and/or intense do protective spells need to be. Sounds expensive. Or like it's Old Knowledge, closely kept, and obscurely documented.

Using blood of the deceased introduces a new factor to care of the dead. Are bodies drained of blood after death? What would happen to it? Are the dead cremated to prevent misuse of blood? Are there specific crimes against violating a grave or what have you? If magic is classified, would that be Dark or Black magic? Would it be familial magic if done by a family member or relative?
