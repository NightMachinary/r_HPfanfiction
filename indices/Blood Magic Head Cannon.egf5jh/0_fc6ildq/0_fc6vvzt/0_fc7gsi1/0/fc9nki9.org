I've added the following points to my list, with notes of some related head cannon of mine, inspired by the discussion here.

- Blood protections (I.e.: Lily's ritual blood magic that left the rune scar on Harry's forehead) and 'Potter Luck' a (mostly) beneficial 'line curse' on the family line (expression of which varies according to the individual's magical power level, thus Harry's repeated bouts of incredible luck - a 'power he knows not').\\
- Declare/dissolve blood feuds
- Blood bind magical contracts via signing them with a blood quill. (After Umbridge Harry is reduced to clever use of misdirection and half truths, together with judicious failure to correct misapprehensions, when he needs to deceive (like the Fae), as he no longer has the ability to tell an outright lie.)
- Creation of homunculi and vessels of resurrection ('blood of the enemy, forcibly taken') - combined with the appropriate amount of soul magic, as necessary

I'll have to work up a format to outline the limitations, and related aspects (treatment of the dead, etc. ) and details related to long term storage and finer aspects of blood adoption.

Thank you so much for engaging me with this exercise.
