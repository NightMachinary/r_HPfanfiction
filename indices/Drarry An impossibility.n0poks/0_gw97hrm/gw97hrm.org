I don't think Drarry is in any way likely if you follow the book canon. I find the "Drarry with book canon" fics where they try to legitimize Draco's actions annoying.

If the author tweaks things so Draco's not such a racist prat? Or it happens later on, as adults, when he's grown up? I can see it.

Now Tom Riddle/Harry? THOSE are impossible without mega tweaks, IMO.
