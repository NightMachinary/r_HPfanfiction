Realistically Drarry maybe but im stretching alot snd it would have to be decades later

Dramione i dont see at all because she's litterally the oppressed minority he was trying to actively genocide. He can reform but I don't see her being in a position where she can be intimate with him even if she can forgive him. Doubly so considering Hermione is very on board with promoting minority rights like say with the houseelves and her sympathizing with werewolves.

buuuut most Drarry and Dramione do alot of what if situations and create situations that were very different than canon often giving Draco very different experiences that could lead him into a position where ya you can see either ship become canon its very deviated from canon but thats kinda the point
