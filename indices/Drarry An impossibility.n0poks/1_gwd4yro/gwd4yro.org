Firstly, cannon Harry is 100%, fully, completely straight. So even if Draco was the nicest, most not death-eatery guy Harry wouldn't ever even consider dating him specifically because he was a he and not a she. Secondly if Draco was a girl, or you replace Draco with Pansy Parkinson or someone like that then no, Harry probably wouldn't date them if they were even remotely sympathetic to the death eater cause. Despite fannon portrayal Harry is not a very accepting person in cannon at all, he probably wouldn't date anyone from slytherin in general even if they weren't death eaters.
