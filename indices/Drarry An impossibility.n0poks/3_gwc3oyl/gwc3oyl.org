While I'm not generally a fan of slash, and I dislike this particular ship on principle, I can see a very slim possibility of it happening (with minor tweaks) up until somewhere in /OotP/ like when Harry gets that Quidditch ban or Malfoy joins the Inquisitorial Squad.

By /HBP/ there isn't any chance of it at all.
