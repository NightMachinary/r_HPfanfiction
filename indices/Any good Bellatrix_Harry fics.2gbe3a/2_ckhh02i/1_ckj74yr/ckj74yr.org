Just finished reading what there is for HP and Turning of the sun. Can't say I like it: as you said, it is pretty slow. On the other hand, I did read all that was there. I would have finished the story, if it was complete. But IMO, its not good enough to follow, especially since the story isn't complete after 4 years of working on it. One thing that I found disappointing about it is that it doesn't showcase how awesome Bellatrix could be.

Now to try The Taste of Your Magic. Edit: well that was a mistake.
