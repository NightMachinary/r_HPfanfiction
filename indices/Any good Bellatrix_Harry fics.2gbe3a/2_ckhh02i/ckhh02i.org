This one is pretty slow,but it's a decent fic. Delenda Est is hands down the best Harry/Bella fanfic. I've read Passageways, but don't really like it due to all the clich√©s and the way the author wrote Bellaxtrixs character. However, beggars can't be choosers.

Earl of the North was one of the first fanfics I read and I don't remember much about it.

This one was /really/ weird but may be interesting to some. It doesn't seem to be what you're looking for but I thought I'd mention it.
