Not really what you are asking but in linkffn(prodigal delinquent) he is that kind of OP and more or less ignores Voldemort and the whole PS plot, it only updates every few years though.

And in linkao3(This is not the chosen one you are looking for) it's a crossover with good omens in which he is the Antichrist, so Voldemort is petty much insignificant in the plot, bonus in which it is already complete.

And in linkffn(Storybook Hero by dogbertcarroll) it seems to be heading in that direction, but it is still in the beginning and only updates occasionally.

None of them have Daphne Greengrass as a particularly important (or even present) character though, closer one I can think to this would be linkffn(The mind arts), but in this Voldemort is shown as an actually significant threat.
