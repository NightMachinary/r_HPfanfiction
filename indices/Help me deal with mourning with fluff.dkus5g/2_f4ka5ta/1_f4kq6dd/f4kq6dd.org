Never thought I'd see "The Quidditch World Cup" by TheEndless7 recced in a thread asking for fluff. 95% of the story is fuckin depressing last I checked. Might not be the best to read about the history of a failed marriage which concludes in cheating and neglected spouses when OP wants distraction from depression. Even if the other 5% of the story could be considered fluff as it is a happy ending in a way.
