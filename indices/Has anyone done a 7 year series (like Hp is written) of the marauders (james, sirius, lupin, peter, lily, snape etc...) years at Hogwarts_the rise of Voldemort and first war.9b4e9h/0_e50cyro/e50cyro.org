If you don't mind Sirius/Remus, this is a fantastic AU that has been going through all seven years of Hogwarts from Remus' perspective. And now beyond! /But/ it's AU in that Remus grew up in an orphanage. It doesn't change Sirius/James/etc. backstory. Just Remus', so it changes his character arc. He's still somewhat the Remus we know and love. But with lots of internal angst.
