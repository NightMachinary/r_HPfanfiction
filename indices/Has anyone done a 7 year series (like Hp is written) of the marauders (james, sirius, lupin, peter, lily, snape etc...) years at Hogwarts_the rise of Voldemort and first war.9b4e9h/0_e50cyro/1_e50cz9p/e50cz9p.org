  VERY LONG fic charting the Marauder's time at Hogwarts from Remus' POV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges.Eventual wolfstar, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! On the plus side, I do update very often (sometimes twice a week, sometimes daily).HOGWARTS YEARS COMPLETE! - Will be starting on the War Years next :)***WINNER of the 2017 Marauder Medal, 'Best Work in Progress' by the Shrieking Shack Society!***
