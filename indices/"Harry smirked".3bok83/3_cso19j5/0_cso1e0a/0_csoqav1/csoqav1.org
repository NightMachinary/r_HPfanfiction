I really love terrible fanfictions. I search them out.

I think my favorite was one where Itachi was Merlin.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8013278/1/Eye-of-the-Beholder][This one]]

Heres what his wand is made of:\\
1. a Unicorn who gave two drops of its blood freely to him;\\
2. an Akki that gave him a fang after being defeated;\\
3. a Ningyo gifting him one of its pearl tears after he resisted its allure;\\
4. and finally the hair of the Grand Elf when Harry had been pulled into their realm during his sleep.\\
5. "Twelve and three sixtieth inches," he explained, getting a raised eyebrow at the precise measurement, "made of my femur bone after I had been bitten by a Nudu."

And he'd had twenty sorcerers helping him with it. At age 8.

So bad I could never get pass chapter 6...but one of the most remarkable experiences of my life.
