He says 'my dear boy' to Harry at least seven times, but he's not alone in that. It's a common enough phrase for Harry used by Slughorn, Trelawney, Hagrid, Minister Fudge, Minister Scrimgeour... Dumbledore even refers to Draco as 'my dear boy' and Tom Riddle gets it several times from Headmaster Dippet and Hepzibah Smith. It's something of a Rowling-ism.
