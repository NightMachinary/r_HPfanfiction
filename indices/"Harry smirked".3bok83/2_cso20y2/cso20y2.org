Following a brief scan of the books, I can say that Harry has smirked on more than one occasion, though never as often as Draco Malfoy, Snape or the Weasley twins. Ron has him beat by a handful of wry teasing half-smiles, and even Hermione has been known to exhibit an expression of schadenfreude.

It is the face of taunt, and one can expect an empowered Harry (often encountered in fanfiction) to have more cause for lording his quick wit over others. Certainly moreso than canon cork-in-the-ocean Harry.
