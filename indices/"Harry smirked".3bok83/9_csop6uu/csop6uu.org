In return you'll offered 73,200 search results and /free nightmares./

Some choice samples:

/Snape's coal-black eyes slid slowly to the left, wordlessly taking/ ~ /Snape snapped. His coal black eyes bore into the headmaster's/ ~ /Snape's coal black eyes looked into Harry's bright green eyes and he saw her/ ~ /Snape's coal black eyes hit me/ ~ /A salty tear leaked out of Snape's coal black eyes/ ~ /Snape's coal-black eyes began to glimmer/ ~ /Panting, Harry stared up into the coal black eyes/

What was that again?

Coal black eyes. *73,200 instances of COAL BLACK EYES silently swiveling as they are snugly set against their milky white backdrop*

In case it isn't clear, irises are usually brown, blue, or piercing green (if your name is Harry Potter). Black eyes would be irises the same color as the pupil. A coal black eye would be a featureless black circle against the white of the sclera.

No wonder the students hate Snape. I think you could write a compelling/horrifying story just by stringing together quotes about Snape's coal black eyes. . . . . . Bonus round!

/Coal black eyes, surprisingly soft, looked down at me as Snape reached into.../ ~ /His coal black eyes bore a serious message. "You will".../ ~ /as her teacher stared at her, his coal black eyes daring her to continue.../ ~ /His coal-black eyes reflected the pale light of the nearly full moon above them. "I promise, I won't hurt you/ ~ /meeting the coal black eyes unwillingly, scared that Snape would delve.../ (Delving, is that what it's called these days?) ~ /Snape looked at the centaur with his coal black eyes, "Stay..."/

I'm not sure what was going on in the last quote. I wasn't brave enough to follow the link.
