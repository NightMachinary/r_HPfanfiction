OH, I really like the balance of these spells. They seem all realistic enough to be thought of by J.K. Rowling (meaning I could definitely see them in the books or movies.)

I would see the fear curse being based on boggarts, taught by Lupin in the third year. But there is some form of counterspell missing. Really seems like Dark Arts more than anything. But then again, it is a curse after all.

And the Lightning Bolt one: Would that be summoning a bolt of actual, physical lightning, or would it be like the sensation of a lighting hitting something or someone? This would probably be a spell heavily influenced by intent.
