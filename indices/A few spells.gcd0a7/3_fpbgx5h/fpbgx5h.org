I am trying to research some Welsh, Sumerian, and Sanscrit to make some exotic spells, also shamelessly getting incantations from Merlin.

Though I haven't found a good source for Ancient Egyptian spells.

Because we know there were Wizards before Latin was invented/spread, so they probably used their own language for their spells.
