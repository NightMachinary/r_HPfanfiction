I would like to share one of my favorite original spells.\\
It's the favorite Curse of my OC Isaac Grimblood, he's a sadistic Ravenclaw that likes to experiment on people he has affinity for Lightning magic and has a freaky obsession with Death and Necromancy, in my fic he's Harry's best friend and the heir to Ravenclaw.

Scalpere, the ripping curse. - Isaac's original and signature curse, it's a cutting curse that fires from the wand a bright purple scythe like blade of light that can tore other beings apart depending on the force behind the spell.\\
It's also pretty versatile, because the half moon blade will be fired accordind to the moviment made with the wand, can be horizontal, vertical, or even a 360 degree rotation that would fire to all sides, this curse also have a penetration effect, after striking a shield charm, the blade of light will shatter and some of the shards can pass trough the shield, causing minor damage to the opponent.
