I've started writing this... Here's what I've got so far...

Hermione Granger could have belonged to any of the houses, really.

She was determined to be the best, and she knew how to make the most use of her available resources which fit in with the Slytherin ideals. Only she didn't really consider people to be a resource, and her level of self preservation was perhaps too lacking for that house.

She dearly wanted to be brave and popular, and she had a stubborn, mulish quality that would do well in Gryffindor. She had her own lofty ideals that fit in with that house's sense of chivalry.

She was deeply distressed by unfairness and held justice highly on her list of values. Her past successes had been largely due to the amount of effort she put into her endeavours. Like a good Hufflepuff.

Those endeavours were largely academic. She loved knowing and learning anything and everything. She also loved the written word and how a person could turn a phrase to give it multiple meanings. She remembered a tutor telling their student at the library once 'So, Romeo, he's sitting under a sycamore tree, syc amore, sick with love because of his pining over Rosalyn' and she was hooked.

She loved research, and figuring out the cryptic crossword in the newspaper with her dad. She loved watching documentaries with her mum. She loved going to museums, and galleries, and guided tours of crumbling monuments with both her parents on holiday.

And she loved planning, and thinking, and dreaming, and imagining, and 'learning about learning' as an old teacher had told her. She loved taking the personality quizzes in teen magazines, even though she they were pseudoscience (she learned that she was the take charge type of her friendship group). She loved taking the personality tests with her therapist who also taught her how to deal with bullies and a fear of failure (as well as acknowledging one's strengths).

And after all that introspection the hat said, 'Well, Miss Granger, I know where you will thrive, it's tough to remember sometimes, but Rowena knew that there is much more than just knowledge needed for true wisdom. Keep that in mind because you are perfect for RAVENCLAW!'

Perfect, she beamed as she ran up to the applauding table, I'm perfect for somewhere
