I'll take a look. Meanwhile, I tried to like the Ravenclaw!Hermione fic. I honestly did. But, it's exactly how I had expected it to be. Pretty much nothing happens that didn't already happen in canon, and the only effect of sorting Hermione into Ravenclaw was to make her all nice and passive. It seems like a weird extrapolation, but whatever floats the author's boat, I guess.
