I have to admit I don't like non-canonical sortings much. It's better just to take somebody who actually is a Ravenclaw and create story for him/her. One of stories I really miss it being finished is linkffn(11858501). Although, HP/Avengers crossover ... bleh, just say no. Perhaps it is better it has not been finished.
