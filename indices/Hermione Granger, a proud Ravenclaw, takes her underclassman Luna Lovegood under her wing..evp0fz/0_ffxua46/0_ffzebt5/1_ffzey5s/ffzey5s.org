Thanks for the recommendation! I think I've seen it before, but I was turned off by the "lonely and friendless" bit in the summary. This is exactly what I am talking about when I say that there are practically no fics in which Hermione is in Ravenclaw and actually likes it there. She's basically in a holding pattern of misery and uselessness until (in order of frequency), Harry, Bellatrix, or Ron comes to her rescue.

On your recommendation, I'll give the fic a try.
