English doesn't really have words for someone who is above/below another person in grade/form. Japanese has「先輩」 /senpai/ and 「後輩」 /kouhai/ which describe this type of relationship, and they are usually translated as "upperclassman" and "underclassman", but it's not an ideal translation, since those English words tend to describe absolute class/grade/form rather than relative.

Maybe "Hermione Granger, a proud Ravenclaw, takes Luna Lovegood, one grade her junior, under her wing."?
