Not really. Or at least, not where I live - I grew up in the North and hit the lower years of secondary schooling in the mid 2000s. I think. My only vivid memory from back then was being young enough to be scared by the Empty Child when Doctor Who first came back.

We might call them 'lower years' and 'upper years', I suppose, but it never really came up as a student. If you're pretentious you might call them the 'lower forms' (vs the 'upper forms'), but that's a tad archaic these days outside of places like Eton and Harrow.
