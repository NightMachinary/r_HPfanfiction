It's an interesting series which sadly has not aged very well. Like with many old stories, the tropes are nowadays completely overused.

The other issue is Andromeda. There are a couple of scenes where Harry gets beaten up by the Dursleys, Andromeda is mad but still sends him back. The story is overall pretty casual about child abuse worse than canon.

That being said, the friendship between Harry and Tonks is sweet, even if the get together part in book 4 drags on a little.
