In this series case, I don't think it's just a matter of not aging well. I read it as it was being posted and my opinion of it then is pretty much the same as it is now, since the eternal struggle back then was to actually find an indy!Harry story that was done right. Anyways, this story does have some pretty cool elements in it, such as powering up the Philospher's Stone. I don't think I've seen that sort of thing in any other story.
