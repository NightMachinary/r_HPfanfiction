chelseyb has some of the better HP/NT fics in the fandom. Her only completed 'long' (100k+) fic is The Rebel and the Chosen, which is essentially a canon-rehash with Tonks way more present. Some people take issue with that, but since the focus for me was on their relationship than the plot (and its woven well) I don't really mind.

she took all her fics off FFN a while ago, so you'll have to google it, but it's not too hard to find.
