Thanks for the mention, but in all, these are the stories that don't quite fit the original request. Jamie, Holly and Jennifer are all more fond of girls, though there's some fun interaction between Jen and Viktor Krum in Princess. Also, Holly and Jamie aren't originally girl!Harry.

What all these stories do have (in contrast to most fem-Harry stories) are strong central characters, epic battle scenes and quite a bit of no-nonsense dark magic. That, and the authors write with an ending in mind, as demonstrated by having complete first stories in all three cases.

Just trying to provide full disclosure, here.
