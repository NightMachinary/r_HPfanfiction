[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/536450/chapters/952621][The Never-ending Road]] by laventadorn is definitely my favorite. Two caveats: it is a WIP and it is eventually Harry/Severus, BUT nothing happens while Harry (Harriet) is underage. In fact, the fic is 446,164 in and they are nowhere near a romantic relationship yet. It was also updated less than a month ago, so it is not abandoned. Anyway, here's the summary: "AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Deathly Hallows. Future Snape/Harriet."

Another good one that is complete is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8121773/1/Of-Power-and-Prestige][Of Power and Prestige]] by Ell Roche and ExcentrykeMuse, but it is so AU that you almost can't call it a girl!Harry, except for the fact that her father is James Potter and her name begins with an H. It's very different from canon, even the magical world and the politics/society is very different, but it's really good. "Nothing could tempt Marvolo, Lord Slytherin, to leave the Lone Islands---except, perhaps, for Lady Haesel Potter, the most powerful witch of her generation. TMR/Fem!Harry."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7905430/1/Life-As-She-Knows-It][Life As She Knows It]] is pretty good as well. It is also very AU, though perhaps not as drastically as "Of Power and Prestige." It's Harry/Severus, but nothing happens between Hollis and Snape until she is in her twenties. It is also a time travel fic, which I like a lot but I understand is not everyone's cup of tea. BIG WARNING: WIP hasn't been updated since October 2013. "Hollis Potter, with grim determination, walks into a battle that will make or break England - and affect the World War raging around them. The outcome is surprising, even for her, and she is left with nothing to do but adapt. TimeTravel / FemHP."

And finally, this one I don't remember much about. It's a WIP, last updated in January, but I haven't read it since I added it to my story alerts a year ago. If you're anything like me, you read so many fics that you can't always remember which was which. That's the case here, so I can't say much about it other than the fact that I apparently liked it enough to follow it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] by Taure. "Fem!Harry AU. When she was seven years old, Alexandra Potter discovered she had special powers. She thought she was the only one, but then a letter comes and reveals to Alex a world she never knew existed. Will she become the hero so many believe her to be? Or will she lose herself to the temptations of power? Character-driven story, lots of world building. Not a canon rehash."

There you are. Hope you like them.
