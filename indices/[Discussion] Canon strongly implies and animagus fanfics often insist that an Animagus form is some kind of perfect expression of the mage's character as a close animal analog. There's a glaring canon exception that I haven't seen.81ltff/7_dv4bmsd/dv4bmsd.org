I always thought of the Animagus transformation as an expression of what you want from yourself. Not in your own animal choice (that part being more a subconscious choice), but in what it represents for you. And then as they come to understand their choice they grow closer and closer to it.

Take Peter, he was small and weak. And what he wanted was to be quick, smaller, sneakier even, and what he got was a rat.

I always thought James wanted to be a Lion, but ended up getting a Stag. Same concept of wanting to be proud, but different execution.

Sirius wanted to be a Dog I'd bet, but unfortunately got a scarier and more intimidating form than he wanted. Because of his own need to be strong, not wanting to be like his family.

McGonagall perhaps wanted to be Regal, or Aloof, or however she herself viewed cats. That represented what she wanted from herself.

Let's try Harry, what animal represents him? Perhaps a Peregrine Falcon, they travel farther than any other bird, fly faster than anything else, and are loyal to their partners, and in general are solitary. Good reasons, but that's fitting him to an animal to me.

Why would Harry want to be this animal? Because they are free, they go wherever they please, and they enjoy moving fast, talking down birds much larger than them. Size doesn't mean anything. From that mindset coming from an abusive household, regularly locked up by friends and family, the appeal of a flying form seems perfect.

Hermione, some would say she's an Owl, because Owls are representing smart people. That's pretty dumb reasoning. I'd choose a Lioness for her. She chose Gryffindor, she wants to be brave, she wants to learn, she wants friends. I think a young Hermione would easily pick the lion and be surprised at her subconscious choice.

Ron would want to be Lion for the same reasons as James to be brave and proud. I'd give him a peacock, remember the Mirror of Desire? He wants to be noticed, to be looked at, have fame. To not be like all the rest. It's not easy to ignore an peacock with it's tail flared. No matter how wide the shadow of being friends with Harry Potter is.
