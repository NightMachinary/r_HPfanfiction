In response to Pettigrew's form, the way I see it the animagus forms are based on common depictions of animals. I mean, snakes aren't evil, but in religious and mythical stuff they are often depicted that way. Same thing with rats. They make really intelligent, cute pets, but Rowling seems to go on the way animals are traditionally depicted. And when people think of rats, they usually think of wild, disgusting, disease ridden rats. I don't know whether that's a misconception on Rolwing's part, or her just using the widespread ideas people have on animals.

So Pettigrew; indeed, lazy, disgusting and a piece of vermin.

Sirius; his animagus form is of course based on his name, but he's also incredibly loyal and playful (prankster).

James; I would say he's a stag more he likes to strut, rather than being posessive. But proud, definitely

And as for McGonagall, I don't know, it fits somehow. But that might just be me. She comes off as stern and severe, but she's got a pretty soft heart underneath. That fits with some of the cats I've been petsitting, who had to warm up to me at first and were distant and untrusting, but turned out to be wonderful cats once they started trusting me. But I admit McGonagall's animagus form is the least obvious out of all of them and perhaps the least logical.

And either way, I sometimes petsit a wonderful cat who is completelly stupid, wants constant attention, is a lapcat and really clumsy. Aloof and disinterested doesn't go up for every cat.
