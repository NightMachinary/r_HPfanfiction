This goes right with Hermione harboring a blind, uncontested trust in authority figures. The girl who lied about pursuing the troll on her own to make friends, made the Polyjuice Potion, turned back time to rescue an escaped Azkaban inmate, tried to upend the Hogwarts house elf system, founded a secret club in explicit violation of authoritarian rules and ended up fighting a war.

Lol, Hermione Granger is one of the most rebellious characters in the Potterverse. Just because she trusted that Dumbledore knows what he's doing doesn't make her a lapdog of Authority.
