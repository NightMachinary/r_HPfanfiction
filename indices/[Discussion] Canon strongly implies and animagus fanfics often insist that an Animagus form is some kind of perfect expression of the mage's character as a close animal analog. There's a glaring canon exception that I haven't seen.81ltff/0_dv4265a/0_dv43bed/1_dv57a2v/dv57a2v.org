Yeah she might tell Dumbly how she feel but still follows his word to the T.

She let him leave a baby outside in the cool with only a blanket and note. Show me in canon where anyone cast any spell to help a baby stay warm or a sleep. At his age a kid would get cold wake up, cry and then craw around.

She asked if they could do some thing about the scare but because her hero gave some odd answer about scares can be useful she does not insist on getting a kid that just got hit by an AK spell get a small look over by even a school nurse let alone a healer.

The even though she liked both his parents and she knew where he was and that they where "the worst sort of muggles" she still never went to even check on him. She could have went and made it so no one would have known but she did not because blind faith.

Plus she could not have been really thought Hagrid was a bad "babysitter" because it is the same person that first takes him back to the wizarding world just a few pages after. What changed her mind to think maybe Hagrid was maybe not so bad a keeper? One thing...blind faith.

I could go on if need be but it is clear that she might tell the headmaster her thoughts but still always follows what he said no matter what.
