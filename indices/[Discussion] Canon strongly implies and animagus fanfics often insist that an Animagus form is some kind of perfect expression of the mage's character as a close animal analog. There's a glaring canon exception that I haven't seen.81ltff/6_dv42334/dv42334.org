An animagus form perfectly reflecting somebody's character doesn't quite make sense anyways. After all, your character changes all the time. You can fundamentally change as a person in just a few short years. Yet, there's nothing to suggest that an animagus form changes. Not that it matters much for literature, since you'll only see a small slice of a character's life at a time.

Of course, there's more to cats than sleeping all day and eating whenever. They /have/ to play or hunt or they get bored. They're solitary most of the time, but are still capable of social behavior and do form small packs on occasion. When they're hurt or scared, they isolate themselves and hide, which is sometimes instead interpreted as pride. Lord knows we have plenty of ideas about arrogant cats.

You can write around that anyways. Perhaps Minerva /used/ to be aloof and disinterested. If somebody also had an academic interest, then went into teaching, they would seem like a strict professional. Only socialize when necessary, and only develop a tolerance for others after prolonged exposure. You could even write a fanfic about how she actually came to respect her colleagues, particularly Dumbledore, after the first conflict with Voldemort. You could use her reactions to others while she's a cat to illustrate what she thinks of them, and the big turning moment would be when she seeks out Dumbledore of her own accord - like how you know you've earned an aloof cat's respect when they come to you without any prompting or bribing.

The way I see it, it's not so much a plot hole as it is a missing detail which doesn't necessarily need to exist in most stories. Hell, it's not like it mattered much in canon anyways. About the only really important animagus transformation was Peter's, and the important thing was how it functioned as his disguise. On the other hand, you can expect a story with a focus on animagi to go in whatever direction they feel is most appropriate for making it an interesting topic in itself.
