OH NO. THE THEORY OF SELF. People either never change or are always changing. I don't remember which philosopher said it, but it's been posited that our personalities are entirely contingent on circumstances and context and not at all solid so that would support that theory. Of course, there's a dozen to dispute it but that's philosophy for you.
