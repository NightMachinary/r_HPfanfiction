  Harry Potter hated his fame, hated the way everyone compared him to his parents -- who he never got a chance to meet. Adults saw his parents in his hair or his eyes, whilst his â€˜friends' saw a celebrity first and a person second. He just wanted to be a normal pre-teen. Who would have thought the combined powers of the Mirror of Erised -- a device that mirrored your greatest desire -- and the Philosopher's Stone -- an artifact to give one immortal life -- would team up to offer him a new start? Finding himself in a world not his own (repairing itself from a recent alien invasion of all things) Harry must survive the horrors of puberty, learn a whole different kind of magic, deal with sentient technology, oh, and maybe save the universe. Timeline: Harry from 11->14, The Avengers through to Age of Ultron.
