  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  For as long as Harry Potter could remember, he had only ever really needed---and wanted and longed for---one thing. Family.Family cared for one another, even at the expense of others that was not part of that family. In that, Harry could say that family is selfish and he was okay with it.And Death had always been a part of his life and he might as well hold on to what was left for him. It's that Harry Potter is Harley Keener AU nobody (including me) was looking for. HIATUS
