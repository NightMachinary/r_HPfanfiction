"Mine" and "Hauntingly" by ObsidianPen, which are part of the "Haunted and Hunted" series. Voldemort realizes Harry is his horcrux and kidnaps him, then doesn't tell anyone about it. Even has his death eaters look for him. And his prison, when it's revealed, is really unique in fanfiction.

Despite the underage dub-con in the first story, the second is hilarious. Harry doesn't spend the story as a captive getting raped (a worry which kept me from reading it for a long time). It's full of laugh out loud moments without being crack and great canon twists on the sixth and seventh books. It does well with portraying the forms of friendship, love, and power. "Hauntingly" also ends beautifully. HP/LV slash.
