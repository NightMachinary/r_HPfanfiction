It's never mentioned in canon that you need a license for any of the jobs, and I would honestly assume only being a Healer would require a license (as canon's a bit blase on letting randoms have access to mind manipulating magic without consequences).

However, a Healer's license isn't a license that allows someone to be able to perform healing magic, it would just be a right to practice. E.g: it would be illegal to open a clinic or work at St Mungos without a license, but it wasn't illegal when Luna fixed Harry's broken nose without one.
