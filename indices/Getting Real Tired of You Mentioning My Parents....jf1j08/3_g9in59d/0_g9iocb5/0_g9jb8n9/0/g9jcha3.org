Then again, they do throw around the title of Professor to anyone who wants it (e.g: Lockhart, Umbridge and arguably Firenze). I understand that Hogwarts, in many ways, seems to be its own entity, but with how easily the Ministry is able to interfere in 3, 5 and 6, I do wonder what sort of licensing and qualifications the Ministry actually hand out/enforce.
