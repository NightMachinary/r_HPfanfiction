  didn't James become an Auror and Lily an unspeakable?

That's not canon at all. James and Lily left school and went pretty much directly in the order full time. They didn't have any jobs and were bankrolling their life with the Potter family money.

At no point is it ever mentioned that either of them had a day job.
