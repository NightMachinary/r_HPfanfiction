I think Ron would be better as head Auror since he is more strategic and better at people management. Harry is more warped by the war, bit of a saviour complex, angry at ministry, constantly scrutinised by public. Once Hermione gets closer to Minister for Magic the two of them can work more closely on reforms.

Harry needs either 1. Travel/exploration/independence 2. Routine/mundane 3. A noble cause like education or health, (teaching would combo better with 1&2 rather than healing).
