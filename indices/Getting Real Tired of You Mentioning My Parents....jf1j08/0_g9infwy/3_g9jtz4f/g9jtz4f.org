The ministry is almost always way more of a hindrance than any kind of help, with some pretty fucked up things going on in it (Dementors, soul and emotion eating monsters, were casually allowed to roam a school where emotions would be at an all time high with coming of age students. They ended up trying to kill Buckbeak, an animal for acting like an animal after a sham trial, I mean come on.), and not only does it stay in power by the epilogue, Harry's a god damn auror/wizard cop for them.
