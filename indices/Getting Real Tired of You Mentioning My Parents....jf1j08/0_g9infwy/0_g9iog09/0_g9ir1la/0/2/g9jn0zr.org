/Kind of/ Bungle in the Jungle. Harry isn't an official curse breaker himself, but after finding out about the usual manipulative Dumbledore (a trope which I personally hate, but the rest of the fic is so good that I can look past it) bullshit, he runs away, runs into Bill Weasley, who, after learning about the shit Dumbledore did, offers to take Harry with him on his curse breaking trip in Brazil. It's a lot of fun, and I heartily recommend it. (He /does/ learn some curse breaking from Bill over the course of the story, which should fit your query, and they spend a lot of time delving into ancient ruins)
