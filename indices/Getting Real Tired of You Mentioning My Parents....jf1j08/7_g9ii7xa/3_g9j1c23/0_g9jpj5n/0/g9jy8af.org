Use the carat (^) symbol to turn the next word into a superscript. Use parentheses to turn the next series of words into a superscript, or to apply the superscript to only part of a word. (Periods count here, so this is useful for when it's at the end of a sentence.) Use multiple carats to make the superscript even smaller and tinier.

^{Example} the first. =^Example the first.=\\
^{Example the second.} =^(Example the second.)=\\
^{^{^{Example}}} the third. =^^^Example the third.=
