There might not really be any elaborate ritual- Lily didn't have time to do one, unless its something she could do in advance and leave sitting there to activate at an indeterminate point in the future. I always thought it was more like Pettigrew's supposed connection to Harry, or wands switching allegiances- something more vaguely defined which just happens if the right set of circumstances occur. Heck, we see a similar magic invoked when Harry sacrifices himself in the wood, and there doesn't appear to be much to it beyond "person (magical person?) is willing to sacrifice themselves to a completely avoidable death to protect others" (its obviously not enough to just die in battle- you have to have had the chance to escape death and chosen not to take it). One can see parallels to Christ sacrificing himself to redeem humanity in Christian mythology- Rowling has described herself as a Christian, albeit obviously not a fundamentalist one.

I do think it makes Lily a stronger character though if it was something she knew about and deliberately invoked. Otherwise, there's no reason for her not to at least try to fight Voldemort, and it makes her a much weaker character who just got lucky.

As to the mechanics of how the magic itself works, that would be something that's probably difficult for an author to describe. In-universe, it would probably something locked up in the "love" room at the Department of Mysteries by the Unspeakables.
