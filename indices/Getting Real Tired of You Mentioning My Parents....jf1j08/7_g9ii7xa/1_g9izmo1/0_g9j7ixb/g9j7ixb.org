I wouldn't put sacrificing yourself for another in the same category as sacrificing an unwilling third party. I'm not sure who would, except maybe Ayn Rand disciples. I can't see why it would be criminal- its not even suicide really, because it was Voldemort who killed her, and the protection only took effect in the event that he actually did so.
