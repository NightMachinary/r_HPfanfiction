  I hate making Lily's protection dark magic, it feels like an assault on the intended themes by people who think "the power of love" isn't dark and edgy enough.

I am /entirely/ willing to believe that it'd get /called/ dark magic because it was done by a. a witch of the wrong social class b. a muggleborn and c. outwith the parameters of 'acceptable, decent, respectable' magic.

Magical Britain bears entirely too strong a resemblance to the Muggle Britain of which Vernon Dursley is such a regrettably illustrative example for me to believe that 'dark magic' really means much more than that in the mouths of most of the characters anyway.

/Maleficium/ and 'magic that requires inherently criminal acts' are certainly dark by any reasonable definition, but we're not talking about reasonable people here, are we?
