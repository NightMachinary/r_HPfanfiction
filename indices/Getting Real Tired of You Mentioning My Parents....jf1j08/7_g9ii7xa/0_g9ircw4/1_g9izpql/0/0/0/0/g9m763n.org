I think so too. From what I can think of: I'm pretty sure there is bad scarring on George where he lost his ear, then there's the scarring Bill got from Greyback, which was also permanent and /extensive/ and finally, a lot of Moody's scars (and partially missing nose) are badly healed (and not regrown) due to dark magic/dark curses. I /could/ be wrong though.
