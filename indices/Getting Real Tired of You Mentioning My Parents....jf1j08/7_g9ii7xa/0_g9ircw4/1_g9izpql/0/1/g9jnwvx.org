Not sure if it is said in "plain text", but isn't dark magic/arts in the books just magic with the main purpose of harming others (from very mild discomfort up until death and torture)? I ofc know that the magic in Harry Potter isn't divided in "Dark" and "Light" like The Force in Star Wars and that there are no politico-societal divisions called "Light" and "Dark".
