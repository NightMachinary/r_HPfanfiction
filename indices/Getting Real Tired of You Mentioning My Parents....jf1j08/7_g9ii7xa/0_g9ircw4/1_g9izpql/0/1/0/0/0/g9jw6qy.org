You literally described one. 'Magic with the main purpose of harming others' is as good a summary of its definition in /Malleus Maleficarum/ as you could hope for.

(That work also insists that such magic can only be performed by women and it's the only kind women can perform, because Heinrich Kramer wasn't just a raging arsehole he was a raging /misogynist/ arsehole.)
