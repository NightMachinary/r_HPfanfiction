I'm actually okay with a lot of tropes that are not well liked. I think their infamy stems mostly from them being employed poorly and cheaply:

- Children acting like adults: It's fine. Better than reading a story about pulling pigtails. Other attempts around this like "everyone starts Hogwarts age 17" never make sense to me.

- Magical cores and their depletion: A sensible idea if you want Magic to be more tangible and rule-based. Rowling avoided such problems for the most part by using friendship, love and strength of character to resolve difficult situations, but her track record isn't entirely spotless. Brandon Sanderson has addressed this well in his [[https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sanderson's_Laws_of_Magic][Laws of Magic]]. Magical cores are only bad when they are used as an excuse to make Harry mega powerful.

- Soul Bonds: Actually quite intriguing. One of my favourite stories is about a Hermione/Bellatrix soul bond. As long as the bond is a premise and not a solution it can be an asset (as opposed to trashy romance novels that use accidental pregnancy as a solution; a bad use of soul bonds is similar in function in bad soul bond stories).
