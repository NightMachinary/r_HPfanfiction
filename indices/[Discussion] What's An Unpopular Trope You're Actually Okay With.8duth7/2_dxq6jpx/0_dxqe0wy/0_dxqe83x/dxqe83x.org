Yeah I mean, there's a line, right? I was thinking more in the direction of "children acting more mature than their age would suggest".

No-one is going to do anything except laugh when 11 year old Harry Potter threatens to bring the wrath of House Potter, that - in its entirety - consists of an 11 year old child, upon Dumbledore. But I wouldn't actually count that as acting like an adult. There's many other probelms with such scenes, the least of which being that Harry acts too grown up.
