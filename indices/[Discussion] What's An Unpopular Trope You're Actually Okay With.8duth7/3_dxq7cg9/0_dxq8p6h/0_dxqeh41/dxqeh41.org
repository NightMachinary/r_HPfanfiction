Telepathic communication appears often in Soul Bond, but it's not a defining characteristic (I've seen some without that).

Usually the Soul Bond basically forces two people to be 'destined' for each other romantically. If Harry is involved there's a lot you can do with that by him being quite mad that another of his choices has been taken away.
