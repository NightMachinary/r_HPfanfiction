The problem with this analogy, canonically, is that (with the exception of a few notable spells) there's no evidence that magic involves any active effort at the time of casting, other than saying the incantation and making the wand movement... both of which wizards frequently dispense with anyway. All the effort is in the past: mastering the magic in the first place. Once mastered, magic appears no more taxing to cast than saying a word is. This is quite different from playing the piano, which still takes concentration.

Of course, in fanfiction writers are free to change this up.
