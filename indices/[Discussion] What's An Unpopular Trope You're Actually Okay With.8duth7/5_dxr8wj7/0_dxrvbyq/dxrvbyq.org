  Magical exhaustion--not magical cores, but the idea that magic is like a muscle that can be overexerted, because unlimited magical stamina breaks the story more.

Indeed. In my head canon, I liken casting magic to other intensive physical+mental tasks like playing piano or competitive fencing. To borrow an analogy from [[/u/taure]] there's no finite "piano mana" one can conjure from one's musical core, yet playing complex pieces at a high level for a long period of time is exceedingly difficult. Though I'm admittedly not a concert pianist, I don't think I have ever practiced for more than two hours in a sitting, and when I do pass hour mark, my mind and my forearms are often exhausted and it's not my most effective playing.

I'd imagine magic would have a similar drain on the caster.
