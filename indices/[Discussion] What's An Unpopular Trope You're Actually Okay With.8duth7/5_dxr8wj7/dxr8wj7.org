My philosophy is that any trope can be made to work in the right hands. I'll indulge in Dumbledore-bashing, soul bonds, Super!Harry, and so forth if it's already well-rated because sometimes, you find gems like /Core Threads/ or /The Amplitude, Frequency, and Resistance of the Soul Bond/. As for specific tropes I actively like:

- Magical exhaustion--not magical /cores/, but the idea that magic is like a muscle that can be overexerted, because unlimited magical stamina breaks the story more.

- Muggle-wank. Even if muggle technology isn't an advantage or is even somewhat behind magic, the enormous population difference is going to tilt things heavily in the muggles' favor if it comes to it.

- The "standard" fanon characterization of minor characters like Daphne Greengrass. I've always liked how there's a sort of lore beyond the canon for things like this.

- Political kids. Eh, more of a guilty pleasure than anything else.
