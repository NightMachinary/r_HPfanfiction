*Soul bonds*: They could be interesting, but 99% of the time they're often ridiculous excuses for OP!Lord!Harry, used for instantly perfect romance (no fun) or in one case that I know of used to make characters hate each other for being bonded when they didn't want to be. They could be cool if they were just this rare occurrence which could lead to a blossoming romance, but the characters still had to work at it like an actual relationship. Like perhaps instead of giving telepathic conversation abilities, make them allow for empathic communication. They can feel what their bond-mates feelings are (unless they're using Occlumency) and so they have to work on their relationship until they can be verbally honest about what they're feeling as well.

*Runaway Harry & Metamorph!Harry*: I'm not sure if these are actually unpopular (I haven't actually bothered to read any stories with these tropes), but I give them a mention since they're the premises upon which I wrote my own fic, "Break the Limits". I think they have a lot of potential if used properly.

*Manipulative Dumbledore*: Now I've grown tired of Dumbledore bashing to some extent, at least when it proceeds to make Dumbledore outright evil. A Dumbledore who is much like canon, but has to actually own up to his mistakes rather than the nonsense we got in canon where he bears his heart and (seemingly) all is forgiven until DH is interesting. One where it's not clear whether he was in the wrong or in the right to dump Harry on the Dursleys. Grey!Dumbledore could fit this but I've rarely seen it done convincingly.
