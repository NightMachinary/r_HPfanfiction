My issue is where the place of the manipulation comes from. So many stories have Dumbles as straight up evil or full-on Greater Good dictator mode and everything I do is okay. Dumbles has been shown in canon to, after Ariana dies, never aspire to seek out power. He was shown to honestly care about Harry's well being. Yet many a story have him treating Harry like a weapon, with Dumbles trying to achieve power over all (including actually trying to overthrown the Minister desperately, which makes no bloody sense since he turned down the role like three times).

Granted, I'm a Harmony dude and I've found a whole bunch of Harmony writers hate Dumbles with a passion. But damn, Dumbles has his faults and, as he said, they have dire consequences since he's a powerful wizard and highly respected. You don't need to make shit up, just use the ones he already has.
