Eh, the thing is he did accept power. Oh he turned down the position of Minister of Magic, but I'd submit that being the headmaster of a widely acclaimed school that is autonomous from the government and member of a Parliament/Top Court makes one pretty powerful. Whether he wanted it or not (pretty clear these positions weren't forced on him), he had power, even if he didn't seek all the power he could have had.

The manipulation would be his unilateral decision on how and where Harry would be raised. You can argue the merits and negatives of doing so, but it was manipulation either way. And I ship Harmony as well~
