I get amused when people go off on rants about notice-me-nots. Like, you can get away with that without any magic. Attention blindness covers a lot of things.

If you are paying attention to something, really paying attention there can be a guy in a gorilla suit wandering around and you might see him but your brain won't register (actual study done).

Also there's the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BavarianFireDrill][Bavarian Fire Drill]]. Look busy, look like you should be there and mostly, people don't question you. Lots of people have conned lots of other people that way.

So why not a magic that does the same thing. Probably wouldn't work on someone like Moody, Snape or Dumbledore but for walking down a street relatively unnoticed, it makes sense.
