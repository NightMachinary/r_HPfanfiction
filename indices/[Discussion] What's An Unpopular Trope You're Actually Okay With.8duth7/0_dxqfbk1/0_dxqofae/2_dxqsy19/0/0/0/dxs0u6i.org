Moody is paranoid, not actively defending against every possible spell (this spell basically does exist in canon, see the way the Leaky Cauldron is hidden, even from wizards until they know it's there). And i didn't say you couldn't stop the spell once you noticed it, I was just saying the idea that there are people you just couldn't use it on seems untrue.
