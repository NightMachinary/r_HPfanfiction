Well, there is the fact that it's used on yourself or whatever and that makes everyone miss you regardless of everything. I find it hard that a spell places on /you/ could have so strong an effect on everyone in your vicinity and all that without them being able to do anything about it.

I'm absolutely fine with it being something that nudges the attention away from you, makes you easier to overlook, but stops working if they're actively searching for you and doing it properly or if you pull attention to yourself via, for example, being loud. The spell working as a universal “now everyone automatically fails a spot check when looking for you no matter what” thing is so low-effort that it's just sad.
