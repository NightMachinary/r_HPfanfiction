And that is exactly it, really. Many a plot device that people dislike are only really disliked because the overwhelming majority of time they are used poorly, uncreatively, and in ways that cause plot holes in world building, when really they have potential and would not be bad if used by writers who actually cared. This is just one more such thing.
