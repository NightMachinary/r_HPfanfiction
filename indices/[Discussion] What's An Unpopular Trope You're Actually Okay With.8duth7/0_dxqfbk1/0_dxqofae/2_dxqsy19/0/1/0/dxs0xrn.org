This spell basically already does exist in canon though. The spell hiding entrance to the Leaky Cauldron works on wizards and can be dispelled from oneself in exactly the way you described (once Harry knew it was there it became visible). Sure, anything can be used poorly but that just means people abuse things to the point of being OP which they should stop doing. :)
