It's not making the man pregnant, but besides a C section, the birth part is what's disgusting me about the concept. Maybe it's because I have male genitalia, but the thought of giving birth... It seems painful enough for women and they are biologically equipped to do that. Imagining squeezing a baby through a cock or basically shitting it out...
