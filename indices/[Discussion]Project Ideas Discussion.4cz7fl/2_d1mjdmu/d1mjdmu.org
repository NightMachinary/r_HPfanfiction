Your first idea is great.

Marriage law is a terrible plot device the fandom has come up with. A powerful, time-traveling Harry will never accept being forced into marry anyone. A government that sanctioned and enforced rape was the worst form of tyranny, even Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and Maoist China didn't go that far. If the British wizarding world was stupid enough to enact something like that, there could be only two outcomes:

1. Harry leads a mass exodus to let those inbred bastards die out by themselves in the *Harry Potter's Reaction to the Marriage Law* style, linkffn(6049450).

2. Harry kills off those insane blood nazis in the *Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution* style, linkffn(10595005).
