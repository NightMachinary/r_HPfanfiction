Re: Marriage law:

Would your opinion change if I eliminated the marriage law and instead replaced it with Voldemort forging marriage contract as his means to force Daphne into Harry's confidences?

Basically, I'm looking for a way to put Harry in an awkward quasi-romantic position with someone too young for him where just telling them to go away isn't an option, and neither side are right or wrong.
