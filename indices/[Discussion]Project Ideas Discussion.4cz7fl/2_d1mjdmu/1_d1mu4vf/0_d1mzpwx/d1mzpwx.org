That wouldn't make sense either. A marriage contract should only be created if parents/guardians from both families agreed to it. Unless Dumbledore or Sirius signed for Harry's side, there was no one else in a position to do so. Then again you must ask the question why Dumbledore would bother with forcing Harry to marry someone, what were the benefits for his cause and the greater good?

Since this plot of yours is a time travel, you have two 20+ years old going back and apparently very powerful ones. May I ask what form of time travel? Time-turner, memory, or alternate dimension?
