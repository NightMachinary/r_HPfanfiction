The first idea interests me. I'd cut out the multi pairing idea and throw away the bond if you chose Gabrielle, but romance aside, sounds interesting.

The second and third ideas do not sound interesting at all to me.

The second idea is too crowded. You have too many facets. Also, servant family and ritually bound marriages are a nono, imo.

The third idea is going to be half-parody, half-serious, and bad as a whole. Ideas from those two categories do not mix.
