Right, I forgot the part where wealthy aristocrat Harley Quinn joined the KKK and then died fighting at Joker's side.

Their motives, values, backstories, and the ultimate trajectory of their character arcs are radically different. But you just ignore all that, because "crazy women" are all just interchangeable.

Let's break this down. Bellatrix is from wealth and privilege. She believes in pure blood supremacy and was likely raised to "do her duty" and enter into a respectable pure-blood marriage. She was drawn to Voldemort likely because he was the standard bearer for pure-blood supremacist ideology, and because his power and cruelty appealed to her sadism. And she remains blindly loyal to him to the end.

Harley... this being the sprawling mess of continuities that is DC, it varies somewhat from version to version, but generally she's not from wealth or privilege, and doesn't give a damn about ideas of racial supremacy. She is drawn to Joker because he represents a kind of freedom, and she mistakenly believes that he loves her. In most versions, she eventually moves past that attachment, striking out on her own-and while often violent, is at least sometimes capable of acting heroically.

So yeah, treating them as interchangeable because they're both "crazy women" is fucking sexist, and if my saying so makes you uncomfortable, I'll be over here playing the world's smallest violin.

Now go ahead and downvoting me for making insecure boys feel threatened by pointing out facts.
