You're conflating two separate questions here- who is worse, and whether they're the same. My point about Harley's motives is that she and Bellatrix are not interchangeable characters.

Also, you're bogging the conversation down by twisting my words and forcing me to defend irrelevant tangents, and I know from experience that the only way to win that game is not to play. Bye now.
