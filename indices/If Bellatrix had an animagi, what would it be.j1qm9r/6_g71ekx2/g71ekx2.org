Probably something that kills for fun. For some reason I'm getting ocean vibes maybe because there is a lot of large predators in the ocean and a lot of them do like to kill for the thrill of it. Animals that surplus kill include wolves, jaguars, orcas, red foxes, leopards, lions, spotted hyenas, spiders, brown bears, American black bears, polar bears, coyotes, lynx, mink, raccoons, dogs, and humans ([[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surplus_killing]]). A spider would be super interesting especially the spying aspect doubly so if she's a magical one that's way more venomous than normal spiders. Hyena too, would fit her, probably no bear... very interesting question all the same! I think a spider fan fiction of Bella would be so interesting.
