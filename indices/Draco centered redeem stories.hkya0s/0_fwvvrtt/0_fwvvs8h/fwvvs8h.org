  Draco Malfoy accepted Dumbledore's offer of help at the top of the Astronomy Tower too late to prevent what he had started. Given shelter with his Mother's sister he finds himself facing up to the true nature of the cause he once pledged himself to. As the war worsens he is forced to confront his worst fears and decide what kind of Wizard he wants to be.
