I remember one fic that was a perfectly average though well-written (paced and plotted) 'Harry befriends everyone and is powerful and popular' fic, until suddenly Harry turned around to Hermione in the middle of a DADA lesson (I think?) and suddenly started talking about how homosexuality causes Squibs and that's why every magical-raised person (and Harry) was shunning their fellow classmate who was recently forcefully de-closeted.

The Author Note on that chapter was a very rambly mess about how the author was a proud Christian woman teaching young girls in a rural American town and how everyone had the right to an opinion (Which, y'know... if your only justification for your opinion is that it's not illegal to have, you really need a better opinion) and we shouldn't be mad for her expressing things there.

I didn't read any more of that fic.
