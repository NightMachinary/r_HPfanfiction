I read one that was developing a slow-burn romance between Harry and Luna that suddenly became a full-blown dom/sub relationship.

There was another one that started out pretty good, until, suddenly, George W. Bush is visiting Voldemort, thanking him for the contribution to his campaign for governor of Texas, and offering his help in reciprocation. Around that time, formal courtly language also started being used by the Hogwarts students.
