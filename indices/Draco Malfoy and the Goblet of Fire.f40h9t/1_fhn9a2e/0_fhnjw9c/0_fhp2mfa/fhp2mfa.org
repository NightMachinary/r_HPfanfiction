Could go the other way and have Malfoy senior messing up each task by his sheer ineptitude. trying to pay off the dragon by doing what a Malfoy does best throw gold at it. Buying Draco diving equipment that doesn't work or has know clue how to put it together. Think “a black comedy” levels of jokes and verbal barbs. It would be hilarious
