  Crouch Jr. accidentally puts in Draco's name instead of Harry's, Draco convinces an older student to put his name in, etc.

I would prefer Harry somehow manipulating events so Draco's name instead of his is put into the goblet. Maybe he learns in advance about the goblet and that contract thing. Or maybe he is a time traveler with future knowledge. But I think it would be only fair, something like entirely justified vengeance, if Harry had a hand in this, considering all the shit always heaped on him - with Draco being one of those responsible for that.
