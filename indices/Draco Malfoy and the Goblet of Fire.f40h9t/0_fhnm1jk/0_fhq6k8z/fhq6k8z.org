I'm not sure how that could work. Harry's own name would be on the paper as well as his own magical signature, considering that he was the one who created the copy.

If, however, he took Draco's paper, made a copy and then smuggled the copy into Draco's bag, keeping the slightly modified original, the paper would still have largely Draco's magical signature...
