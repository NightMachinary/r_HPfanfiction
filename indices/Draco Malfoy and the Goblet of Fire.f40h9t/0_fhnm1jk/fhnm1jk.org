Harry forgets his DADA homework and is reminded by Ron at the last minute of potions with Slytherin. They see Malfoy's bag unguarded and hastily copy his work before heading off to Moody's class.

He is supremely surprised when he learns that the Goblet considers the paper to contain Draco's signature, never mind who's name was printed at the top.
