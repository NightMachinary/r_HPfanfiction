This tends to be my favorite genre so I've got some good recs here. Not all of them meet your desired length. Also a couple were mentioned in this thread already but I'm gonna rec them again anyway.

linkffn(Travel Secrets First) and sequels. This one has Dumbledore bashing, but it did does so it a way that doesn't irritate me like most bash fics. It is an AU like Dumbledore instead of the author trying to convince us canon!Dumbledore was a bad person. The story is about a 20-something Harry going back in time after he learns a nasty truth. It focuses on Hogwarts life and Slytherin House.

linkffn(Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen) Voldemort learns the prophesy and decides trying to kill Harry isn't a good idea. So he sends him to an alt-dimension. However the connection between them still exists. James and Lily live in the AU and it features a really good OC.

linkffn(C'est La Vie) This is one of my all time favorite stories. Harry won the war but it left him a rather broken person, hes a hermit who drinks too much so Fate offers him a chance at a life where he isn't the BWL and doesn't have that responsibility. 4th year fic, Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived and did all the canon Harry stuff. James and Lily live, and the AU Harry Potter is a major git. Its well written, the characterization is phenomenal but it isn't much of an adventure fic if that is your desire.

linkffn(The Lesser Sadness) When Harry dies in the forest he's offered a 3rd option to death and returning to the forest. Harry trades a piece of his soul to return to the 3rd task, however he can't go around with an incomplete soul, so they splice in a couple other's pieces.

linkffn(A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story) Harry gets catapulted through time into an alternate dimension. So he get Sirius out of prison and poses as his son.

linkffn(I'm Still Here by kathryn518) Long and slow moving story, but well written. Harry interrupts a ritual of Voldemorts and ends up in an alternate dimension where Iris Potter is the girl-who-lived. 4th year fic James and Lily live. Mild Dumbledore bashing in context that he didn't do enough Harry's first time around.

linkffn(The Wizard Who Meddled With Time) Harry learns to control time and goes back to his 4th year to do things properly.
