As far as I'm concerned, Delenda Est linkffn(Delenda Est), is /the definitive/ time travel fic. Very well written, and paints a striking picture in your mind. Ships Harry/Bellatrix, but not in a smutty manner. Expands well on how noble family politics work, and Voldemort is actually scary. There is no character bashing.

The author previously wrote 'Earl of the North', which is incredibly cringy and awful. But for this one, he/she teamed up with someone else, and crafted a needle in a haystack of bad HP fanfiction.
