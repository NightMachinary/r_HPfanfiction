*Welcome to Hogwarts 1949* linkffn(2550563) is one of my favourite fics. It hasn't been updated in a long while, but the author is currently writing another story and said they'd come back to this one at some point.

Then there's *Back Again, Harry?* linkffn(3693052) which is probably abandoned, but I remember it very fondly.

*C'est La Vie* ist also a great read, and also abandoned. linkffn(8730465)

*A Stranger in an Unholy Land*. Complete, I think. linkffn(1962685)

*Only Enemies*. If you're in the mood for Harry/Bellatrix. linkffn(2896398)

And another favourite of mine: *Circular Reasoning* linkffn(2680093) It's really long and still ongoing.
