[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope by Jeconais]] has Harry go to Beauxbatons as a teacher post war. It is a pairing centric fic focusing on a romantic relationship between Harry and Gabrielle (who has gotten much older at this point) and is quite well.done in my opinion. Harry is overpowered AD, but it doesn't really matter cause the conflict in the story is largely emotional rather than physical.

All in all 8.5/10 would read again.
