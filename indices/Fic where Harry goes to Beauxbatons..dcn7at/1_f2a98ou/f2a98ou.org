The French magical school is one I've always wanted to flesh out/see expanded - though not really as Beauxbatons, because its canon interpretation (like Durmstrang/every non-Hogwarts magical school) falls flat for me (Norway to Bulgaria for Durmstrang? Why is there one school for the UK and one for France + Iberia + the low countries? Where do the Italian students go? How do ministries without a school in their borders deal with that?

Obviously the other magical schools were (at most) an afterthought, so developing them wasn't very high up on JKR's list. I've toyed with some thoughts on expanding magical Europe's worldbuilding, with Western Europe being heavily influenced by the French Revolution with wizarding involvement (eg, Georges Danton makes for a perfect half-ogre ;) ). Just haven't found the right idea to bounce it into.
