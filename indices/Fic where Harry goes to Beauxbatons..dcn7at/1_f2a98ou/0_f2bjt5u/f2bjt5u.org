Reading Pottermore for what the canon lore on the other schools really rings home how ridiculous a lot of the expanded canon(everything not in the core books) is.

There are 7 Schools, 3 in Europe, 1 in Africa, 1 in North America, 1 in South America and 1 in Japan. That's it. It really kind of bad, almost as bad as how magical US turned out.
