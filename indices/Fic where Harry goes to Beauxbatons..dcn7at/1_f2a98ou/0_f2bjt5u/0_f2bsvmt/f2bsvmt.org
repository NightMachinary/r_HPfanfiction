Yeah, it just doesn't make much sense. Plus the names kinda stink - like Beauxbatons/Durmstrang are in line with Hogwarts, if a little less silly. But the one magical school for all of Asia being called 'Magic Place Academy of Magic'? 'Wizarding Castle' in Portuguese for a Brazilian school supposedly as old as Hogwarts (ie, centuries /before/ the Portuguese came to Brazil)? Ilvermorny doesn't even /mean/ anything, and has houses for some reason.

It's just a mess.
