It could easily be later than the 2nd century - the 4th/5th century attacks by Saxons would fit well too, particularly if we view the Arthurian legends as more Welsh (where the britons lasted longer). The version of King Arthur I'm most acquainted with included a Saxon invasion .

But your twist would work well there. I'd not been aware of Merlin supposedly being Slytherin - him being a mythical pre-founder figure works nicer imo, perhaps being the one to switch to the use of wandS?
