#+begin_quote
  Rocked by the guilt from the Battle of Hogwarts, surrounded by the ghosts of the dead and drowning by the expectations of the Wizarding World, Harry vanishes one night from the Burrow and is not seen again for three months. He resurfaces at the first place he'd ever called home: an interim Defense Professor at Hogwarts Castle. Students, lessons, and spell casting has always brought him calm, but as the world rebuilds around him, he struggles to rebuild himself. One thing is certain: All is not well.
