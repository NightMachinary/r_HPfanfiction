i like the last few. the dursleys have similar feelings to harry the wizard as the trio have towards tom the horcrux' so that might explain there reaction. also, ron does become more of a dick as the story progresses.

the last one is interesting. imagine how useful that hat would be if you made one to do something more useful than sorting houses. surely the ministry has a similar thing they do use? and things like traces and aparation/portkey tracking are obviously as useful to a wizard as hacking your communications is to the us government. perhaps wizards are just going through a dark-age.
