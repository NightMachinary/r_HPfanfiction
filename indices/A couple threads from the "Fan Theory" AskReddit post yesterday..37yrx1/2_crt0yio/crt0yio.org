The Dursley being affected by the horcrux and some shady side of the wizardin world keeping wizards ignorant of muggle tech is my headcanon.

In my opinion magic doesn't disrupts electronics so much , only Heavly magical places like hogwarts/diagon alley do. And only to the extent that EMP protection would be enought.

This is also intentional because it incourages muggleborns to not use muggle gadgets and therefore making it harder to come up with magi-tech or similar.
