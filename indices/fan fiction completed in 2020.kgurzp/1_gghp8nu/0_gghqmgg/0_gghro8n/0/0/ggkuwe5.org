Right??

That wasn't the intention I had going into this story (but then again, I didn't really have any intentions...) but the more I thought about it, the more I realised that Regulus is basically the /perfect/ character to fulfil that role. He's been there, he's been recruited as a schoolboy, he's /died/ as a schoolboy, and he has all these frustrations and feelings of injustice that Dumbledore can do to Harry what Voldemort did to him and still come out as the good guy. And he also doesn't have the teaching staff's cumbersome mortal/corporeal burdens - he doesn't need to worry about lesson plans, or angry parents, or even getting injured!

But most importantly he knows that division and secrecy and bottling things in didn't help him and it won't help this generation of children either. They might find it weird, being mothered by the ghost of an 18 year old boy, but he'll be damned if he won't try his best to help them!
