  The second anniversary of the war dawns on Wizarding Britain and Harry Potter still does not feel anything approaching normal. He had really thought waking from that 24 hour nap after the Battle of Hogwarts would fix him once and for all, but two years on, he's still unable to sleep through the night, so jumpy that his girlfriend is worried about him, and he doesn't know what he wants to do with his life after he failed the psych evaluations necessary to become an Auror. He had never expected to feel perfect two years after the Battle of Hogwarts, not that he knew what that was like, but he *had* expected to be okay.Good thing Harry Potter's well used to disappointment.

  Harry's words spiraled out through Remus' mind in dangerous fractals. What exactly did â€˜gone' even mean? He had thought Peter was gone for a dozen years, only to find that he was alive. The entire Wizarding World had thought Voldemort gone until he had returned! Why should he assume the permanence of Sirius' death when that line was blurred, when that line was as fragile as the flutter of a Veil? Could fabric not be torn?     In which Remus Lupin must come to terms with third chances coming at a very dear price.*Written for Fireside Tales 2020*

  Regulus Black died twelve years ago and was transported to Hogwarts, as a ghost. It's not the place he would have chosen to linger for all eternity, but he supposes it's pleasant enough.
