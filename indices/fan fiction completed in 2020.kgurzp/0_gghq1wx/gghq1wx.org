Well I started and completed a story this year, and the sequel will miss the 'this year' cutoff only by a week or so. It might not be the one most people wanted, and it might be relatively small compared to the great fanfiction epics. It might even be a crossover, which I know many do not like, but I really enjoyed writing it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13521865/1/Kicking-Gotham][Kicking Gotham]] is a HP/DC crossover set post Hogwarts and it was some of the most fun I've had writing since the early days of Shadow of Angmar. The sequel is also almost done. So if you squint it's kinda like a 180k word story in two parts.
