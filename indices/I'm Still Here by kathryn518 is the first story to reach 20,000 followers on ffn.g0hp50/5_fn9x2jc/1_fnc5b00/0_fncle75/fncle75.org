It's useful to be able to look at your favorites list and think, "Yep, any of those is one I'd be happy to read again." While the follow list might include ones that you're keeping an eye on because you've started and don't want to leave them unfinished, or you think they have potential but aren't really sure how they'll turn out once they're done, or you start one and get interrupted before you can really make a judgement but bookmark it just in case you want to come back to it.
