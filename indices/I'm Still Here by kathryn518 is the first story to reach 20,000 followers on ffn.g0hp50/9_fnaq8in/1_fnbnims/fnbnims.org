Team 8 is a really good fic to read if you know Naruto or if you're interested in the anime. It's around the premise that Naruto is assigned to a different team.

In canon, he ends up on Team 7 where he's taught by Kakashi who is very hands-off and rarely teaches anything. Where in Team 8, he ends up with Kurenai who instills basic disciplines and much more proactive in his development.

It's a rarely good look into the ninja world. Pretty writing, good reflection of the characters and not a rehash of canon.
