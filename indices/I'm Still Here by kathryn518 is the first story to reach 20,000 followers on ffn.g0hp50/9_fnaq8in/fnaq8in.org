Wow, I'm glad it got more over HPMOR but I don't really think any of the top fics (except for team 8, know nothing about it) deserve them. Dodging Prison - Child Grooming and bad writing. HPMOR - bad writing, bad author, incorrect science, bad ethics. I'm Still Here - standard manipulative Dumbledore tropes and associates.
