I have not yet read a SG/HP crossover with a Ginny/Harry pairing. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Stargate-SG-1-and-Harry-Potter-Crossovers/68/224/?&srt=4&lan=1&r=10&s=2]]. I recommend everything up to "Nobody Said it would be easy" with the exception of Harry Janus Potter. I haven't read any of the fics after that (except for a couple fics that are <5000 words).
