Eh, the majority of evil!harry stories ignore the fact that riddle and harry are essentially mirrors of each other, signified mostly by their similar looks and opposing hue eyes. If one showed harry growing evil as riddle grows to regret his actions only to be murdered by the new dark lord harry to cement the sheep's view of him as a savior that could be interesting but few evil harry stories have him being competent, they just have him essentially declare he's the new dark lord.
