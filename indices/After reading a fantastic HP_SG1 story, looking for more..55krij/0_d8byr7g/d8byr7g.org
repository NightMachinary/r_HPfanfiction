[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9261735/1/Madness-at-the-Gate][Madness at the Gate]]. It's a sequel to another story. It's basically a sort of guilty pleasure type story because Harry is basically a Gary Stu in how OP he swiftly becomes, but he's also an asshole and I find that sort of thing entertaining. Think mad scientist with magic + Greg House, and it's sort of similar to what you might come up with in your head. He pairs with Tonks in these stories.

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4564625/1/Isis-s-Bane][Isis's Bane]] that stars a younger Harry. The premise is that a Gould gets inside Harry and takes him off-world. He defeats it, but then has to deal with SG-1.

It's pretty short (three chapters), but it splits into two longer stories. They're AUs of each other. One is "what if Harry went on by himself" and the other is "what if Harry went to stay with SG-1?"

The nice part is that they're "complete" stories and one of them even has another, finished, sequel.

I quite liked it, but then I was a huge fan of Stargate growing up, so I'm a sucker for this crossover. At least, when it doesn't get too unbearably stupid.
