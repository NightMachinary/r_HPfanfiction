I read Isis's Bane this morning and I'm reading the Jack raising Harry sequel atm. I think I'll skip the Harry-Sue one for now. I actually [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9900528/49/An-Anthology-on-Broken-Pottery][wrote]] a short bit on a character driven story last night as well and may write a few more pages or so on the idea, probably a few vignettes.
