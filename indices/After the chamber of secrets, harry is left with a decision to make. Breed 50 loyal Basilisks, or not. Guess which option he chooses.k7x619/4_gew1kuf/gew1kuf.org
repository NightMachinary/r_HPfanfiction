Idea: Basilisk wardrones.

Breed a ton of baby Basilisks, train them in recognizing foes, not harming friends. Build a tube that one can slide in with various buttons and levers that can be moved by the snake. Add flight charms, maybe find some physics exploit that provides a physical force (I can think of a dozen ways to do that) to provide fighter jet like acceleration. Give each a way to communicate with others. Teach the snakes to use their new vehicles.

End result: Drone sized flying intelligent snakes with instant death beam that attack in swarms. Anyone that looks at one zooming towards them? Dead. Anyone who doesn't look at it? Doesn't see the bomb dropped from it, also dead. Anyone who survived that? Good luck aiming at something that fast and maneuverable. And the Basilisk leader can just sit at home in another country, view the progress on a magic mirror whose counterpart is being carried by a snake-drone, and issue commands. No need for an expensive army of henchmen. World domination, here I come.
