[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11131988/1/Birth-of-a-Nightmare-Man][Birth of a Nightmare Man]] is a nice heartwarming story about Harry recovering from Azkaban dementor exposure. It's got a fair bit of bashing and a little bit of angst, so be warned about that, but once it gets going ti's a fucking bloodbath. It's the prequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11131988/1/Birth-of-a-Nightmare-Man][The Nightmare Man]], I'd suggest reading what's written so far of Birth before going into the sequel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6764362/1/][Here's a fic that ships Harry and the Joker]]: Harry gets locked up in Arkham and snaps. Definitely qualifies as a sadistic Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7309863/1/][Prisoner's Cipher]] is sort of a sadistic Harry, I think? I don't know. This story was too much for me to handle sober.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2973799/1/][Equal and Opposite]]: This fics got more issues than you can shake a stick at. Harry literally gets addicted to fucking himself.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/881050/cloneserpents][The Screams Series]]: The Ultimate Harmony ship. There are 6 one shots in the series. Take a look through his fic list to find them. They're probably exactly what you're looking for.
