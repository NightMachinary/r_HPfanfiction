Here are a few more, some of them aren't from the Potterdom though:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9976928/1/The-bloody-Ashikabi][The Bloody Ashikabi]]: Harry gets raised by a psychopathic swordsmen. The Sekireiverse is kinda weird, but its a fun story with lots of violence and the whole Lord ___ - ___ - ___ political bullshit takes a backseat in the trunk of the car.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9117546/1/Birth-By-Fire][Birth By Fire]]: A fate stay night corssover. Shirou is raised by Kirei and is no longer a bland-ass motherfucker focused on heroism. Also Avenger is fucking awesome. I'm a little biased on this one since I really like fire so a story about a psychopathic pyromaniac kinda hits all the stuff I like in a story. I'm not 100% sure about sadisticness in this one though.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/slaughterhouse-nine-days-worm.361191/][Slaughterhouse Nine Days]]: This one's from the Worm fandom. It's told from the perspective of Jack Slash and is most him bringing a group of special individuals together for a higher purpose.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/phobophobia-worm.326972/][Phobaphobia]]: Another from the Worm fandom. In this one, Taylor's power is super strength powered by the fear of everyone around her. It increases the more scared people are.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8064299/1/Consuming-Direct-Control][Consuming Direct Control]]: Crossover between Prototype and Mass Effect. I'm not sure that this one is a sadistic sort of thing per se, but it's definitely Mercer doing terrible things for shits and giggles.

I'll probably come up with some other ones eventually. I'll post them when I do.
