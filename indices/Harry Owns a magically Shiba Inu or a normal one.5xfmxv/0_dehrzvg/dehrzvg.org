What kind of weed are you high on and more importantly, where can I buy that shit? Anyway, passing drug enquiries aside, you seem like the type to be into all that cutesy type of story with no actual plot and just a metric fuckton of cuddling. I know just the fic that will make your day, and I can recommend you for the low low price of 199.99$. Just kidding. If I did that I'm pretty sure I would be against the wall and getting reamed from behind by Rowling and her squadron of Death Lawers before I could say 'Doge'.

Anyway, the only story that I know of with a Shiba Inu in it is Darkness Ascendant by [[/u/viol8er][u/viol8er]], who wrote it in 1998 when The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.
