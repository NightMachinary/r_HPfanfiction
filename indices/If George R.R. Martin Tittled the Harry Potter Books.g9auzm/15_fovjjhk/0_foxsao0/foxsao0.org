Needs to be someone sympathetic, important, someone who's death is shocking and shows how dark the setting is.

Maybe Ron doesn't survive the chess game? Or Harry himself dies, and the rest of the story is the others try to carry on without him. What made Ned's death so shocking, in part, is that he was set up like a major protagonist- and then he dies before the end of the first book.
