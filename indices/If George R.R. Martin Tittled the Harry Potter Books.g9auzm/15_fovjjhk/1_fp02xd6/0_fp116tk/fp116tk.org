People focus on Neville because he was the other choice for Chosen One. But Voldemort picked him, and while Neville develops a lot, he isn't protagonist material until late in the series, if then.

In all honesty, I think if Harry bought it in book one, Hermione becomes the protagonist.

Although GRRM likes his multiple protagonists.
