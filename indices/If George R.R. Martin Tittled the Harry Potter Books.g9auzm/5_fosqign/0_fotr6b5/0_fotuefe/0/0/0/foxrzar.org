Oh if only Albus/Scorpius was the worst bit of ship teasing that play does. While I feel its a pairing that's so common in fandom as to be cliche, there's nothing actually /wrong/ with it unless you're a homophobic twit. Time traveling Albus Potter/Hermione on the other hand? That is truly and genuinely creepy.
