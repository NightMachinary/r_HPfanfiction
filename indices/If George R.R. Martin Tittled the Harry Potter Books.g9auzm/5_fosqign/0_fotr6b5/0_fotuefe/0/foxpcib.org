The best parts, to me, where the finale scenes and the second alternate reality. Everything else felt like mediocre to bad fanfic- messy plot, character derailment, weird ship-teasing, the works. Even tiptoed on the edge of Dumbledore bashing as I recall.

But I'll give it this- I've observed that nearly everyone who's just read the script seems to dislike it, or outright hates it- and nearly everyone who's seen it performed live seems to love it. Plays are generally meant to be viewed, not read. So I don't think its entirely fair to judge it if you haven't seen it performed.
