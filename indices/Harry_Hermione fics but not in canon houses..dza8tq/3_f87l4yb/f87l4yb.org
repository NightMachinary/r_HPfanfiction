There's a fic called The Reclamation of Black Magic by ShayaLoonie. Harry is in Gryffindor and Hermione is in Slytherin. It's a WIP though. The [[/r/HPharmony][r/HPharmony]] subreddit community recommends some good HHr fics. They are organising a book club, you might find some interesting stories there and if I'm not mistaken someone is compiling a master list or something.
