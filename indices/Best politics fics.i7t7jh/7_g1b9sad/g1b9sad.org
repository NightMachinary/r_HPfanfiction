In my past decade of reading HP fanfiction I haven't come across anything better than linkffn(Emperor) with regards to politics and nuance.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) doesn't give me that same intense thrill of layered nuance, but the politics still get interesting and it's a fantastic series.
