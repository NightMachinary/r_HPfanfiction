Harry Potter and the International Triward Tournament

linkffn(13140418)

Cannot reccomend enough, I haven't read it since Chapter 37, been letting the chapter build up for a nice binge.

Still everything to then was amazing. Parts pass me off, parts make me nod along, but all of it makes my inner plotter try to figure what all is happening behind the scenes and what is going to happen next.

Love it,
