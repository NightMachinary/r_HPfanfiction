The pairing is complicated.

Since harry is as typical, 'lord of x and y' meaning he has to take more than one wife.

And contrary to normal tropes, this is something harry does NOT want at all.

Also the pairings are a mixture of chemistry between the character and political consideration. None of that marring for love shit, especially daphne. Tough she is very interesting on this fic.
