Seconding this. It starts off tropey - Harry being shunned, finding Slytherin's study, rapid magical growth, yada yada... but then it turns the cliche on it's head.

The writing is excellent from start to finish, don't get me wrong, but it starts off kind of predictable. The first major divergence from the tropes is when Harry thinks to get dance lessons for the ball. It seems to go well, until he realizes being Harry Potter puts him smack dab in a political quagmire and for all his growth, he's still a minnow swimming with sharks.

I won't get into details. I enjoyed following the story far too much to spoil the surprise, but I will say that Harry feels impressive, his victories - earned, and his enemies are the furthest thing from incompetent.
