For most of their schoolyard relationship Ron and Hermione lightly tease each other. Both of them went out of line a few times, but suggesting that Ron was constantly mean to Hermione is just not true.

Ron cut up her food when her hands were bandaged. He stood up for her to Snape in class. He calls her 'amazing' and 'genius' every chance he gets, and tells a psychopath to torture him instead of her.

The only times that Ron 'fucks up' are in Goblet of Fire and Deathly Hallows.

In Goblet of fire, he throws a 14 year old hissy fit after an argument. He didn't out of the blue say "you know what Harry, I don't believe you, so now I'm gonna abandon you". Harry calls him stupid for even suggesting that Harry did put his name in, and Ron has a poor reaction. He also admitted his mistake and apologised.

In Deathly Hallows he clearly was affected more by the horcrux than Harry or Hermione (as well as having lost a lot of blood from the splinching), and he immediately regretted his decision to leave when he disaparated away from it.

I'll say it again: If one horcrux can make Ginny try to kill people, it can make Ron chuck a hissy fit. The same horcrux made Hermione work into a dead end, and made Harry suspicious of his friends. It was only until after Ron destroyed it (by facing the fears and insecuties the horcrux used against him) did any of them come up with a decent plan.

Sorry, but while you tried to make your post seem reasonable and not a about the "personal aspects of Ron, his faults, flaws and whatnot", you immediately backtracked and did just that, with the same arguments that have been refuted time and time again.

To be fair, if you are basing your image of Ron from the films, or even most fanfic, you are probably right. But none of what you said applies to actual canon.
