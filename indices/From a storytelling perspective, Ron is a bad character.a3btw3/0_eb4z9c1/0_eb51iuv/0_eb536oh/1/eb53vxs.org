  Ron and Hermione never make those decisions for the group, so there are no consequences to actions they never did.

Hermione does not believe Harry about Malfoy. Therefore she does not start another intelligence-gathering program like in CoS. Malfoy's plot succeeds and he injures innocents in the process.

  or weren't truly his fault.

Neither of the other examples I provided were anyone's fault. Harry could not guarantee that Sirius was at the Ministry after all. I am not blaming Harry for what he did, but there still were consequences. Same with the fight at Godric's Hollow. And I am not blaming Ron for what he did. The reasons were understandable.

  if Ron actually had majorly fucked up at some point in the series I would be agreeing with you, but he didn't.

He deserted the only somewhat effective opposition against Voldemort for two or three months. Given the state of affairs in magical Britain, that seems rather major. And yes, the Horcrux caused this, that's why I am not suggesting any punishment for desertion or anything, but some consequences would be nice. Because while Harry and Hermione were miserable and hungry in the tent (idiot ball), he was comfortable at Shell's cottage.
