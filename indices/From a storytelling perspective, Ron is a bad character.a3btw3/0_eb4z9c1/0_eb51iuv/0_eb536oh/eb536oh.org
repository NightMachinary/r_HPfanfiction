All good dude, but I'm saying that the examples you gave either were false, or not Ron's fault, or in the case of the goblet of Fire incident, teenage boys being immature (go figure).

Hermione also doesn't get much consequence for her actions. In a schoolyard sense, her and Ron give each other the cold shoulder and hurl insults, but nothing major.

Its because Ron and Hermione aren't the protagonists. Being the defacto leader of the group means that he made the decision to try and rescue Sirius. So he feels that Sirius's death as well as Ron and Hermione's injury are his fault. He made the decision to go to the godrics hollow, and he looses his wand because if it. Hermione didn't make that choice, Harry did.

Ron and Hermione never make those decisions for the group, so there are no consequences to actions they never did.

The fact is, if Ron actually had majorly fucked up at some point in the series I would be agreeing with you, but he didn't.

The small and medium mistakes however, were certainly with their consequences. Every time he took a step too far with Hermione, he pushed her further away preventing them from getting over their issues sooner. Hermione did the same thing to him. After he didn't believe Harry, he was used as a test subject for the Harry to practice spells on, while Hermione wormed her way out. When Ron is driven away by the horcrux, he gets roughed up and his wand stolen by snatchers.

He does get consequences for his actions, but I fear you wish for him to be punished for things he never did, or weren't truly his fault.
