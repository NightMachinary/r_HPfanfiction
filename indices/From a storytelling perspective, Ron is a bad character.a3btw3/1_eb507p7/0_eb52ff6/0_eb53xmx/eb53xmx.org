Except that to 13 year old Harry, Ron is practically the only family he has. Would you forgive your best friend, one who you knew would die for you, and follow you into the heart of danger, for a two week hissy fit? I would, because brothers have misunderstandings, even though they would die for each other.

Also, Ron at no point called Harry a liar. He felt hurt that after everything, Harry would go ahead and put his name in without him, then when he tried to remain friendly he messed up by not believing Harry within the first 10 seconds, then Harry snapped at him and called him stupid, and then they didn't talk for 2 weeks before Ron sucked up his (considerable) pride and apologised in public.
