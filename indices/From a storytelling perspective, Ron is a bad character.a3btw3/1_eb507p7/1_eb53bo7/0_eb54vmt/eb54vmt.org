I didn't say it was friendly banter either - I said teenagers insult each other all the time, and there are no hard feelings involved, unless one party is a thin-skinned pussy.

Hermione also has several bitch moments in her 3rd and 6th year. When it looks like Ron's pet rat is eaten by her cat, Hermione harps something along the lines of, "They're animals, and cats eat rats." In her sixth year, she sets birds on Ron for absolutely no reason, when looking at it from Ron's perspective.

Also, you're conveniently ignoring all the nice things Ron does in favour of the times when he's being a typical teenager. Look up the other comment.
