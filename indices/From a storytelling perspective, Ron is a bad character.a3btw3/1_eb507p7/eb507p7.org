  Ron spent the better part of six years at Hogwarts making fun of or belittling Hermione

Friends jab at each other all the time. I don't know what kind of schooling you had, but my friends and I insulted each other to high infinity all the way through school and it was glorious. Maybe you don't remember your school days all that well, but use "belittle" in front of a teenager crowd, and you'll be laughed at for being a pussy.

Again, I don't know about you, but if a friend tattled on me to a teacher even if it was for my own good, 13 yo me would be fucking pissed.
