Reluctant prophet Severus Snape had me gasping for breath 😂 I imagine Snape being his usual dour and moody self after a vision. Going on rants at the first class of the year for 3rd years about “the true art of divination” and how “complete dunderheads can't possibly understand the complicated balance of a real Prophecy and a self fulfilling one, and why would they even try when luckily only one or two would prove to have the capacity to OPEN THIR THIRD EYE!” He also predict not one but all of his students deaths, several times, often he is the one doing the deed. Luna just thinks he is frustrated with the fact that Hermione Granger is a natural at divination while barely applying herself at all.
