Dumbledore freaks out because of this and decides that since he wants to raise the boys without magic, but needs them in the same place, the easiest answer is yet another muggleborn family. He consults the book of names for hogwarts for Harry's year (or younger) and goes and drops them off there. He could convince the parents to accept them, or he could use memory charms to just make the muggles think adopting was their idea.
