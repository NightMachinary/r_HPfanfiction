Every named adult from the series (who was born before 1965 or so) is a candidate, though a lot of them would need a redemption arc first. OCs are also candidates.

Dumbledore himself is an obvious choice. He's got the most personal ability with magic, will know the most about upcoming threats, and is the person he can trust most. However, he has long sessions at the Wizengamot at times (and presumably he does /something/ at Hogwarts), so he'll need someone to babysit. On the other hand, the average Hogwarts professor is much more busy, as is anyone with a normal job.

Augusta Longbottom too. She's raising the other potential child of prophecy. If the Longbottoms need to work, she's retired; if they manage their estate, she's already capable of raising Neville, so it's not that huge a time sink.
