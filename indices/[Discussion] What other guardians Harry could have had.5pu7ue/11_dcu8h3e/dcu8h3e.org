I reckon whoever the next closest non death eater family is. Personally, I don't think Petunia would dislike Dudley just for being magical, after all, it was what she always wanted. I reckon she'd want to raise Dudley to be a greater wizard than her sister's son. She'd live through him. I think she'd still dislike Harry, because he was Lily, and live through Dudley, because he was her.

Vernon's entire perception of magic was through Petunia, and if she told him Dudley was going to be a perfectly normal wizard, not like that freak James Potter, he'd go for it. He'd believe that James and Lily had been freaky, layabout, no good wizards, and that Dudley wasn't going to be anything like them.

She'd probably call Snape in, looking 'normal' as opposed to Dumbledore, and have him as contact. Dumbledore would make him do it, too. Snape grew up with Petunia, and was a Respectable teacher, who was basically a chemist, despite the animosity between them.
