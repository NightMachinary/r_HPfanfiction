I've read that fic too, and really enjoyed it. I definitely agree on your point about the Weasleys, they couldn't afford to take in two more children and even if Harry's bank payed for both of them, it would cause trouble if Harry and Dudley could get nicer stuff than the rest of them. I am leaning towards the Longbottoms as well, mainly because with Augusta looking after them, they wouldn't grow up spoiled.

The only reason I have for Dumbledore approving it is that in canon, he seemingly has control over Harry's life. Plus he has Harry anyway so he gets to decide what to do, unless the ministry catches wind of it and forces their way in on the situation, but in that case they might get split up and I wouldn't want that.
