I have read one where Petunia left Vernon to raise both of them because Dudley was magical. They more or less took that viewpoint, as soon as Dudley got his letter Vernon adapted and Petunia just couldn't deal. I don't know why so many people want MORE Weasleys raise Harry stories, sure Dudley is added but I don't see how they could afford two more kids on top of the attention aspect. Both Harry and Dudley have no idea what is normal behavior, the twins are already out of control. Dudley's abusive tendencies would have to get even more out of control to be noticed in that house. The Longbottoms taking them in would be interesting. Neville would have some company. His grandmother seems stern enough to whip Dudley into shape and Harry wouldn't be overlooked or fawned over. Are you dead set on Dumbledore being the one to approve it?
