The way I saw it was, despite Vernon getting his viewpoint on magic from Petunia, he is ultimately the decision maker within their household. Because he sees magic as freakish, and has only met Lily and James and, in my fic, Dumbledore, his ideas about it are pretty set in stone. Petunia would be against it, but Vernon would convince her with the "normal child" proposition.

Basically I want the fic not to pit Dudley and Harry against each other, but have them band together, to the point of them being reliant on each other for support. Whether that's because they were both abused by Vernon and Petunia, or because they have to deal with fame, bigotry and the fact that they're both orphans essentially, is what I'm trying to decide.

As to your point on the next closest non death eater family, who do you think that'd be? So far the top suggestions I've seen are the Weasleys, the Tonkses and the Longbottoms.
