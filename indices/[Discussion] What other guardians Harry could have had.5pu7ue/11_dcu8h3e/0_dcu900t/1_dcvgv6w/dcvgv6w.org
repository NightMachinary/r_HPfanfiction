I think either the Longbottoms or Tonks. The Weasleys aren't closely related at all, and aren't actively looking for orphans to adopt. They took Harry in because he was Ron's friend, with no close family. Parents around the world do this for their children's friends in similar situations - either the kid has distant parents, or a solo parent who works all the time, or is in the foster system.

If Harry weren't friends with Ron, he'd never have ended up as close to the Weasleys. If he'd befriended Draco, it'd be Narcissa sending him christmas presents, etc. Plus, the mothering really took off when Harry didn't respond to any letters, so the boys sneaked off and rescued Harry - if that had never happened, Molly would never have taken Harry in to the family quite the same way, because she wouldn't have known just how unfamily Harry's family was. Hermione, Lee Jordan, Angelina, and even Luna, who had no mother, weren't taken in in the same way.

Anyway, that was a big bunny trail. The truth is there are almost definitely relatives out there that we just don't know about. I'd say Andromeda, because she was Sirius's closest relative that wasn't a Death Eater/married to one, plus she was the eldest. Given that Sirius was an unofficial son to Harry's grandparents, plus his godfather, it would make sense that his relatives would be the next step, since Harry apparently didn't have any.

Of course, I've also read a story where Marge takes in both Dudley and Harry after Vernon and Petunia were arrested for child abuse, and it turns out her friend the Colonel was a squib. Apart from that, if you wanted to get OC, Charlus and Dorea Potter's son /should/ have still been alive. We don't know the exact relation, but can't have been much more distant than anyone else. Plus, he was a first cousin once removed to Sirius.

Otherwise, if Harry had to go to someone else, I could see Dumbledore looking into Sirius legal things, and discovering the lack of a trial.
