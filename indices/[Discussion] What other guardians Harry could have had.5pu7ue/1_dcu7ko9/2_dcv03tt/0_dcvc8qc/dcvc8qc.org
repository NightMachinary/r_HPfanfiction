I think the Evans' wouldn't take them in because they don't want the Petunia v Lily feud breaking out again (even though Dudley has magic in this scenario, Dudley is "Harry's cousin" and would always be in Harry's shadow everywhere.)

I didn't consider the possibility of Harry's cousin taking him in, but do we know anything about him?

Also, the thought of Marge raising a magical Dudley would be hilarious.
