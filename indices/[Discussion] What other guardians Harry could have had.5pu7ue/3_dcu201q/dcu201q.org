It would depend on how much Dumbledore wanted Harry raised away from magic. If he was committed Ms Figg would be an obvious choice. I can imagine a interesting childhood if Dumbledore entrusted Harry to another squib, Filch. Magical families would depend more on if he wanted one of his people or James and Lily's friends.
