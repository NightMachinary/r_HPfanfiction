I talked to my brother about it, and we both agreed that Dumbledore wanting Harry raised away from fame is kinda dumb, because he gets it thrust upon him at the tender age of *eleven* anyway, and with no knowledge of it at all. If Harry had been raised by wizards, he would have grown up learning how to handle his fame, the good and the bad, as well as knowing so much more about his own parents.
