I think with the sort of screwed up family situation Dumbledore himself had his views on family and childhood are slightly off. As dumb as it might be with regards to Harry's future those first eleven years should have been easier for Harry with his ignorance and probably safer too. After eleven Dumbledore himself would be able to look after Harry so it wouldn't matter to him. Dumbledore wants freedom for Harry, if someone can't make choices they can't define themselves. Dumbledore doesn't want Harry coached, he wants Harry to make his own choices.
