A case could be made for almost anyone.

Minerva McGonagall - I had this small tidbit of a fic where she and Poppy Pomfrey raise Harry.

Albus himself - because to do it right, you do it yourself

Amelia Bones - because "friends with the Potters, yadda yadda"

and so on and so forth. The only ones that wouldn't make much sense are Death Eater families.
