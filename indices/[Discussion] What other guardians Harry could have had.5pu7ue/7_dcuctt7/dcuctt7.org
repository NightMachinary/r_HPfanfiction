Another option:

Harry and Dudley stay with the Dursleys for a bit (who would tell them Dudley is magical? would he have already done accidental magic at age one? are the Dursleys really given the option to reject Harry and/or Dudley since Dumbledore just left Harry on the doorstep with a letter?). This gives them reason to band togther. After a while it gets too much so they run away together. Then you have the option of someone like Aunt Marge or Piers Polkiss's family for them to stay with.
