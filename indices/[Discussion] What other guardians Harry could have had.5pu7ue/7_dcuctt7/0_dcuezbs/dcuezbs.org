I read up on the way a student gets accepted into Hogwarts, and it basically says there is a magic book which names get written into when they prove their magical ability. My idea is that Dudley's name is in the book before Harry gets dropped off, so Dumbledore decides to talk to the Dursley's in person about taking Harry in, and the fact that their son is magical.
