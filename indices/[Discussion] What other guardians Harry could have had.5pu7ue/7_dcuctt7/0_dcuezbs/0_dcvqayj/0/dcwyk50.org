One of the benefits of writing the story means that I can decide how his accidental magic displays itself.

I actually remembered after reading your comment how I'd intended to write Dudley's magic into the story almost a year ago, which I stupidly didn't write down, and that was that on the day McGonagall was observing the Dursleys, Petunia is feeding Dudley when the phone rings, and she puts his food down out of reach of him. McGonagall sees Dudley levitate the food towards him and bam! Dudley is magic.

Obviously McGonagall tells Dumbledore and they check the book of admittance and his name is there, so Dumbledore decides that due to these new circumstances, he should talk to the Dursley's in person.
