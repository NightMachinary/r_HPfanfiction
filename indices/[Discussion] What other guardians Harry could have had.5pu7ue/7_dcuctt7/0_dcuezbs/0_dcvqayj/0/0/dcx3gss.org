That would work, with the caveat that they needn't really check in the book if she witnesses him doing magic /because neither of his parents are magical/ and the thing with the quill of admittance and book of acceptance is that the latter requires a sufficiently dramatic display of magic precisely because of the possibility that it might not be the child that is magical but rather that the parents' leftover magic is still there. As you can see, with neither of Dudley's parents being magical there really isn't a need to check for that possibility so as far as I see it she could just go directly to Albus with it because it's clearly his magic despite the fact that he probably wouldn't be in the book for some time yet.

It makes the situation a bit simpler for you, I would guess, as for one ambiguity is nice and friendly and for two it means that if you needed to temper Dudley down for whatever reason you'd have the chance for it (it is precisely lack of Neville's name in the book at age shortly before 11 that made his family do what they've done) and if you don't then that's fine too.
