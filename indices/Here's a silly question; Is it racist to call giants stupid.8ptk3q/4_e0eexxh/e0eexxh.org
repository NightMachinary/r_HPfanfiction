We only see one and a half giants in canon, so no way to know. Is Hagrid inheriting his cognitive capacity from his human side? Is Grawp developmentally disabled?

Peddling bullshit on the basis of biological determinism is a sufficiently developed art that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mismeasure_of_Man][there's a book about it]], and 'inherently stupid' and 'inherently violent' are labels that have been applied to otherwise entirely unremarkable groups of humans (including ancestors of mine from both sides of my family).

So, on the basis of what is seen in canon, I'm going to go with: Insufficient data.

It might be that 'giants are stupid and violent' is as uncontroversial a statement as 'the average subsaharan african has a lower albedo than my pasty part-irish part-scandinavian self'. Given the historical record wrt labelling sentient beings as stupid or violent, I would be highly surprised to find that it is, however.
