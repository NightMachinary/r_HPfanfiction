I'm not trolling, I was just thinking about House Elf rights and SPEW and it got me thinking about how wizards interact with magical creatures.

I mean, Sphinxes are as intelligent and self-aware as humans, so I think they should have equal rights and opportunities as wizards. There could be a sphinx Minister for Magic, or Sphinx professor at Hogwarts, or even a Sphinx janitor.

But what about a giant janitor? I dunno. Should centaurs be subject to the same laws as humans? I dunno. It's interesting to think about.

In regards to the rest of your post, can we honestly say that giants are genuinely more stupid than humans? Magical Britain is obviously filled with bigotry and corruption, so we can't take anything any of the characters say at face value. If you were raised on an isolated mountainside by uneducated cave people, then you would probably be as stupid and feral as Grawp. Giants are like the uncontacted tribes in the amazon; of course they're going to seem uncivilized.

I'm not saying giants /aren't/ naturally stupid, but I think this sort of thing would be interesting to explore in fanfiction, which is why I made this thread.
