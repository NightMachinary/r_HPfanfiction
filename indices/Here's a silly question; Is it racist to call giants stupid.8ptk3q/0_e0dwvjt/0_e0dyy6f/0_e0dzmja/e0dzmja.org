I think there's a lot more to answering the question "should human society recognise a species as having equal rights to humans?" than intelligence or self-awareness.

Your example of the sphinx is actually a very good one. Yes, they are intelligent. But they also will maul to death any person who incorrectly answers their riddles. This means that sphinxes, by their nature, are simply incapable of participating in human society as responsible citizens. It would be mind-bogglingly foolish to grant them rights as if they were humans.

I think people see the example of House Elves deserving equal status and they make an unjustified generalisation. You can't just whitewash the differences in species away. House Elves are not just intelligent, they are also highly compatible with human society: they are of the correct temperament to respect laws, they recognise human social constructs like property, they are willing to perform work, and they don't possess either biological violent tendencies or aggregated social ill-will towards wizards.

But there are obvious examples of species where this compatibility does not hold, whether for biological or social reasons. Sphinxes are one, for the reasons above. Another example, if they are indeed violent by nature, is giants. A third possible contender is vampires, who potentially need to hunt humans in order to survive. A fourth example is goblins, who are antagonistic towards wizards to the point that they renege on any agreement and seek to trick wizards into an early grave. They have fought numerous wars against wizards and have fundamentally different views on basic tenets of the social contract like private property. Goblins are not like house elves. They are not the victim of wizards. They are the wizards' *enemies* who just so happen to have lost the fight for supremacy.

Only a suicidal society gives full rights to their enemies. Sure, give them some rights such as basic protections from cruelty and exploitation, but that's a far cry from permitting full participation in civil society. You don't give the keys of the kingdom to people who are diametrically opposed to your way of life, especially in a democracy.

Really, House Elves, Centaurs, Merpeople and werewolves are the only non-human intelligent species who I think are deserving of recognition as having equal rights to wizards. Of these, centaurs and merpeople have already rejected this status because they disliked the wording ("creatures of near human intelligence") and the implication that they needed to be granted rights by humans. Werewolves, by the end of the series, are likely well on their way to legal recognition. So House Elves are kinda the unique case of a species in need of a dramatic change in legal status.
