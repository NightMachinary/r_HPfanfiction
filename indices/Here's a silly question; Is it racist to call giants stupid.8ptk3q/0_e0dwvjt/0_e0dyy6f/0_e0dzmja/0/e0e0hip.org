Great post.

  It would be mind-bogglingly foolish to grant them (sphinxes) rights as if they were humans.

Really? So what happens when a there's an oddball sphinx that doesn't care about riddles? Or instead of maiming those that don't answer her riddles, she just tickles them or something? Can we really justify denying her individual liberties and rights, simply because of the behavior of /other/ sphinxes? Is that ethical?

I mean, you say that House Elves need a dramatic change in their legal status, yet the overwhelming majority of House Elves are content with the way things are; Dobby is just a weirdo that doesn't fit the mold of his species. And like Ron said, there are weirdo's in every species.
