  Really? So what happens when a there's an oddball sphinx that doesn't care about riddles? Or instead of maiming those that don't answer her riddles, she just tickles them or something? Can we really justify not denying her individual liberties and rights, simply because of the behavior of other sphinxes?

The possibility of there being an "oddball sphinx" is exactly what I'm disputing. Posing riddles and mauling people who get them wrong is an innate part of the nature of a sphinx. Being intelligent and sapient does not mean that you have the ability to act contrary to your nature. Sphinxes are closer to being an animal that just so happens to be able to speak than a person who just so happens to have the body of an animal. They are, so far as we can tell, creatures of animalistic instinct, despite their intelligence.

Fantastic Beasts notes this explicitly. It states that sphinxes were considered for "creature" status on the basis of their intelligence, but in the end their violent nature resulted in them being classified as beasts, a rung on the ladder /below/ House Elves and goblins.

  I mean, you say that House Elves need a dramatic change in their legal status, yet the overwhelming majority of House Elves are content with the way things are; Dobby is just a weirdo that doesn't fit the mold of his species. And like Ron said, there are weirdo's in every species.

Well, no one can compel a House Elf to take up freedom, but that doesn't remove the moral obligation on wizards to at least offer it, and in the mean time guarantee certain standards of treatment.

It's a common misconception that House Elves are held in slavery by some kind of magic, or magically compelled to obey their masters. This is not the case. In GoF, Winky directly disobeys Crouch Sr: he told her to remain in the tent, but she left it and went out into the woods in direct defiance of his explicit orders. Similarly, Dobby was perfectly able to betray the Malfoys -- no magic stopped him from doing so -- but he felt compelled to punish himself afterwards.

This is why initially Hermione attempted to simply persuade the House Elves to embrace freedom. It was only after she gave up on that as hopeless that she redirected her efforts towards convincing wizards.

As a related matter, people often wonder why House Elves can do laundry if clothes free them, but the obvious answer, given the above, is that clothes only free a House Elf because this is recognised as such in House Elf society. From what we see of Winky, in theory a House Elf could just decide to wander off one day and abandon their master. But the social construct of service is so strong that even defiant House Elves like Dobby feel compelled to serve until they are provided with a flimsy excuse to leave like being unintentionally passed a sock.
