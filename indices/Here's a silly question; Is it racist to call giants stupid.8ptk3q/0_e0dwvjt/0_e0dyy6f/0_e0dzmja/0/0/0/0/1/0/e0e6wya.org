This is kinda veering into a general philosophy of mind debate, divorced from Harry Potter. On that topic neither of us can say anything new and I am not keen to summarise arguments which are far better explained in the literature. Suffice it to say that:

1. I disagree that the limits of understanding are simply a matter of computing power; the hardware matters too. The human brain is not a computer and, until our understanding of the brain improves, it remains unclear as to whether computer-based emulation of the human mind is possible. This can be characterised as either a rejection of functionalism or, alternatively, a modification to it based on the idea that certain functions can only exist on certain hardware.

2. I place a different weighting than you in the nature vs nurture debate, where I consider a person's character and values more determined by their biology than you do.

Returning to Harry Potter, you have to remember this is a dualistic world. Remember, for example, that a Dementor victim has the same intelligence as they had before being kissed. Their brain is working perfectly fine. Nonetheless, despite being of equal intelligence to a regular human, they are incapable of making even basic decisions such as deciding to eat when they are hungry.

Regardless of your opinions about the nature of intelligence in real life, within the Harry Potter world it is established that intelligence is not the be all and end all of determining a being's status. Portraits and the Sorting Hat are examples of things which are intelligent and self-aware but not sentient. They are not capable of personal growth, love, etc. Their intelligence and self-awareness are equal to a human's in appearance (i.e. the pass the Turing test) but they are in fact limited to a specific purpose and nature. Accordingly, it's entirely possible for a sphinx to be intelligent but lack any kind of ability to act contrary to its nature, because in the HP world, intelligence and self-awareness aren't really all that much. It's the ability to speak and think but it's not sufficient to grant you full sentience. That is restricted to beings with a soul.
