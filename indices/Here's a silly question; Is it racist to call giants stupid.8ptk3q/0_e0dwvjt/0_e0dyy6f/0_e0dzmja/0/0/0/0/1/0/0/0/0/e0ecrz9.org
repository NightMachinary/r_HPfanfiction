  And yet they [the Portraits] are not sentient. They have no internal mental life - a "philosophical zombie".

What proof have you of this? I mean, one could spin it that way, but I don't think anything quite so clear-cut is ever stated in canon. I have made it a point in my fics that Portrait-People /are/ considered to be people by Wizards, though this doesn't mean they are listened to very much (any more than they listen to Centaurs or even Ghosts).
