  If you're self-aware and intelligent, then you have the capacity to learn. If you can learn, you can learn to act against your nature. It's human nature to fear death, yet plenty of people end up killing themselves, in complete denial of their inherited Darwinian survival instincts. A less grisly example would be how humans are biological predisposed to certain logical fallacies, but we can learn to recognize those fallacies and correct our thinking.

  I'm not saying we shouldn't take precautions against a species nature, but intelligence introduces a conflict between nature and experience that can't be hand-waved away.

I think these are not the correct analogies. Suicide, while against normal human instincts, is nonetheless within our nature. Anything that humans are capable of choosing to do is, by definition, within our nature. I am talking about the unknown things that are outside our nature - things which we cannot think of, because it is beyond our cognitive ability to grasp, what Chomsky calls the limits of understanding. Intelligence does not gift a being with the ability to grasp all concepts, or to do all things. Your ability to choose is still limited by what your biological nature can conceive of, and of what you are physically capable of doing.

What I am saying is that, from what we can see, a sphinx can no more choose not to attack someone who fails to solve a riddle than a human can imagine a new colour. It is outside of our nature. It's difficult for us to conceive of, because we are the only intelligent beings we know of, and so we naturally assume that all intelligence must be like our intelligence: the ability to comprehend and choose the same things. But there's really no reason to think that human intelligence is universal among all intelligent beings.

I think the real problem here is that, while you are talking about intelligence and the ability to learn, what you are really saying is that sphinxes have free will. That is something entirely separate from the idea of intelligence. In the Harry Potter universe, which is dualist by nature, I think that question comes down to the question of whether sphinxes have souls.

  I'd also like to point out that Fantastic Beasts also says that Acromantulas are also not "beings" because they're incapable of not devouring humans that go near them. However, we know for a fact that an acromantuala that's had contact with humans during its upbringing can learn to act against its nature. Aragog never attacked Hagrid, and he didn't personally attack Harry or Ron --- he simply *couldn't* convince his wild children to spare them.

Not couldn't. Wouldn't. He deliberately used a technicality to evade a promise he had made to Hagrid in order to indulge his desire to feed humans to his people. Not the greatest example for your argument, I think.

  I think it's also worth pointing out that, in Fantastic Beasts, it specifically says that sphinxes are "usually only dangerous when what they're guarding is threatened"; it's not like they're mindless monsters or anything. What if a sphinx was raised to protect a human, instead of protecting a treasure? Suddenly, that sphinxes "dangerous animal instincts" become ethically justified, like how a mother is ethically justified in defending their child from a murderer.

That is not the only thing Fantastic Beasts says about sphnixes. They are also discussed in the section on the history of the classification system. That is where it is stated that sphinxes were classified as creatures because of their innate violence.
