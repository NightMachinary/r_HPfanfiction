  Being intelligent and sapient does not mean that you have the ability to act contrary to your nature.

If you're self-aware and intelligent, then you have the capacity to learn. If you can learn, you can learn to act against your nature. It's human nature to fear death, yet plenty of people end up killing themselves, in complete denial of their inherited Darwinian survival instincts. A less grisly example would be how humans are biological predisposed to certain logical fallacies, but we can learn to recognize those fallacies and correct our thinking.

I'm not saying we shouldn't take precautions against a species nature, but intelligence introduces a conflict between nature and experience that can't be hand-waved away.

I'd also like to point out that /Fantastic Beasts/ also says that Acromantulas are also not "beings," because they're incapable of not devouring humans that go near them. However, we know for a fact that an acromantuala that's had contact with humans during its upbringing can learn to act against its nature; Aragog never attacked Hagrid, and he didn't personally attack Harry or Ron --- he simply couldn't convince his wild children to spare them. We also saw Grawp learn to act against his supposed violent instincts. He even visited Dumbledores funeral in a suit. Plus, I highly doubt that Dumbledore would let Grawp live so close to the school if he believed Grawp was incapable of learning to live peacefully with humans. So, that's two canon examples of /Fantastic Beasts/ being wrong.

I think it's also worth pointing out that, in /Fantastic Beasts/, it specifically says that sphinxes are "usually only dangerous when what they're guarding is threatened" --- it's not like they're mindless monsters or anything. What if a sphinx was raised to protect a human, instead of protecting a treasure? Suddenly, that sphinxes "dangerous animal instincts" become ethically justified, like how a mother is ethically justified in defending their child from a murderer.

So, you can't say that it's impossible for a civilized sphinx to exist. Can we really deny that hypothetical sphinx rights and liberties?

Or how about this, would the unprovoked killing Aragog be murder? Should capturing a sphinx be a case of kidnapping? They're intelligent and conscious beings.
