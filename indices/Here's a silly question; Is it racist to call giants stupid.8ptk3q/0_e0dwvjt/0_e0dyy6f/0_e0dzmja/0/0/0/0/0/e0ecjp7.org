  That is not the only thing Fantastic Beasts says about sphnixes. They are also discussed in the section on the history of the classification system. That is where it is stated that sphinxes were classified as creatures because of their innate violence.

But then you trust the biased wizards' view of the nonhumans there? Isn't it overwhelmingly more likely that Sphinx /culture/ places a great importance on riddles and the ritual need to murder anyone who answers them? With assuming that it is their /innate nature/ to pose riddle and maul anyone who answers them wrong being equivalent to aliens observing humans and concluding that they have a biological compulsion to start singing anthems whenever they see a particular arrangement of colors on a piece of cloth.
