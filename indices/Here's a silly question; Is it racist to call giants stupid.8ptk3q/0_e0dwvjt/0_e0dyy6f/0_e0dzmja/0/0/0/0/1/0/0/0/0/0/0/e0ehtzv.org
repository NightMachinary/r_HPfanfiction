Er, it does say they're "two-dimensional" in a way, but not that they can't hold any conversations; that would be utterly ridiculous, since Portraits practically do nothing /but/ hold conversations. And they /are/ capable of independant creativity, even (Dumbledore's Portrait schemed some things based on new information DD didn't have at the time of his death).

The way I'm looking at it, Portraits /are/ sentient, but akin to living caricatures --- think Toons from /Roger Rabbit/. It's not that they don't have thought and feelings, but the baseline personality they start out with is a crude, broadstrokes version of the original model. They're actors unwittingly putting on a two-dimensional /performance/.
