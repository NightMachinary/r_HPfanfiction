I was under the impression that portraits weren't intelligent at all. They're, like, sophisticated chatbots --- the creator inputs a behavior and sets the painting to output that behavior in response to specific new inputs.

Like how past Headmasters tell their portraits things, and "set" those portraits to only reveal that information in response to specific circumstances. And all the portraits have been set to output "pretending_to_sleep.exe" as their default behavior. So, even a portrait of an intelligent person like Dumbledore will output "pretending_to_sleep.exe" in circumstance where that output is highly inappropriate, like when Harry is about to get himself killed in the last book, simply because that portrait has no intelligence of its own to modify its outputs in a way that isn't specifically accounted for in its design. I hope you can see what I'm saying, though this is all a bit of a divergence.

As for the duality stuff, I don't think it's entirely relevant. My argument was a matter of nature vs nurture, and it doesn't matter if that nature is inherited through genetics or through the nature of the inherited soul. In my previous post, you can supplement every reference to genetics with "soul-etics" and my point still stands.

  That is restricted to beings with a soul.

So, if giants have souls then they deserve equally rights and liberties under the eyes of the law? I'm speaking from a purely ethically perspective here, never mind the logistics of actually incorporating giants into society.

You also didn't specifically argue against my cursed sphinx scenario. You really think that the baby sphinx would grow up to be indistinguishable in it's behavior to a sphinx that wasn't cursed?
