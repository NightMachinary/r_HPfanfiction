The limits of understanding is directly proportionate to our intelligence of cognitive abilities. The reason there are things we can't think of is because we're too stupid to understand them --- the ideas are too vast or complex for the hardware of our minds to processes. That isn't a matter of instinct or nature; it's a matter of computing power.

However, we do have some degree of intelligence, and that intelligence allows us to act against our instincts.

An ant, however, has very limited intelligence, and as such is incapable of acting against outside it's inherited programming. If you cloned an ant, and then "raised" that ant in a unique environment, it would still respond to external stimuli in a way that is largely indistinguishable to the original ant that shares its genetic material.

However, if you took two identical human twin babies and raised them in radically different cultures you would end up with people who have different ideals and make different choices, despite their shared genetic code. This isn't because we humans lack instinct, nor does it mean that our instinct is less developed than that of ant.

What separates humans from ants is our ability to learn --- to observe the world and make logical conclusions based on our observations. Our intelligence allows us to act outside of our inherited programming. Our brains software is constantly being patched by our experiences, while the mechanism behind an ants decision making process is not significantly updated throughout its life.

If a magical species is intelligent, then it can learn, and grow, and update its decision making process based on its experiences. As long as it can learn, then its upbringing will in some way dictate its future actions. The ability to learn is directly tied to intelligence, and so intelligence is directed tied to a creatures capacity to act outside of what its instincts are compelling it to do.

Let's say a wizard placed a curse on a baby sphinx. This curse will make the sphinx feel excruciating pain every time it asks a riddle. The sphinx is sufficiently intelligent to recognize the causation relationship between asking riddles and experiencing excruciating pain. It'll associate riddles with unbearable suffering. It will learn not to ask riddles. This poor sphinx's inherited instincts will be updated by its experiences, and it'll grow and mature into a sphinx that acts outside its supposed nature.

This is all directly due to its ability to observe the world and draw logical conclusions based on its observations, which /is/ intelligence. So, it's not unreasonable to say that a creature's capacity to act outside of its inherited nature is in many ways directly proportional to its intelligence.

So, if a magical creature is as intelligent as a human then we should judge them as individuals, and /not/ based on their inherited nature, since that nature is subject to being overwritten by their experiences.

  I think the real problem here is that, while you are talking about intelligence and the ability to learn, what you are really saying is that sphinxes have free will. That is something entirely separate from the idea of intelligence.

I actually don't believe in free will /at all/, including within humans, so no, that's not what I'm talking about.
