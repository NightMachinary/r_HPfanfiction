Re: portraits, it is not that they are enchanted with specific behaviours like a programme. Rather they are enchanted to come alive, and once alive, if the subject is a sufficiently powerful wizard, then they learn by observation:

#+begin_quote
  Some magical portraits are capable of considerably more interaction with the living world. Traditionally, a headmaster or headmistress is painted before their death. Once the portrait is completed, the headmaster or headmistress in question keeps it under lock and key, regularly visiting it in its cupboard (if so desired) to teach it to act and behave exactly like themselves, and imparting all kinds of useful memories and pieces of knowledge that may then be shared through the centuries with their successors in office.
#+end_quote

Note that the portrait isn't being programmed to follow any kind of algorithm. It's learning by observation as a child might.

Further, such portraits are capable of interaction with humans in conversation on an equal basis, without any limited domain or script. They certainly seem to meet all the normal criteria for possessing intelligence - a "general AI", as it were. And yet they are not sentient. They have no internal mental life - a "philosophical zombie".

  As for the duality stuff, I don't think it's entirely relevant. My argument was a matter of nature vs nurture, and it doesn't matter if that nature is inherited through genetics or through the nature of the inherited soul. In my previous post, you can supplement every reference to genetics with "soul-etics" and my point still stands.
#+end_quote

I think it's highly relevant. Your argument was that intelligence is sufficient for a being to act contrary to its nature by learning. But in the HP world, this is not a characteristic of intelligence. It is entirely possible for something to be fully intelligent and yet fixed in a certain state. The ability to change or to act contrary to your own nature is a characteristic of free will, which derives from the possession of a soul. A soulless animal which possessed full intelligence, equal to that of a human, would not have the ability to learn to act contrary to its nature.

For example, Voldemort damaging his soul damaged his ability to repent of his previous actions. He was intelligent but his character was static. However, taking Harry's blood into himself, and along with it the goodness of Lily's protective magic, gifted Voldemort with the ability to choose to act against his own nature once more. JKR explained as much on her old website:

#+begin_quote
  Having taken Harry's blood into himself, Voldemort is keeping alive Lily's protective power over Harry. So Voldemort himself acts almost like a Horcrux for Harry -- except that the power of Lily's sacrifice is a positive force that not only continues to tether Harry to life, but gives Voldemort himself one last chance (Dumbledore refers to this last hope in chapter 35). Voldemort has unwittingly put a few drops of goodness back inside himself; if he had repented, he could have been healed more deeply than anyone would have supposed. But, of course, he refused to feel remorse.
#+end_quote

It is clear that your magical nature determines the courses of action you can choose. Voldemort's magical nature was evil, but he altered this by putting goodness in magical form into himself. By doing so, Voldemort inadvertently granted himself options that were not open to him before - he magically granted himself the capacity for goodness, which before he lacked. His intelligence was the same throughout.

Returning to your points:

#+begin_quote
  So, if giants have souls then they deserve equally rights and liberties under the eyes of the law? I'm speaking from a purely ethically perspective here, never mind the logistics of actually incorporating giants into society.
#+end_quote

If giants have souls then they are capable of exercising free will and therefore overcoming their nature.

Giving them rights, however, seems to be a political rather than ethical decision. The capacity of giants to change may well be a factor in that decision, but it would not be the only one... I imagine the fact that they have a nature to overcome in the first place may be a problem, because just because giants can overcome their nature, it doesn't necessarily mean that they will. Another factor may well be a giant's ability to cause unintentional harm through its strength and low intelligence. Like a child with a rifle.

  You also didn't specifically argue against my cursed sphinx scenario. You really think that the baby sphinx would grow up to be indistinguishable in it's behavior to a sphinx that wasn't cursed?
#+end_quote

Obviously the sphinx is intelligent enough to know that it is going to experience pain upon asking a riddle, so it will be a very miserable sphinx. Nonetheless, if the sphinx is guarding something, I think it will find itself compelled to ask a riddle to any person seeking access to the thing, and in turn attack anyone who got it wrong. That's just part of the magic of a sphinx. It's "hardwired" into the sphinx's behaviour, like an involuntary reflex.
