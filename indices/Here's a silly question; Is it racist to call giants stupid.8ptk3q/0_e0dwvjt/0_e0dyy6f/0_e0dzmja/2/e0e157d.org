  A fourth example is goblins, who are antagonistic towards wizards to the point that they renege on any agreement and seek to trick wizards into an early grave. They have fought numerous wars against wizards and have fundamentally different views on basic tenets of the social contract like private property

I think you were doing fine up until the goblin example. It doesn't appear to be the case that they will renege on /any/ deal, that seems to be strictly for goblin-forged artifacts (e.g. Gryffindor's sword). We have no examples of them, say spontaneously deciding to empty someone's bank vault. And since we know all currency is cast and minted by goblins, if what you were saying is true we should know of at least one instance of this occuring, but we don't. They clearly hold to their agreement with customers using their banking services. The closest I can think of is them mobbing Bagman, but we know that was because he tried to screw them over a wager he lost on the World Cup and Triwizard.

That seems to be their only real difference in view on private ownership, not a deep difference of philosophy regarding the social contract. In fact, even the rebellions are quite squarely about lacking wand ownership, not some other issue. They don't appear to be intersted in violating laws or entirely subverting broader society on the grounds of incompatible views.
