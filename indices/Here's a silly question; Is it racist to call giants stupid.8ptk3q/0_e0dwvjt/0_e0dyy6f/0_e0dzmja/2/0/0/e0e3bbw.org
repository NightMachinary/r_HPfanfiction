  So what happens if you give goblins the right to vote and allow goblins in government? You will get goblins voting in favour of laws which reflect their view on property, and administrators making decisions based on their view of what is right. This would be a massive problem and a huge own-goal for wizards.

  So what happens if you give Indians the right to vote and allow Indians in government? You will get Indians voting in favour of laws which reflect their view on property, and administrators making decisions based on their view of what is right. This would be a massive problem and a huge own-goal for British settlers.
