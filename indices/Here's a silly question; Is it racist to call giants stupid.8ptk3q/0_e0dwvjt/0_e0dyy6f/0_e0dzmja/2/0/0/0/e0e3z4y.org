  You could make this same argument for denying voting rights for demographics of humanity. For example, some native Americans didn't think anybody could own land.

Oh, absolutely. It's the primary reason that nations deny voting rights to people of other nationalities and those outside their borders. I believe this is fully justified.

The moral problem with Native Americans is invading and annexing their territory in the first place. Denying them voting rights is immoral because of the earlier immoral act, not because there exists a general principle that everyone has the right to civil participation in all societies around the globe.
