  If that were their view on property in general then one would think people like Bill,who mention it with respect to goblin artifacts, would mention it. But no one who would know this suggests that their very currency could taken by goblins whenever they feel like it.

You are misremembering Bill's comments.

  "Then I have to say this," Bill went on. "If you have struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, and most particularly if that bargain involves treasure, you must be exceptionally careful. Goblin notions of ownership, payment, and repayment are not the same as human ones."

  Harry felt a slight squirm of discomfort, as though a small snake had stirred inside him. "What do you mean?" he asked.

  "We are talking about a different breed of being," said Bill. "Dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for centuries -- but you'll know all that from History of Magic. There has been fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have been innocent. However, there is a belief among some goblins, and those at Gringotts are perhaps most prone to it, that wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure, that they have no respect for goblin ownership."

  "I respect --" Harry began, but Bill shook his head.

  "You don't understand, Harry, nobody could understand unless they have lived with goblins. To a goblin, the rightful and true master of any object is the maker, not the purchaser. All goblin made objects are, in goblin eyes, rightfully theirs."
#+end_quote

Bill is quite clear that the Goblin concept of ownership extends to all property: "the rightful and true master of *any object* is the maker". Goblin-made items are singled out only in so far as those are the ones goblins get upset about, because those are the ones they consider themselves the rightful owners of.

  Is there even a voting system in wizarding UK? The Minister seems to be voted in, but by whom I don't know (maybe the Wizengamot).
#+end_quote

Yes, the Minister for Magic is elected by popular vote every 7 years.
