But Bill, in this quote, is /also/ quite clear that it's a cultural thing: emphasis mine:

#+begin_quote
  "there is a belief */among some goblins/*, and those at Gringotts are perhaps most prone to it,"
#+end_quote

I believe Rowling has said elsewhere that this is an "extremist" view among Goblins. Now I'll grant you (in comparison to what I wrote in my other message) that the issue is less clear-cut for Sphinxes, but in Goblins' case, how could you look at these quotes and assume their peculiar views on property are an inherent biological trait, as opposed to a feature of their culture, which developped independantly from Western Human culture, and thus /would/ quite naturally have its own, very alien customs?
