If that were their view on property in general then one would think people like Bill,who mention it with respect to goblin artifacts, would mention it. But no one who would know this suggests that their very currency could taken by goblins whenever they feel like it.

Is there even a voting system in wizarding UK? The Minister seems to be voted in, but by whom I don't know (maybe the Wizengamot). But even then, that's only going to apply to what they make. In which case, people will simply stop buying goblin made objects (besides which, those don't seem plentiful outside old, wealthy pure-blood families like the Blacks).

That Gryffindor apparently trusted them suggests that it was not common for goblins to renege on deals (unless we're going to say Gryffindor was out of his mind). In fact, from what we are told it's the excellent job he did which caused the goblin to try and keep it, not because he didn't plan on honoring the deal. We have more than a sample of one. I repeat, are we given the suggestion that using Gringotts is risky business because goblins might jack the contents at any time? Never hinted at, Hagrid even says it's he second safest place to put your valuables.

Griphook makes it clear wand ownership was a major factor in their rebellions. Giving evidence of their viciousness (which they are, to be fair) by pointing out how rebellions were described is silly; rebellions by nature are bloody and vicious. Harry skipped the question on his OWL that asked if wand legislation was a major factor in 18th century goblin rebellions. The 1612 rebellion was about lack of Wizengamot representation. But the Chipping Clodbury rebellion (a modern one) was explicitly about wand ownership.
