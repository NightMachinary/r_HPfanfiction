The Goblins' view on property is that whoever makes it, owns it, and it is not possible to transfer property. It just so happens that practically, on the current social arrangement, this only comes up as an issue where wizards come into possession of goblin-made objects, but it is not limited to those items. It is a view about the nature of property in general.

So what happens if you give goblins the right to vote and allow goblins in government? You will get goblins voting in favour of laws which reflect their view on property, and administrators making decisions based on their view of what is right. This would be a massive problem and a huge own-goal for wizards.

With regards to reneging on deals, we only really have a sample size of one, so it's hard to say for sure. All I will say is that the only time we saw a character make a deal with a goblin, the goblin betrayed that deal, and did so in a deliberately vicious manner which was intended to result in the death of the counterparty. This is not the only example we have of goblins having excessively violent tendencies: the punishment for trying to break into a vault is death by dehydration, a massively disproportionate response to theft, and one that goblins seem to take delight in. Moreover, the overwhelming impression we are given of the history of the wars with the goblins (which we are not told are all about wand rights) is that they were a particularly vicious foe.
