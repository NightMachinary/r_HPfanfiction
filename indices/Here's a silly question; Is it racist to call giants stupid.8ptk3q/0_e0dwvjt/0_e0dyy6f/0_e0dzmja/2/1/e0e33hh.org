  I think you were doing fine up until the goblin example. It doesn't appear to be the case that they will renege on any deal, that seems to be strictly for goblin-forged artifacts (e.g. Gryffindor's sword). We have no examples of them, say spontaneously deciding to empty someone's bank vault. And since we know all currency is cast and minted by goblins, if what you were saying is true we should know of at least one instance of this occuring, but we don't. They clearly hold to their agreement with customers using their banking services. The closest I can think of is them mobbing Bagman, but we know that was because he tried to screw them over a wager he lost on the World Cup and Triwizard.

Great point. I'd also like to point out that if Goblins were unreliable, or prone to breaking deals, then there's no way Voldermort would entrust them with something as important as his soul. He wouldn't have kept the Cup in Gringotts if there had been even a single case of Goblins stealing wizards treasure from vaults.
