Indeed. Griphook certainly doesn't. From DH:

  "We can give you something else," said Ron eagerly. "I'll bet the Lestranges have got loads of stuff, you can take your pick once we get into the vault."

  He had said the wrong thing. Griphook flushed angrily.

  "I am not a thief, boy! I am not trying to procure treasures to which I have no right!"

I would like to point out, for all the bellyaching about Griphook betraying Harry, it was Harry who had made the deal in bad faith and didn't intend to give Griphook the sword. Griphook saw through it and after keeping his end of the bargain, made Harry pay.

It is a bit sad, really. Griphook had spent most of his life resenting wizards, and despite that he had started to respect Harry.

  Goblins and elves are not used to the protection or the respect that you have shown this night. Not from wand-carriers.

But then they make a deal, and Harry plans to screw Griphook over, thus validating (in Griphook's eyes) all of his initial views on wizards.
