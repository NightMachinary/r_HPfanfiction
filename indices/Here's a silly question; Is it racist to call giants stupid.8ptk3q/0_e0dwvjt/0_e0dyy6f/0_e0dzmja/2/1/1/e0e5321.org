As a point of order, it was Bellatrix who entrusted the goblins with the horcrux, not Voldemort.

In any case, goblins are known to be unreliable in specific ways. Bill mentions "ownership, payment, and repayment". Hufflepuff's cup was made by Helga Hufflepuff, not goblins, so goblins would not consider themselves its rightful owner. There's no payment or repayment involved, so no problem there. And providing vaults is a /service/, not a good, so no problem there so long as comply with goblin payment rules.

So there was no real risk of goblins suddenly seizing Hufflepuff's cup. This does not mean, however, that goblin ideas about ownership, payment or repayment are compatible with British wizarding society.
