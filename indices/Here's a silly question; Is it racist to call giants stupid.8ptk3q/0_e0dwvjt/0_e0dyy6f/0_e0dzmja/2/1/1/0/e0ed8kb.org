  As a point of order, it was Bellatrix who entrusted the goblins with the horcrux, not Voldemort.

True, but wouldn't Voldemort have /asked/ Bellatrix where she had concealed the "very special object" he had given to her? Indeed, can we truly be sure he didn't just give it to her with strict instructions to put it in Gringotts (with the reasoning that /she/ disposed of a first-class Gringotts vault when /he/ did not)?
