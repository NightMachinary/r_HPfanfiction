  Your example of the sphinx is actually a very good one. Yes, they are intelligent. But they also will maul to death any person who incorrectly answers their riddles. This means that sphinxes, by their nature, are simply incapable of participating in human society as responsible citizens. It would be mind-bogglingly foolish to grant them rights as if they were humans.

Is it their nature or is it the customs of Sphinx culture? If we look around a bit we can easily find group of muggle humans the same has been said about?
