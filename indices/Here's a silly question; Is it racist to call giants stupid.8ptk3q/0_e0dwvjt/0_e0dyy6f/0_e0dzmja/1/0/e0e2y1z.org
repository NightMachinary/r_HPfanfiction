  But there are obvious examples of species where this compatibility does not hold, whether for biological or social reasons. Sphinxes are one, for the reasons above. Another example, if they are indeed violent by nature, is giants. A third possible contender is vampires, who potentially need to hunt humans in order to survive. A fourth example is goblins, who are antagonistic towards wizards to the point that they renege on any agreement and seek to trick wizards into an early grave

It's common in the fandom for people to take the fact that JKR was making an allegory with Muggleborns and assume she is doing the same with all species. I think this instinct is largely incorrect, a kind of kneejerk progressiveness which may, on a case by case basis, lack justification.

Sometimes an animal is just an animal, with no special message intended. Especially when the animal is taken from common mythology. From Fantastic Beasts (the book), it appears that JKR didn't intend for sphinxes to be anything other than a magical creature which just so happens to be intelligent.

There is no real life analogy for coexistence with a different intelligent species and I think people too easily reach for the low-hanging Godwin's law fruit. The whole point of the Muggleborn analogy is, like real life racism, there is nothing there to justify it. Pure-bloods aren't more powerful, smarter, etc than Muggleborns. But where there is a genuine difference in species, then suddenly the analogy with any real life comparison goes away. Each instance has to be considered on its own merits, there's no quick and easy "but racism!" answer.

For example, with goblins, the fact that they share many characteristics with the historical stereotype of "the Jew" cannot be a coincidence. However, I hesitate to say that JKR is intending to draw an analogy between the treatment of goblins and the treatment of Jews. The reason for this is that, unlike the Jews, the goblins have historically given as good as they got, and on top of that they do seem to be genuinely malicious and vicious in nature. I suspect that JKR's intention with goblins was to make goblins the historical origin for the myths about Jews, where ignorant Muggles associated the one with the other.
