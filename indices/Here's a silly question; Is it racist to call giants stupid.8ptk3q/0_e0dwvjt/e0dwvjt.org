I suspect you are trolling, but no, it's speciesism, racism being prejudice or discrimination on the basis of race. So far as we know, "giant" isn't a race of humanity but rather a different species. If you want to fit them into Muggle systems, giants may still be of the homo genus, like Neanderthals, but they are not homo sapiens.

To address your follow-up points, even though I answered the first question in the negative, a position being racist is of course is a separate issue from a position being justified or moral. Historically, most racist positions have been lacking in any rational or scientific justification and have also been morally heinous. However an example of commonly accepted "justified, moral racism" is in medicine, where certain medications are known to have different levels of efficacy on different races.

If giants are genuinely more stupid than humans (and all signs would indicate that they are), then it would be both speciesist but also correct to say "giants are stupid". Whether it's moral or justified to segregate them on this fact is doubtful. We don't segregate stupid humans. However, the accusation that giants are innately violent and dangerous, if true, would be much more powerful in justifying their segregation.

As for Hagrid, he's half-giant. We don't know what traits he shares with actual giants. He certainly seems more intelligent than the "pure-blood" giants we are told about, and he's definitely not violent in character.
