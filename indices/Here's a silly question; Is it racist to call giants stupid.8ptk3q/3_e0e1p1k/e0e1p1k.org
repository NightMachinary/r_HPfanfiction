Let's assume that it is reasonable to judge Hagrid based on his giant's blood. What if he then proves to be a very intelligent and very capable wizard despite his blood? Would you still judge him by his blood or change your perception based on his actions? As someone mentioned, Madame Maxime achieved this very thing.

Quite simply put, to judge someone based on their blood instead of their deeds is stupid, regardless of how true any stereotype of their ancestors is.
