First, I would like to point out that Giants are not a different "race" as we mean it, they are more like a different species.

Secondly, "race" and "racism" are largely social constructs defined by when and where you live. As an example, in the USA, up until the 1930s-1940s, the term "white" did not include anybody of Irish, Polish and Italian descent. Now it does. And NO, I am not supporting racism or the like, I am simply stating these things are defined by individual cultures and the times, and are thus abstract in what they mean.

Here is an example: blood-prejudice is functionally racism. There is no difference beyond cultural differences and history (which seems to be the origin of most racial tensions anyway). Conversely, giants and wizards are different species, with clearly distinct biological and magical differences.

If someone wiped out muggleborns in the magical world, it would be referred to as "genocide." If someone wiped out all the giants, it would be called "xenocide."

No its not racist to call them stupid. Its just pointless and cavalier. They can still kill you after all.
