Okay, some of your question gets into the idea of whether magic has an effect on speciation and evolutionary biology. This is a rabbit hole that I am not smart enough, prepared enough, nor *want* to dive into headlong. But I will answer a certain aspect of your question.

First, you need a sizeable population for a new species to occur. That negates both the growth potion and the polyjuice from producing similar results of diverging species. Even then, there is no reason not to believe that wizards could not change someone 20 feet tall back into human, or any other magical catastrophe. There really is no proof that goblins or giants or elves are anything like humans beyond the superficial.

Secondly, you have to realize that cross-species breeding does actually occur, often in zoos. If you want some laughs, google search liger and wolphin. The point is the byproducts are almost always sterile and unable to breed. BUT, in one in a million cases or so, they can breed with another species and also have a progeny.

There are two likely possibilities for magical species. At some point a population of species were isolated from the rest, and over time diverged enough to become the way they are. Giants could have resulted from being humans trapped in mountains, similar to something like homo floresiensis. Alternatively, these species could be the deliberate byproduct of a magical species creating them. Hagrid demonstrates that you can cross-breed a chimaera and a fire crab (gross) in GoF. Try looking up the Firebird Trilogy for similar examples to this.

So no, it wouldn't be the dawn of a new species. You need a LOT of them to create a new species, and they need to be fertile and survive.
