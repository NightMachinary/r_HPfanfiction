I've honestly never run across a story of this type that wasn't just canon ruined by a bunch of insipid banter. After all, there's a reason why MST3K goes after the likes of Gamera, not Citizen Kane.

While it's probably not what you're after, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2829366/4/Dimension-Hopping-for-Beginners][World 298]] out of nonjon's Dimension Hopping for Beginners is a meta-story that sums up my experience (and perhaps your frustrations) with the genre.
