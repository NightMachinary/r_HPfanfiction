I've always seen those types of stories as one of those things that gives FanFiction a bad name. Hear me out, I know it can be interesting to see character's reactions to their future laid out in a book or whatever, but the only ones I've ever seen have had the entirety of the book (or books!) typed out in the story- which is illegal! People could read the entire book- or series- without paying for it, or even increasing a library's circulation. If there were only tiny portions of the book that were directly quoted, I suppose that would be alright, but I have only ever read fics where they quote the /entire book/. And that is not okay.

Like I said before, I totally see the allure, and there are a ton of cool things that could be done with the concept. But I haven't come across a single "Reading (insert book name) with (insert people / person's names) that's been original.
