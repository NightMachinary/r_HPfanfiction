That's such a great gesture, because it reads both Ron and Harry perfectly.

You would assume that /Ron/, as the last Weasley boy to need a watch on his seventeenth birthday, would be the one to get his uncle Fabian's watch. But he's not. Ron very rarely gets new things that have only ever belonged to him, so giving him something new is the loving gesture.

Harry, on the other hand...what Harry lacks is family. So when he's given the family heirloom, that's really meaningful.
