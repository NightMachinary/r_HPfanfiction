This is a very interesting take on the curse I've never seen before. It even makes sense to boot. Combined with the answer above, it seems the answer is a resounding 'no'. As long as the intent is to teach defense, the curse will take hold. I wonder if JKR considered it similarly.

Even if this is the case though I can still spare a giggle or two for fics that snark at canon by getting around the curse as op stated.
