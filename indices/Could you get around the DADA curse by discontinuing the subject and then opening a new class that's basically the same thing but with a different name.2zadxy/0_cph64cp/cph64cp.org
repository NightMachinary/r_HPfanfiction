It's my belief that the curse Voldemort put on the position is for the DADA professor to be confronted by his or her worst fears;

1st - Quirrel was devalued, used, and then thrown away. His death wasn't even investigated

2nd - Lockhart was forced into a do or die situation, revealed as a coward and huckster, then had his own Memory charm used against him

3rd - Lupin's lycanthropy was exposed and by losing control he threatened the lives of those closest to him

4th (a two-fer) - Moody is blindsided by a Death Eater and his identity/reputation used against his allies; Crouch Jr. kills his own father before he can prove his worth, misses his Master's resurrection and then gets Kissed by a Dementor

5th - Umbridge has her authority destroyed and then falls victim to half-breeds and creatures, because she was deceived by a muggleborn

- Harry also taught Defense; his relationship with Cho imploded, he was betrayed by someone trusted (Marietta Edgecombe), they all were caught by Umbridge with help from his hated rival (Draco), and he later lost the closest thing to a parent he had left (Sirius).

It's probably for the best that he and Ginny hadn't started dating yet.

6th - Snape is forced to choose his side, ruining his reputation with those he respects. He also has to kill Dumbledore, the one man who knows his true motivations

7th - the Carrows witness the fall of the Dark Lord and are captured and sent to Azkaban (a place they had avoided up til then). Amycus gets a dose of his Cruciatus from Harry.

In a sense, I see the Curse as an answer to the insult; Riddle felt he was the best possible candidate for the Defense position, and his curse would force any other contenders to prove their superior fitness for the position. It ends when he dies, but not because curses end with the death of the caster. It ends because he could no longer take the position.
