How about two or four people just doing shifts. After all it goes rather well for them all in the first half year. I imagen this is because the curse has to need time to latch onto the teachers. So if guy 1 do summer to winter, guy 2 winter to summer. Maybe having more people the shift out helps confuse the curse... If nothing else i imagen it could be good rookie auroer traning. "Go in, teach, if i see you next year you're officially an auroer."
