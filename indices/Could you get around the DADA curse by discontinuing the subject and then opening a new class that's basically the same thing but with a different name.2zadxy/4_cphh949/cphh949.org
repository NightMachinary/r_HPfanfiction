I doubt it. Magic works by intent rather than technicalities, and if people could get around magic with mere technicalities like this, it would be worthless. The spirit of the curse matters more than the actual position it was applied to.

That's why I don't like fics where Harry manages to get around the GoF just by screwing with contract technicalities. I always like to think of *magic as intent-based*, it works by the *spirit of the thought* rather than the intricacies of the thought.

Otherwise, Hermione would be the most OP character in all of Harry Potter, fanfiction included, forever.
