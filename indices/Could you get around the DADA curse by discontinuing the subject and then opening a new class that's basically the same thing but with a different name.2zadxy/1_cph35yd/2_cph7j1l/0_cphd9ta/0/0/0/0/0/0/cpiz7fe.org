I'm really glad my comment made sense to you =D

I haven't heard that example about the water runes and the plumbing, but you're right, a lot of the enchantments at Hogwarts would require power long after the founders were dead and gone. Of course there's counter-arguments to that too (the headmaster, leylines, magical residue from spells being cast....) which is why I decided not to really include Hogwarts among my examples, but that's one of the great things about fanfic, I think, is that you can write magical theory to suit your fic and your tastes. It's only when you start saying, 'no, magic /can't/ work like this/do this' that you start running into problems, I think.
