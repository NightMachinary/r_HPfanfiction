Excellent analysis.

Thanks for proving that there's always another way to think about it!

  I think there's a difference between active spells like the body-bind or imperius curse, and long-term enchantments.

This seems like an important distinction. Many times in fics that extrapolate on Runes they use an example of a water-conjuring rune to explain the presence of something /resembling/ modern plumbing in a thousand-year-old castle. The runes would need to be powered by something and the founders are long dead.

Your explanation goes a long way towards resolving some interesting details of the HP universe.
