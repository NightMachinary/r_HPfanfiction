If the curse was anchored to something, for example with runes carved into it or something like that. For example, Bill being a curse-breaker and working on the old tombs in ancient Egypt - the people who cursed them are long dead, yet the curses are still in effect without being actively powered by the caster's magic anymore. I'm sure other old enchanted objects exist - maybe the hand of glory or cursed necklace that were sold at Borgin and Burke's, or the Mirror of Erised. Also, wouldn't it make the sale of magical items difficult if they would stop working once the caster died? Like Dumbledore's pensieve, Moody's foe glass, Harry's sneakoscope, the deluminator Dumbledore willed to Ron, the products Fred made at Weasley's Wizard Wheezes.... It would also probably be an unreasonable drain on a wizard's magic if they had to keep actively powering every object they'd enchanted. I think there's a difference between active spells like the body-bind or imperius curse, and long-term enchantments.
