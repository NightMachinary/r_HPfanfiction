You could make the case for it either way, but I'm betting it was lifted. There's evidence for magic weakening or going away once the caster dies - Dumbledore as Secret Keeper for the Order; his death made everyone who knew the secret an individual Keeper. We also have Voldemort's defeat (at Godric's Hollow) breaking the Imperius on various people he'd enchanted.

Probably the strongest evidence is when Harry is unfrozen atop the tower at the end of Half-Blood Prince. Harry basically says straight-out that Dumbledore's death lifted the Full Body Bind.
