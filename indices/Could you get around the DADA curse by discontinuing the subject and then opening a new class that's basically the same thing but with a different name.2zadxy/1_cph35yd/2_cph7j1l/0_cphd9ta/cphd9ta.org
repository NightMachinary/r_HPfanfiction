I mean that magic has its own conception of what, to us, are merely symbolic or subjective ideas. "Love" isn't just an emotion, it's an actual force with actual power. And the Sword of Gryffindor, for example, needs to be taken under conditions of "need and valor."

In the real word, "need and valor" are subjective. I might think I need the Sword, but you might disagree because my "need" involves a great party trick where I cut salami really fast. But, to me, I really need it.

In JKR's magical world, "need" exists as something that magic actually knows about and checks. (Resist the urge to latch onto "knows" and anthropomorphize magic). You have to /really/ need the Sword, and you have to /really/ display valor when you take it -- you can't have someone Memory Charm you into thinking there's a dragon you just fought to win the sword.

"Flesh of the servant, willingly given." - There's a reason "willingly" is included in that ritual. It's something the magic cares about, and it's not something you can fake.

In the context of the DADA job, the curse is on the position itself. Calling DADA something else is semantics - it's still /actually/ DADA.
