Do you know any noteworthy stories that explore magical theory in a similar manner? Also, have you written any stories yourself, if you don't mind me asking?

/edit:/

I myself came up to something similar to what you are describing. But, however you look at it, I think there are still some unsolved problems and that you'd have to involve some additional elements for the necessary resolution:

- it could either be anthropomorphism of Magic, after all, --- e.g. something akin to what [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]] did for their series --- a consciousness developing itself wherever large amounts of “magic” concentrate, or a consciousness distributing certain powers of “magic” (“light”/“dark”), etc;
- it could be something powering itself from certain hosts of consciousness (wizards; wizards and non-magical humans; these two groups and developed enough animals; etc). This way the “common sense” affecting the results with magic would start making sense because it wouldn't matter any more that certain laws by which magic operates are based on definitions that are extremely subjective in their nature. In other words, it wouldn't matter that “evil”, for instance, is subjective, because as long as a large enough portion of the population (unconsciously) evaluates certain things as evil, it would get recognised as such by [their magic] / [Magic].
- or it could be a system that envelops the entire Magical system inside of it and emulates all the necessary effects --- a virtual reality, perhaps, or a meta-magical dimension of sorts that would be too esoteric and incomprehensible for wizards to understand and describe.
