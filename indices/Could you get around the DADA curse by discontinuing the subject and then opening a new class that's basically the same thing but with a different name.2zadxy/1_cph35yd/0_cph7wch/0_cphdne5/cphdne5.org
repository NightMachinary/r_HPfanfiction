  Even if it is symbolic, what is powering the curse?
#+end_quote

Magic. It's a mistake to think of magic as needing some kind of anchor or mana pool or shit like that. That way madness (and magical cores) lies.

#+begin_quote
  Is it anchored to an object, location, or person?
#+end_quote

The curse is on the position itself. Magic doesn't need a physical anchor.

#+begin_quote
  Is it simply affecting reality in some way we've not seen in canon?
#+end_quote

No, it's affecting reality in the standard way magic does in canon. Magic is seen to affect, in canon, at various times: people, animals, objects, buildings, locations, words, memories, and concepts (such as secrets.) This is what I mean by the HP magic being unlike standard roleplaying game magic. Concepts and context matter - it's not as simple as "cast spell for 8 mana, does 10 damage to target."

  if literally nothing , whether it be a new name, new room, moving out of hogwarts, can allow the childRen to be taught defense by anyone other than Voldemort, then it is focused on and activated by a very loose concept with hundreds of variables and that is in fact a Plot Hole. If he's the only one capable of that magic he's a god, if that magic is common, then why isn't it utilized better?

It's not as complex as you're making it seem - and, though it's a powerful curse, no doubt, Voldemort is on the upper end of the HP magic power spectrum. But it's really not a loose concept with hundreds of variables. If you, as a reader, look at a situation, and ask, "Is Defense Against the Dark Arts being taught at Hogwarts?", and you consider it in a common-sense, non-semantic way, and the answer is "yes," the curse is in play. If not, then it isn't. It's actually pretty simple. Magic cares about /results/ - Is the Defense Professor still teaching at the end of the year? Yes? The curse comes into play, and the result will be that he/she doesn't come back next year.

It's the same as people arguing about the /Protego/ spell, about what kinds of different Muggle things it would stop. It's really easy: a properly cast Protego will stop things that would harm you. The concept of the spell has to do with "protection." It's not a physical analogue for some kind of sci-fi forcefield - it's /magic./ Concepts matter. If you're under the Shield Charm and someone points a laser pointer at you, the Charm does nothing. If they amp up the laser so that it would hurt you, the Shield Charm blocks it. Because it would hurt you. Again, magic cares about /results/ - would X hurt you? Yes? Then X is blocked by a properly cast /Protego/. That's the logic of the magical system JKR implies.

(And yes, we can complicate this by talking about how magic can defeat other magic: /Protego/ won't save you from fiendfyre, etc. For the purposes of this argument, we're talking about /mundane/ ways to defeat the Defense curse, such as changing the name of the class or its location.)
