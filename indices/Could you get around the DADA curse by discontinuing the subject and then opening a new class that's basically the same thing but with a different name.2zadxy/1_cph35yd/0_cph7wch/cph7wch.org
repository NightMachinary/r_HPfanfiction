I like this explanation as far as the nature of HP magic is concerned, but you're kinda skipping over several key concepts here. Even if it is symbolic, what is powering the curse? Is it anchored to an object, location, or person? Is it simply affecting reality in some way we've not seen in canon? How does the existence of the ability to essentially destroy and redirect fate like that over such an incredibly petty thing affect the rest of the world of magic? Is Voldemort simply so powerful that he can force reality to bring about the removal of the defence professors no matter what they try to do? If so, why couldn't he apply this somewhere else?

I'm probably communicating this very poorly but I guess what I'm saying is, if literally nothing , whether it be a new name, new room, moving out of hogwarts, can allow the childRen to be taught defense by anyone other than Voldemort, then it is focused on and activated by a very loose concept with hundreds of variables and that is in fact a Plot Hole. If he's the only one capable of that magic he's a god, if that magic is common, then why isn't it utilized better?
