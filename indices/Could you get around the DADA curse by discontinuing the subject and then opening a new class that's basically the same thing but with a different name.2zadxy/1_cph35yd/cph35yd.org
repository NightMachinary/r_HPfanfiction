No. HP magic isn't semantic, it's symbolic.

It wouldn't work for the same reason a Death Eater couldn't Oblivate / Confund someone into kidnapping Harry from the Dursleys - magic has a definition of "kidnapping," and tricking the person into thinking he's helping Harry doesn't trick magic.

Understanding how HP magic is different from D&D style "letter of the law" magic is a key insight into understanding why some of the various proposed fanon "plot holes" are not actually plot holes.
