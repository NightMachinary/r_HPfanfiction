It's an interesting question, but you'd think in 40 years someone would have tried that.

It also depends on the application of the curse. One ff author I read tied it to the Professor's contract.

Personally, I would imagine that LV tied the curse to himself given his attempts at immortality.

If I were to end it earlier - as a ff writer - I would think about attempting to contravene it from the professor's side. That is magically creating a new identity year after year. This would be pretty inconvenient, but not much more than getting a new professor each year. It would probably be classed as 'Dark' Magic though.
