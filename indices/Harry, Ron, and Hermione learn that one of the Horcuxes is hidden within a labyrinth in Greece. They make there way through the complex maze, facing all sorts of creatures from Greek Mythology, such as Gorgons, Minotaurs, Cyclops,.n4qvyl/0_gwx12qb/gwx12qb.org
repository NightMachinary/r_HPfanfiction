You could probably draw some like with Herpo being a Greek and inventor of the Horcrux, so that is why Voldemort felt it was appropriate to put it there.

On a different note, JKR seems to have just said that magical creatures tend to originate from where their myths started, which means magical Greece must be horrifying. Just from the entries on the wiki alone it has cerberi, manticores and chimeras, let alone some of the other monsters you have mentioned and everyting else from the Greek myths. In my head canon, there is no Greek magical community because it is just too dangerous for anyone except monster hunters with a death wish or Dark Lords. Incidently, if you allow these creatures to have ranges that extend a bit beyond the modern boarders of Greece, it is an excellent explanation as to why Albania is such a good place for Voldemort to hide.
