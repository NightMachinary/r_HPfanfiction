An interesting thing with Greek mythology (that Harry Potter seems to ignore, but I'll get to that later) is that most the monsters are one off. There was only one Chimera, only one Manticore, and Cerberus was literally the guard dog of the underworld (which is where the books diverge for the mythology with the existence of Fluffy).

So yeah, apparently there might be a whole race worth of gorgons (Medusas) running around the wizarding world. That's... terrifying.
