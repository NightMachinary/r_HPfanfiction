The Wizengamont doesn't have the power to expel students, only the Headmaster does. Removing such a popular Headmaster at the time would have been political suicide for Fudge, which is why he tried to slowly chip away at Dumbledore's influence using Umbridge (unsuccessfully it must be added). Even if the expulsion stood, Dumbledore would have every right to keep Harry on as a "member of staff" like Hagrid. The only other option would be to order Harry sent straight to Azkaban, but then sending the Boy-Who-Lived to prison for underage magic might have had even more disruption both politically and in the press.
