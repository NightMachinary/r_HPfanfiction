Only reason why I didn't say Lupin, was because Snape told the school that Lupin was a werewolf, but if it was just to help with the lesson plan, I could see it happening.

After he taught the DA, I always thought that he'd be a great Defence Professor, and it'd be a perfect little revenge, becoming the Defence Professor in canon, after killing Voldemort, since Voldemort wanted the position but Dumbledore turned him down. While I'm fine with Harry becoming an Auror, I do wish he would have become a teacher.
