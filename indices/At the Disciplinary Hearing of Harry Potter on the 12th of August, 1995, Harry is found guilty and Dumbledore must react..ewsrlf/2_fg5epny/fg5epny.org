It'll probably be another Hagrid case, where Dumbledore takes Harry on as another member of the staff, maybe even fixing Harry's wand with the elder wand, and telling him to use it discreetly.

Harry would probably become the next Defence Professor, so in this timeline, Umbridge wouldn't. He would be forced not to use magic in front of the students, but given how great he was at teaching in the DA, I think he'd be fine with that.

Though I don't think the Ministry has any right to interfere with expelling a student, so in that case, I could see the other professors, as well as Dumbledore helping Harry pass his classes

Edit: He'd probably have help from Dumbledore himself, so he's not overwhelmed with teaching so many kids. I'd actually be interested in reading that...

Though alternatively could also have Kingsley Shacklebolt or Moody or someone to potentially help Harry with the overload as well.
