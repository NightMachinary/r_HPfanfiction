I'm not proving his point lol. I was answering your question about how many Dumbledore is willing to sacrifice to make Harry happy.

I think the biggest problem with your argument is that Dumbledore, in OoTp, was gone from Hogwarts and the Ministry from the end of March/beginning of April to the end June. Voldemort didn't step out of hiding until his plan was a near success. Why? Because Dumbledore wasn't /dead/.
