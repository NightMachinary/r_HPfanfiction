It's still a useful quote. However, it's not about Dumbledore being willing to sacrifice, it's about him willing to risk. That's a pretty big difference.

Dubledore in OotP was gone from Hogwarts, but he was still around to show up and foil any major plan of Voldemort's at a moment's notice---as he did, at the end of that book. On the other hand, publicly leaving the country with a defenceless adolescent in tow could significantly increase his response time (depending on the availability and the range of communication mirrors, speed and range of Patronus messengers, and range and accuracy of Phoenix teleportation). It would also send a very different message to, his allies, his enemies, and those undecided.
