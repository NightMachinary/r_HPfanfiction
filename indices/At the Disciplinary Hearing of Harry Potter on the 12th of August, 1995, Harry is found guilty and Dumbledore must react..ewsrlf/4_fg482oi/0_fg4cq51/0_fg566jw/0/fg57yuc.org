I think this quote is actually helping my case more than [[/u/Miqdad_Suleman]]'s:

1. It shows that, contrary to [[/u/Miqdad_Suleman]], Dumbledore /already/ truly cares about Harry, perhaps more than he should given his other responsibilities.
2. From the way Dumbledore says it, it was a narrow decision, and he isn't necessarily proud of it.
3. At that time, Dumbledore was weighing the certainty of burdening Harry with unbearable responsibility against a distant possibility that not telling Harry would maybe hurt others in the future. In [[/u/Miqdad_Suleman]]'s proposal, Voldemort is already back and actively gathering forces, and so fleeing with Harry would be a near-certainty of those nameless and faceless people's and creatures' slaughter.
4. As far as I can tell, in Dumbledore's ethical framework, causing harm through action is worse than allowing equivalent harm by inaction. Not telling Harry is an inaction; taking Harry and fleeing is an action.
5. Arguments in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ewsrlf/at_the_disciplinary_hearing_of_harry_potter_on/fg56l9f/][my reply to the sibling post]] also apply.
