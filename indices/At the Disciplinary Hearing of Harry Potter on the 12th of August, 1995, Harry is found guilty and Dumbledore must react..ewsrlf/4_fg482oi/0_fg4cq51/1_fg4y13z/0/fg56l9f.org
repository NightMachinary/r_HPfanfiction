Not really. The prophecy only matters to the extent to which its subjects care about it. If both Harry and Voldemort both choose to ignore it and stay away from each other, they can both live happily ever after (literally). So, Harry and Dumbledore can go on their merry road trip, while Voldemort consolidates his power over Britain and purges it of anything he perceives as Muggle influence.

Or, maybe Voldemort doesn't accept their retreat and ends up chasing them all over the world. That would be better for Britain, but it certainly wouldn't be safer for Harry. Harry, by abandoning 4 Privet Drive, will have lost the only truly inviolable sanctuary he has against Voldemort and his agents.
