It is a rather cool prompt and it would work with fanon, but probably not with Canon "Order of the Phoenix" Dumbledore, as he feared the whole book that Voldemort had too much influence over Harry.

And giving Harry the teaching position that Voldemort always wanted would run contrary to that imho. Though he would surely offer him a place at Hogwarts, so that he could monitor him more closely.

I could rather see that Harry has to become Severus's assistant to make both of them miserable XD
