I never though he was racist it seemed more to me that he was interested in all the other aspects of the DE (the dark arts, friends within slytherin etc). I think that he called Lilly a mudblood not because he felt that she was inferior but just because well if you grow in an environment were the only people who accept you are racist with a single exception then well you internalize some of that. I feel like he is like a children repiting what his fathers said. Although his actions were racist, OK you know what you're absolutely right it doesn't matter if snape truly believed in blood purity or not what matters is that snape acted like a racist and that makes it as a more important example of racism than what I though.
