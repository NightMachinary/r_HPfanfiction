I'm sorry, what the hell are you doing acting like you know my father? You're not the one who had to hear “oh, you're Mexican but you're not really Mexican. You're basically an honorary full-white!” You aren't the one who had to see his fucking stick-and-poke swastika back tattoos every time he walked around with out his shirt on. You aren't the one who had to listen to every rant about how the “fucking wetbacks need to learn English.” You aren't the one who got grounded for “disrespect” when you yelled at him for calling all Black people “monkeys.” You aren't the one who hated herself for the color of her skin because of the internalized racism I struggled with for years.

And okay, maybe you want an example of something else relating to the topic? Homophobia. How many kids are thrown out of their homes or have killed themselves because of parents who hate gay people?

People can, and absolutely will, support causes and ideologies that hurt their family/friends. I don't know what world you grew up in, but clearly YOU have no fucking clue what you're talking about.
