Just a FYI: it's very, very difficult to read that the racism in the southern USA and the lynchings were'nt that bad. They were terrible. Many hundreds of people were killed, thousands were injured, and millions were prevented from living as actual human beings (still being felt by some). That really is not on the level of 'genteel disdain' or implicit / passive racism, as you appear to be suggesting.
