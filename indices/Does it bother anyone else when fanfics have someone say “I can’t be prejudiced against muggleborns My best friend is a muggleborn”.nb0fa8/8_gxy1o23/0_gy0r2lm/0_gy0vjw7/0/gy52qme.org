I don't understand why that coumnts as OP being confused. Many thousands of people died because of racism and elitism; a huge class of people were legally seen as sub-human. You're saying it's... not as bad as someone saying they aren't racist..? Not as bad as the HP example because the fictional baddies killed like 4 people, but for some reason that's worse than systematically killing thousands?

Quite apart from this really odd concept that calling anything short of holocaust racism counts as 'being confused' - there are very, very few circumstances in which it is helpful to point out that 'other people are more oppressed' - unless it's a teenager whining about not getting enough pocket money. Women complains of sexual harrassment? You're confused; women had it much worse 50 years ago. Company only employs white people? Stop complaining, people have it much worse in the States. Beaten up for being gay? Well, at least you're not in Russia hey, that's what ACTUAL homophobia is. Anything short of that is A-OK...

Even
