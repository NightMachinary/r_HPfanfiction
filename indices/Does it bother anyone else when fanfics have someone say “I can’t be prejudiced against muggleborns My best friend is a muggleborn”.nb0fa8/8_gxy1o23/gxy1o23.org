You are confusing your concepts.

Being a racist is something else than being a murdering madman. There were times and places where most of the population were racists: US South during the Jim Crow's times, most of the “good society” in UK and US before the Second World War was mildly antisemitic. It was bad, but still, it doesn't mean that blacks were mass-murdered in the South (lynching, however despicable, never made it into Holocaust size mass-murder) and I am quite sure that all those Chestertons, Churchills, Woodrow Wilsons etc. would oppose (and they did actually oppose) mass-murdering of Jews by Nazi Germany, and yet some of the things they said [[https://www.econtalk.org/thomas-leonard-on-race-eugenics-and-illiberal-reformers/][were quite horrible]].

Second thing is that you have to distinguish between racism as a state of mind, and attacking somebody because of his minority status. However bad it is despising anybody still it is not the same as actually attacking somebody. Moreover, there is no good evidence of anybody state of mind, but you can prove if somebody attacked somebody else.

So, yes, I would agree with your point if one was saying “I am not an antisemitic, because Kohns are my friends.” That doesn't make any sense, however many people tried to say that. However, it is something different from “I am not trying to kill Jews, see, my beloved mother was the one and my best friend is the one”, isn't it?
