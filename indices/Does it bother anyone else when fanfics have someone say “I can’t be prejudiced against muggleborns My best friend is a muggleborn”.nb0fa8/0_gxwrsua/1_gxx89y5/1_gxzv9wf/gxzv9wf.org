I cannot believe this was actually upvoted. Every single time I see anyone claim that Adolf Hitler was anything less than a raving psychopath that killed on whim, tortured people without reason, poured milk before cereal, and advocated for pineapple on pizza.

It is the reason I get antsy when people call Death Eaters magical Nazis because that could not be more wrong. Tom Riddle and Adolf Hitler and nothing alike. Hitler was unnaturally charismatic. He could make even the most stubborn person fold on their lifetime beliefs with nothing more than a few honeyed words. He rekindled a nation, pulled it from a depression where most other leaders would have faltered. He lied to people, they knew he lied, and they still believed him for some reason because why not? He made people break treaties, made people do things they never would have. I mean, he even invaded a country and no one (besides that country) really cared. He made people believe his lies because he said the thing enough, even if the lie was disproven. Whether you look at this as charisma or whatever is debatable.
