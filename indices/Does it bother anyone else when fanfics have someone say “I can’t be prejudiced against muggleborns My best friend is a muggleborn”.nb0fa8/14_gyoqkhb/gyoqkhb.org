I mean, I can see it being relevant around Chamber of Secrets? At that point he is firstly only 12 so hardly going to have well-reasoned and political arguments in the face of being thought of as the heir of Slytherin, secondly has only two or three friends (one of which being said muggleborn with whom he spends much of his time), and thirdly - one of the only things he knew about his mother at that point was that she was a muggleborn.

At that point in time it really does make for a decent argument (insofar as a 12-year old could be concerned).

Especially compared to Slughorn and his claims about Lily.
