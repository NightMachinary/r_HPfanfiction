okay there is a difference a pureblood saying i can't be a blood purist i have a halfblod kid.

vs

i can't be a blood purist because my mom was a muggleborn (and that makes me a halfblood) so comming from harry its more of a "i'm not a self hating halfbllod"

that being said there can totally be people prejudiced against themselves look at uncle ruckus from boondocks
