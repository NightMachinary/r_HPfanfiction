While I don't defend Snape's actions, I never considered him prejudiced against Muggleborns. Muggles, yes, definitely, but not Muggleborns. He's a halfblood himself, and his best friend was Muggleborn. Not /a/ friend, but /best/. I always figured he didn't much care for blood supremacy but rather joined the Death Eaters as a way of gaining power and recognition, and to deal with Muggles, which he very much was prejudiced against.
