I agree that he had to do something to earn Voldermorts trust, but that fact that he asks Dumbeledore 'what about my soul?' kind of implies that he's never killed, doesn't it. If his soul was already damaged by murder then he wouldn't make that arguement.

Also, its Voldermort who presumes he lusts after Lily, Snape never said that, he asked Dumbledore to save them all.

His redemption arc wasnt "wants to bone Lily Potter" it was "almost 20 years as a deep cover double agent, spying for the light, and ultimately helping then to win the war".
