The thing is that 'going through the motions to fit in' could justify Snape's actions in school, what happened afterwards discredits this. It is strongly implied that Snape is one of Voldemort's most trusted Death Eaters. He is one of the group who were invited to witness Voldemorts ressurection, even though he couldn't make it. His entire value as a spy predicates him having access to Voldemort and his decision making. In book 7 Voldemort trusted him to be the Headmaster of Hogwarts, an incredibly important and powerful position as it allowed Voldemort to effectively hold the nation's children hostage.

This is in spite of Snape being vouched for by Dumbledore at the end of the previous war as having switched sides and then spending a decade and a half working for Voldemort's nemesis. In addition, while he is skilled at potions and dark magic, Snape has no social standing that is valuable to the Death Eaters, as he grew up in the muggle world.

This suggests that Snape earned that trust by being an incredibly eager Death Eater, which would include going above and beyond when it came to hunting down and torturing to death muggleborn, rather than doing the bare minimum for appearances. Even his 'redemption' for wanting to save Lily was 'please kill her husband and child and give her for me to use'.
