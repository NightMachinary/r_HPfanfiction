He only changed sides when he realized that Lily was gonna be the victim. That the prophecy was talking about the Potters.

He went to Dumbledore and begged him to hide Lily and only Lily. And then when Dumbledore told him that he was disgusting, Snape told him to hide Harry and James too if he wanted.

Dumbledore said that he wanted something in exchange, and he told Snape to join the Order to help them spy on the Death Eaters. He left him no choice, it was either that or he was gonna report Snape to the Ministry. Snape didn't join the Order because "he believed in what's right ðŸ˜©"

And for 20 years??? Snape didn't do shit until Harry came to Hogwarts and Dumbledore told him to spy on Quirrell. Voldemort was believed to be dead and Death Eaters had no one to turn to. He wasn't a spy until Voldemort's rise in the 4th book.

He didn't fight for the light for 20 years straight, he terrorized generations of students for 20 years just because he could.

Istg Snape apologists don't read.
