That's actually not true, he canonically called Lily a mudblood, but that was it. It's never stated or shown that he bullied muggleborns, and when Lily asks him about what happened to Mary, it's about what his friends did to her as opposed to what he did. He didn't say that Lily was different from other muggleborns, she did. When he was trying to apologise and explain she kept stopping him from talking and putting words in his mouth.

As for Hermione, she was being a know-it-all in his first class, when he ignored her for waving her arm about. It had nothing to do with her blood, in fact she told the portrait of Phinneas Nigelus Black not to call her 'Mudblood'.
