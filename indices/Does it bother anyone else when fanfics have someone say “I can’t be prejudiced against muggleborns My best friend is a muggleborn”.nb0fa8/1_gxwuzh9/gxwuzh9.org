I feel the version that can be justified is 'why would I believe purebloods are the best if my mother was muggleborn', as that makes him a half-blood. Otherwise, Snape's father was muggle and he grew up with a muggleborn best friend and he still was an eager Death Eater. Voldemort chose to support blood supremacy and he had a muggle father as well. Even in universe the argument is disproven.
