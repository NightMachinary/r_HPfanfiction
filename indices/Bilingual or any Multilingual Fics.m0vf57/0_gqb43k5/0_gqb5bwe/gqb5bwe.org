Just the protagonist or adjacent character knowing another language (or multiple), it wouldn't have to be the plot point but preferably it would be a causal mention that follows throughout the story. I find it super interesting how authors deal with the subject of language. Myself being bilingual gets kinda bored of just reading one language at a time tho lol
