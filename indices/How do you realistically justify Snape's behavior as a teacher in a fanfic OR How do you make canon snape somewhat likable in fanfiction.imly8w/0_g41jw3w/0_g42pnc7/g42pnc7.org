I agree with you assessment and am of the firm opinion that it's a shame he loses this nuance in fanfic. The Changeling, by annerb, exemplifies an exceptionally well written Snape perfectly - he remained totally horrid and in character, without having any onscreen redemption whatsoever. In fact, that fic even interrogated how much of his redemption served his own ego and sense of superior self, without diminishing his good actions. That was an awesome addition to his character. He was sinister, clever, horrid and all his actions were ambiguous, especially his good ones. Snape in the Changeling was more in character and enjoyable to me, as someone who loved JKR's snape, than any “pro-snape” fic that rehabilitates him, to be honest.

Alsoooooo [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] wrote my favourite small missing scene fic on Snape. It confronts how Snape's request to Voldemort for Lily to be spared would have been framed. Which is to say, sinister. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20868359]]. I grieve that I didn't write it myself, it's genuinely so good. Changed how I saw his character permanently.
