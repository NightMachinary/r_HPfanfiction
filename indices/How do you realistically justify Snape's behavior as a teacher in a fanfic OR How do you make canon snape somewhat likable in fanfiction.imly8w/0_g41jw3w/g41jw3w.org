You don't realistically justify all of Snape's behavior as a teacher, because it's not justifiable. Mocking the appearance of young teen girls with bad teeth, threatening to kill students' pets, and glowering at the kid who looks like his dead father are all indefensible.

What you do is acknowledge that human beings are complex and there is more to Snape than his bad behavior. For example, he had rough experiences as a child that explain (but don't justify) some of his bullying tendencies as an adult. And his actions are integral to the war's success. And he's sometimes very funny. And he's academically brilliant. And some students-- the ones who don't crumble under his mockery like Neville-- learn a lot from him because he knows a lot.

He can be "somewhat likable" while also being somewhat awful. In fact, I think that's exactly what he is in canon.

If you redeem him completely, he's no longer his canon self. In the best case scenario, he's an evolved or expanded version of his canon self. And that's fine; most fanfic is AU. But it is possible to give him a realistic journey to being kinder and more humane... just don't pretend that he was always flawless and nothing was ever his fault.

As to your PS, I like him better in canon than in positive fanfiction representations because I get irked by the easy excuses that "he was mean to children to trick Voldemort, he's really sweetness and light" or "he bears no responsibility for his own behavior because James."
