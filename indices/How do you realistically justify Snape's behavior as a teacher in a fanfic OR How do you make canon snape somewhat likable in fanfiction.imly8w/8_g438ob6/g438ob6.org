Recently I've watched a video essay that spoke about why the fans are so divided about Snape, to make it short the one from the movies is much less unpleasant than the one from the books and Books!Snape deliberately throws away the minor redemption moment he gets when he outright states that he is only protective of Harry because of Lily in DH.

Mostly it is a matter of presentation and rigging the other characters reactions, depending on how you show/interpret the same action it can have different effects. For example, was Snape cruelly bullying Neville during potions and consequently making him worse in potions or did he let his naturally winning personality get the better of him when he got frustrated by Neville's frequent falls at potions he (a prodigy) sees as extremely easy while keeping a much closer eye on him to prevent any lethal accident?

I think reading fanfictions (or even other fan-made content, like theories or essays) always colors our opinions in some way or another as it exposes us to the interpretations, ideas and alternative scenarios thought up by people who are as deep in the universe as us, plus all the responses that this content inspires others to post in more fanfics, theories, essays... I am not naturally an immersive reader, I read stories because I like them and find their content interesting, but I generally grow attached to the story instead of characters, so when I first read the books I didn't actually feel strongly one way or another about Snape -he was an interesting character who had his plot-twists and helped move the plot along- it was only when I got deep into fanfic that I stopped to consider that some of his actions really /were/ very messed up.

Today I personally am anti-Snape because I grew to see the way he gleefully sets on being a Jerk King to school children as pitiful and cruel to the point that I can't really see any realistic justification that would make it excusable.
