Many things were said here and while I agree with some I gotta say.. and this will bring hate... You can't redeem him.

He's a great soldier. He's an amazing fighter in a war but an awful teacher and person overall. While he has some nice traits I don't think you can redeem someone who won't want or do something to get it.

Besides what we get is Harry's interpretation so it's biased. We are biased to think he's a bad person because it's how Harry sees him.
