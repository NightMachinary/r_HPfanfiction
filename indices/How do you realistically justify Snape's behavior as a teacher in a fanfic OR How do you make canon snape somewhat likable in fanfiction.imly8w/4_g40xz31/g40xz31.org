This is a titanic task. Reedeeming him while not going OOC. You definitely need him to have a wake up call. There is no way otherwise. He is a grey character but you can't make him jump into the reedeemed bandwagon without he having some sort of epiphany. He needs to understand that he cannot atone for something and mess something else.

I think that if you want inspiration you can look at Jaime Lannister. A hell of a writing job. (Book not tv). He is not quite redeemed yet but he is in the right path at the end on AffC. Jaime did a good deed no one knows about (like Snape). Thinks he is above people and doesn't need to explain himself how good is actions are/were (like Snape). He is a prick and is mean though, pushed a kid out of the window (metaphorical window for Snape). Until Jaime doesn't understand that he has to deal with pushing Bran, he cannot get full atonement. Same for Snape. You need Snape to revaluate who he really is. A heck of a task.
