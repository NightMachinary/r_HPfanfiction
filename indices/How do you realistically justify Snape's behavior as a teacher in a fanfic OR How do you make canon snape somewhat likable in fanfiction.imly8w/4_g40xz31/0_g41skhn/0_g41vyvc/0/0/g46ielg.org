When Snape angrily demanded, in Prisoner of Azkaban, that Harry ought to be thanking him on bended knee, he may have lacked information about the situation, but he did have one good point: Harry never offered him the tiniest sliver of thanks nor apology, for anything. Snape threatened the life of Neville's toad, but he also saved Harry's life on numerous occasions. And he never gets a single token of gratitude.

It's things like that that no doubt convinced him he was dealing with James 2.0.
