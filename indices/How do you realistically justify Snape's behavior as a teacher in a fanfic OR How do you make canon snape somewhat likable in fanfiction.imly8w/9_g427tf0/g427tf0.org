The thing with redeeming Snape, is it has to come from a place of atonement for his wrongs, not lust for his teen obsession. Snape as he is in cannon is too immature to find true redemption. In order to find redemption he has to atone for how he treated his students, both individually, and en-mass. He can continue to despise jame's potter's memory, so long as he dosen't take that contempt out upon harry. He can continue to remember his relationship with lily, as long as he focuses on his friendship, and not his obsession.

Snape can be redeemed. The books entirely missed the mark.
