I mean, you seem to be asking four different questions here - How do you redeem Snape, how do you make him likeable, how do you make him good, and how do you justify his canon actions/behaviours.

Likeable is simple. Wit, Snark, Sympathy, and Sass. People like the guy already, so give him some quips, some badass moments, and some sympathetic reasons for what he does. That seems to be the basic recipe for likeability in fanfiction. People in this fandom will cinnamon-roll wizard Hitler and leather-pants Draco Malfoy, we're totes easy. :)

Justification and Redemption are rather more difficult.

Justification tends to revolve around the 'why' of actions. May seem obvious, but it's worth stating. So, you work backwards. Snape does a thing. Why does he do it? What's his reasoning? What's his logic?

Logic is how a character thinks and how they process information and make decisions. Snape tends to be very bitter and obsessive about past events, so everything he experiences tends to be filtered through those events and seen through a lens coloured by those experiences.

Reasoning tends to come in two categories: implicit and explicit. Explicit is the reasons you can tell, implicit is the reasons you can't. You can do things for reasons you don't even realise - that's a big part of certain types of therapy, uncovering unknown reasons for your behaviours and helping you find out those reasons for yourself.

So, you follow that through. Take a situation - Snape telling on Lupin and getting him fired - and work backwards. The situation was provoked by the events of the Shrieking Shack night, so you take that and filter it through Snape's logic (bitter and angry about his youth) and work from there. The implicit reasons that he doesn't really think about too much would likely be around self-hatred and bitterness, while the explicit reasons would likely be around Remus deserving it for nearly killing him or being a werewolf and Sirius being an unrepentant psychopath who also nearly killed him.

Redemption tends to revolve around reflection, growth, and acceptance. Identify where you fucked up, learn from that mistake, then move on and past it to a point that other people agree you're redeemed, basically. That tends to occur via people, via actions, or via experiences, and then either with a single event or over time, depending on the impetus the catalyst thing gives the change.

Generally, everyone has what we can shorthandedly call 'a worldview'. This is, as you could probably guess, the way they see the world. Villainous characters tend to have a worldview that, to them, justifies their actions. The Greater Good, we all want to watch the world burn, all that stuff. This is solidified to them due to their backstory, their experiences through life, and needs something strong to break it.

This could happen due to people. Usually, something happens to a person, or an interaction happens with someone the villainous character cares about. Since this is Snape, that's basically Lily and maybe Dumbledore. Something happens to Lily (she dies, obvs) and then Snape breaks from the Death Eater-y worldview and joins Dumbledore's side. This could also take the intervention-esque form from most American Sitcoms, some characters sit down with the character-in-need-of-redeeming and try convince them to change.

Actions is a mix of decisions and events. Basically, something happens to them or they do something to someone else. Vader is a pretty good example of this. His redemption comes when he sees Luke being tortured, turns on Palpatine, and then dies for his son. Equally, you could have Snape being instructed by Voldemort to torture a captured Harry, then have his breaking-point moment and turn to Harry's side to rescue him and get out of there. It's all about something happening that shows the character the effects of their actions and involves them making a single decision between their redemption and committing to their villainy, and the event gives them some reason to pick the redemption choice. Interestingly, Kylo Ren is also a great example of flipping this around completely. Where Vader was always the Lackey until he got his redemption, Ren took his master's spot and discarded his redemption event to fully commit to being the baddie.

And finally, Experiences. This tends to be the slow path, and often features in 'long term villain helps out the heroes' arcs in TV serials. So, it tends to be a long effort to fully realise the consequences of their actions and to atone for what they've done. For this, I'd say someone Snape betrayed comes along and Snape gets to know them and what happened, then really sees the impact of his spying and double-agentry and such.

Though, I'm sure there's probably way more things. Basically, redemption just needs a catalyst to make the character realise they fucked up, then some development to show them changing and everyone accepting that.

Making a character Good... that I can't really help with. Philosophers have been debating for centuries on what makes a good person, and I honestly find the good-bad evaluation thing to be a little pointless anyway. Most people aren't good or bad, they're just people, and identifying those that are good or bad doesn't really tell you anything useful about them. And I've been playing D&D and reading Sword and Sorcery fantasy novels for too long to see Good as anything but an Alignment value. :D
