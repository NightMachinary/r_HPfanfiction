Canon Snape, as in: book Snape, trying to kill Neville's frog and ignoring Malfoy throwing stuff into other people's potions with potential disastrous consequences.

And it's just:

1) the massive age difference 2) without having read the fic Harriet will probably be an allost-clone of Lily, making it creepy and seem like he's living his fantasy through his obsession's offspring. Like Littlefinger from GoT. 3) The inappropriateness and immorality of engaging in a romantic relationship with a much younger, emotionally vulnerable, person that sees you as his/her saviour.
