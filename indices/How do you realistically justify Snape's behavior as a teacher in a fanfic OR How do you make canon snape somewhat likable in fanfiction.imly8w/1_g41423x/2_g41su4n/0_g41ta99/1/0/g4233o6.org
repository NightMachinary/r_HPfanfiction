I hate Snarry pairing with a passion but do like the Never Ending road fic a lot. Both Snape's and fem!Harry's characterizations are really good. Like the original poster said neither the main fic or the sequel have this pairing actually in it so I think of the fic as gen.

Harriet in this fic is a female take on Harry both in personality and looks. The one time romance is mentioned in the fic I believe Harriet has a sort of crush on her teacher. Snape is super pissed when he finds out (at least I think he finds out and stops talking to her, I don't remember the details) and is no way into her like that at the point in the fic where I stopped.
