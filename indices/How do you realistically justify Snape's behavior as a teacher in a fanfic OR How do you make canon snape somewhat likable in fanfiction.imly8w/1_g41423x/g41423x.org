There's a few ways to go about it, and it depends on the characterization and goal towards him.

For instance, if it's in the background, I quite like the option of seeding in that he's a harsh teacher, but not completely unfair. Linkffn(Blood Crest) has one of my favorite examples there, where Harry opens up his potions text on the train and does a bit of studying - and where all the tough question Snape asks turn out to sbe (aconite being early alphabetically). A little detail like that can turn Snape's first day outburst into a teacher with a poor temper checking to see if students had even opened up the book to the first page, which is at least a bit more reasonable.

With that sort of characterization, I like the approach of Snape not wanting to be a teacher, but being forced into the role b/c of his dual spy role. So he's a potions prodigy, stuck teaching something he has no desire to do with kids he has no temper for, and who manage to mess everything up. That doesn't make him a 'good person' magically, but it does make him more relatable/understandable.

To flesh out his more pleasant side, I think that should come out more in conversations with other teachers. McGonagall in particular makes for a good foil there, with the two of them being more serious that Dumbledore and having to deal with his... eccentricities. Dumbledore too is good for conversations to showcase Snape when he's not in Teacher Mode. Others that can fit in interestingly are the Malfoys (particularly Draco and Narcissa). Lucius also provides an opportunity to have a nicer Snape still be in an adversarial role early, by having things be requested of him to do.

For having him turn more good, my preferred avenue is having him find out what the Dursleys were doing to Harry early on, when that would force him to change his opinion of him. That is (IMO) the best way of jolting Snape to not hating Harry early on, and from there setting up a more gradual evolution of his character. Laventadorn's "Never-Ending Road" has very nice characterization for that type of Snape, and is highly worth reading (it's my favorite characterization of Snape). linkffn(8615605) . Alternatively, a potions devoted - and competent - MC would seem a fitting way to force him to respect them more. That's the avenue taken in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense), and it's done well there too.

Snape's personality should still be acerbic, still be bitingly mean/sarcastic, cynical, etc. But I think that having him be a on the whole 'good' character - or at the least a complicated, grey one - is far more interesting way to take him, even in the background. And those aspects of his character are easy to make him be more lovable too - after all, a sarcastic cynic can be a lot of fun to read about ;)
