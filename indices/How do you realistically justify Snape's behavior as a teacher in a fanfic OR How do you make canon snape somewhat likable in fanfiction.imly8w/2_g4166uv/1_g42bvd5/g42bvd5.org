  He can be a good (not evil) character while still being a cranky bastard. ... He hates Snape, so he sees everything Snape does through that lens.

This isn't true at first. I don't think his "hatred" starts until at least 2nd term 1st year, more likely later. After the first lesson he's not happy with Snape, but that's because of Snape's own actions, which don't improve, leading Harry to hate him. If Snape had not been a bully, had he at least been neutral, i doubt Harry would have hated him at all...

We see Snape's actions clearly at first. While damning Lily made him run to Dumbledore, we don't ever see proof that Snape felt bad/repented for everything else he did as a death eater. He wanted Voldemort dead, so worked with Dumbledore. I still can not see why anyone considers him a "hero". That said, i believe we are all entitled to our own opinions.
