To steal a line from Sondheim: nice is different than good. He can be a good (not evil) character while still being a cranky bastard. Within canon, I think it's perfectly reasonable to point out that Harry has a limited perspective, especially on the adults in his life. He hates Snape, so he sees everything Snape does through that lens. If you're writing from Snape's perspective, or from someone else's, there's no reason why we couldn't see other aspects of his character. And if you go beyond the books and have Snape survive the war, it's plausible that he could become a /slightly/ less bitter/unhappy person.

There's not much to like about him in canon, though, I agree. People like Alan Rickman or they like the challenge of humanizing villains and unlikable characters.
