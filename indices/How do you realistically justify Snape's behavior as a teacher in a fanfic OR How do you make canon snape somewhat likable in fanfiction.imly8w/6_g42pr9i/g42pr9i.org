I generally prefer a grey or morally neutral Snape. I feel like it's a better sale.

There are several fics that I like which portray Snape as equally prepared to be on the winning side - light or dark. I think that's a cool perspective.

As to why I like Snape: I like YA fiction, I do. But Snape is a fully adult character with a complicated backstory BEFORE he walks into a fanfic. There's a lot to work with. He's complicated and messy and very difficult to Mary Sue.
