I feel linkffn(I know not and cannot know yet I live and I love) has a very good characterization of Snape. He's still mean to his students, but somehow Luna grew on him and he tried to be nicer. (he was still not a nice person) Idk I'm not good at summarizing it. It's the best one shot I've ever read. linkao3(problem of potions) has a pretty well written Snape I find? He's still not a nice person, everyone hates him except Harry, but that's just because he liked potions enough to put up with Snape.
