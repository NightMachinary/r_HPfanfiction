  How do you realistically justify Snape's behavior as a teacher in a fanfic?
#+end_quote

Book Snape? You can't. He's petty and cruel and gives zero fucks about Harry or anyone else besides himself and his own self-pity. He's verbally and emotionally abusive. He picks on a child because his appearance resembles that of his father, constantly insulting that child by comparing him unfavourably to the father he'd never met... meanwhile Snape himself is the reason that father is dead and the child grew up an orphan in an abusive home.

Let me say that one more time: Snape habitually mocks, belittles and torments a preteen orphan while *being the reason the kid is an orphan in the first place.* There is literally no way to justify that.

Fuck Snape redemption arcs. He shouldn't be allowed within ten miles of any child let alone be employed in a school as a teacher.

(And yes, my opinion is harsh. He's still a prick though.)

You would have to toss canon completely out the window, INCLUDING the reason he switched sides, in order to make him not a waste of space imo.
