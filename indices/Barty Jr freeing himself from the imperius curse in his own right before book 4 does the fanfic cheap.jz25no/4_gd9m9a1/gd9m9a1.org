Are things going to be any different for Barty Senior in the leadup? One of my fics, I had the increased stress and scrutiny following the public reveal that Sirius hadn't had a trial weaken Senior's ability to maintain the Imperius, with it finally snapping while he was in the middle of a meeting with the DMLE that he couldn't beg out of and Junior gone with Winky by the time he got home. In another fic that I read, the stress caused by different events caused Senior to have a heart attack or stroke, which left him unable to keep up the curse.
