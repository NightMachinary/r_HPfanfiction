If it somewhat follows third year, have Pettigrew Captured, Sirius freed, and Snape gets slapped with a heavy fine for lying about Sirius confounding them.

Have another Death Eater overhear Snape muttering to himself. They can go looking.

ORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR~ Have Crouch suffer a heart attack when he falls under massive scrutiny when Sirius is declared innocent, and Junior was going to be discovered. Junior can free himself then, since IIRC, Senior was regularly reapplying the imperius leading up to the events of the fourth book. It sounds like where Pettigrew went to when he escaped sounded like a known regrouping location for the Death Eaters and Voldemort.
