I agree I don't think J.K thought threw the Ramifications, after all why not use a snitch Keyed to someone to spy on them. sure you would have to add a bit of extra magic to help it hide but Snitch's are already pretty stealthy to begin with.

Or what about a Contact Poison on a Snitch.Add Poison and then just release the snitch in an area you know they are going to be.
