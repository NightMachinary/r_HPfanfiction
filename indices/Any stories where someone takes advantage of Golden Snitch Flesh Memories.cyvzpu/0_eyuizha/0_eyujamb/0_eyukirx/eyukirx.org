Idk if Snitches actively follow the people they're keyed to, I thought they just only open if touched the same way they were caught?

If you can get a snitch to track and follow a specific person, then you have so many ways to track, kidnap or kill that person, it'd take years to list them all.

Although if owls can track anyone the same way, nobody would bother using a snitch when they could just owl the target a hand grenade.
