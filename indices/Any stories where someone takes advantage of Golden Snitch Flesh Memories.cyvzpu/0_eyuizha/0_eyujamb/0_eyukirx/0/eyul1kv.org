Pretty sure the Opening when touched was Dumbledore addition. I don't Think normal Snitch's open like that. In my mind it more like the Dog test where they Put the Two seekers on opposite sides of the room and then let it fly to the person that it has a flesh memory of.

And Even If it doesn't work exactly that way in Canon whos to say that the Person using the Snitch couldn't modify it like Dumbledore did in canon just to different ends.
