Suddenly Lily appeared in from of him "what was that she asked" he caved quickly telling her what is was.

"give it to me"lily said and "teach me the spell you used to capture it.

"you want to keep it?" questioned Sirius in confusion

Not knowing that he had started Lily Evans soon to be potter down the Path of Tantric and love based magic that would lead to the fall of the Dark Lord that was currently terrorizing the country.

I am not a very good writer and suck at dialog but thought I would have a go at my own prompt although I tried to also keep it SFW.

Edit: If Iwas a better writer I probably would have mention how Flushed Lily was from the Snitchs attention and that it couldn't follow her when she apparated places.
