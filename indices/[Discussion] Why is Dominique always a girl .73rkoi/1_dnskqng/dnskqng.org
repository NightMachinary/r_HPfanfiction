I just always viewed Dominique as a girl, although I remember when Rowling made all of the Next Gen some people were calling Dominique, Dominic for a boy version.

But yeah as far as I am aware Rowling never stated either way if Dominique was male or female (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong). But yeah most people generally write Dominique as a woman, including myself.

So really I think either way is okay in fanfiction. Again unless Rowling has specifically stated that Dominique is male or female.
