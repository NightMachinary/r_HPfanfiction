To be fair, she is a blank state and the only time her name is mentionned in Canon is when she passes the Charm or Defense OWL (can't remember which one) at the same time than Hermione.

Later, Rowling said that she was a Slytherin, and member of Parkinson gang. I know that fanon loves to portrays her as a Ice Queen who is too inteligent to believe in Blood Purity, but few infos we have gives more credit to a bigoted girl who is just as mean as Parkinson. May or may not be beautiful, but Harry never ever looked at her so we don't really know.

As for recommendations, I remember some "Idiot Daphne" fics, like in linkffn(Innocent) , but she is just a background character in most so don't know if that counts.
