I'm surprised we don't see it more often. Rather that Harry discovering the existence of Daphne in 4/5/6th year (which is a bit ridiculous when seem to be less than 40 in their year and they spends half their class in the same room), I believe a bigoted Daphne that grow out of her view would more interesting.

Not only would it give a cursed lover plot (I admit to have a linking to this kind of scenario), but it also gives the opportunity for a lot of character building.
