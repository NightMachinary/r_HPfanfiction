While I generally agree its not that ridiculous. Harrys year has considerably more than just 40 students, the 40 we know of are just from some list Rowling used to have names on hand for when Harry had to interact with people from his year, it was not intended to be his enitire year.

Him discovering Daphnes existence in later years makes perfect sense, simce in canon he didnt know Theodore nott until they shared Slughorns class and he didnt know Susan Bones until they met at Dumbledores Army.
