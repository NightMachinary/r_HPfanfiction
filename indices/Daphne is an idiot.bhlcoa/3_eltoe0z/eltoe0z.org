linkfnn(13041698) What's Her Name in Hufflepuff, one of the very few self inserts I recommend, in which a girl over her head accidentally fucks up canon and has to be the heroine.

Daphne in this one... We don't know yet whether she's an excellent slytherin fucking with people or has been smoking that Greengrass as she seems to have more than a few screws loose. We do know Daphne absolutely loves turtles and hates being told who she's allowed to talk to.

Edit: Either I screwed something up or the robot is busy getting drunk, sorry bout that but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff][here's the link]]
