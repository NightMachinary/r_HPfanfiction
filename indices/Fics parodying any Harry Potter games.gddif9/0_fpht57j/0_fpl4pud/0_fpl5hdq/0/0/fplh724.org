Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (PS2). I'm pretty sure there was a convenient hole to crawl through that took you to a bathroom with Fred and George selling stuff for beans. Speaking of currency, Harry also becomes an avid collector of WIZARD CARDS which can be found in random chests throughout Hogwarts, Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley that can only be accessed via an obstacle course and using spells that Harry just happened to be taught 20 minutes ago.
