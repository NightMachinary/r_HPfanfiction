Dumbledore dies early: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Muggle Mess by DisobedienceWriter).

The only story I've read that has Dumbledore taking Harry's place at the Dursley's doesn't have him die; he gives up after a couple of hours. I don't remember the name of that one, though.

By the way, you used the wrong flair; "What's That Fic?" is when you're looking for a specific story. The one you should have used is "Request."
