"As with all things, Harry, knowledge comes with experience. If you will excuse my boasting, I must say that while there was a lot that Gellert could give, it was nothing that I couldn't take, though I will confess that it was not easy to take it all," He admitted.

"Really?"

"Yes, It was very-" Here, Dumbledore paused, seeming to think about a suitable turn of phrase. "Very hard.

He was steady and knew perfectly well the way to use what he had. After all, it is common knowledge that having a big magical core will not help you if you overexert yourself and blow it all in one go," Dumbledore advised him, his blue eyes twinkling.

"Nowadays, hot-headed youngsters think that duels are all about big, flashy spells and that you can end it with a few strong thrusts of your wand, but this strategy falls flat when you have exhausted yourself and your opponent is still standing. What matters is finesse, my boy. Finesse and endurance. You must make it last."
