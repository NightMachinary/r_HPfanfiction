There are a ton out there. Since it sounds like you're new, let's get you into some of the popular ones that meet literally all your criteria.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) - basically established the wrong boy who lived genre. Extremely well-written but abandoned.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) - probably the most popular regularly updating fic on this sub right now. It explores a lot of different aspects of magic, but isn't the best technical writing.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) - another extremely popular updating series. It does have fem!Harry and she is very OOC. But tons of magical theory and a very prodigious Harry.

linkffn(Victoria Potter) - this is intended as a subversion of all of the tropes you listed, but they still apply, just not in excess. Some of the best quality of writing you'll find in fanfic. Also updating somewhat regularly.

linkffn(On the Way to Greatness) - slightly less popular, but a lot of people like it. It has a distinct structure and writing style, but it's technically well done. Abandoned.

linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) - very, very rough and tropey, but gives you a very good sense of what most stories in this genre are like. Complete.

This is just the tip of the iceberg, and there are a lot of great fics that might not be as popular, but these are the mainstream fics that have pretty much defined the genre you're describing. If you read a couple of these and Google a reddit site search for for "similar to this" you'll find recommendations for a lot of other fics you might like. I'd also recommend the DLP library since they really are into this genre in general, although they shun stuff that's too over the top.
