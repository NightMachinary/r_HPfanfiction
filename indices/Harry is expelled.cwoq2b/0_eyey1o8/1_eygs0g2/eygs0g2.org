Just want to point out to OP that the Arithmancerverse is Hermione-centric and she's by far the most important character, though Harry does feature quite a bit. It's quite slow burn intially and has over 1.3 million words over its 3 parts, so getting into it can be quite a commitment.

Also just want to say that this my favourite fic ever. Nothing else comes close.
