Heroes Assemble! It's a post-canon, non-epilogue-compliant fic that crosses over with the MCU. At the start of the story, Harry's been traveling the world for several years, playing tourist after getting sick of the UK in the wake of Voldemort's defeat.

He decides to settle down in New York City and open a cafe but quickly ends up tangled up in the local superhero scene.
