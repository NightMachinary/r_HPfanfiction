The only one I can really think of from the top of my head is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw][Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches]]. There's plenty of diplomacy there, although some aspects of the world do get reinterpreted to give it more of a place than it had in canon, at least that's the impression I get. linkffn(11574569).
