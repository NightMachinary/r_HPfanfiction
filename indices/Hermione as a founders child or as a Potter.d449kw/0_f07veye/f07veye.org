The only one I can think of where Hermione gets semi adopted by Harry to gain the legal protection of the Potter family, even though it's just Harry and he isn't even pureblood, is linkffn(Patron by Starfox5), which is Harry/Hermione.

The only one I know where they become siblings through adoption is linkffn(The Accidental Animagus), but there it's Harry who's adopted by the Grangers, not the other way around, but while Hermione stays a Granger she's pretty much Harry's adopted sibling as far as the magical world is concerned.
