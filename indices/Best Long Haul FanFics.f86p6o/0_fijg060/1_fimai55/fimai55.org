I imagine for most people "long haul" would be anything over the largest word count section on [[https://FF.Net][F]]anfiction.net - 300,000 words. Any fanfic over this amount could be defined as long haul, I suppose. For me as an individual, anything that has a complex plot which takes a notable period of time to resolve. The longest fanfiction I've ever read was around the 3 million word mark.
