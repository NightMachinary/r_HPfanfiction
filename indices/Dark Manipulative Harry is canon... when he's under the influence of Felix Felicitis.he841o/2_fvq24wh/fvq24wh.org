On a completely unrelated note, there was a fanfic where a potions accident resulted in Snape permanently under the effects of Felix Felicitis, along with giving him a godlike physique, and golden blond hair. He then succeeded at everything he did, and was utterly miserable for it, because life no longer offered any challenge.
