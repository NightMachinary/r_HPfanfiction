I wouldn't call it dark and while he doesn't do it often he does similar things in other books. Some are:

- when McGonagall catches them without supervision in CoS, Harry lies and starts going on about how they haven't seen Hermione in ages. McGonagall tears up then takes them to Hermione.

- he pretends Sirius is a mass murderer to get the Dursleys off his back at the end of PoA

- pretending to pour Felix Felicis in Ron's goblet

And another "for the greater good" moment is pretending he'd immediately give Griphook the sword in exchange for his help.
