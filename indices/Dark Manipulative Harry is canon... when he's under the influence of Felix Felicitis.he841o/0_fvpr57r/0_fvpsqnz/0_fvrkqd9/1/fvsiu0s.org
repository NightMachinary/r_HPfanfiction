Yea that's kind of what the canon books discuss with that book The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, since Dumbledore's supposed to be the king of the Light. Finding out about Dumbledore's past makes Harry and Hermione get "disillusioned" about these perfect boundaries. They're socially isolated kids so their understanding of morality is pretty simple, but some adults think that way too when they idolize someone (Snape for Lily, everybody for Dumbledore).

Many fics decide that Voldemort is playing the long game and is staving off some threat of Muggles destroying the planet if they're given power over magic, kind of like Grindelward. If he's given "true sight" of these actual consequences then he's doing the right thing. But if he's just guessing then he's an egomaniac who's willing to throw away other people's lives for his theories.

I think "Light" morality, whether in magical or nonmagical actions, tends to firstly respect people's autonomy over their own lives. Like a love potion would be dark, a healing potion is light because it gives you back your health which gives you more autonomy. In the real world where most people already don't have autonomy, its more complicated.
