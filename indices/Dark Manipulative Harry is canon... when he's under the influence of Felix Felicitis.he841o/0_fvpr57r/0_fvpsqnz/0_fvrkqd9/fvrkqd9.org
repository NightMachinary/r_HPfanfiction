Am I the only one who hate this whole dark vs light adjective thing?

It used to be that dark Harry was “dark magic using Harry” and it sort of became “pragmatic Harry who isn't afraid of killing, using dark magic, or doing unsavory things to win”

I've also seen it as “sadistic, sociopathic Harry who gains pleasure from hurting or exploiting/abusing/manipulating others”

Now dark seems to be “Harry lies or manipulates” which is kinda ridiculous. It's like how fanfic would call Harry Slytherin for doing something that is reasonably smart. “Oh you're lying to avoid trouble, how very Slytherin of you” Yeah find me a teen who haven't lied at some point to avoid trouble

Light and dark are such senseless terms nowadays because 1) they've been overused and 2) morality is a lot more complex
