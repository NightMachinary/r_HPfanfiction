Well I guess that's a conversation about what's dark vs light. The Ron's pumpkin juice is actually a great illustration because Hermione is all shocked and offended "Harry I can't believe you would do something like that..." and Harry's like, "Hermione, you're a hypocrite because you confunded McLaggen."

The reason Harry's and Hermione's actions are "not dark" are because Ron's a better person than McLaggen and deserves to win. But Hermione's posturing and Harry's response clearly draws the line about things that aren't really within the boundaries of wholesome lightness.

His manipulations of McGonagall and the Dursleys I don't believe make him dark in the same way as Felix does because he doesn't really manipulate his "victims" into anything really out of their comfort zone. He manipulates McGonagall and the Dursleys into not punishing him which really doesn't affect their life much.

With Slughorn, he had a reasonable fear of Voldemort coming after him if he didn't straddle the line, and poor Hagrid basically got his generous nature taken advantage of thinking he was bonding with another professor who just wants money, just because Harry wanted to get Slughorn in a good mood.
