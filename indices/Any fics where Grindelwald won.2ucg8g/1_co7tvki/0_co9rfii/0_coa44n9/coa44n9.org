Ah it makes me sad when authors discontinue a story and do a 'rewrite'. Especially when the original story was good, and 40 chapters in, and you just KNOW the rewrite is going to get abandoned before it even reaches the first 10...

Maybe I've just had bad luck but I've yet to see a rewrite of a story I liked that makes it even a fraction of the way to were the original was before being dropped.
