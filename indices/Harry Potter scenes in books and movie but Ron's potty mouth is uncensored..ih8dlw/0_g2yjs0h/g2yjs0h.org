I like to imagine that 80 to 90% of his daily swearing were bloody, ruddys, bledings, buggers, bollocks and hells with the occasional wankers and pricks. Then, the parts in the book that are censured with stuff as "swore loudly" or "Hermione looked scandalized" or stuff like that I just translate those as fucks.
