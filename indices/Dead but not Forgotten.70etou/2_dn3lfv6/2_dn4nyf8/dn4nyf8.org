I remember Contemplating Clouds! Though I think I remember a somewhat similar fic as well, where Luna sort of accidentally-on-purpose used her influence on Harry to start dating him a little? Like, they started with Occlumency practice and she said something like 'kissing will help you concentrate and wards off nargles' or something like that, so they ended up dating eventually (though of course it did work fine).

Man, yeah, that's exactly the sort of thing this thread is for. You aren't left at a cliffhanger (no matter what the author says, silly) and you wish there was more.
