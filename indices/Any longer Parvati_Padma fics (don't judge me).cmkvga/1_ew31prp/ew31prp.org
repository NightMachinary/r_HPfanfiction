Well, I seatched that as a pairing at FFN, and got 4 results. Longest was 1k+ long. One was in Polish.

I then searched as not a pairing because some people don't list it. There are only 218 fics on FFN that have both as characters. Only one is over40k words, and that is a Harry/Padma/Parvati fic.

When it comes to FFN, think you're out of luck. Since I can't find it within me to give enough of a fuck to deal with AO3's tagging system, can't help you there.
