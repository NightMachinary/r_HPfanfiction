100% the best harry potter series on ff.net? well, there can be none other then the pretense series, by murkeybluematter. linkffn(7613196)

It is hands down the most well written, interesting, often witty, occasionally dark, but always exceptional series on ff.net, and is a MUST read for anybody with a passion for fan-fiction. (or if you familiar with Tamora Pierce's works)
