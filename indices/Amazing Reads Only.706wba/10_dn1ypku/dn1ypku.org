This is one of my favourite fics and another one (like After the End, which I still think is the best ever) that I very rarely if at all see recommended! H/G post-Hogwarts fic (AU post-OOTP) that wonders what would have happened if Harry thought Ginny, Ron and Hermione were killed in the final battle.

I think it's very well written and the characters are well constructed and eminently believable. Like After the End I think it's a very mature fic - which I think is something you rarely find.
