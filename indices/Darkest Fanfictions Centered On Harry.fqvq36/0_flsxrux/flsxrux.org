*Paid In Blood* - linkffn(9474009)

Severe AU. Stuff goes horribly wrong, Harry does a ritual to go back in time to prevent a lot of things from happening.

Anywho, the beginning leaves A LOT of questions, exposition happens when needed in the form of explanations or flashbacks.

Lots of drama, revenge, blood and guts, and feels. You will cry. You will cheer when the revenge happens.

Haphne.
