See, that's an interesting question. I find myself going back to my favorite fanfics all the time, but I rarely go and reread canon. And yet, without canon those fics would not exist. I guess it's inevitable that there will be this element to reading fanfic of "this could have been so cool in canon". The urge to fix things, or improve upon what we see as failings in canon. Fanfic is a strange beast.

There's one, I think. Prince of the Dark Kingdom.
