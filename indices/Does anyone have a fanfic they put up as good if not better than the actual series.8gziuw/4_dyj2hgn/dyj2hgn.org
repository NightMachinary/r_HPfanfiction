I would have to say The Arithmancer by White Squirrel, and it's sequel, Lady Archimedes. While the first years of The Arithmancer can be described as boring, the latest chapters (its still updating, but close to completion) are the absolute definition of the word Awesome. It is as good as the original, not sure if better but definitely on the same level.
