It's hard to compare as most of the great fics are single novels rather than 7 part series. There are fics that I believe did a better job in certain aspects than canon such as with world building or building up of the canon pairings. But I haven't found a fic that exceeding Rowling's plot and simple scope, which she had 7 books to devote to.

For me, there aren't many fics that exceed the series, but there are fics that fit seamlessly into the narrative as companion pieces, for example [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]] which offers a different perspective on Deathly Hallows.
