I think linkffn(The Augurey by La-Matrona) is better than canon in some respects m. At the very least, I think it takes the canon characterization and uses it well. Some might not think it's a compliment to say this - understandably, given all the nonsense that cropped up in HBP and DH - but this story nails the characters much better than the last few books and I find it much more enjoyable because of that. Even Ron, who by this point in canon was more often annoying to me, is kind of tolerable here.
