I wouldn't say it's better than the cannon and it starts off weak. But, I have read the Resonance series by GreenGecko several times. It's like the perfect Snape raises Harry story because neither of them get a personality transplant to make it happen. Also, even when Harry gets all super Harry there is still conflict and character development.
