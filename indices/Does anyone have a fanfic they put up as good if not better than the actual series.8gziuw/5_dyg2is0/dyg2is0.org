I guess MOR somewhat qualifies for me, as do a few others. (Don't hang me just yet.)

I have a /lot/ of gripes with canon because I dig consistent world building and well defined magic systems. I just can't enjoy canon that much anymore because I keep cringing at how much conflict is forced by making people act stupidly.\\
MOR fixes a couple of these problems. The writing and the way the story is told is really painful, but after I get used to it I don't really notice, and having at least the attempt of making people non-stupid or having people notice stupidity when they run into it removes a lot of immersion breaking moments I had in canon. To me HPMOR is a pictore of something absolutely beautiful and amazing... drawn by a two year old with crayons.

I remember a couple other fics that did the same or even more for my taste, but I would have to dig those up since it's a pretty long time ago that I read those.

Basically, I really don't like canon that much, but it does provide an elaborate setting into which to transplant characters as well as archetypes to modify and characters to transplant into different settings.
