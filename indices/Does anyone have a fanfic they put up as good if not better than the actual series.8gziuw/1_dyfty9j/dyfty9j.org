This is a very controversial question. I'll give you my /honest opinion/ even though I know many will disagree.

The only Fics I'd put on the same level of quality of Canon are the Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave and Hogwarts Houses Divided.

Let me explain my reasoning for the first. This is a 7 year, 2.6m word epic from over 10 years ago that still manages to not show too much age. It sticks with familiar Canon occurrences but changes them oh so slightly to really stand out. The creativity and world the author creates is superb. This is Slash after year 5, and isn't terribly popular around here but I believe it deserves much more recognition.

Onto Hogwarts Houses Divided. My reasoning here is simply this: the epilogue was unsatisfying. This story manages to continue the feel of the HP universe and usher us into the next era.

Both of these maintain a somewhat Canon feel while being unique and doing much more.
