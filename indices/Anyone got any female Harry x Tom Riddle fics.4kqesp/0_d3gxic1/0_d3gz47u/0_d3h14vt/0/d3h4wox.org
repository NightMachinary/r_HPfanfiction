These are interesting concepts. I particularly like the idea of him using Ginny's form. It would be an interesting idea for someone to dive into. Voldemort comes back as Ginny (keeping in mind that that version of Riddle does not have full memories of later life), and under the influence of Harry (and Hermione/Luna/other friends of hers), changes viewpoints some. Perhaps she and Harry become dark lords, but maybe less evil... more focused on changing the wizarding world then worrying about muggles or pureblood philosophy. Or maybe just as evil. Or maybe not evil at all.. maybe they go light... or something inbetween.

Point is.. it could go in so many directions both due to Riddles smarts/thoughts/ideas/concepts/drive now being in a female body, and the fact that there would be no true memories of the later form of Riddle (aka Voldemort).
