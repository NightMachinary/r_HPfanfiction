The library at [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net][forums.darklordpotter.net]] has a lot of great examples of the really successful, influential, universal stuff that dominated HP fanfic from 2005-2015ish and spawned so many of the tropes that people are playing with nowadays. We're talking Harry-centric fics that often play off subtle differences or a single AU divergence point. A lot of this stuff brings inventiveness and a darker and more complex take on the conflict, usually with some romantic subplot but still mostly considered gen. The library has all the "classic" fanfics except for those of specific shipping fandoms (with the possible exception of Haphne and maybe H/G).

Much of the stuff in this style is under "General" in the library. The other divisions are worth checking out, but keep in mind the taste might not align with everyone's and many of my favorite fics are in Almost Recommended or the trash bin.

A fair warning that the site's tone in general is rather crass, abrasive, and politically incorrect (more so than your average subreddit, tbh), so I'd stay off the comment threads if you don't like that kind of stuff. It has a somewhat sketchy reputation on this sub, but it's probably the best place to find what you're looking for.
