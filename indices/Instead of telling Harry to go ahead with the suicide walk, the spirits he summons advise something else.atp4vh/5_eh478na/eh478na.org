I read recently a story where each Hallow actually beckons the user to their death. The Wand makes them courageous, sure of their power, makes them want to fight and, consequently, to find themselves in situation where they can die. The Stone summons spirits/fake apparitions that lure the wizard to their death by appealing to their love for them. The Cloak instead encouraged its wielder to remain anonymous and stay under the radar, just do the absolute minimum necessary to remain alive and nothing else until they could pass the Hallow on to the next generation thereby continuing the cycle.
