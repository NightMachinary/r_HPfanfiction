But is there a /guarantee/ of an afterlife? Ghosts are just imprints left behind, the stone might have been created by a mad wizard and then misidentified based on the legends its spawned, the veil of death may be a similar artifact, and Limbo-King's Cross may have been a hallucination. Hell, we know that Dementors exist; whose to say there isn't a whole ecosystem of horrors that feed on the departed mortals?

Sure, there's evidence that the afterlife does exist, but there's also a set of circumstances in which all of that evidence exists despite the lack of a (pleasant) afterlife, as the combined efforts of mad wizards and natural phenomena in the mortal world.

I don't mean to be so bleak, but still, so long as magic is a thing, you can't trust your eyes and ears 100%. That stone could have been created as a trap - or trapped by someone after its creation - and could very well be trying to subtly kill everyone who uses it; no afterlife necessary.
