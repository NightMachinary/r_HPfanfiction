I made that comment to explain why Harrys ghostly parents might want Harry to walk to his death. The previous commenter has made arguments over several comments, that the parents must be faked by the stone, because real parents would never want Harry to die.

But assuming the parents are real, that would mean there is a guaranteed afterlife. And if that's so, it might be quite reasonable from the perspective of the dead parents to want their child to join them.

I agree with you completely in that from the perspective of a living person, the stone offers no real proof that dying is a good thing, and if I was in Harrys shoes I would not consider it a proof of afterlife.

But if the summoned ghosts are real, than it would make sense for them to want their loved ones to die, because they wouldn't actually be dying. They would just transform to a different state of being.
