Not sure how you can say that it isn't canon, just because it isn't explicitly stated.

Lily, when she lived, gave her own life without a thought for Harry's. Even the echo of Lily that comes out buys Harry time to escape. It is the exactly same for James - his last action in life is try and buy time for Lily and Harry to escape. Sirius, when he lived, well...he literally lived off rats to be close to Harry and provide support. When he learned that Harry had been lured to Ministry, he comes with the rest of the Order to try and rescue Harry, even though he's a wanted criminal with a Kiss on sight order attached to him.

After all that their real-life selves do, we have the Stone's versions saying shit like, "Dying? Quicker and easier than falling asleep," and "You've been so brave." If that is not them egging Harry on to die, I don't know what is.
