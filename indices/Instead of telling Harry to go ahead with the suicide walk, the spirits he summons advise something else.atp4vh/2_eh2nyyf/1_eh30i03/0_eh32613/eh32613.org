Right, that's my interpretation too.

The Resurrection Stone is actually a lying piece of junk that encourages its owner to commit suicide.

That being said, the hallucinations it generates can perfectly tell Harry to get some serious explosives, use the Invisibility Cloak to sneak up on his enemies, and blow everything within a few hundred meters radius to smithereens.

Afterwards, Harry's friends should have it easy cleaning up the rest of the scums. It's a pity Hagrid has to die too, but I think he will be understanding.
