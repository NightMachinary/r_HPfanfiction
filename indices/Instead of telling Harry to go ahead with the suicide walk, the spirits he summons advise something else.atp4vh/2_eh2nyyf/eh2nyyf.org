Yes I agree Hellstrike! It always seemed super creepy and disturbing that Lily, someone who got herself killed on the off chance to save her son's life as a baby, would appear before him later and then urge him to go kill himself!

That's why I do like the theory someone put here once about the Resurrection Stone enticing its users to commit suicide and that the "spirits" aren't actually real, or if they are their being mind controlled or something.

It just totally does not FIT Lily that she would do that to her own kid. She'd probably actually tell him to run the other way and go live! She died so he could.

I guess that's just more JK Rowling putting plot before character though? :( Like all of book 6. :( :(
