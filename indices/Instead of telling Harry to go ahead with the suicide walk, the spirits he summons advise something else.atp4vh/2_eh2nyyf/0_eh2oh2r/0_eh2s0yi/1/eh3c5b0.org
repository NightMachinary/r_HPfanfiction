But it seems very odd if a scared teenager suddenly reenacted 300. Because being scared shitless is in the way of efficiently slaughtering large quantities of enemies. If you read "To Hell and Back" or interviews with Simo HÃ¤yha, they aren't afraid during their most famous moments. Beforehand and afterwards, but not in the heat of the moment.
