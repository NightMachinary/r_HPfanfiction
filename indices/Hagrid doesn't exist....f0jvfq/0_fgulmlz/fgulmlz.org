You're dangerously close to my idea of a bad Hagrid fic. Something, something, magic comes from the patterns on creatures and plants' souls. Wizard souls have a blank pattern, but wand wood & core allow them to cast spells and through repetition, this carves patterns on their souls, eventually allowing wandless magic.

Hagrid is obsessed with creatures, not because he's a softhearted giant, but because he is obsessed with splicing their souls onto his and gaining their innate magic.

Don't really know where to go with it, or what the plot would be, but I do really want evil!Hagrid.
