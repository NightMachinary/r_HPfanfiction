Depends on what kind of relationship the owner had with the elf.

Hate -> vanish the remains, burn them in the fireplace, harvest them for potion ingredients

Neutral -> let other / new house elf deal with the remains, just put them out somewhere in nature

Love -> burial à la Dobby, mounted like a stuffed animal (some people do this with pets)

​

For Kreacher: he wanted his head mounted on the wall, so he wants to be part of the family even in death. So you could say his head is mounted on the wall and his body burned on the Black family cemetery and his ashes used on their graves or something.
