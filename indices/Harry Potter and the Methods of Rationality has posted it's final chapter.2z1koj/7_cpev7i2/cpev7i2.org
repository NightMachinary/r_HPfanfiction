Sometimes it really saddens me to see the hatred poured out to this story.

I was around when the Weasley twins sung the Ghost Busters' theme to Harry's march got hastily edited out, and when most people thought HPMOR was just some adventure/crackfic with SCIENCE!

It seems to me that the great popularity the story has achieved - and yes, questionable publicity stunts - has led people to look upon it as some kind of attempt at a meteoric work of art, and criticize accordingly. To these people I'd like to remind that HPMOR is first and foremost a fanfiction, which we love and spend much of our waking days on, and for that... well, it's more than good enough.

Also, many of the 'problems' people point out with the story does get addressed later in the story, so I'd like to advise people that suspension of belief is yet a reading technique. While it's never worth forcing yourself to read a story, there's no harm in giving it a try.
