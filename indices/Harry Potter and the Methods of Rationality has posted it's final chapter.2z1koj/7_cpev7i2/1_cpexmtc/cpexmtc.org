Why do so many people assume that if someone criticizes something then s/he must be hating it? This creates an image of a hateful person instead of one who just doesn't like certain things about the item they are criticizing.

HPMoR has its problems regardless of how you chose to view it --- in context with everything that comes from Yudkowsky's corrosive personality or dis-attached from it.

For instance, while [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/search?q=rationality&restrict_sr=on&sort=top&t=all][many people said]] that they didn't like the book for its preachy nature, that was exactly what /I/ liked about it. I saw that the author was consciously trying to tap into HP's popularity, but I hoped that the story would eventually develop into something that would be 1. introducing its readers to the scientific world and make them interested in it; 2. making its readers more rational by exposing various fallacies and misjudgements that our brains are prone to fall into; and 3. influencing its readers and people in general to be more tolerable and less hateful towards each other. I don't know how much has Yudkowsky changed the first chapters now, but back then the story [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgMO6eGi9VEhdEJLdmllQldjWTgwYld3SU1CLWpVWVE#gid=0][was doing exactly this]].

Then, alas, this story's Harry became a Mary Sue not for the sake of introducing and explaining all these concepts but only for explaining just how powerful, smart, and awesome this Harry was. Harry himself became rather irrational in those of his choices that mattered the most, making the story lose its integrity. Harry --- and story's narrative in general --- also became more and more intolerant of those who possessed less logical intelligence than Harry and his friends did.

So I think part of this “hatred” comes from disappointment rather than the author's antics.
