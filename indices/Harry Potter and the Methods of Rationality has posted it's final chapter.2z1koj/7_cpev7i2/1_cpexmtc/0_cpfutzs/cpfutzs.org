  Why do so many people assume that if someone criticizes something then s/he must be hating it? This creates an image of a hateful person instead of one who just doesn't like certain things about the item they are criticizing.

I think this idea that HPMOR has attracted hate groups can be traced to Yudkowsky. He's [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2n3yh5/what_is_it_with_dark_lord_potter_and_hpmor/cmad6x3][attributed]] criticism of his fanfic to "sneer clubs":

#+begin_quote
  Dark Lord Potter (I infer) aggregated as a Sneer Club targeted at Harry Potter fics they considered inferior, mated with a self-conceptualized elite fanfiction forum for properly dark, gritty, adult HP fics - the most elite HP forum on the Internet, or so they considered themselves. HPMOR came along and was critically acclaimed by mainstream authors despite not (then) being dark and gritty, and it was by an outsider. So the sneering club encountered something that seemed to threaten their status. There is also a common attitude that nerds are designated bullying-targets; or to write it out at slightly greater length, people who talk about science are acting like they think they're snootier than you, which is especially deserving of a slapdown since the person is probably just some nerd in their mother's basement...

  The natural response of a low-Dark-Triad non-bully who encounters HPMOR and doesn't enjoy it is to stop reading it, maybe with a small note of gratitude to the author for warning them in advance to give up if it wasn't fun by chapter ten. To /hate hate hate/ a vegetable stew and everyone who ever said they liked it, you need to have something else going on inside your head besides having tasted the stew and having said "bleah" that one time.

By referring to criticism of HPMOR as hatred, fans are just following Yudkowsky's lead.

My [[http://www.reddit.com/r/badmathematics/comments/2bazyc/0_and_1_are_not_probabilities_any_more_than/cj43y8k][experience]] with non-fanfic-related criticism of Yudkowsky is that he's quick to jump to accusations of hatred and bullying.
