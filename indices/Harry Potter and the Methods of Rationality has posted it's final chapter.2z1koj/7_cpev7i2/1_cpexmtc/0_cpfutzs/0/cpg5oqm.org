This is why I really should not read too much about the authors of fiction I like. I really enjoyed reading HPMOR. I don't think it was perfect but neither was canon. At the same time, however, I've heard enough about the author to make me think he really isn't a very good guy. It's sad really. Same reason I can't read Orson Scott Card's books without feeling a bit guilty.
