  Why do so many people assume that if someone criticizes something then s/he must be hating it?
#+end_quote

I mean, it's not like people are claiming that all criticism of HPMOR is hatred. I think the claim is that there exists hatred of HPMOR, and that there's a surprising amount of it.

For example, take a look at the thread "[[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2u2vhl/final_arc_of_harry_potter_the_methods_of/][Final arc of Harry Potter & the Methods of Rationality is finally underway!]]". Not a lot of the phrasing explicitly says hatred, but nearly every comment is critical of the story, and in a manner that doesn't come across as literary criticism. Some examples (all of these are from upvoted comments):

  The fic was horrible and the author is very arrogant.

  I hope it doesn't make the list of recommended fic on TV tropes.

  This is the best fanfiction news I've heard in a long time.

  No, really. *I hate the story* and think the author comes off as complete douche. It's just that I can't wait for him to leave the fandom and then we can all stop having to tolerate his legion of fanboys pimping this story at literally every opportunity.

However, to be fair, I have to admit that a lot of extremely valid criticism is unjustly considered hatred by people that really, /really/ like the story. For example, I think this guy in the comment thread for the last HPMOR chapter is likely to react a little bit more emotionally to criticism of the story than I might:

  Kind of a lengthy comment, but the ending has me emotionally charged in both good and bad ways.

  I'm crying, sobbing, even as I was reading and now as I type this.
