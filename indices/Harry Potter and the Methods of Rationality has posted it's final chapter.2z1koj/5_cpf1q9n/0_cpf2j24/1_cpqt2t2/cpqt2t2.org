Not /entirely/ true. They do have not only a friendship, but a closer-than-just-friends friendship for most of the book. It was setting them up for future relationship.

That said, I've only read to chapter 101 and am actively working on finishing this fic, so I shouldn't even be reading this in case someone ruins the ending. It's a LOT of reading to have it ruined by a random spoiler. :)
