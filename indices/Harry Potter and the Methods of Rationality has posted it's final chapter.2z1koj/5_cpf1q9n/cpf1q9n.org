I know that this is probably an extremely trivial question to those of you who have dedicated an awful lot of time to read 660K+ words, but I noticed the tag is Harry and Hermione. It's really shallow of me as a reader, but I really don't like like taking chances on fics that don't feature my preferred pairing.

I've heard what happens in chapter 89 and I was just wondering if that tag is still truthful. If it is I'll give it a shot.
