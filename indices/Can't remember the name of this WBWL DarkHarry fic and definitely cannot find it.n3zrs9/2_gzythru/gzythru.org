Hey, I'm not sure if you found the fic but, was Harry a black in the story ? Because I read one where Voldemort and Harry went to Hogwarts together but instead of being a potter he's a black and born a necromancer with glowing green eyes, It's tomarry but he's married to Pandora Malfoy who then Married to xenophillius lovegood and is luna's mum,

So when Voldemort makes horcruxes Harry does a ritual to ensure that he's reborn in 9 months as a child , But when he dies and doesn't get reborn within 9 months, Voldemort becomes insane and starts killing everyone but then his lover is reborn as Harry Potter with the memories of what happened in his previous life, but cannot recognise that it's him and so Voldemort tries to kill Harry as a kid.

If this is the story you're looking for or want to read the story I'll post the story link here

Harry's name is Ophiuchus Black And here's the link to the story:
