While this story sounds hilarious, I'm a little sad that it wouldn't actually have actually worked in the canon. There are apparently charms that one can use to avoid being located by owls (among other means of magical tracking), and Voldemort more than likely make extensive use of them.

Sorry I couldn't help with the search, but you've also piqued my interest in what this fic might be because it sounds funny, if implausible given the current canon.
