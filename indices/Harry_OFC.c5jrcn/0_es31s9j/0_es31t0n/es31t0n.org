#+begin_quote
  Twenty years after a falling out with the rest of the Marauders, Remus Lupin has completely cut himself off from the wizarding world and opened a restaurant in the muggle one. Unfortunately for him, his past comes back to haunt him in the most irritating way possible: his restaurant seems to attract the weirdest possible customers, both magical and muggle. Episodic, Remus-centric.
