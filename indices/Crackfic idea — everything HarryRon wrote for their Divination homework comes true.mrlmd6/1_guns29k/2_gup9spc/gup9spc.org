  Harry gets a blob like a bowler hat: the Ministry interfering at Hogwarts

What if Fudge didn't wear bowler hats? What would the tea show then, the British equivalent of a DMV form? Or if it still showed the same shape, would it still mean the same thing?

These kind of interpretations are always funny to me, it's all just really arbitrary pattern-seeking - but that's not even so much in reference to the books but life in general
