No tarot reader in real life does anything like what divination can do in Harry Potter. Almost everything that was said in Trelawny's class that wasn't Ron and Harry faking their work came true, often in the exact order and timeline it was mentioned in. The two people who know the MOST about magic in-universe, Dumbledore and Voldemort, acknowledge it. Voldemort, who obsessed about learning obscure magic and becoming greater than anyone else, had seen things in his life that made him */absolutely certain/* that divination was legitimate: Voldemort's faith in divination and prophecy is the crux of the entire plot of the story.

Likewise, Dumbledore was on the verge of discontinuing the subject at Hogwarts, yes, but in his own words, that's only because he does not believe it is something that can truly /be taught./ Dumbledore canonically didn't put any stock in the prophecy between Harry and Voldemort, he said himself that he felt it was a self-fulfilling prophecy. But he never stated the opinion that the art of divination was wrong or even unreliable. It is McGonagall who argued that, not Dumbledore.

Our own experiences with the art support both Dumbledore and Voldemort's opinions simultaneously: McGonagall is simply wrong. One way or another, the prophecy Trelawny gave came true. It was a real prophecy, and it accurately predicted a sequence of events that literally NO ONE saw coming: that Voldemort would be defeated, but not destroyed, by an infant. Voldemort was right to fear and respect the creation of a prophecy regarding him. Likewise, Dumbledore seems quite correct to suppose that the art cannot be taught. You either have the talent or you don't. Harry and Ron picked up tea cups on their very first lesson without having the foggiest idea what they were doing, and */accurately predicted the events for the entire next year, in the order they would occur./* All either of them needed was a single book with pictures of symbols and lists of meanings next to them, to effectively decrypt what they were seeing, and they were set. That's it. A person with the talent needs nothing more than a reference encyclopedia to accurately make forecasts and divinations of the future: someone without the talent, like Hermione and presumably McGonagall, simply cannot be helped. Likewise, true prophecies like what Trelawny occasionally gives are random and cannot be taught, either. You either give them or you don't.

Voldemort is right about prophecy. It should be treated cautiously, because it can be a serious danger to yourself and others. Dumbledore, too, is right about prophecy; it is not something that can truly be taught, like transfiguration or potioneering, and while we don't know if all true prophecies are self-fulling ones, the one that is central to the series most certainly is. Both of them are correct, their opinions are not mutually exclusive. It is McGonagall that is wrong. And that's the humor of it. Her opinion is the most prevalent and common one, but it is also the one that's wrong. Divination was giving answers to serious questions and spoiling the plot from the very start, but only the readers were really in any sort of position to appreciate that or notice it happening.
