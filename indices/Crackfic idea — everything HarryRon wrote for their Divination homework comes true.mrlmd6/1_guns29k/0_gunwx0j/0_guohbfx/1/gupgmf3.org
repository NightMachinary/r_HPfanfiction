I agree and disagree. There definitely is true Divination that cannot be taught and it manifests in the form of prophecies recorded in the Hall of Prophecies. IIRC Dumbledore himself points out that Trelawney's not aware of the two accurate prophecies she made. All the other things require a very open mind because those symbols could mean anything that you could correlate with a real event in retrospective. Quite like tarot cards or horoscope in real life. I would say that Hermione and McGonagall who are pragmatic and only care about clear information were bad at it because they refused to open their mind towards it. Dumbledore is more open minded than most characters but even he treats some of that stuff with a grain of salt. Like when Trelawney predicts that Lupin won't be with them anymore for long, Dumbledore just dismisses it, even though it's ironically true because of the curse on the DADA position.
