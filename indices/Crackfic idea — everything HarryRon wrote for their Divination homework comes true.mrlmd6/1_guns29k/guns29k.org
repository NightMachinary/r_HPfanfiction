That's not even a crack fic. It's canon. Pretty much everything that Ron and Harry ever predicted in class while they were trying to take the subject seriously came true. Pretty much everything TRELAWNY predicted came true as well. The first lesson in Divination spoiled what would happen at the end of the book

They do tea leaves. Harry gets a blob like a bowler hat: the Ministry interfering at Hogwarts with the Dementors, or possibly Harry meeting the Minister at the beginning of the year, establishing a timeline. The hat turns into an acorn, a windfall, unexpected gold in his near future. Harry gets sent a Firebolt anonymously later in the year. Next Harry gets the falcon, a mortal enemy is nearby. Hermione guesses Voldemort, but we know in hindsight this must be Peter. Then Harry gets the club, danger is approaching. He's attacked by Dementors in the very next Quidditch match. The club then becomes the skull, mortal danger. The Dementors swarming at the end of the book, and Remus transforming. Then finally the grim. Sirius Black.

The tea leaves in their very first lesson not only spoiled the entire events of the coming year, but arguably did it in correct sequential order, or at least roughly the correct order. In theory, the acorn should have come after the club, because he got the Firebolt after his broom was wrecked, but Sirius would have needed to start arranging the purchase and shipment of it sooner, particularly since he needed to do so anonymously, so the cup may have actually called out the "true" order of events, which is that Sirius was in the process of buying the broom for Harry before his Nimbus was ever destroyed.

Divination is absolutely not a hoax. It works just fine. Both Harry AND Ron have "the gift," they have it in canon. That is 100% real and absolutely true. Harry, Ron, and even Trelawny all have the gift of true sight. Only Hermione seems not to.
