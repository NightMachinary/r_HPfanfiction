York the biggest wizarding city.

Muggle York is far too small to be the county town of the biggest county. York is old almost two thousand years old and it's full of history. It was named the capital of Britannia inferior by the roman emperor Severus which just happens to be a wizarding name.

Yorkshire has magical places like the moors, the dales, and the peaks.

The Longbottoms could be from York.
