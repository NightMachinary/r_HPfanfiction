One thing I don't think I've ever seen is something I'd like to call "character-insert". Basically a self-insert, except you insert a character from a different franchise instead of yourself.

Most crossovers I see have the two franchises exist in the same world, for example a Bleach/HP crossover where Ichigo is sent to bodyguard Harry and kill Voldie because Soul Society owes a favor to their British equivalent. My point being that for the purpose of that story, Hogwarts and Soul Society exist in the same universe, but what I'm thinking of is something more like a "Ichigo wakes up in magical Britain and Soul Society doesn't exist here" type of setting.
