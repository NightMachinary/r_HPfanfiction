Here's one:

I was thinking recently about Mr Weasley's comment in PoA:

#+begin_quote
  "I don't care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet, we're no nearer catching Black than inventing self-spelling wands."
#+end_quote

It's a throw-away comment, but in fact it summarises neatly an important aspect of the wizarding economy: a lack of ability to automate magic means there's little room for mass production.

This ties in nicely with the likely small population of the wizarding world, and the relative simplicity of the wizarding economy as seen in Diagon Alley. Contrary to a lot of "rich Harry" fanfic, there isn't really any evidence of complex financial markets and nowhere near enough economic activity to allow there to be wizarding billionaires.

And so onto the "plot mouse": what about Nimbus? The brooms appear to be mass produced like Muggle goods, yet we know there aren't self-spelling wands. Essentially, each of those brooms has to be made by an individual wizard who has presumably been taught the Nimbus spells by the company.

And here's the thing: we know that there is a huge variation in magical ability between wizards, and that there can be huge variation even within a single spell. In GoF, when Harry first learnt the shield charm, it was flimsy and could barely stop a jinx. By DH it was deflecting powerful curses and covering large areas.

The logical conclusion to this is that different brooms within the same brand and model will have variations, given that they have been created by wizards of different skill, even though they are using the spells.

Now, Nimbus has a strong brand and reputation for quality, so they presumably make sure all their brooms meet a certain minimum standard/specification before putting them out for sale. But this does not exclude the possibility that some are still much better than others, depending on which employee enchanted them.

The "plot mouse" is therefore as follows: despite Nimbus' marketing stating all their brooms are equally good, it is generally known and understood that some are better than others. Within broom enthusiast circles, it is possible to identify via serial number or maker's mark the person who enchanted the broom in question, and certain makers have a reputation for producing brooms of higher quality. There is a small but enthusiastic market for acquiring top-level brooms, as well as collectors.
