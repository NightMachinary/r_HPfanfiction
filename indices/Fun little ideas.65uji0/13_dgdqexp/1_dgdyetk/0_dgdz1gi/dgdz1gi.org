I can see the problem here.

What I mean to say is that I don't know how to handle Cormac McLaggen reacting to what Colin Creevey is doing (given how McLaggen reacts to the DA at first, and how he reacts to losing to Ron in Quidditch tryouts in HBP). This situation is somewhat different, as I see McLaggen siding with Ron here, which could lead to fighting in the dorm between Colin and Cormac.

I'll go ahead and edit my OP to clarify.
