What if Colin had the courage to back Harry to the hilt in the immediate aftermath of that goF Halloween scene (ie: telling Ron that if Harry didn't enter, how could he have given Ron the chance to do it?)

Probably a few throwaway scenes, but it could involve a little bit of trust forming between Harry and Colin, if nothing else). Had a fic planned, but it's just been sitting in my brain for a while because I don't know Cormac McLaggen's characterization /that/ well.

Edit to clarify who I mean in the last sentence.
