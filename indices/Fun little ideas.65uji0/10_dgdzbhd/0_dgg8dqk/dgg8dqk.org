Everyone who has Chessmaster!Ron always plays up him being some grand strategist, but I want to read something where Ron's strengths are a bit more abstract and used more in his daily life. Namely, his talent at chess giving him greater consideration of the consequences of his actions (playing five steps ahead) and the value of his friends and those around him (knowing the potential of your pieces). Basically, and this is true irony in this fandom, make him a bit more mature than the other two. He can still be lazy and rude, but give him some forethought.
