While I covered the subject in Red-headed stepchild, I would like to see a story where Luna Lovegood receives the Diary (and one where it's serious instead of semi-crack). If you think about it, she's already the perfect candidate. She's ostracized and alone; she craves companionship and friends. Perfect prey for Riddle. She's also considered weird and strange, so anything she says or does is not taken seriously by anyone. Well suited for stalking through those corridors. I think it could fit into a lot of fics and would really change both Luna and Ginny as characters.
