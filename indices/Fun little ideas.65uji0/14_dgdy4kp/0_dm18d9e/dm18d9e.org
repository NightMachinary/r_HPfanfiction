The whole "sapient creatures break out into the Muggle world, wizards freak out" idea is gold. It's actually a full plot-bunny, I think, not a mere plot mouse. Maybe the Goblins could peruse wizarding law and find that the wording of, say, the German law against breaking the Statute of Secrecy is worded in such a way that it covers wizards and squibs, but not Creatures. They proceed to officially shift all Goblins' nationalities to the German Goblin Nation, and then start flowing into the Muggle world /en masse/, taking Centaurs and Co. with them.
