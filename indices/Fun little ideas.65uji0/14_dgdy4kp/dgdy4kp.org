My big thing right now is getting better at writing imperfect characters that don't automatically make you hate them. It's hard to write characters with flaws because they immediately either get dumped in the villain box or they seem overly unsympathetic and turn people off of the story itself.

Also, I'm interested in other sapient magical creatures and how they are forced to survive not only on the fringes of magical society where they are ostensibly acknowledged as existing, but the fact that muggles are EVERYWHERE and tech is practically better than magic nowadays and so how the hell are centaurs not part of society? How the hell have dragons not been discovered on satellites?

And, if magical sapient creatures were discovered, how would muggle society react and behave? Would this create a crisis in the magical world as well, especially if goblins and centaurs were given more rights and options in muggle society?
