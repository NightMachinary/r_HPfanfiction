Last one for now:

I have always been curious about the date of the passing of the International Statute of Secrecy (the 'Statute') and the creation of the Ministry for Magic. It is well established by now that the two are linked - the obligations imposed by the Statute necessitated the creation of a larger and more organised bureaucracy - but the dates remain curious.

The Statute was signed in 1689 and came into force in 1692. The Ministry was founded in 1707.

For those of you who are not familiar with British history, these dates are significant for Muggle Britain also.

1688 was the year of the "Glorious Revolution" in which Parliament overthrew the monarch King James II for being too Catholic and too French. They instead installed the Protestants William of Orange and his wife, Mary II (also the daughter of James II) as joint monarchs. It was a moment which essentially established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown, the culmination of a process which had begun with the English Civil War (1642--1651) between Parliament and King Charles I, which Parliament won (chopping off Charles' head for good measure).

Similarly, 1707 was the year that the Kingdom of Great Britain was established following the Acts of Union in 1706 (English Parliament) and 1707 (Scottish Parliament), which unified England and Scotland.

It is curious to me that a period of great constitutional upheaval in the Muggle world is mirrored in the magical world, and I wonder if they were at all connected. We know of at least one connection from the following WOMBAT question:

  In your opinion, which of the following contributed MOST to the introduction of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy in 1692? Choose ONE.

  a. widespread persecution of wizarding children by Muggles

  b. escalating attempts by Muggles to force witches and wizards to perform magic for Muggle ends

  c. escalating attempts by Muggles to force witches and wizards to teach them magic

  d. increasing numbers of witch-burnings

  e. increasing numbers of Muggles being burned in mistake for witches

  f. failure of Ministry of Magic Delegation to Muggle King and Queen (William and Mary) begging for protection under Muggle law

The phrasing of the question is convenient (since we were never provided with the answers to the test) because it means that all of the answers are true events, it's just that the question is asking you to identify the one which was most important.

So we know that prior to signing the Statute, British wizards attempted to have magic legally recognised in the Muggle world so that they could live in the open without hassle.

(But note also that the dates have since been revised, as the Ministry did not exist yet in 1692).

On to the "plot mouse", then:

The idea is that the English civil war spilled over into the magical world. That the conflict between Royalists and Parliamentarians, which might anachronistically and simplistically be described as a conflict between tradition and revolution, was mirrored by a conflct between the traditionalist Wizards Council which had ruled magical Britain for hundreds of years and a "progressive" faction which would eventually evolve into the Ministry of Magic. The Wizards Council would be essentially for the status quo of de facto separation but no formal divide between the two worlds, and may have in fact had ties to the Crown which gave them a vested interest in both no Statute and Royalist victory in the civil war. In comparison, the pro-Statute forces who wished to overpower the Wizards Council would thereby be natural allies with the Parliamentarians.

So the plot mouse is that the English civil war was the last combined Muggle and wizarding conflict in Britain. Both Royalists and Parliamentarians had direct and official magical aid, and the Parliamentarian victory was fundamental to the transition from the traditionalist Wizards Council to the modern and bureaucratic Ministry for Magic.

After that time the Statute prevented magical interference in Muggle conflicts, though breaches would of course occur.
