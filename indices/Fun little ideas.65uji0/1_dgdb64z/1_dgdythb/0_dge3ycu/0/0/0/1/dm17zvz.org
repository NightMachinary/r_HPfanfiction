Well, duplication is basically pointless for personal cooking. Y'see, Duplicated items spoil faster than their normal counterparts, so it means Duplicated /food/, being that food spoils pretty fast already, would fall apart within a day. Therefore, you have to have some fresh food already lying around to Duplicate it --- you can't just keep duplicating a ten-years-old meal over and over.
