fanon has a tendency of trying to nerf magic because it helps with some power consistencies, or helps the narrative they believe. Take transfiguration. Absolutely nothing in canon says that transfiguration isn't permanent, and doesn't change your object down to it's molecular structure, but we get a bunch of fanfics suggesting thhat transfiguration isn't permanent (looking at you HPMOR) or that transfigured items aren't made or real substance and gaps are filled in by magic.
