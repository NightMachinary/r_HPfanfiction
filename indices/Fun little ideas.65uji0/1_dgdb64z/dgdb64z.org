Another one: the Malfoys are farmers.

We know from Pottermore that the Malfoy family came to England with William the Conqueror's invasion in 1066, and that they were rewarded with land for this.

Amusingly, this means that the Malfoy family very likely do have the right to the title "Lord", as in those times a gift of land and the granting of a noble title were essentially tied together. Ironically, however, the Malfoys are Muggle nobility - the title would not be magical in any sense, as it was granted by a Muggle monarch. Which might explain why by the time of canon they don't use it - it would be a rather nasty reminder of their past Muggle connections.

In any case, the Malfoys have a large amount of land, gifted to them by William the Conqueror. The Malfoys are also very rich.

Now, the magical economy seems to be pretty basic. Most shops seem to be independent sole traders. There are a few well-known brands and products, but not too many of them. The potential for wealth creation is limited by the small size of the market, given the low wizarding population. So where do the Malfoys get such fabulous wealth from, given that enterprise and trade have limited potential?

The answer to me seems obvious: the land that they have. Traditionally, the landed classes generated wealth from that very land in the form of agricultural activity. Which is to say: the Malfoys are farmers.

Indeed, depending on the size of the land, it might be that they are THE farmers. That is, their land might be large enough to constitute the food supply for all of wizarding Britain. Alternatively, they might use the land to breed magical creatures or grow magical plants.
