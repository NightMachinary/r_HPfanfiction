I have always liked the fanon notion that wandless magic isn't actually wandless, it is simply less precise than a wand. If we look at guns, the purpose of the barrel is to give it more room to accelerate, and add rifling for stabilization. And if we think about it, a wizards arm would work well as a magical focus. Made of wizard bone, with a core of marrow and blood, surrounded by yet more blood and muscle. The wand basically adds the rifling, because it extends the amount of focus used and allows nifty tricks like wand motions to help influence and direct the magic. Without a wand, you can't do wand motions, and your magic comes out sooner than you expected, but if you are quick enough, you can shape it with will before it escapes. This explains a lot about the Wizarding world. Canonically, we know that Quirrel, Harry, Dumbledore(probably), and Lupin(debatable) all can use wandless magic. It also explains how other creatures use magic. Dragons for instance have dragon heart strings as a way to channel magic through their body so they are durable and can fly, and the vocal cords could be how they create fire. Wandless magic, which is very crude, but extremely powerful. House Elves do a similar thing, but they snap their fingers, while moving their arm in a way to indicate what they want done. Thats why wands are so important, because they allow the magical being to make their magic much more complex.
