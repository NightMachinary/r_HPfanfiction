This "plot mouse" was inspired [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5Gz7MeSbF4][this awesome scene]] from /The Guardians of the Galaxy/. Imagine if you could use some sort of Disullusionment charm on an arrow (or even a bullet) spelled to be very strong. You could use /wingardium leviosa/ to control its flight. You've basically got Yondu's weapon but even better as it's invisible (it needs to be invisible to prevent enemies from just vanishing it).

If you want to cast other spells while still using it, you could take a spider, put the Imperius curse on it, transfigure it into a bullet, disillusion it, spell it to be super strong, and voila! You've got an invisible super strong bullet that you can control with your mind while still casting ordinary battle spells. Would be very lethal if used properly, I think.

I don't know if this is super original (I think I saw something similar in HPMOR) but basically you could transfigure a wand into a tooth (or a strand of hair) and replace one of your actual teeth (or strands of hair) with it. When you're trapped in a Dark Lord's dungeon cell without a wand, simply reverse the transfiguration on your tooth or whatever and now you have a wand!
