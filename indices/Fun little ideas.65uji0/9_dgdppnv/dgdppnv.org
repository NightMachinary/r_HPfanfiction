I recall Snape's speech in the first class Defense Against The Dark Arts that Harry has with him as sole instructor (and not temporary, fill in). Specifically the part where he discusses how the Dark Arts are like a many headed hydra, forever changing. The hydra comparison is obvious, cut off one head, and two more appear. This, to me, implies one great truth: all dark magic (jinxes, hexes and curses) that don't count as Dark Arts are merely former Dark Arts that have been countered, and then replaced by new Dark Arts.

For example: The Body-Bind Curse (incantation: /Petrificus Totalus/) was the preferred Dark Art of a serial killing dark wizard back in /whatever date/ who would use it to bury people alive and could only be countered by Mandrake Restorative Draught (incredibly rare due to the then difficulty in procuring wild mandrakes), however it's status as Dark Arts was ended due to the simultaneous advances in Herbology (figuring out how to farm mandrakes) and the development of a counter-curse.
