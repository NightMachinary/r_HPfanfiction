I like the small plot mouse idea of someone looking through old year books or hogwarts a history and seeing all of these fun awesome looking extracurricular activities and wondering what happened to them as they don't exist in current hogwarts. I know my high-school had once offered at least 15 different after school clubs but by the time I was a student there was only band, foot ball, baseball, basketball and theater. It was sort of disappointing and there was no real explanation to why they stopped.

I know it's a sort of aside, but that's the whole point of this thread, small things that build the world.
