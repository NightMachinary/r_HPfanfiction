It's pretty clear that the Wizarding World is very into read and consumes a lot of reading material of different types (books, periodicals, etc).

I've been thinking about how The Quibbler (which by the way I like to think that Luna calmed her "looneyness" down after the war) becomes a more arts and literature focused periodical.

Along these lines, we could see how Rolf + Luna and Neville contribute to their respective research journals (remember Transfiguration Today?). I read a fic or two mentioning this concept and I think it would be a nice touch somewhere.

I also think about how in the USA we have a man called Bill Simmons, who is a famous sports columnist who went on to found a few famous sports and culture journalism websites as well as write a few famous sports books about basketball and other things. I want to see Ginny have this type of authority, with her writing doing very well, and having a developing fanbase and power in the journalism world.

I especially want to see her switch newspapers because of how the Daily Prophet continually pushes trash journo over her sports reporting team, and how she bolsters the rival paper because of her very public switch.
