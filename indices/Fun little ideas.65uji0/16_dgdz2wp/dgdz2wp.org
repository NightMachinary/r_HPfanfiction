I would like to see a few snippets on how Hermione and Harry use muggle writing utensils for their administrative jobs, with Ginny and Ron getting convinced by this "Muggle Self Inking Quill thingy" as Ron would like to put it. I can see Harry and Hermione shopping together for some stuff like this, with Hermione excitedly splurging on an expensive pen/pencil set (or Harry giving it to her for her birthday).
