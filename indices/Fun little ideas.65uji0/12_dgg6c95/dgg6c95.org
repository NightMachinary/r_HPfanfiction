That small crime among wizards is virtually ignored.

From what I know, and I'm probably wrong, the Ministry of Magic was first set up specifically to enforce and regulate the Statute of Secrecy. This later evolved into the different departments, such as Law Enforcement. However, according to the wiki, Aurors are essentially muggle military used as a peace keeping force, while Hit Wizards are essentially SWAT teams used for capturing fugitive criminals. This means that anything smaller than that - such as fraud, theft, vandalism, illegal potion use, black market trading - is of lesser importance, and thus not attended to by either. Normally such things would be the responsibility of the police, but Wizarding Britain doesn't have police; they just have a peacetime military.

One would assume that another department would take up the slack in that regard, but according to the wiki, the only department that would deal with anything smaller than what could be considered a felony would be the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts office. And of course, that's the smallest and least staffed office in the entire ministry, not to mention it deals with muggles and not wizards. The Improper Use of Magic office only, or at least usually, deals with wizards in muggle areas, as presumably that's the only thing they can reliably detect.

The only crime that might intrude upon another department is the smuggling of magical animals, and presumably the Department of Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures would only bother chasing things of a potentially volatile nature, such as dragon eggs. (Way to almost bring down the long arm of the law, Hagrid.)

All of this, combined with how easily magic can be used for concealment and evasion, means that the effort:reward ratio of prosecuting small crime that doesn't break the Statute is simply nonexistent.

This might also explain the level of corruptibility in the Ministry of Magic. Should a criminal somehow be caught by a ministry employee, and if the crime was not of an urgent nature, a simple bribe would be far more attractive if the employee knew how much time and effort it would be for an ultimately thankless task. Aurors and Hitwizards would be especially susceptible to this, due to a feeling of superiority because of their specialized training, as well as other, more pressing matters.

This also offers an explanation for Nocturn Alley. All the shops are a front for the criminal arm of Wizarding Britain - the Rogue's Court, if you will.
