Well, if she had been Riddle-talented I'm sure someone would've mentioned it, especially Dumbledore. She was talented, but I don't think anyone reached Dumbledore/Riddle/Grindelwald type of talented. So I'd say she and James would be a bit like The Longbottoms had they lived - someone who was renowned but not mindblowingly talented to the point of making Voldemort seem like nothing or make Dumbledore stare in awe. After all, Riddle was supposed to be a very rare and puzzling case of a prodigy.

I think her grades would probably be 4 O's and 4 E's with two A's or 6 E's. That'd firmly be in the category of 'talented' and someone who could easily become a healer or auror.
