Oh okay! That makes sense Bookworm! :) But yes I was more meaning about believability in fanfiction. Because yes like if that is CANON that Voldemort can do all that as a teenager, then it should be easily believable for a fanfiction to make Lily a talented magic user as far as grades and effort goes. :)
