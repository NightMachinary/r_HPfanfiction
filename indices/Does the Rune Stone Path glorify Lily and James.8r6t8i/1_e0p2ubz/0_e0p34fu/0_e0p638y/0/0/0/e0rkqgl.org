Yeah, but if we want to make her a super talented person then so should Sirius, James and Snape. Because these three were the top. But then that makes Dumbledore and Voldemort something akin to a god in the eyes of people. Because if you want to raise someone to a higher level then the already more talented ones should be raised to higher levels as well. Because these were canoncially more talented and /if you want/ to be canon-compliant then they shouldn't be reduced to nothing compared to Lily, as they are the overwhelming majority of the time.

So I think she was talented but she should also have weaknesses, like everyone else!
