Not to put too fine of a point on this, but its worth pointing out how incompetent the majority of the wizarding world actually is compared to savants like Voldemort and Dumbledore. Seriously, everyone thought an acromantula was petrifying people and maybe that Hagrid, a half-giant, was actually the heir of Slytherin.

Voldemort gets away with a lot of his activities because magical people don't really think to much about evidence or facts (for any number of reasons). This is one of the reasons only Dumbledore really figured out how Voldemort survived in 1981 (besides the fact that horcruxes are very obscure and dangerous dark magic with little apparent study material).

Anyway, the idea that Lily, or possibly Harry under different circumstances, could be fairly talented or even savants in a specific field isn't too far out of the realm of believability (if you ignore or stretch canon a fair amount of course). Canon seems to indicate that most wizards/witches have natural inclinations toward specific "sub-branches" of magic (ex. Ollivander's explanation of wands being better at certain magics). Like Harry in linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning), it is not impossible to see either of them focusing on a particular branch of magic at the expense of all other forms. Something similar to the Jedi Weaponmasters in the Star Wars EU.
