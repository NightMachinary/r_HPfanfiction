For God's sake she was only twenty one when she died, barely four years out of Hogwarts! How is she going to be a savant so early when Nicholas Flamel and Dumbledore literally took over a century for them to be that distinguished - Voldemort less than half. It's very common to make her their level when she was only that young. James, of course, is forgotten. Hell, I don't think she'd have even reached Snape's level had she or any of the Marauders lived!

Worse yet is Harry being at that level when he's only 17. Like I get being talented is nice but don't make him too overpowered. And /of course/ he's going to be more powerful and much more talented than Hermione because how can you make his love interest more than a trophy wife.

How bad is it for both lily and Harry though?
