  Is it actually stated anywhere in the books that having a wand good for something makes someone good at the subject themselves
#+end_quote

It's shown. James's wand was very good for transfiguration, a subject he apparently was very good at (according to Snape's memory no less).

  I think by now control over underage magic isn't that unusual, it's how you use it is what makes it unusual.

No, Dumbledore says it's extremely unusual, to the point of being unsettling, to control one's magic so early and without a wand. Arianna Dumbledore is the perfect example. She couldn't show those muggles the magic she did by accident. McGonagall wasn't controlling her magic that early, we are just told of her accidental magic; Lily was doing it consciously.

Lily is almost definitely behind Amelia Bones, if only because Bones lived much longer and was shown to be near Voldemort's level from the evidence Fudge mentioned. But there's little chance Molly or Dorcas were, at 21, on Lily's level. Unless we're picking a lucky shot on Bellatrix as aptitude.

I've given ample evidence she was either above them or no lesser than them.
