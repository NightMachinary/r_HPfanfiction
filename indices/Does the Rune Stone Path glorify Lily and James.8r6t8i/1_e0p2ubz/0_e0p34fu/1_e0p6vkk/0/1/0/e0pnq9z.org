There's no evidence Dorcas or Molly weren't as skilled as Lily - or her being more skilled for that matter - at her age. Molly was a very talented witch and there's nothing to suggest that she wasn't more so than Lily. So you're suggesting Lily at 21 is better than Amelia Bones when she died? Voldemort personally went after both Dorcas and Amelia. Molly bested Bellatrix.

If she had lived, her as well as Tonks, that long I would say they would have become like Amelia. But I think she'd be like Tonks when she died.

McGonagall did use wandless magic on purpose, it's stated in her biography.
