There's nothing to suggest Molly's aptitude at all one or or the other. Whereas with Lily we have half a dozen or more examples. And no, I literally just said Amelia Bones is much more talented than Lily. We know Bones could and did go toe to toe with Voldemort. Molly "bested" Bellatrix in much the way that Harry "bested" Voldemort as a baby: a lucky shot. Bellatrix is quite clearly shown to be laughing and thus not defending herself. That scene was quite clearly trying to parallel Sirius's death.

In her biography, it says she was inadvertently (i.e. not on purpose) controlling her cat and summoned books and such. Lily was purposefully slowing her fall and using telekinesis on flowers.
