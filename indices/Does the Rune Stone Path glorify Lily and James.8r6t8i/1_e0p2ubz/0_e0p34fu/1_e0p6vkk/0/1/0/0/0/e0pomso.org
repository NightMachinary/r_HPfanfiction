Rowling herself said she thinks Molly was very talented. No one can raise that family - especially Fred and George - with no talent at magic. She was also in the Order, although for what I'm not sure and was trusted on guard duty at the Ministry. She appeared to have an aptitude for potions since we see Harry hearing her tell a story about her brewing a love potion. And I think she'd have brewed a few potions in her time as a mother as well.

In the wiki, when you open the intentional category, McGonagall is listed there, controlling her magic as a baby, inadvertently, but she had a goal (like the toys) and summoned them. A baby isn't going to know what magic is, after all.
