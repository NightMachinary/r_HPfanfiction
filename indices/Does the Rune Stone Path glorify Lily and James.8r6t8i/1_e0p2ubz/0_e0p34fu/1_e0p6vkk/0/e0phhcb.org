I'm not convinced. For the fact we don't actually have concrete evidence. Is it actually stated anywhere in the books that having a wand good for something makes someone good at the subject themselves? Besides, charms is described as very light and fun compared to actually hard subjects like transfiguration.

I think by now control over underage magic isn't that unusual, it's how you /use/ it is what makes it unusual. For example, Riddle concerned Dumbledore because he was a little psycho child and was strangling bunnies before reaching ten years old, not because he had control over it! There are three Canon characters that have control of it (Lily, McGonagall and Riddle).

Besides, as I recall Hagrid says in book one that Voldemort didn't try to recruit her so very early.

She's nowhere described even as close as Snape. If she was that talented at such a young age I think Harry would have heard a lot more about his mother's talent because people wouldn't pass up an opportunity to talk about her.

As for Lupin, a lot of people don't consider the movies Canon. I know I don't.

Meanwhile, there's no reason to believe she was more talented than Emmeline Vance, Molly Weasley and Dorcas Meadowes. To me Lily, Molly and Emmeline all line up behind Dorcas and Amelia Bones. She's as skilled as Tonks, who was also 21/22 when the story started and an auror.

We have absolutely no evidence she would have surpassed Snape and The Marauders.
