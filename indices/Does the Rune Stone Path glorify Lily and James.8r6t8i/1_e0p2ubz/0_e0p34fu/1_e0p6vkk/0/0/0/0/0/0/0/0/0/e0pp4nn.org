My point is she's overrated. Yes she can have a wandless talent as a child (we have no indication of her wandless talent as an adult, but since the ones we know like McGonagall and Riddle rarely used it, I'm going to say it went away as she bonded with her wand and grew used to it) but she had an idea it was magic, just like Riddle. After all if you can do all that aren't you going to go 'maybe it's magic?'?

Anyway when I say she's overrated this is what I mean. A long time ago in a fic I dropped immediately she can apparate at fourteen, use no wand at all, the thrice defied was only applied to her while James did nothing but stare as she dueled Voldemort and bested him while the Order gaped, got all 'O's without studying and was the real Half-Blood Prince and Snape only stole everything she wrote down while watching her like a hawk, she can fly before Voldemort can all while she's only 21. Bested everyone at their own games as well and dueled Dumbledore and made him go like 'oh my god'.

If that's not ridiculous I don't know what is. My point is that she'd be as skilled and talented as Tonks when she died. I think that's believable enough and fits with what we know about her.
