Well, that's just up to our own interpretations when it boils down to the problem, doesn't it? Because you and I both have our own views that are both never contradicted by the books. And both are perfectly valid. But I stand by what I say: she wasn't the top, but one of the top and still perfectly talented and above average, just not remarkably or mindblowingly so. I still don't see how that proves she's the top since Sirius and James both could also cast the patronus and were very skilled at charms as evidenced by the Map. They might as well be the top too if we're going to apply the same argument. We're taking her talent as an individual, not as a group of people. We're excluding all other people just because she was good at charms.

So agree to disagree :)
