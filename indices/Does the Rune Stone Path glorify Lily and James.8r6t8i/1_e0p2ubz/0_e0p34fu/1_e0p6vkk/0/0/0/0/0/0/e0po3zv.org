I've no idea what Potion you're referring to. In HBP, when Harry does an excellent job via unorthodox means, Slughorn says it was comparable to Lily's intuitive grasp at potions, which he also compared to Snape. Calling that an exaggeration is just choosing to make characters unreliable for little reason. This is not about a character's morality (which may well be bleached clean after death), it's about their talent.

  Even James's Quidditch skills have to be exaggerated. Controlling your magic at a young age has no bearing on anything used afterwards. Dumbledore can barely use wandless magic. Voldemort shocked everyone when he did and Lupin was the only one who could actually use it in the books.

I don't recall James's flying being exaggerated. If anything, we barely know about it. Dumbledore almost outright says that controlling one's magic that early is ominous and very unusual in HBP:

  "surprisingly-well developed for such a young wizard and --- most interestingly and ominously of all --- he had already discovered that he had some measure of control over them, and begun to use them consciously"

Also, Snape and Quirrell also do some wandless magic in the books. Lily did so, in the books, before what magic was. The only other character to do so was Riddle, an ability which Dumbledore comments on being unsettling.
