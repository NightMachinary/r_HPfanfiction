Hagrid, Slughorn and Lupin say such about her. There's no reason for them to exaggerate in a consistent manner, we even /see/ her controlling her magic before knowing what it is. Slughorn didn't exaggerate his relationship with her, he simply said she was one of the most brilliant students he ever taught. In fact, he suggests she was fond of being cheeky with him, so its not like he pretended of be a great friend or mentor of Lily's.

As far as I can tell, we'd basically have to treat every character that praised another character as too unreliable to reference.
