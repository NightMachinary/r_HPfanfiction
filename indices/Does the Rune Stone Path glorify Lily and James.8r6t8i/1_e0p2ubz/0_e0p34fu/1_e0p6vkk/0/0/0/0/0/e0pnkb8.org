I don't consider the movies canon. Knowing Hagrid, he'd try to hide everything bad and exaggerate the good qualities. I never doubted her potions abilities - but if Slughorn said she could brew a potion that has to be brewed on a week in one day then that's exaggeration. Slughorn loved Lily. What if she was cheeky with him? He cried when her death was mentioned.

Even James's Quidditch skills have to be exaggerated. Controlling your magic at a young age has no bearing on anything used afterwards. Dumbledore can barely use wandless magic. Voldemort shocked everyone when he did and Lupin was the only one who could actually use it in the books.

As far as I'm concerned, her abilities in fanfiction are very overrated and way over the top.
