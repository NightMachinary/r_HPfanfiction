When I say she's overrated I mean by fanfiction writers and those tumblr headcanon people. I mean, is it really that implausible that at least two other girls were smarter than her in her year? I don't think it is very implausible. Like give her some competition (since the Marauders always copy her homework and stare in awe at her amazing magic in fanfiction and reduced to the very bottom... /shudders/) other than the Marauders and Snape.

I think you're underrating Tonks here - she's very smart and became an auror (just look at the requirements) but I think that's overshadowed by her light and bubbly personality but she's very deadly. So at the time of her death she's like Tonks (who was very talented and mentored by Moody himself) but I think if she and Tonks had lived they'd both be like Emmeline Vane - highly talented, takes a couple of Death Eaters to take them down and a heavy blow to the Order but they can carry on without her. So she'd match Bellatrix but eventually lose or win by a lucky shot.
