Since the normal course load is 7 or 8 classes, I don't think that works. Sure, I said there were a number of people, but we know Lily's wand excels at Charms, her controlled magic as a kid were all.charm /and/ she could do a corporeal Patronus. All three together adds up to definite charms excellence.

Animagus transformation only require a single potion taken at the end. The process requires one to say an incantation everyday until a thunderstorm comes along. That's a lot more of a requirement for Transfiguration than Potions. James and Sirius were near or at the top in transfiguration, which again matches James's wand. Wands seem to do this, likely it's part of how they pick their initial owner.

Um, I'm pretty sure Dumbledore picked prefects. At the very least he suggested to Harry that he didn't get the prefect badge because he (Dumbledore) thought he had enough going on at the time.

What I'm saying is that if she was top in potions (from Slughorn, it's very unlikely anyone but Snape edged her out) and in Charms (from the above examples, not just her wand) then it's almost certain she was near or at the top. And I don't see why people would keep mentioning it. The only time it was mentioned for James was once by Lupin. She might not have been the very top, but there's nothing I've seen that suggests she was just incapable of or clearly below Snape and the Marauders.
