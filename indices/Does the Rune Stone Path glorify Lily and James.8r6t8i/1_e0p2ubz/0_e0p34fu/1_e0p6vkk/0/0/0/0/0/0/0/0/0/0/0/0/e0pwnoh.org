It's pretty implausible given she was either the best or second best (to Snape) in Potions and likely top in charms (due to her wand and ability to do a corporeal Patronus), as well as her being Head Girl (academic achievement is a large factor in who gets that position). James, Sirius and Snape at the least were known to be near the top (if not the top, according to Lupin), so I doubt anyone else was above her.

I don't think I'm underestimating Tonks, she's strong and talented. It's just we know a lot more direct things about Lily's talent, whereas we have to go indirect to get Tonks's.
