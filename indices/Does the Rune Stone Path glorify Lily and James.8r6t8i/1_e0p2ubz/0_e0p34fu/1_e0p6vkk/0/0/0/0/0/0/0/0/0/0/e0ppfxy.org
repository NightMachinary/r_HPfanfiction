How is she overrated? I just said she was highly talented, hardly obviously below the Marauders or Snape given canon. McGonagall did not control her underage magic, it was stated to be accidental. In canon, Snape had to tell her it was magic, she didn't understand the thing she was doing, she just controlled it.

Well, ok, fanfic authors do lots of silly things. I never said Lily could do all those things. :P But from what we saw and we're told, she was almost definitely above Tonks. Had she lived, my guess is she'd be around the level of maybe Bellatrix (who was supposed to be the strongest Death Eater)
