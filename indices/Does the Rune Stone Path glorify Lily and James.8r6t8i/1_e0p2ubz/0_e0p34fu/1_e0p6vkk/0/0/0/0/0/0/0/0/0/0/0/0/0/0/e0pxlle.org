My point was that if you're the top or near the top in two classes, it's very unlikely anyone else (besides the mentioned Marauders and Snape) could be above you. You'd basically have to think she bombed her other classes, which is doubtful. Also, the point about the Patronus is simple. James's wand is known to be good for transfiguration. This hints at a natural talent for it, which is verified by how young he managed to become an animagus. Similarly, Lily's wand is good at charms, and all of Lily's controlled magic before Hogwarts were charms. Her casting a corporeal Patronus (which, btw, only a few in the DA managed, not most) is proof of that. Also, according to Rowling, a corporeal Patronus is an indicator of superior magic ability.

It's not impossible but it's implausible. As an example, Draco was a known blood purist and son of a Death , yet he was made Prefect strangely enough. Would he have been Head? No clue, but it's not a complete disqualification. Lily was stated and shown in numerous ways to be exceptional at magic and near the top of her class, so I don't see it as unreasonable to suggest what I have previously.
