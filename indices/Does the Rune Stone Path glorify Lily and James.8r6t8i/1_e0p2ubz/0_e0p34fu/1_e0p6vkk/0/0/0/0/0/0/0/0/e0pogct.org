My point is the Potion example is completely nonsensical and thus isn't a real comparison to canon, where her talent is simply praised.

No, Snape told her it was magic. Before, she just said "Tuny, look what I can do!"

No, she had an ability that Dumbledore said is very unnatural because kids shouldn't be able to control their magic that early and without a wand. It's talent.

Who said James was legendary? Again, i just remember a brief reference by McGonagall saying "You're father was quite good on a broom too."
