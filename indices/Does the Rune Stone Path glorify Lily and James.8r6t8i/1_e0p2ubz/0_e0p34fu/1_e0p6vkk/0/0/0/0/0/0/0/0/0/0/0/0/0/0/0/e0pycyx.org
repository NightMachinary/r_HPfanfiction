She really wouldn't have to be bomb her other classes to be the third girl in her year! I can see her having 3 O's 4 E's and 3 A's and that would firmly place her in the top ten. Yeah, but Harry, Ron, Hermione, Cho, Seamus, Ernie, Luna and Ginny can cast a patronus. That's a lot of people. Funnily enough, becoming an Animagus requires more of a talent in potions than transfiguration. The only bit of actually transforming is the final achievement but you need to make the Animagus potion fit it. So Sirius and James might as well have been right behind Lily and Snape in potions class.

But Draco was made a prefect by Snape and Slughorn was the head at that time. Slughorn wasn't that biased. And Dumbledore would never put a blood purist on top.

Lily was repeatedly said to be one of the top in potions, not the top of the class. I'm sure, had she been, we would have known since no one passed an opportunity to tell Harry all about how awesome his parents were. I think it's plausible enough that she wasn't the very top.
