Not really, no. Only Hagrid and Slughorn describe her as smart and only McGonagall and Lupin describe James as such. You also need to take into account that they're talking, especially Hagrid (except McGonagall) about their orphaned son whom they died to save. They're famous and very young war heroes and of course they're going to be exaggerated in front of their son. Slughorn is also very fishy and will likely exaggerate his relationship with Lily because when she died she became famous for being the mother of Harry Potter.

I think he liked her but she didn't. He jumps at every opportunity to gain recognition and of course he's going to jump on the chance to be connected to Harry via Lily, who he liked.

It's only natural both she and James are going to be exaggerated and you have to take everything said by a grain of salt.
