Just because her wand was good for charms doesn't mean she was the top. She's not the only one there, you know. All the Marauders (except maybe Peter) and Snape can cast a patronus. So it's not implausible others didn't as well. Most of the DA could cast a patronus. Maybe someone else had a wand good for charms too. Doesn't mean she was the top.

Besides, being head girl requires more than good grades. I mean, I can't see a brilliant but lazy girl or a blood purist as head girl. Can you? Or a genius at magic that's a bad role model for kids. So I think giving her some competition since we know nothing about the students in her year is very plausible. I see her as the top five, with two below her and two above her. So the third girl in her year.
