I haven't read the story in question but

  Hell, I don't think she'd have even reached Snape's level had she or any of the Marauders lived!

I doubt this. Slughorn at the very least suggested Lily was Snape's equal in Potions and given her wand's aptitude at charms and her apparent ability to control her magic without a wand as a kid (something only Riddle is shown to have done), I have a hard time thinking she didn't (or would never) surpass the Marauders and Snape. Lupin, for instance, refers to her as a "singularly gifted witch" and Voldemort wanted to recruit her (before the Prophecy) despite being a Muggleborn, so her potential ceiling appears to have been very high.
