I'm quite certain that James is not bashed. It was more of an "we shouldn't have married" situation where he was trying too hard to make things work.

Don't remember much about Ron, but I think they simply don't get along well since Harry is way more academic, or rather Rune obsessed, than in canon. But take that with a pinch of scepticism, since I really don't remember his part in the story.
