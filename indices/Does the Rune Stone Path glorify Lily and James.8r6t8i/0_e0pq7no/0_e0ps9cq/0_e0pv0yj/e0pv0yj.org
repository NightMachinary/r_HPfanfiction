More the second. Harry is smart at Runes, perhaps the best one in the entire universe. He tries to replace everything with Runes and succeeds more often than not. But it has its drawbacks. He gets cocky, he neglects other branches of magic, it makes him vulnerable at times.

Lily is interesting. In some ways, she is a broken person. She has been through some bad shit, her relationship with James was failed at the end. She is smart, but nowhere near as bad as your average OP!Harry.
