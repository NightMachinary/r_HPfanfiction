Rune Stone Path does a lot of stuff right. The mentor/adoptive mother relationship with Shiva was a joy to read and I would wish to see more like that. The whole resurrection of Lily and the resulting conflict/slow acceptance from Harry was also rather good. The story does not glorify James, if anything it throws some shade his way. Lily is shown as smart, but not flawless.

It is the best harem story around, but it would have been a lot better without the inclusion of Daphne Greengrass or the whole pureblood contract/consort thing. Fleur and Tonks make a decent couple on their own in the story, so it is not just Harry/arm candy, but having the two couples (Harry/Hermione and the aforementioned FD/NT) grow slowly together instead of centred around Harry would have been a huge improvement.
