I love Slytherin Harry/dark Harry stories but so many of them are so bad and tropy

what i love: a darker Harry who is actually somewhat changed by all the bad things that happens to him.\\
I think it‘s realistic that you don‘t Just walk away from 10 years of neglicene and borderline abuse. Even if you manage that somehow, there is also the point of being nearly killed five times at age eleven, shunned and again nearly killed at age twelve, hearing your parents die a whole year while thinking your parents traitor is after you only to be nearly killed by a werewolf and nearly lose your soul... and that‘s literally the better half of Harrys Hogwarts years. I like Dark!Harry Fanfics because they actually adress all the sh* that happens to him.

What i hate: Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin and whats not; bashing of the good guys/ apologicing the bad guys; out of character without plot explanation (you can change a character in your ff - but it needs time and reason that fits with the original character); „friend of the goblin nation“; unexplained OP Harry (you can make him stronger than canon - but I want a in world reason for it that isn‘t some Deus-Ex-Machina bullsh*)
