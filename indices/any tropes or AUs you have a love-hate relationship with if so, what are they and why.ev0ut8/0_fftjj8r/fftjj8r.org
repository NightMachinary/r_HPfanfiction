Love: time travel fix-its, raised by others, alternative sortings and day 0 AUs

Hate: power wanks, lord everything-under-the-sun, main characters being dickish assholes

I'm rather forgiving about bashing etc as long as it stays entertaining. If it's just there because the writer hates the character... probably not. But if it has a purpose in the plot or is just funny? Then sure.
