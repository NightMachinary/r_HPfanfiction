It was about 98/99. A friend got me into watching Pokemon. A few altavista searches later led me to some fan site that had stories posted. Heck yeah, I wanted some pokemon stories! I thought they official stories but halfway through the first one I realized the main character had the same name as the author. The fic was something about Ash going to Lavender Town to talk to the ghost of his dead pokemon.

Pokemon fandom led me to the Digimon fandom. Then I hopped around other anime fandoms a bit(cardcaptor sakura, gundam wing) before finally finding the Harry Potter fandom around early 2001.

I don't remember much about the first HP fic I read except it was a shitty Harry/Hermione fic where Hermione was the prettiest girl in Hogwarts and the American foreign exchange student was like, so jelly, of her.
