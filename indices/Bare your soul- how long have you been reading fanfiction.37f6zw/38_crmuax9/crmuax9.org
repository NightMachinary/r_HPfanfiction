My fanfic account says it was created Oct. 2006, but I remember reading it long before I got around to creating an account and writing myself. So at least 10 years I'd say? It was right around the time HBP was released because I remember authors had to mark their stories for spoilers if they were using new information or 'pre-HBP' as there were a lot of existing stories where people tried to come up with their own 6th / 7th year stories.

I can't remember the first fanfic I ever read, but I know I started at mugglenet. I used to go there for news on the upcoming books / movies and eventually ran into their fanart/fanfic community.
