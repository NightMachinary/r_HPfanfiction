2003 was when I started, the exact day after the HPOTP book release. I was randomly searching HP stuff and came across a site that was hosting a competition for fanfiction (wasn't called that, it was just called stories written in the HP universe) about HP & co going back in time and meeting the marauders. It stands out in my mind because there was a side bar listing people who had finished the book in record time. I remember thinking "it took you 24 hours to finish? Pfft, slow".

Granted, I was a recent college grad and unemployed, so I really had nothing /to do/ but read the book, so I wasn't exactly being fair in my head.

I can't remember the exact stories at all, and honestly they were all rather shit now that I think about it. I was just so new that the idea of /more/ was amazing to me.
