Oh gosh, since 2002. I was in fifth grade, and my dad was just starting to let me go on the Internet unsupervised. It was on his computer, so I could only be on it when he wasn't busy with something. But fanfiction opened up a whole new world for me. I started writing as soon as that happened. Prior to that, it hadn't dawned on me that you could write your own stories, even though I had been making up "what happens next" scenarios in my head for a while.
