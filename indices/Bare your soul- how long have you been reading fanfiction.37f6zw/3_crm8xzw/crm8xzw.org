I'm a newbie compared to all you other posters. My first ones I know for sure are Make A Wish/robststuff in the summer of 2013 on holiday to France. Used to buy 15 minutes of internet on the camping computer and then open as many tabs as I could to read for much longer than those 15 minutes. Before that I'm pretty sure I'd read HPMOR, maybe stuff like Nightmares of Future's Past.
