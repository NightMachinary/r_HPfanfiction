I started reading fanfiction in mid-September 2013, and I started with one where the HP characters read the HP series when published (I don't remember the exact title, nor the author, but it was soon after taken down). I then delved exclusively into H/G fics, which is probably 99% of what I read lol. My first H/G fic that I read was complete crap however...
