September or October of 2006. It was my first semester of college (and the first time I had my own computer) and my roommate was a rabid HP fan. She said, "Just don't read any Hermione/Snape stories. Ugh." So of course I read the first one I came across. I liked it (I wish I could remember what it was!) and read almost nothing else for ages. I've read literally thousands of HG/SS stories, of variable quality. It's only been in the last two or three years that I've started branching out to other pairings/genres.
