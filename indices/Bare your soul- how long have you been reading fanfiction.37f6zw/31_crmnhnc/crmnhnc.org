It must have been...2009? I was sent a link to a fic by a Twilight-obsessed friend. I don't think the fact that there were thousands of 'what if' stories out on the web, just waiting to be read, had ever occurred to me before. I hadn't long gotten a proper internet connexion, anyway. Still, needless to say the Twilight fic horrified me as much as the original books had, but I quickly found that FFnet was huge, and full of Harry Potter fics, which were far more to my liking.

Other than when completely necessary (you know, food, school/uni, sleep (/sometimes/)), I have barely left my computer in the last six years. The level of devotion I have to fanfiction's sad, really, but an awful lot cheaper than buying books that I'm not even sure I'm gonna enjoy (which is what I did previously--more expensive than a crack habit, that).
