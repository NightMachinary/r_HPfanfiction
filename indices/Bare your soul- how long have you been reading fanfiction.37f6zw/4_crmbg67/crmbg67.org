Late May 2011. I read all the books and watched all the movies when they came out but never played the videos games.

I bought copies of all 8 games and decided to play through them all. Most of them sucked. CoS and OoTP were okay, PoA was pretty good.

When I was done I felt sad because I had just hit what I felt was the end point of original Harry Potter content. Enter Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness. Its been a long, slippery slope since the day I started that.
