My first fan fic was in 2006 and was [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-8077/Naitch+Star+Wars-+Episode+III+Revenge+of+the+Witch.htm][Star Wars- Episode III: Revenge of the Witch]] after a search for just what happened on Cato Neimoidia that Anakin teases Obi-Wan about in Ep III. I saw that Google's excerpt of the text included something said by Buffy (who I knew next to nothing of), and was curious enough to click and was hooked from then on.
