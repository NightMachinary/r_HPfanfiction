I'm also a newbie and only started in early 2013. I grew up in a very conservative Christian home that looked down on the series and didn't even read the books until the last movie came out. I read through all the books and watched all the movies. Then, after I was dissatisfied with the ending of another series of books, I happened across a much better ending online. I thought, "What the heck, if I enjoyed this fanfiction, I might like others." I tried a couple of terrible stories close to canon before getting hooked on some H/Hr stuff. I've been on a bit of a tear ever since.
