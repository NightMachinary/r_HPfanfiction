The first fanfic I ever read was a Sailor Moon fic back in like 1996/97. It didn't make an impression on me so I didn't read any others.

I picked up fanfiction again after all that time after watching Star Trek into Darkness in Jan 2013. I read a lot of Spock/Uhura stuff and later Kirk/Uhura.

I came to the Harry Potter fandom in mid 2013 after running out of Kirk/Uhura stuff to read (they are a rare pair) and have been reading HP fanfiction everyday ever since.
