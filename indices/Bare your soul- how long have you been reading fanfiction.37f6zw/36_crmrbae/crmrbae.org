April or May 2003, my sister had gotten me into Harry Potter about a year before, and by then I had already read the four books 3 times. I was pirating some music on Imesh and looked up Harry Potter. I found a Word document called Harry Potter 5 and started reading it. It was actually Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent by Barb, you can find it here:
