(I think I'm telling the truth) Summer of 2000, neighbor kids printed out a fanfiction and shared it with me. Titled /Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix/ of course. Turns out Dumbledore was evil too. Everyone had Animagus forms. I never got to read the end.

It was really weird and I'm not sure why it didn't put me off fanfiction forever.
