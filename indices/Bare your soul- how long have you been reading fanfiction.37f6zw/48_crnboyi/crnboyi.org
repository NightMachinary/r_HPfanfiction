I started with fanfics just 3 or 4 months before HBP came out. It was one in spanish "Harry Potter y la antorcha de la llama verde", a sixth year fic and it's sequel "Harry Potter y Las dos camaras". First english one was an AU about Harry being adopted by a lady (i think her name was Daphne), and ending up in slytherin; they were up to book five in the series around 2007, but i can't find it, and it would be real good to read them again. If any one knows which one i'm talking about please hook me up with the link!
