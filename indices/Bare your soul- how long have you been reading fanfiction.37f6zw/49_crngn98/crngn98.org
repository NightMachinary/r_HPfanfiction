It was late 2008, and my chosen fandom was Evangelion. The fic was [[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4140913/1/Orchestrating-the-Silence]]] Orcestrating the Silence, which still stands as one on the greatest evangelion fics of all time. A must read, and the most realistic post-Third Impact fic I have ever read.
