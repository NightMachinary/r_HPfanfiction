Not too long, I fear, compared to the others here.

2007, "leaked" Deathly Hallows. Reading it made it clear it wasn't actually a leaked Deathly Hallows, but it was fun regardless. Turns out, it was Melindaleo's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/The-Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]].

After that, I wanted to read more alternate Harry Potter stuff, and I found fanfiction. The rest, as they say, is history! :D
