I don't remember the exact year but my entry to Fanfiction was on gamefaqs when KholdstareV wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4270777/1/Road-to-Nowhere][this Mario Kart fic]]. There was also a good Metroid one that seems to be deleted :(

My entry into Harry Potter Fanfiction was one of those terrible "reading the books" fics by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1847346/jlmill9][jlmill9]] which have since been deleted. I remember liking jlmill9's version because all the books eventually got completed instead of the author giving up halfway through the second book. I eventually discovered The Lie I've Lived which pretty much ruined my ability to stomach reading the terrible quality Fanfiction I had been reading up until that point.
