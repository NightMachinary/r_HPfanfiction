Since shortly after Deathly Hallows part 2 came out on DVD/TPB. So 3-4 years?

I've already mentioned that the [[http://imgur.com/aJGLBHz][last shot]] of that final film got me thinking about Harry and Hermione as the camera zooms in to the two of them leaving Ron and Ginny to the sides. I'd never thought that the two of them should end up together while reading canon, but the film made me curious. So I googled 'Harry and Hermione,' found a [[http://www.harryloveshermione.com/][fan site]] which led me to one of [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=809&chapterid=&agree=1][KateJ's fics]].

To be honest, I really didn't like the last three books. If there hadn't been a community of ardent H/Hr supporters, I wouldn't have given this fandom a second thought. I'm very glad to have found it, though. It's quite an interesting genre of derivative work IMO.
