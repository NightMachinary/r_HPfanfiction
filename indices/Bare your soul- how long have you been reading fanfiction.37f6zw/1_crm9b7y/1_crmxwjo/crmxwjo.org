I was 98/99 too. We need to start an old-timers club apparently. Only 90s fandomers can join.

GW was around 00/01 for me though. I remember always being on the lookout for 1x2 and 3x4 lemon and lime fics. God, those are phrases I haven't thought about in so long. Please tell me I'm not the only one who remembers when fics were called lemons?
