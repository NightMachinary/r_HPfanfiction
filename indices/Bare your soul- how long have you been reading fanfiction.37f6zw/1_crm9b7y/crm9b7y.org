Y'all are making me feel old, jeez. Probably around '98, and I think it was Gundam Wing fic. I read a lot of Gundam Wing/Sailor Moon crossovers that neatly paired off the pilots with the senshi. Thinking back on it, that's hilarious, because I've never seen two characters as ill-suited as Tsukino Usagi and Heero Yuy.
