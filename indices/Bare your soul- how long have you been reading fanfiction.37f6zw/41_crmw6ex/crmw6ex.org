I believe the first real fanfic I read was Velvethope's "Seventeen, Clumsy, and Shy." I don't remember what year that was...early 2000's I think?? I read it at the time it was published. I know the author retired some years ago so I don't know if the story is still floating around out there somewhere. A quick Google search just said no, but I didn't have time to really look into it.
