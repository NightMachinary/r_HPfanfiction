I think it was ages go, like just after the GOF novel came out. I was just Googling (probably with AOL search or DogPile as it was so long ago and on dialup) and I found ffnet. I looked around and I know the first thing I clicked on was a post-Hogwarts or non-magic AU where everyone was underwear models. I didn't understand anything fanon at the time so words like “Slash” meant nothing to me. Then it turned into a very hardcore (pre-purge) Drarry and I left the site for a while because I was very, very young. I came back at the time of OoTP and started consuming mass quantities.

I remember before the days of kindles and fanfic downloaders that I'd copy and paste a bunch of chapters into word docs on my laptop for car rides and things. Then I got my first ipod and there was a little teeny screen and a way to read docs on it, so that worked for me for a while. Having an ereader is so much more civilized.

I read HP off and on for a few years, I switch fandoms sometimes but generally end up back in HP eventfully. HP is like that comfort food I can always eat no matter what.
