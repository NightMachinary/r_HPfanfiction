I was about 12? My mugglenet fan fiction account says it was created a month before I turned thirteen, and I know I only created that after seeing a few stories elsewhere.

Mnff was my first archive, my once love. It seems so bleak and barren and forgotten now, it's kind of sad.

The first fan fic I remember reading was a Draco/Ginny fic worked around the song Bent by Matchbox Twenty, but wasn't actually a song fic. I remember nothing about the plot, but I remember the site has lots of dark blue and the links were yellow lmao

Edit: I'm 23, so it's been more than a decade of reading fic now. Wow.
