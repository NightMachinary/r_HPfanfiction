Wow, that's really similar to how I started reading. I began in Feb 2011 with Naruto as well. I remember the first one I came across was one where Sakura and Sasuke were admitted to ANBU and Naruto wasn't.

My first HP fanfiction was a relatively well known one, I'm pretty sure. I've forgotten the title, but it had to do with Harry having the Sharingan.
