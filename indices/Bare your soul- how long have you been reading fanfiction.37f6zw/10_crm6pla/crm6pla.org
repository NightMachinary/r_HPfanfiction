I started with /Naruto/ stories (almost exclusively NaruHina fluff, at first!) in spring of 2011, and began checking out the /Harry Potter/ section a few weeks later. The first stories that I remember particularly liking were /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4251989][A Few Angry Words]]/ for /Naruto/ and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771][Partially Kissed Hero]]/ for /Harry Potter/.
