Since around 13, so ~14 years? I definitely remember my first fic. It was a Gundam Wing story that my best friend gave me. The pilots were hit with a pheromone bomb that turned Quatre and Heero gay (based on an [[http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_bomb][actual proposal]] by the USAF in the 90s). The rest of the fic was Heero and Quatre trying to get Duo and Trowa to date/marry them. It wore off in the end.
