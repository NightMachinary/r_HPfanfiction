Errr 2012? Ran across a fanmix on tumblr that was SO GOOD I decided to investigate the fan fiction that inspired it. Man that was a sinkhole of like three days.

Fanmix: [[http://speedhearts.tumblr.com/post/70005105719/alone-with-you-a-draco-hermione-fanmix-01]]

The fic was Isolation by bex chan. Still reread that fic from time to time.
