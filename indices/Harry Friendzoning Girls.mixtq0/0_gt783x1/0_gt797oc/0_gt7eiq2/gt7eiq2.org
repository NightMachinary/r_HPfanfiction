See, I'd argue the love triangles thing. I tend to find them boring and trite.

But yeah, there are a lot of harems that are stupid. I don't actually mind polyamory, I know a few people iRL who have been in such relationships for over a decade. But so many harems end up being 'Harry mostly with one girl and the others are there for titillation' which is dumb as hell.
