I've always had the idea that the limiting factor, other than knowing the mechanics of the spell like wand motions and pronunciation, is will and emotion.

The strength and duration of a spell is determined by how much you want it. And then different spells have different upper bounds for length. For example a standard Cheering Charm might regularly last an hour but if you were desperate to cheer up a grieving friend you might be able to make it last a whole day.

Where as the spells used to make brooms last decades as long as you do them right but someone who is especially proud of their work could make it last over a century.

You could totally hold an active spell like levitation charm all day as long you can focus on keeping the feather up.

The reason you can't keep a Patronus going for hours on end is because holding onto the positive memory/emotion is overwhelming and you start to get distracted and emotionally exhausted.

The reason you can't use a million Killing Curses in a day is because even for terrible people drawing on the ill will and desire for death over and over is taxing and after a while you grow numb to it.

This also explains why people can do extraordinary magic when I'm danger, of course their will is stronger when the spells they're casting could save their life.

I admit this is a rough theory that I've never written out before so there's probably some canon examples that is doesn't gel with but I prefer a system where effort and knowledge of spells is more important than some inherent power that in a lot of stories there's no way to make better so people like Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Harry are just born better than their peers.
