I think Magical Cores started out as purely a way to show power-level differences, to attach a meaningless "mine is bigger than yours" comparison to the idea of magic. There's quite a lot of fics where Harry's said to have a massive magical core, and then it goes completely unmentioned (and un-shown) what having a big magical core actually /does/.

The few times it's actually shown, it functions purely as a "limit" to magic - suddenly, Ron's exhausted from lifting the troll's club because his magical core's run out of juice (as opposed to the fact he just spent a lot of time dodging bathroom sinks, troll weaponry, and bits of toilet). Someone's in awe of Harry's ability to cast a Patronus Charm not because it shows his knowledge or skill, but because he shouldn't be able to manage it with a teenage magical core.

I actually kind of dislike it as a trope - it feels like an arbitrary limitation to weaken anyone-but-the-protagonist.
