Honestly it's very based on some of the modern witchcraft movements which holds that the magical ability is inside of the witch but that you need to work it like a muscle. The more you practice and study, the more magic you can do before becoming exhausted or having spell backfire.

So, it's mostly pulled from modern ideas of how witchcraft worked based on Buckland and Gardner and a bit of Crowley.
