Maybe I read too much smut, but I thought a person's "core" is just a euphemism for those parts of a woman's body where she feels sexual arousal and pleasure, so a "magical core" is just a witch's core and has nothing to do with spellcasting unless "sex magic" is a thing.

Basically, Lily Evans had a magical core, Petunia Evans had a non-magical core, and neither James Potter nor Vernon Dursley had cores of any sort.
