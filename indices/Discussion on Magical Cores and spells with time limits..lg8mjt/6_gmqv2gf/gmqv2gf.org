The way I generally have it work in my fics is pretty varied. The biggest thing to note is that none of the various attributes of "cores", a fancy term for the ability of the soul to process magic, are static. You get better at magic by doing magic, and your ability to cast magic doesn't atrophy.

So there are three major traits that I use to define cores

1. Capacity. How much magic can you store? The naturally increases as you grow older, and is increased further by casting magic. Some people start with a slight boost in this front over others, but experience is far more important.

If one completely runs out of magic, then they can begin pulling magic from the environment instead. Doing so tends to put some minor strain on the soul, but it heals naturally with time.

1. Replenishing. How quickly the soul can "refill" it's store of magic. Like the above one, it's improved through experience, and while some people bstart with an advantage, it's usually insignificant my adulthood.

2. Affinities. This is the most varied and most versatile category. Some spells come more easily to some people than others. Affinities allow one to cast spells that would otherwise be beyond one's ability. For example, in one of my fics, a character with an ice affinity was able to cast a fifth year ice charm as a first year.

Some people might have elemental affinities (fire, ice, light), some might have affinities for fields of magic (transfiguration, charms), other could have affinities based on the use of a spell (protection, housework), and affinities can even be as benign as having affinities for spells that begin with certain letters or have spellbolts in certain colours. Affinities can also be trained, but they tend to be more indicative of a one's personality, desires, and values. Undergoing major life events that cause one to re-evaluate such things can help them gain new affinities, although affinities can not be lost
