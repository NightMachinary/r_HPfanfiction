Seems like there are two types of spells... those which act for only one instance like the majority of spells and those that require and then those that require you to maintain the flow of magic like the Patronus, Wingardium Leviosa, Cruciatus, Mobilicorpus or Reparo (if we consider the movies as canon).

As for magical cores I also think it's a silly theory but I liked the concept of magical exhaustion from NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series which compared the use of magic with a muscle and the more trained it is the more resilient you become and overdoing it would tire you but you wouldn't run out of magic.

Personally I like to imagine that magic as thought out by JK involves having the right state of mind (Patronus, the Unforgivables) or willing to pay a price for it (Lily's sacrificial protection or the Horcruxes) or communicating your intent through a series of vocal commands and wand movements for simpler spells.
