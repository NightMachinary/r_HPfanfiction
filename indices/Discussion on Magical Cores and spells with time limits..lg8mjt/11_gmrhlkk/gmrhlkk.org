I really love InwardTranscience's concept, where there isn't any numerical "magical core power-level" type situations. Instead, humans are imperfect conductors of magical energy. Like in electronics, you can run any current/magic through your wire/human. The trick is not overvolting the system and turning your nervous system to slag with the waste energy.

People have different initial resistances to the energy, and they get more efficient as they get older and keep casting. Another related fact from this system is that Dumbledore isn't that much beyond average for a person of his age group. He's just very, very clever at maximizing effect.

On the time limits for transfiguration: I prefer a quintessence-based (fifth element) explanation. Transfiguration is fuelled by quintessence, which operates as a universal substance propped up by magic to make the transfiguration operate as it should. True conjuration of matter is possible, but rather difficult beyond basic substances like water. Conjuring a true bird, for instance, would require the complete knowledge of every single property of the bird. The more consistent the quintessence is with what it's emulating, the longer the transfiguration will last before the quintessence falls apart. Conjuring a bird with some basic knowledge of how the bird acts and their organs would result in a more robust conjuration than a blob given the instruction "be a bird".

Gamp's Law of Food Transfiguration isn't a magical law, it's a piece of advice. Eating something that dissolves after your body has incorporated it is rather bad for your health.
