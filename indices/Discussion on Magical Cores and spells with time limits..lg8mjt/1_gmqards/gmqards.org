Personally, I just think turning Wizards into batteries is a particularly dull way of limiting magic. There are literally hundreds of other things - from 'Lady Magic doth decree it to be so!' to simple skill at what is quite possibly akin to doing theoretical physics equations in your head while trying to lasso a tornado, or even that magic has to be limited in order to hide from bigger scarier things. There's a reason 'mana' is usually just a game mechanic rather than an active narrative element and that Vancian magic (where you learn a spell then forget it, D&D style) is so popular a limitation.

My best guess at a reason for spells being limited it that it's because spells are active things. You cast a spell and you're 'doing' it (be it the process of channelling magic or some quantum-mechanics-esque direction-of-attention thing). If your involvement stops, then the spell stops.
