There has to be some difference in magic, we see it in the books. Combining with intelligence/practice magical cores work well enough. Just like our muscles magic eventually running out of energy makes intuitive sense to people. And like anything else there are awesome and terrible examples. Anyone know of any works handling this really well, I can't think of one at the moment.
