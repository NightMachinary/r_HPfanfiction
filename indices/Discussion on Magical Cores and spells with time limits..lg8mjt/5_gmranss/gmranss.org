Setting magical cores aside, canon spells seem to fall into a number of categories: permanent, permanent unless cancelled, lasting, focused, and immediate.

Permanent spells are like the permanent sticking charm. You cast it, it does it's thing, and it doesn't stop doing it's thing.

Permanent unless cancelled are spells that will last forever, doing their thing, as long as no one comes along and cancels them.

Lasting spells are ones where the spell takes effect and lasts for a duration unless cancelled. The duration of the spell most likely correlated to how well the spell was cast. Over time the spell fades and eventually stops working. Spells like disillusionment.

Focused spells are like the levitation charm or the patronus. You cast the spell, and it is there doing its thing for as long as you are focusing on it and maintaining it.

Instant spells are spells that perform and action and then stop. Like the stunning spell.
