Oh my god, I am so tired of people treating prophecies as prescriptive rather than the descriptive sayings they are. You get this same shit in the LOTR fandom with people thinking that Eowyn was magically imbued with magical power to kill the Witch-King because she was a woman, or that the Witch-King was magically protected from the blades of men or some shit. No, you potato, she killed him because she killed him, and Glorfindel prophecied that he wouldn't fall by the hand of a man because he literally looked and saw a woman doing it (and decided to be cryptic about it because hey, he's an elf, it's what they do).

I mean, there certainly are questions of how much is inevitable in the HP universe, especially with how Time-Turners canonically work, but I'm very sure prophecies aren't magic. The art of seeing/making them is, but not the saying itself.
