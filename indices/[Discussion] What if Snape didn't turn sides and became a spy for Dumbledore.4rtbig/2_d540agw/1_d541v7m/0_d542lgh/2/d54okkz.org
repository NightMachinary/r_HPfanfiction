I completely disagree. Dumbledore says the prophesy doesn't matter because Harry would fight Voldemort anyway. I say the prophesy happened because Harry was going to fight Voldemort anyway. Divination is real in HP. Even Trelawney is right about most of her predictions. This can mean a few different things as I see it.

Seers and look into the future and know what happened. This seems very probable. Supporting evidence is the time travel in canon. Harry went back in time and in doing so saved himself, which means he always traveled back in time. This implies time is concurrent. Everything happens simultaneously.

Prophesy is a likely or inevitable outcome, and prophesy can change the world to come true. This is my favorite interpretation of prophesy, and not just in HP. This is supported by the amount of luck and ridiculousness that follows Harry. Prophesy changing a million tiny things along to way to see the outcome it desires.
