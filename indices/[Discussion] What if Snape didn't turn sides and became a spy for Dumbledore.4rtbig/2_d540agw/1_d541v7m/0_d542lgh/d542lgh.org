  “No, it doesn't!” said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, “You are setting too much store by the prophecy!”

  “But,” spluttered Harry, “but you said the prophecy means ---”

  “If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?”

  ...

  “But, sir,” said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative, “it all comes to the same thing, doesn't it? I've got to try and kill him, or ---”

  “Got to?” said Dumbledore. “Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!”

  Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.

  “I'd want him finished,” said Harry quietly. “And I'd want to do it.”

  “Of course you would!” cried Dumbledore. “You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. . . . In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it certain, really, that ---”

  “That one of us is going to end up killing the other,” said Harry.

  “Yes.”

You know what would have happened if Voldemort chose the Longbottoms, and somehow Neville got all Boy-Who-Lived on us? He would have gone to his grandmother, same as in canon. And we would have ended up with the same confidence-free, poorly skilled, equipped with an ill-fitting wand and having been raised in the shadow of his parents Neville that we had in /Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone/. That Neville would never have dived in the mystery the way Harry, Ron and Hermione did. Even if by some bullshit he ended up in that final chamber, there is no guarantee Neville would have gotten the Stone out of the Mirror of Erised. Because,

  In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart's desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror?

The only reason Quirrell grabbed Harry, and therefore got burned to death, was because Harry had the Stone, and they couldn't risk accidentally destroying it in subduing him (which means no Stunning Spell, no Incarcerous, no Body Bind, nothing that would make him fall over). But if it was Neville, and he didn't get the Stone out of the Mirror? Dead Neville. And there would have been no Blood of the Enemy tying him to life. There would have been no Voldemort's soul dying only because

  “So the boy. . . the boy must die?” asked Snape quite calmly.

  “And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.”
#+end_quote

only Voldemort killing Harry/Neville-in-this-nonsense-hypothetical would have the possibility of killing only the horcrux.

Voldemort most likely figures a way to get the Stone out of the Mirror. Voldemort gets his body back. Malfoy never slips Ginny Weasley the Diary. Dumbledore never learns about the horcruxes. Voldemort infiltrates the Ministry of Magic with his pimps, and the Ministry therefore can't do shit. Order of the Phoenix gets fucked five ways to Sunday. Voldemort wins.

Let's say that Voldemort can't get the Stone out of the Mirror. Lucius Malfoy slips Ginny Weasley the Diary. Ginny gets taken over/possessed by the horcrux. Since Neville is dead, Diary!Voldemort doesn't obsess over the Boy-Who-Lived, and Ginny probably doesn't start distrusting Tom until it is too late. Dumbledore gets removed from Hogwarts by Lucius Malfoy. No Parseltongue speaking Boy-Who-Lived to kill the Basilisk, destroy the Diary and save Ginny. Horcrux successfully drains the life out of Ginny, leaving a Voldemort soul enbodied and either

A. Becomes the primary soul of Voldemort, and restarts his reign of evil from the beginning, and most likely wins

or

B. Hunts down the major part of Voldemort which had possessed Quirrell, and gets that part of Voldemort a body back. Voldemort calls in his Death Eaters, and brings them back to his service. Voldemort infiltrates the Ministry of Magic with his pimps, and the Ministry therefore can't do shit. Order of the Phoenix gets fucked five ways to Sunday. Voldemort wins.

Prophecy. Doesn't. Mean. Shit.

  Nah, you're forgetting the Prophesy
#+end_quote

Prophesy is a verb, meaning "to predict some future occurrence, or to make a prophecy." A /prophecy/ is a prediction of the future.
