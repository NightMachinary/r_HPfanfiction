  They might think, after seeing no signs of accidental magic, or very little accidental magic, that defeating Voldemort came at the cost of his magic.

It's an interesting hypothesis, but I don't see why it's a likely one. For that matter, it might be moot: if lack of self-confidence was crippling Neville's magic (as OotP suggests), he might show accidental magic sooner if he is raised as the Boy-Who-Lived.

Even if not, this leads to interesting character development, not just a blanket canon rehash. Imagine: Neville is the beloved Boy-Who-Lived --- only kept from being spoiled rotten by the dignified hand of his grandmother --- but something is changing: nobody tells him anything, but he can sense the looks of pity and the sudden, excessive, gratitude of the adults around him. Sooner or later, the mystery is solved when he overhears a worried conversation between his grandmother and uncle, or perhaps Skeeter does, and he reads about it the Daily Prophet.

How does he feel about that? How does he react? Does he /volunteer/ to be put into danger to try to elicit his magic, becoming a life-long adrenaline junkie because he proves to himself that he is a wizard? Or something else? Is he put through some program for getting Squibs ready for the Muggle world? Does he meet other Squibs his age? And then, when his Hogwarts letter does arrive, how does he react? Does he commit himself to the cause of improving the Squibs' lot, and find himself in Gryffindor? Does a drive to prove himself send him to Slytherin?

The point is that either way, the Neville who shows up at Hogwarts will not be the canon Neville.

  And yes, I did go with the more negative interpretation, because that interpretation is the most likely.

It's not an interpretation. It's a counterfactual and an extrapolation over a decade. Unless you have a line to JKR, you don't know what would be more likely any better than I do. However, I think I've made a pretty good case for why Neville would be rather different, so that part of your scenario seems pretty implausible.

Regarding Mirror of Erised, only a few minutes elapsed between Harry's arrival and Dumbledore's. Unless Quirrelmort was just about to give up and leave (which seems unlikely, since he hadn't even tried using magic to examine the mirror by the time Harry arrived), yes, Dumbledore would have caught him, and, grafted onto Quirrel's dying body, Voldemort would not have stood a chance. The only question is whether Voldewraith would have been able to escape unscathed --- and Dumbledore is nothing if not resourceful.
