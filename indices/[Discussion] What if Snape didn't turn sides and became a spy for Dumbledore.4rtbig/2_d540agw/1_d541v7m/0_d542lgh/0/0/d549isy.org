  No one, not even his uncle, would question his worth as a wizard, and, if anything, I'd be worried about him getting a big head.

They might think, after seeing no signs of accidental magic, or very little accidental magic, that defeating Voldemort came at the cost of his magic. Perfectly logical since no one else had /ever/ survived a Killing Curse.

And yes, I did go with the more negative interpretation, /because that interpretation is the most likely/. Thinking on it more, it would probably take too much time to figure a way to get the Stone out of the Mirror. But it's no guarantee that Dumbledore would have been able to stop him. Likely? Yes. But Quirrell was in no way ensnared by it, and with Voldemort sticking out the back of his head it wasn't going to happen.
