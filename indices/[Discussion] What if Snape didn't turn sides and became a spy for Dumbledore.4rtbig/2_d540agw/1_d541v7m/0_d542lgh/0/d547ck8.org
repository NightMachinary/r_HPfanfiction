It's a good refutation of the force of the prophecy view of the prophecy, but I think you're overstating the case with Neville, always choosing the worst case scenario.

Neville, supposing that he survives (since Voldemort does follow the prophecy, and therefore gives it power over him so he should, /somehow/), would be Boy-Who-Lived. No one, not even his uncle, would question his worth as a wizard, and, if anything, I'd be worried about him getting a big head. (Remember, Neville got a new wand /after/ he gained confidence and became a proficient wizard: his progress in OotP was entirely with his old wand.)

Assuming Quirrelmort's plan goes loosely as it does in canon, if Neville doesn't go after the Philosopher's stone, a more likely outcome would be Quirrelmort being unable to get the stone out of the mirror, likely ensnared by it, and stuck there until Dumbledore returns. Remember that Dumbledore showed up minutes behind Harry.

I am not saying that this is the only way it could go, nor even the most likely one, but probably about as or more likely than the scenario you predicted.
