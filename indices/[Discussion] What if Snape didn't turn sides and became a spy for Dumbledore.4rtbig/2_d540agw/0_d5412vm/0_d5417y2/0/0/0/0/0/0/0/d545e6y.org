  Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew --- and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents --- that there was all the difference in the world.

All that gives us is that JKR used both Harry and AD as mouthpieces for her exposition. It doesn't explain why is there such a big difference, how aren't the two situations different (TMR's ultimatum to Harry said nothing about sparing him if he stayed out), and why weren't more people randomly triggering the love-bullshit defence during the first war.

Some fanfics explain this as Lily possessing enough esoteric knowledge to arrange the defence mechanism with\ after her death or AD orchestrating the situation. The problem with the 1st option is that HP didn't know any such magical theory,^{1} and a relative problem with the 2nd one is that no such thing was highlighted in the books themselves.

^{1} --- also, getting back to your last quote, how the hell did he know that that's what made the difference? It's a writing as bad as HJPEV+GARRRBL+ in HP!MoR meditating for half an hour in a critical situation and coming up with important and great revelations about the world's structure to “cleverly” solve the conflict.
