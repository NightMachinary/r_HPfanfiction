First important quote.

  “If she means so much to you,” said Dumbledore, “surely Lord Voldemort will spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?” “I have---I have asked him---”

Second important quote.

  "Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?" Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time. "Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are ready, you will know." And Harry knew it would be no good to argue. "But why couldn't Quirrell touch me?" "Your mother died to save you."

Third important quote.

#+begin_quote
  “I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish every last man, woman, and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour.”

It's a very specific set of circumstances. Snape asked Voldemort to spare Lily, and he decides to. But once he is there, Lily refuses to live at the cost of her son's life. Voldemort kills her. Oh shit, Lily's love protection.

Voldemort gives Harry the option to flee, to hide, which is de facto a chance to live, but at the cost of the lives of all Harry's friends and allies. Harry refuses to live at the cost of their lives. Voldemort kills him. Oh shit, Harry's love protection.
