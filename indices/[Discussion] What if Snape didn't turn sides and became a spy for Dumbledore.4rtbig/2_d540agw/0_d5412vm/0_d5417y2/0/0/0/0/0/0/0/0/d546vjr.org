  how aren't the two situations different (TMR's ultimatum to Harry said nothing about sparing him if he stayed out),
#+end_quote

Part of that is probably my +shitty+ /stellar/ communication skills. The ultimatum wasn't "come and die, or we kill all your friends and you live." It was "come and die and your friends live. Don't, and they die, and I will hunt you down until I kill you." That leaves the "Harry runs for his goddamn life and gets away" option available. Certain death verse not certain death at the cost of his friend's life. It is the refusal to have the chance to live at the cost of the lives of others and therefore choosing to die out of love.

  and why weren't more people randomly triggering the love-bullshit defence during the first war.

  Some fanfics explain this as Lily possessing enough esoteric knowledge to arrange the defence mechanism with\after her death
#+end_quote

Probably because this is deep, weird magic. It isn't a "I'll go sacrifice myself to enact a ritual" type bullshit you see in those shitty fanfics. This is of a much more ancient, less rigid, free of incantation and wand movement, subtle magic. This isn't something you can plan. It has to be true. It didn't happen more often during the war because outside of the two times it happened, nothing about the situations, actions and motivations of the people were right.

  also, getting back to your last quote, how the hell did he know that that's what made the difference?

Because, all of the things Dumbledore taught him, that allowed Harry to overcome Voldemort and live, were about the power of the choices one makes the actions that enact them. For example

  "Harry -- you're a great wizard, you know." "I'm not as good as you," said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him. "Me!" said Hermione. "Books! And cleverness! There are more important things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful!"

  It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone -- find it, but not use it -- would be able to get it, otherwise, they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life.

  “So I should be in Slytherin,” Harry said, looking desperately into Dumbledore's face. “The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin's power in me, and it ---” “Put you in Gryffindor,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Listen to me, Harry. You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-picked students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue --- resourcefulness --- determination --- a certain disregard for rules,” he added, his mustache quivering again. “Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor. You know why that was. Think.” “It only put me in Gryffindor,” said Harry in a defeated voice, “because I asked not to go in Slytherin. . . .” “Exactly,” said Dumbledore, beaming once more. “Which makes you very different from Tom Riddle. It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”

  “Harry, I can't believe it.... You conjured up a Patronus that drove away all those dementors! That's very, very advanced magic....” “I knew I could do it this time,” said Harry, “because I'd already done it.... Does that make sense?” “I don't know --- Harry, look at Snape!”

  Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt.... When one wizard saves another wizard's life, it creates a certain bond between them ... and I'm much mistaken if Voldemort wants his servant in the debt of Harry Potter.

  “So what happens when a wand meets its brother?” said Sirius. “They will not work properly against each other,” said Dumbledore. “If, however, the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle . . . a very rare effect will take place. One of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed --- in reverse. The most recent first ... and then those which preceded it....”

  "But I knew, too, where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be protected by an ancient magi of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated --- to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mother's blood. I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative." "She doesn't love me," said Harry at once. "She doesn't give a damn --- " "But she took you," Dumbledore cut across him. "She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet she still took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you."

  "By an act of evil --- the supreme act of evil. By commiting [sic] murder. Killing rips the soul apart.

  "You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!" said Dumbledore loudly. "The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort's! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart's desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not! But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort's mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole."

  “Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it's supposed to be you.” He was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had known that the doe was benign, he knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the sword. Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculabe [sic] power of certain acts.

It's only one of the major themes of the damn series.
