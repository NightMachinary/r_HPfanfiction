A. Voldemort tells Lily to stand aside multiple times, and we learn later that Snape asked him to spare her.

#+begin_quote
  “Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!”

  “Stand aside, you silly girl. . . stand aside now.”

  “Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead---”

  “This is my last warning---”

  “Not Harry! Please . . . have mercy. . . have mercy. . . . Not Harry! Not Harry! Please---I'll do anything---”

  “Stand aside. Stand aside, girl!”

  He could have forced her away from the crib, but it seemed more prudent to finish them all. . . .

Lily is clearly given an option to stand aside and live, yet refuses to do so.

B. Harry didn't have to walk out to his death. Could have fled.

Each of them are given the choice of "stand aside or die." Each one chose die because of their love for others. Magical love protection ensues.
