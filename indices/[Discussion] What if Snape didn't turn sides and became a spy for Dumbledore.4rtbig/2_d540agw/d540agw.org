No Death Eater gives two shits about Alice Longbottom other than "Hey, that's an enemy. Kill that ho." Voldemort would have no reason to offer Alice a chance to live, leading to no wonky love sacrifice shit. He kills the Longbottoms. And, before I go into the next bit, please remember that Voldemort was winning at this point.

Ministry of Magic can't do shit, because Voldemort's infiltrated that bitch with his pimps. Order of the Phoenix gets fucked five ways to Sunday. Voldemort wins.
