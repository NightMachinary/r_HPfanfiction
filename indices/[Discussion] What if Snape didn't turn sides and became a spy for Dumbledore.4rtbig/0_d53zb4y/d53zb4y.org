Your premise is flawed. He changed sides because despite being estranged his childhoodwas suddenly in real and immediate danger. He changed sides before she died. Whether she died or not doesn't change things because the catalyst wasn't her death.

linkffn(C'est La Vie) This is one of my favorite fics. It has some of the best characterization in the fandom and a particularly good Snape and Lily relationship.

Edit: You could make an argument that he goes back to Voldemort in '95 when he's resurrected but I don't buy it. Snape isn't a pureblood he can't care too much about the cause. He joined the death eaters to belong, he joined for power. He found the cost way too high for him. He was lured into something when he was still a teenager. That happens in real life too.
