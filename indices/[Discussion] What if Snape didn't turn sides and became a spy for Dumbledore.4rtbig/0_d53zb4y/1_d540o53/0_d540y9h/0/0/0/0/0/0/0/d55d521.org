  Isn't having an exceptional talent an invitation in itself?

No. Potential to succeed involves three things amongst others: talent, attractiveness (largely physical, but not solely), and wealth. Snape had only one of the above. And unlike exceptional beauty and exceptional wealth, exceptional talent alone doesn't open many doors, especially when you bring no connections to the table. Sorry, that's the way the world works.

You seem not to get that /you can't just up and join the Slug Club/. There's no application. Trying to ingratiate yourself makes you look like a desperate tryhard. It's like you have zero experience with these things in real life.
