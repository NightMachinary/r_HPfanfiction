Snape is not explicitly mentioned as being part of the Slug Club but he is present at the Slug Christmas Party in Half-Blood Prince. Still, being part of the Slug Club would hardly net him the kind of acceptance a young, bashed-on-the-head man wants: Acceptance and admiration of his peers.

Few late teens are really all that into going into influence peddling and politics, in the end.

Oh and in Half-Blood Prince Dumbledore does quite explicitly say that Snape's turn came about after he delivered the prophecy to Voldemort, when Voldemort decided on hunting the Potters.
