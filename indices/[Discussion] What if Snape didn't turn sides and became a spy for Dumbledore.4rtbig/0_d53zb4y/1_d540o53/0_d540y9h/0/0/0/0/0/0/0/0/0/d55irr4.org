  As an example, Ginny Weasley got invited to the Slug Club because she was good at casting Bat Boogey Hex alone (it also helped that she was exceptionally beautiful).

Are you even reading what you're writing? It's not that she could cast the Bat-bogey hex, it's that she could cast one /of such power/, in defence of herself - talent. And like you mentioned yourself, she was quite beautiful - attractiveness. She fails when it comes to wealth, but she is still a pureblood from a family with good standing and mild to moderate influence at the Ministry - connections. That's three out of four. How is it not getting through to you that /one out of four is not good enough/?

  And I'm sorry, but you seem to live in a different world than mine.
#+end_quote

Exactly - I live in the world that actually understands what Slughorn was doing. He was not building a club of "useful" people with "useful" talents, or a club of people he could employ. He was building a club of people he could /show off/, people he could /call in political favours from/. The Slug Club is a social club; have you never encountered or at least heard of the politics that goes into that? Being academically talented /isn't good enough/.

  There's no application, yes, but there certainly are requirements - you've said so yourself.
#+end_quote

For God's sake, how do you not understand this? "Trying" will get him no fucking where! Because it's up to /Slughorn/ and no-one else to pick the members of his club! How the fuck do you even imagine this going? "Oh Professor, look at my potion, please let me join your club"? "Let me join and I will brew potions for you"? He can literally order him to do that anyway, he's his teacher! What exactly is Snape's bargaining chip here, that would require Slughorn to admit him into the circle of people he wants to spend time with? Like I said, do you have zero experience with social clubs and societies or what? Did you not at least pass through college?

#+begin_quote
  What I said was an example, not a definitive solution. You get my drift?
#+end_quote

An example that's stupid as hell, but carry on.
