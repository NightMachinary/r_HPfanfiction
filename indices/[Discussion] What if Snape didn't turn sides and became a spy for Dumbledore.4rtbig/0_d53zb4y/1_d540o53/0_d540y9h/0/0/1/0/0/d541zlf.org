Please note that I'm not saying "Snape wasn't a member of the Slug Club." What I'm saying is "there is no mention of Snape being part of the Slug Club." That being said:

1. He's a poor half-blood, so no familial connections to work with (see the HBP chapter when Slughorn invites people to tea with him on the train). He only invited people off the bat because of who they're related to, with the exception of Ginny because he was /really/ impressed with her hexing someone whose identity I forget.

2. From Slughorn's memory of him speaking with Tom Riddle we know that Slughorn is uncomfortable with dark magic.

3. We know from Blaise talking to Malfoy on the train that Slughorn doesn't seem interested in Death Eaters or Death Eater affiliated students.

4. From /The Prince's Tale/ in /DH/, we know that school-age!Snape thinks dark magic is funny (page 569) and wants to be a Death Eater (page 571).

From this we can conclude that Slughorn probably wasn't that interested in Snape for his club, no likely long-term benefits from having him.

  “Horace,” said Dumbledore, relieving Harry of the responsibility to say any of this, “likes his comfort. He also likes the company of the famous, the successful, and the powerful. He enjoys the feeling that he influences these people. He has never wanted to occupy the throne himself; he prefers the backseat --- more room to spread out, you see. He used to handpick favorites at Hogwarts, sometimes for their ambition or their brains, sometimes for their charm or their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields. Horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center, making introductions, forging useful contacts between members, and always reaping some kind of benefit in return, whether a free box of his favorite crystalized [sic] pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin Liaison Office.”

Slughorn wanted for his club the people who he believed would go on to have some degree of power (economic, political, cultural) through their talents, connections or ambitions while avoiding those who would not. And the latter category most likely included those who would go on to be terrorists. Snape may have been good at potions, and he may have been skilled at the dark arts, but he was never going to be a person Slughorn was going to get long term use out of.
