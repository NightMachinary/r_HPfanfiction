It's not as simple as you may think. When London was bombed on Sept 7, 1944, Wernher Von Braun was quoted to have said: " the rockets worked perfectly, except for landing on the wrong planet." This was a man whose interest in rockets was for space travel, not as weapons. His relationship with the Nazi regime is complicated, much like Severus' is with the Death Eaters.

Being intelligent does mean you don't pull stupid shit, it happens all the time. Take a look at some of the most famous serial killers, some are very highly intelligent people. Severus is highly intelligent, HBP's potions book gives us a glimpse of it. He was a teenager who was tweaking potions and creating spells, most don't do this. Severus was also at Slughorn's Christmas party, so he might have been a member, a young Severus might have thought the club would be a good networking tool, but perhaps it didn't live up to his hopes.
