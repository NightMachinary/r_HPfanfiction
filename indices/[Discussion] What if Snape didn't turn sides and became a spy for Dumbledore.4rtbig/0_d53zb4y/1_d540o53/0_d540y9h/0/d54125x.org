Besides, I'm sure Snape is the kind of guy who would get angry for getting shit on after walking through a flock of birds.

He's not even that smart a fellow, really. When have you seen him being smart? He's a talented Occlumens and a hell of a Potioneer, not shabby with the Dark Arts either but he has never shown (in canon) himself to be some sort of mastermind. Rather he's shown as a petty, callous and bitter character with very little to redeem himself with.

He joined the Death Eaters to belong, indeed. This much is very well established in the canon Fall out -scene. Sure that's an inconsistent thing to do if his #1 thing is to keep Lily safe. However, I don't think he considered Lily to be in active danger at the time. Us humans, we like to disregard the blatantly obvious for as long as it is possible, only waking up to danger when it is slapped in our face. That's probably why we're mostly doomed to die in horribly silly ways.
