I'm not sure it's ever made clear either way. When Dumbledore guilts Snape into pledging his life to destroy Voldemort and protect Harry, we have a distinct point at which he signs on for the long haul. The fact that he's in Dumbledore's office when he learns of Lily's death does imply that he's continued to keep the headmaster informed.

I think JKR does a good job of portraying Snape as an extremely talented, even brilliant wizard whose emotional intelligence hovers right around zero. He seems clueless about the things that drive him, and he radiates anger and self-loathing through most of the series, with only very fleeting glimpses in The Prince's Tale of other qualities. He's an absolute idiot with Dumbledore on the hillside when he goes to beg for Lily's safety. He clearly hasn't planned what to say, or how to present himself to win Dumbledore's trust, or given any thought to James and Harry's lives and how it might be diplomatic to fake concern for them. He's abrasively honest and one-track-minded and distraught, and he's weirdly naive. Ditto the scene after Lily's death, when he goes to pieces in front of Dumbledore and plays right into his hands.

However intelligent Snape might be, he's portrayed as emotionally stunted, and until the very end of his life he seems to have very little insight into his own soul. People who are emotionally blind to their own motivations often end up doing contradictory and stupid things.

Basically, intelligence isn't the deciding factor in why people behave the way they do.
