Snape was a Slytherin. He's poor hes a half blood but he's intelligent and capable. He also has a fascination with the dark arts. His house mates are all on the track to deatheater-hood, we see him and Lily argue about this. Remember this is the mid '70s and we don't know what Snape knew. The ministry was probably suppressing reports to keep morale up.

Why would he join? Because terrorist organizations are good at recruiting. They target the young, the disadvantaged, they promise rewards, a future.

Similar to Draco Malfoy, Snape gets in then finds things aren't what he thought. /No one stops being a Death Eater/ Then Lily is threatened, not abstractly, but her life is in great danger. So he goes to Dumbledore. As another person responded, we know the timeline. Snape was Dumbledore's man before that Halloween.
