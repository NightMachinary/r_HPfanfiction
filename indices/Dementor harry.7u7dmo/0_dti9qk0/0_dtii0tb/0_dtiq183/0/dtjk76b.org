Antithesis probably isn't the correct word for what I was thinking of, and a Troll-Hermione is a great idea.

Some more idea's I was playing with:

- Harry becoming a Dementor changes his ability to draw people to him from charisma to literal soul sucking.

- Harry would develop an affinity for decay, particularly rotting curses which would lead him stealing a grimoire from the Greengrass Family, becoming nihilistic.

- The reason Harry would steal from the Greengrass Family is because they were known as the Gangrenous Family of dark wizards in the past.

- Hermione becoming a Basilisk makes her more cold blooded, more ruthless, and more vengeful. Heightening those aspects of her character until she resembles a Lawful Evil Dragon from D&D.

- Ron would become a /Chessmaster/, seeing people as pawns. to be used and discarded. Talk about everything with chess metaphors.

- Ron would eventually develop ambition, become a mob boss. Ron wouldn't loose his appetite and would eventually develop a taste for human flesh as a convenient way of disposing of bodies.
