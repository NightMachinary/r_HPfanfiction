Robst's Harrys usually come off like how a stereotypical anti-social basement dweller fedora wearing neckbeard imagines himself to be when he is being a stereotypical white knight and attempting to act 'chivalrous', as if being nice or polite to a woman automatically grants him access to her panties. If you've ever been on the default subs you see it referenced all the time where you just have to cringe at people who use words like "m'lady" and "sir" a lot.

It's hard to describe because it's kinda something you have to experience. The "hat-tipping" part of that comes from said fedora wearers literally tipping their hat and saying "m'lady". They see themselves as being heroes when really they're just awkward and weird.

It's like the uncanny valley of social interactions. There's nothing wrong with what is being said or done but it just doesn't fit with every day interactions so much that it is appalling, revolting, and/or disgusting to normal people.

In the context of robst's stories, Harry is literally just a normal level of nice to Hermione and she fawns all over him. The "hat-tipping" level is just how much Harry acts abnormal and awkward, much like someone who has no social ability. At least in my opinion, you'd have to ask TLPG for theirs.
