Looks right. One of robst's more readable ones, if I remember correctly. Here's my half-remembered review.

--------------

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]], by robst

Hat Tipping: minimal

Absurd but compelling early premise rating: 9/10

Complete: yes

Cringingness level of minors' sexualities: err, don't...remember? I think it is all over in first year, and it is rated "T", so I goddamn hope nothing happens.
