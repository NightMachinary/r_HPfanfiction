  What if McGonagall had delivered the letter from the start as she had done for every other muggle-raised child? Why wouldn't she have wanted to check up on Harry when she loathed the Dursley's from day one? What would change when Harry has a new legal and competent guardian? Slytherin Harry. No godmoding. No Time travel. Might update 2021.
