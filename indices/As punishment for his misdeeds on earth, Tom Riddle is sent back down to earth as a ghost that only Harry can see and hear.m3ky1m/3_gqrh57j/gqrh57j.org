I remember reading a fic sorta like this except it was Snape purposely haunting James after committing Werewolf assisted suicide because he hated his life so much and just wanted to see the Marauders get what he believed they deserved. Ends with him telling Dumbledore Mcgonagall and James how much he hates them and then he passes on
