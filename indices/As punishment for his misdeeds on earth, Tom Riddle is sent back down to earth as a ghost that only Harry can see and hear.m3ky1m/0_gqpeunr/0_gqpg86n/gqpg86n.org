I definitely will at some point. I've had this idea for a couple years now but when I tried writing it I was stuck on the first chapter, which would be Tom in limbo with Death and Fate where he gets assigned his punishment. My plan is definitely for them to become friends at some point, after they drive each other mad in the process. And it would be an AU, where Fred is alive, Harry and Ginny don't get together, etc

Right now I have 2 HP WIPs and I want to finish those or at least one before I post another (just so I know I'll finish it) but when I do post it I'll definitely let you know! :)

Also I love that ^ ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
