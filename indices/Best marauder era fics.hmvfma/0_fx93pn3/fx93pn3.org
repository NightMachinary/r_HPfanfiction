All the Young Dudes is definitely my favorite marauders era fic, I might even say it's my favorite HP fic.

It spends most of the book in Hogwarts but towards the end it sorta speeds after James and Lily dies all the way up to PoA.

It's slash though (Remus Lupin/Sirius Black) so if that isn't your thing you might want to skip this one.
