It's a lot AU but linkffn(One Step Forward, Two Decades Back) is awesome. Hermione gets sent back to Marauders era by Ron using a spell on her and she ends up as Sirius's sister and completely changes things for the Marauders, Severus and pretty much every other character. It does have the Dumbledore is evil trope thing but in a way I hadn't seen before.
