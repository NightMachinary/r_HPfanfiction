It's influence would be seen in tropes if it was as good as you claim though. I think it's a good story, better than most, but not as good as the author pretends it is. It has little to no character development, an incoherent story line and deeply flawed logic that falls apart as soon as you give it a seconds thought.

That being said, it was outrageously funny at times and I quite enjoyed some of the ideas and the way they were presented.

My point is, while HPmor was a good fanfic, it is nowhere near as good as that.
