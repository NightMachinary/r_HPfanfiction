Man, don't go making outrageous claims like that. I've read HPmor. It was a fun ff with an arsehole Harry and I had more than a few laughs. But it doesn't even make it to top twenty best fanfics. His was a series of cracky scenes intertwined with boring shit about an arsehole who doesn't know shit about science.
