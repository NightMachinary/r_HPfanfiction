Don't ask why I wrote this. I'm bored. Maybe I'll write a oneshot where the Sorting Hat sings this.

YO MOTHERFUCKERS, the 1991 album by the Sorting Hat and His Homies

THIS SONG CONTAINS EXPLICT CONTENT - BANNED BY THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC, BY ORDER OF CORNELIUS FUDGE!

The lead single, YO MOTHERFUCKERS!

Yo motherfuckers I'm the sorting hat I sort your asshole into your house It's your family for the next seven years of your worthless life

I don't give a shit about you You only give one about me because I can make your life suck If you're a mudblood, it's SLYTHERIN! If you're a Death Eater, it's GRRYFINDOR! That's why you want to shit on me And I shit you not about that, motherfucker!

It's brown and wet Just like Dumbledore and Grindelwald's foreplay If you get my jist

Now in GRRYFINDOR, you're brave, reckless, and stupid! In HUFFLEPUFF, you're a meek follower! HUFFLEPUFFs cry all the time! In RAVENCLAW, you're a snot nosed arrogant brat. In SLYTHERIN, everyone else is a mudblood, just like your mother!

Now see here Good girls get points And bad boys cost points Be a shithead, and it's ONE HUNDRED points from GRYFFINDOR! Be a mudblood, and it's FIVE HUNDRED points from SLYTHERIN!

Now see here, motherfuckers I'm the sorting hat I sort you into your best house And I know best which one
