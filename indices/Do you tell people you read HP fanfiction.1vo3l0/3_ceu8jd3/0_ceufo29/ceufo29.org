It is easier when I can say "I've actually written a 570k word story, probably closer to a million words total. But it was fanfiction, I'd like to write something original eventually but it hasn't come to me yet."

Make what you've written an accomplishment you are proud of, but not a big deal since "you know" it is kindof silly and just a hobby.

I kindof specialize in smut with plot, so if that isn't your thing then don't bother.
