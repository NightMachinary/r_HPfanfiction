I throw out several book series I've been reading: Percy Jackson, Wheel of Time, Sword of Truth, Star Wars, Harry Potter Fanfiction, Naruto Fanfiction.

I'm not just a one trick pony, but I'm also not afraid to admit it. There are some seriously good stories out there in fanfiction. Just because it cannot be commercialized doesn't mean it isn't as good as a novel you could buy at the store. Why be ashamed?

Now...I don't tell them my favorites are Harem and Smut...
