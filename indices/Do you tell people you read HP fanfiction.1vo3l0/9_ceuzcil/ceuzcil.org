For a long time it never came up because I was alone in my room when I did it, but now that I have a kindle and take it literally everywhere people started asking what I'm reading to start a conversation. So I flash them the page of foreign-language text (I'm German) and say it's a free eBook by some unpublished author on the internet. If they ask any more direct questions I explain exactly what I am reading, but mostly there is no need. And my closest friends all know and don't care (I am odd enough as it is and most are more put out by the amount I read rather then /what/. Also the adventure and humour things i read are innocent enough, I don't have any explicit het stories and the slash stuff never enters the kindle ^^)
