I tell people I read fantasy. If they ask for details, I admit a lot of it is "set in the Harry Potter universe" which usually gets a better response than "Harry Potter fanfiction". "Fanfiction" generally = instant dismissal as childish, "set in ____ universe" generally = what? Then I get to explain that Rowling created an /awesome/ set of universe rules/ideas and is kind enough to allow anyone to play in her sandbox! I drop a few common themes amongst what I read (time-travel, wandless magic, integration of magic & muggle technology) and people usually respond well. I fielded this question a /lot/ in college, since I liked to read fanfic while I ate breakfast and the people trying to talk to me often asked "what are you reading?"

If you read nothing but Dramione and Snarry, I'm not sure it would go over as well, though :P
