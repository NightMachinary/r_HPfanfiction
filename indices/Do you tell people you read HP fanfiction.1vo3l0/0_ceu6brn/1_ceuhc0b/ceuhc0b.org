The "set in the Harry Potter universe" phrase is pure gold. Though I'm afraid I've been a Snape/Hermione girl from day one. I had a roomate that was big into fanfiction and she went off on a rant one evening about how terrible that ship was. I read some to see what the hubub was all about, and have been hooked ever since.
