I kept it a dark, dark secret for 4 years. Then when I went to university to study creative writing and got to know my course mates better, someone started talking about it and it snowballed. A few of them opened up to having written it and how it made them want to take up a career in writing. I also opened up and now I feel a lot better about it. I still don't talk about it directly, but if the subject is raised I'll contribute. It's something still very personal to me, as online fandom got me through a lot. I'm still not sure how I feel about it becoming more "mainstream" for lack of a better word. But I'm sure that's just me.
