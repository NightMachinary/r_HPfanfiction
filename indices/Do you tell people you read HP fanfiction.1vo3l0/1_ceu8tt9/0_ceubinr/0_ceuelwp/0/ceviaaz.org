Yeah I was going to suggest Tumblr. If you haven't seen the latest episodes of Sherlock then I would suggest watching the first few minutes of the first episode. When Moffat "explains" one possibility to how Sherlock faked his death he has Sherlock and Moriarty almost kiss, and basically turns to fandom and says "I see what you're doing..." Lots more celebrities/bands/actors/whatever are becoming more aware of it, because of Tumblr/Twitter/Other social media. I'm not sure if I like it. Perhaps I just need to let go?
