I generally don't mention it. My closest friends know that I do, and I'm happy to let them think that all I read are fluffy happy stories or awesome adventure stories, rather than dark, smutty slash fics. I just say I'm a big fan of Harry Potter, which is totally true, and that I like reading and writing my own stories. If they ask if they can rea my stories I just say no, it's kind of a personal hobby and I don't want anyone to read them (besides the potentially hundreds or thousands of strangers online who do so :D ).
