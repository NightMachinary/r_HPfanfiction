When I start to read it in 2007 I would only read at home and never have to bring it on conversations. But after I start to read it at the college some friends would ask "What are you reading?" And I just say that it was fanfictions, after they made fun off me I stop answering. Now I just say that I am reading storys that other people put on the internet.

Even worse than saying that you are reading HP fanfics, is saying that you are reading an Anime/Manga fanfics, I also read Naruto fanfics, and even for my friends that enjoy anime/manga and live in the "fantasy world" it is something childish :/ But since I can't see myself ever stoping reading fanfics, I prefer to keep it as quit as possible.
