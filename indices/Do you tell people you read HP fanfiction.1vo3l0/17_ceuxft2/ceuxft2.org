Not people I don't know well. When people ask what I'm reading, I say "something" most of the time and if pressed, I'm very vague ("well, a story. It has words"). Due to being a bit of a completely sarcastic ass, it's in-character enough for people not to press for info.

Honestly, as a somewhat bigger dude (6'2") who already has a couple of "girly" habits that I get mocked for (I shriek like a little girl whenever I trip, for example- it's the only time I can get my voice to go above its normal low pitch) I just don't think that it's worth adding too much material for people to harass me over- even if its good-natured.
