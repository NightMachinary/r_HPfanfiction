I had hid the fact that I read HP fanfiction and additionally was a HHr fan for years. But after I was caught by a friend prepping a fanfic of my own with obvious mentions of Harry Potter, it was kinda hard to continue hiding it. So I gave it to them straight; I enjoy fanfics, especially Harry Potter, and I am an avid HHr fan. The first two points went down really well considering that my friend also loves fanfiction, much to my joy. It was the third point however which cause the "shit to hit the fan". As it turns out my friend was a devout follower of canon pairings.
