Nope. I've read Fanfiction for ages and have dabbled in writing to help me improve my grammar and just writing in general.

Mentioned it to my cousins. Got made fun of. Later I mentioned that I enjoy AltHistory novels and stories. Got made fun of and was told I liked "Historical Fanfiction" and that did I enjoy reading about what would happen if Lincoln was an Alien?

After that I just never told anyone anything about my reading preferences. I will say this though. Alien Lincoln would be freaking awesome.
