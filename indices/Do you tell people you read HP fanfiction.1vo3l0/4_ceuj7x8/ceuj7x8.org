Sure. People laugh, and then I get to tell them that the fanfiction seems to have matured significantly with the fans (which is the case for my taste, so I only read solidly written stuff as opposed to the drivel we all pumped out when we were 12). Usually around this point, they admit to reading some sort of fanfiction as well.

I don't tell everyone that I write it, though. I wrote a 100k word Draco/Harry, Harry/Ginny novel over the summer in about a month, and I just told people at work I was working on a book about human trafficking. I mean, that was the basic premise for my fic, so...
