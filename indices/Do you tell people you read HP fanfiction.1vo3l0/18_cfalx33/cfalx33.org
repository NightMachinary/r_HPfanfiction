I absolutely do! But it's usually in the most self-deprecating way possible, hah. I've just read it and been in fandom for so long that it's just part of what I read. It isn't the only thing I read. I found out that a lot of my friends are interested in fic from other fandoms and HP. I've met a lot of friends through it, as well. I was in theatre in high school, so pretty much all of us read and wrote fic all the time, for musicals, HP, TV shows, etc. I guess I'm lucky!
