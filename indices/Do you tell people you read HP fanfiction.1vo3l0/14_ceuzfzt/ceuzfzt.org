Yeah, I don't really give a fuck. I don't think there's anything wrong with reading fanfiction, or writing it for that matter. I would judge someone more if they read bodice-rippers than if they read LV/HP. If I want to be professional or something, the topic just doesn't really come up. Anyway, I'd rather tell my boss I read HP fanfiction than tell them I read Lenin and Mao, which I do. :P
