Acronyms and descriptive terms that you may not know appear just about everywhere in fanfiction, especially in the character limited summaries of FFNet. Though it is ugly as hell, [[http://www.angelfire.com/falcon/moonbeam/terms.html][this site]] provides a pretty thorough list of terms, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/topic/44309/112420890/Fanfiction-Terminology-Dictionary][this forum post]] includes a few more Harry Potter specific terms. As mentioned before, shipping is pretty important to the fandom, so in addition to initials, ship names and portmanteaus are used regularly to denote pairings. [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_Pairing_Names][Fanlore has the most complete list]]. The ship names with HMS/SS designation are almost never used anymore except facetiously, but shortenings such as Harmony (HP/HG), Drarry (HP/DM), and Wolfstar (RL/SB) are used regularly.

In order to properly set yourself up for a successful reading experience, you should start by making an account on Fanfiction.net. All you need is a unique email and username. I've used the site for years and have never had a problem with spam, so don't be worried about that. The three main features that FFNet offers users are Follows, Favorites, and Reviews. All three are accessed from any individual story's page, [[https://gyazo.com/6876c67f55725e07300e270fc968f596.jpg][as seen here (img)]]. Following a story sends you an email every time the story updates. Even with 150+ follows, [[https://gyazo.com/f5f718826c9375b331eadc336962e006.gif][I get less than 4 emails a day (gif)]] which I tag and store for later reading.

Your favorites list appears in your profile. To view any profile, you can use the tilde (~) link, fanfiction.net/~username or the uuid (unique user identifier) link, fanfiction.net/u/uuid/ to get there however the tilde links do not work from the mobile subdomain ([[https://gyazo.com/d09abaccddf297aff1a15c3a1dd76a94.jpg][example (img)]]). Additionally it strips the link down to alphanumeric characters without spaces: Rorschach's Blot becomes fanfiction.net/~rorschachsblot.

The Harry Potter section on FFNet is located at [[http://fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/]] . That page shows all of the HP stories on the site but you have to change the filter to Rating: All as Mature stories are filtered out by default. If you want an upgraded search engine of the same database, a HP Fanfiction fan forum called DarkLordPotter maintains the [[http://scryer.darklordpotter.net][Scryer]]. Using the Scryer you can search for or exclude terms in the title and summary, exclude an unlimited number of characters, and filter by word and chapter count. It is useful when searching for specific stories as well as for browsing new stories by advanced users with specific taste.

It is a good idea to keep a personal file in addition to your ffnet profile for links to stories you've enjoyed, as it is very possible you will find favorite stories across each of the sites.. Google docs is good for this, as is a simple notepad file or browser bookmarks. Some readers also list summaries, add tags, and list major characters and plots to help them search through and find fics later. Since downloading fics from several of the sites, especially FFNet, is really simple, some readers use ereader programs such as Calibre to track them. Since none of the sites have a way to mark fics you've read or know not to read, this method can help with that too.

*Reviewing Etiquette*

Reviewing is fairly straightforward. it allows you to communicate with the author, but it is necessary to discuss some etiquette. Never ever post anything along the lines of "please update more/faster". It doesn't help anything. Also don't be a dick. It's pretty simple. If something makes you angry and want to yell at the author, just close the tab. There's no reason to put that negativity out there. If the person is breaking rules, just use the report button. The ffnet admins almost never respond to reports directly but usually take care of them within a week. Other sites may or may not be better about responding and taking care of issues.

If you want to typo or grammar bust, be polite about it, including asking the author if they mind if you do so. Most of the time if they do mind, they will have said so in an authors note somewhere, so definitely don't just skip those. If you want to make suggestions (on in-progress stories only), again be polite about it. Telling the author to do something will just annoy them. If you want to offer praise, that's fine, but under 10 word reviews such as "I liked this" are generally frowned upon. If you want to review, take an extra minute to tell them what you liked and why.
