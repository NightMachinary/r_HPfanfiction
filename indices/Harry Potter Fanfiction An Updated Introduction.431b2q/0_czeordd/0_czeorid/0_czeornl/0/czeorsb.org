*** Recommendations and how to find the best fics

When I talk about "Best stories" here, it is very subjective and your milage may vary. A lot. For example, the top 25 most reviewed stories page is riddled with poorly planned and/or cliched plots, bad grammar and spelling, overly proselytizing authors (both religious and non), ships that tend to be divisive, abandoned fics, and author misconduct. Despite that, most are worth reading if only to get acquainted with the fandom. After all, they are the most viewed stories and therefore by default have great influence over readers and both authors who wish to imitate or emulate, and those who wish to completely reject their style and ideas. Some of the stories are even /good/.

I would recommend reading every story on both the 25 most reviewed list and the 25 most favorited list (they share only 10 fics at the moment) after checking out the curated lists below though. In order to find these lists, just set the filter to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=3&r=10][sort by reviews]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=10][sort by favorites]].

This subreddit is a good place for both general recs and themed/pairing recs. Some links to get you started are the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3f97u2/the_most_popular_fanfics_of_all_time_in/cz8rk2c][Most Recommended Stories thread]] and the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3hsfw0/general_recommendations_thread/][General Recommendation thread]]. If you use the search bar, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/search?q=best&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all][you can look for terms like "best"]] and come up with threads like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3ofzz6/best_fic_ever_read/?ref=search_posts][this one]] which have lots of discussion and suggestions. A topic I always like to comment on is sad stories, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3zqz17/your_favorite_emotionalheartwrenching_fics/][such as this thread]].

On FFNet, there are what is known as C2s or Community Collections which are favorites lists that are curated by multiple users and generally arranged by theme. You can see all of the C2s at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/communities/book/Harry-Potter/][this link]]. The most used C2 is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/][DLP (DarkLordPotter) 5 Star and Featured Authors]]

In addition to the main search pages, other authors' and readers' favorites fics and authors pages are a good place to look for more recs. Just click on an author's name and then [[https://gyazo.com/efc08921d79cf905c43a9b605e9a05be.gif][click the favorites tab on their page (gif)]]. Pro tip: make use of the hide bio button in the top center of the screen to make the screen much cleaner. This is basically the only way to find old complete fics from 2002-2005. Many still hold up very well and they're part of the history of this fandom.

To get you started on that front, I've included a list of a few authors who hang around this sub (or used to around the time that I wrote this), as well as a few other authors. You should check out the fics they've written in addition to the fics they've favorited.

One particularly interesting way to explore fics is to look at the various one-shot and idea collection the exist out there. These are fics that usually last a single chapter between 1k and 10k words. Some are as small as a single scene and others are complete but trimmed stories. While this link is over a year old, it's still relevant and a good jumping off point, and I still use it occasionally.

*What to search for*

When looking for new stories on your own, there are four things to really keep in mind.

First is the summary: if there are spelling/grammar errors or it's really incoherent, the rest of the story will be worse.

Next is the wordcount: between 2k and 5k per chapter is generally the best possible range. Lower and it feels rushed, higher and it feels too dense. Your preferences may vary.

Then consider the status: is it complete or not, and is there a note in the summary saying it's abandoned, on hiatus, has a sequel, etc. Obviously completed stories takes away the possibility of them never being finished but following a story is cool too.

Lastly there's the update date. If it's incomplete but recently updated, that's good to know and bodes well for the completion of the story, and if it's complete but updated years ago, you know you should give it an extra bit of leeway as it may have been before some of the books came out or before some plot points and cliches became overdone and lame.
