Once you've gotten this far, you know just about everything you need for reading fanfiction. If you want to leave this thread here and go exploring now, you'd be just about as prepared as I can get you, and I wish you good luck. The following sections are mostly to just get you acquainted with the fandom as a whole rather than specific stories.

One of the main issues you might see pop up in authors notes and reviews is the difference between canon, fanon, and headcanon. They are fairly clear cut, but some people tend to confuse the latter two with the first.

Canon means the contents of the original work, as well as occasionally [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod][Word of God (trope)]] such as tweets, and additional works such as Pottermore. The [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/][Lexicon]] and the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page][Wiki]] both have all of canon pretty much covered.

Fanon is ideas and thoughts about canon that weren't explicitly stated in the books that are generally accepted by a large portion of the fandom. The most used example is Charlus and Dorea Potter, who were seen on the Black Family Tapestry, being James Potter's parents and therefore Harry's grandparents. Though that has recently been explicitly disproved by Pottermore, it is present in so many fics and so completely accepted that its part of the fanon. Additional bits of fanon are listed in the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanon/HarryPotter][tvtropes page]] I linked above.

Headcanon on the other hand is a single person's fanon. This can range from simple things like the color of Petunia's flowers all the way to the function of magic in the universe. The latter would be [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VOF1eu_B7qpTeTUykW5ZGK2HJmVAG5WouY71a5AiRPo/][Taure's headcanon document]] where he discusses his ideas and beliefs on the fundamentals of magic. Headcanon most often has to do with character descriptions and especially sexuality, most of which is based on the person's feelings and opinions instead of descriptions in canon.

I mentioned above that the audience age gap between the early books and the final books caused a lot of people to question the motives of the characters. One such user, ARedHair, has written up a rather exhaustive list of these issues as well as plot holes and gaffes. Among other things it serves as a list of almost every plot point that authors like to change and exploit in their stories. While the tone and format can be off-putting for some users, I personally find it interesting and useful. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Earedhair][Here's a link]].

Another project that is probably considered headcanon, even though it uses mostly evidence from the books and JKR's comments, is a very detailed map of Hogwarts and the grounds that was made by Whitehound and is maintained on his [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/map_of_Hogwarts.htm][website]]. It is an incredible tool for authors who want to keep their setting accurate across stories. He also has several other essays which are interesting reads. Thanks to /u/Taure for the suggestion.

*** [[/r/HPFanfiction]] and General Reddit notes.

If you're new to reddit in general, you definitely want to download [[http://redditenhancementsuite.com/][Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES)]], learn [[https://gyazo.com/88e7c518b60ac300fa76939a22a82ef8.gif][how to flair posts (gif)]], learn [[https://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/cw70q/reddit_comment_formatting][how to format posts]], and get acquainted with our mods: /u/denarii (the boss), /u/tusing (the bot creator), and /u/kemistreekat (the friendly one). (Just smile and wave, don't get too close they might bite, yes even Kat.)

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3d40r7/guide_so_you_wish_you_had_more_harry_potter_the/][Our mod /u/tusing created a guide]] several months ago that I secretly hope to have blown completely out of the water but contains some additional thoughts and opinions that aren't all bad (I'm totally kidding by the way, tusing is great as is the post and the discussion within).

The sidebar has a bit of the information I posted above, but one thing you should make note of especially is the [[https://github.com/tusing/reddit-ffn-bot/wiki/Usage][subreddit's linker bot]], created by /u/tusing and some others. It has greatly streamlined recommendations on this sub and has made everything a bit easier and more enjoyable. One of the tools included in the bot is downloading stories from ffnet to ereader files. That's done with this site: [[http://www.p0ody-files.com/ff_to_ebook/download.php?id=]] where the id is found [[https://gyazo.com/88849c936a5cbbab70d4e154c8fc7012.gif][like this (gif)]].

*Finding a story with [[/r/hpfanfiction]]*

While reddit's search bar sucks in general, for shorter searches you should have some luck with it. Things like “Time travel”, “Sad”, and “Draco” tend to have good results. If you can't find a story and want to submit a “looking for” or “LF” request, to best help the people responding to you, try to include as many details as you can think of:

- Site it was posted on
- When you read it
- Completion status (abandoned, in progress, complete, sequel/prequel)
- Approximate length in chapters and/or words
- Main characters and OC names, if any
- Setting\\
- Genre/theme
- Cliches used
- as many scenes that stick out to you as possible

Most of the replies are someone knowing exactly what story you're talking about already or some exceptional Google-fu hitting the result on the first page. The latter basically comes down to jamming enough keywords into the search to trick Google into giving you what you want. Localization and your search/page history is a factor in this though, so your mileage may vary here as well. Luckily, Google has a search option that removes personalization (pws=0) so we can test results. An example being if I remember a story that had Nicolas Flamel and Draco had a tattoo, those terms come back with the exact stories in [[https://www.google.com/webhp?pws=0&gws_rd=ssl#pws=0&q=harry+potter+fanfiction+nicolas+flamel+draco+tattoo][results 2 and 3]] . Fairly easy right?
