After talking about all the lost sites and fics I generally have to pause here a moment as I'm reminded that just a few months ago that another two sites fell, TrioFic, and TheQuidditchPitch. A lovely woman named Triisha who went by the penname Simons_Flower among others, was a mother, a wife, a friend, one of the most prolific authors of trio fics, and cofounder of TQP. She passed away suddenly in 2009 at just 37 years old. In the last few years we've lost other amazing authors such as Broomstick Flyer and MSgt Silver Dollar, and now Bobmin too is dying of cancer. Among the other untold hundreds of abandoned stories and accounts, there are surely quite a few others what passed away suddenly and without any way for us to know and memorialize.

On the one hand, it's sad that they're gone and their work will never be finished, but on the other, how amazing is it that those ideas can get out there at all? In the past, if a creator passed away before completing their work, more often than not it's lost to the sands of time but with fanfiction and other online media, you don't have to wait until it's done. You can upload and keep records and open it up for the world to see. It might not be a life changing legacy to be written about in history books but surely entertaining even one person makes it all worth it. I know I believe that.
