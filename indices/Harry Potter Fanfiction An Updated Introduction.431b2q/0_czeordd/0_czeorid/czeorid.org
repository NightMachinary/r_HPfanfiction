Before I send you out into the wonderful world of fanfiction, you need at least some tools to sift through the junk fast enough to not become disenchanted. Too many people come in here looking for some good entertainment, read one or two recs, and go out on their own without knowing what to avoid, and end up finding the worst of the worst. Just like that not only do they not come back, but they often are left with such a bad impression that they discourage others from discovering fanfiction. Nobody will deny that there is bad fanfiction, but some of the good stuff is so good that it is worth all the effort. That's not to say every fic that uses those cliches is bad, just most of them.

The influence of those former shipping sites can still be seen in the fics on the major archives. Cliches, tropes, memes, and even some characters (ex: Amelia Bones is a fan creation in all but name and title, while Connie Hammer, who pops up in fics by several dozen authors, is completely fan created) are still recycled from story to story. There's at one decently praised author who was born just 18 days before the release of the first chapter of After the End, one of the most influential early stories, written by Sugar Quill mods Arabella and Zsenya. She hadn't even read the story until just recently, more than a year after reading and writing fics, yet traces of that story's ideas are still visible in her fics. (Out of respect for her privacy and age, I won't be naming her.)

As you read fanfiction you'll become very familiar with a couple cliches that reappear constantly. Most of these come from two things: the tone shift between the first half of the series and the last half, and pity. The dissonance between Harry Potter as a children's story and Harry Potter as a young adult novel causes many, many authors to conclude that those on the “good” side, such as the Weasleys and Dumbledore, must have been evil, and that they intentionally caused Harry strife. These authors tend to pity poor Harry.

  He's a good kid and he deserves better. You know what he needs? A boatload of money, all the magical devices and books he could ever buy, the most expensive shrinkable trunk, complete with hidden apartments, and why not have the Goblins give him lists of stolen abilities which read like the wiki page as well enough evidence to get the good side's own grandmother to incarcerate them. That should do it!.

And then there's no good plot left because [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue][Gary Stu (tvtrope)]] just won everything without lifting a finger.

There are other characters that get the pity treatment as well, such as Draco and Snape, who are made out to be sad and lonely instead of twisted murderers. Both situations are trope namers: [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater][Ron the Death Eater]], and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants][Draco in Leather Pants]].

As you become more familiar with fanfiction, you'll find more and more of these types of situations. These cliches are often used as a lower limit of what makes a fic generally unentertaining because they tend to eliminate any and all challenges to the protagonist without any effort, or create challenges that are completely illogical. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanon/HarryPotter][This TVTropes fanon page]] has a small list of the most used fanon misconceptions that appear in Harry Potter fanfiction. While it's not really a comprehensive list of cliches and themes that tend to resurface frequently, it has fairly good explanations of the ones it does have. Thanks to /u/Lane_Anasazi for the suggestion.

As they are usually frontloaded to the first three chapters, they show a lack of creativity that will almost definitely be continued through the rest of the story. For most readers, especially those of us who have been around a while, it's just boring. For you, as a new reader, you might not find it to be as bothersome, but as you read more you'll be able to recognize these things, and I find it's best to be straightforward and point out they exist instead of pretending every single story is unique and worth reading.
