Fanfiction in the Harry Potter Universe has existed since shortly after the Chamber of Secrets book was released, but exploded in popularity between July 2000 and June 2003. This period known as the Three Year Summer started with the release of Goblet of Fire and ended with the release of Order of the Phoenix and is the longest break between books. The release of the first film in November 2001 and the second a year later also contributed to the boom.

By and large the fandom has been generally organized by pairing rather than plot. Most stories are written with the intent of getting two (or more) characters together. This is known as “shipping”, a term broken off of “relationship”. The shipping wars, though tongue-in-cheek, shaped the fandom from its inception.

In the first decade, there were untold dozens of sites, including many yahoo groups, subforums, geocities, early social media sites such as tumblr, mailing lists, and usenet groups. Almost every single one was started as a repository for a specific pairing, such as Harry/Hermione on [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/fanfiction][Portkey]], Draco/Ginny on [[http://www.dracoandginny.com/][Fire and Ice]], Remus/Sirius on [[http://www.wolfandhound.com/storyline/][Wolf and Hound]], and Harry/Draco on [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/][Hex Files]]. Being largely decentralized, it is impossible to count the number of fics that were created during this period.

While fanfiction did see another boom in 2007 and again in 2010, the release of the final book and movie respectively, it has generally lacked sustainable growth and as such many sites have closed their doors, and their users migrated to larger sites, if they migrated at all.

At least 80 of the 180 sites listed on [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_Archives][Fanlore]] are completely gone from the internet and many more have lost databases or been scrubbed by admins. At least one, the once booming Sugar Quill, has closed submissions but remain open for viewing. Today there are less than a dozen sites that receive regular submissions. Here are some of the most recommended sites:

- Fanfiction.net: FFNet: While the absentee admins are generally disliked, and many parts of the site have been in dire need of overhauls for at least a decade, it is the standard site for submissions at over 702,000.
- ArchiveOfOurOwn: AO3 is run by a nonprofit that is attempting to centralize legal defense of fanfiction and its authors. HP content is mosly smut and slash. The site is actively trying to create backups of other failing sites. ~89,000 submissions
- HarryPotterFanfiction: Ran “The Dobbys” fanfiction awards from 2007-2013. ~83,000 submissions
- HP.Adult-Fanfiction.org: Started in 2002 when FFNet removed NC-17 fics. ~21,000 submissions
- Ficwad: FFNet competitor. ~1900 submissions
- Wattpad: FFNet competitor. Pain in the ass to use and impossible to search. ~10-50k stories
- HPFanficArchive: HPFFA is small and generally adult-oriented. ~1200 submissions\\
- FanficAuthors: Has some of the most popular authors' works, and members are invite only. <500 submissions\\

As is probably obvious, FFNet has always been a fixture in the HPFF community. Despite a number of competitors and off-shoots, it is still the largest and most active site both in reviews and submissions. As such, it is this writer's recommendation that new authors primarily stick to FFNet where stories receive the most possible attention and where it is convenient for readers. While it is sad to see further decimation of the fandom's many sites, in the end it benefits the audience most.
