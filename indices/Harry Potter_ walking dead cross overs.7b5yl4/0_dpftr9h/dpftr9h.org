I've never found any worth reading. That said, I've been slowly working on a fic in which Harry visits the US in the summer after his 5th year and events conspire to have him become embroiled in the zombie apocalypse, and eventually replace Noah in season 5 episode 4 "Slabtown" in TWD canon.

Later, in season 5 episode 8 "Coda" Harry saves Beth and the two (re)join TWD crew on the Alexandria campaign.
