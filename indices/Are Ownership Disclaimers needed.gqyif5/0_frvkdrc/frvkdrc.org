It is not because of JKR, she is really cool with fanfic stories. There used to be an author who did try to sue for something which she claimed was copy of her work. I forgot the name.

And yes, I believe those disclaimers are pure [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult][Cargo Cult]] ... I believe, for the breach of copyright, you have to actively claim you own Harry Potter. If you say nothing, nothing happens, and JKR could be OK, and you own only rights to your own work.
