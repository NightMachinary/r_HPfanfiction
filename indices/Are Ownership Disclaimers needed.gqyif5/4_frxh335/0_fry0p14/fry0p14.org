Uh... depends how you're defining it. The intent behind a copyright infringement is very important as educational or critical intents are indeed some of the few exceptions where copyrighted material can be used without any consent of the creator and in direct opposition to the copyright holder's wishes.

Fanfiction doesn't fall under that generally, so JKR can take it down at any point.
