If you use someone else's copyrighted intellectual property without their permission, that's copyright infringement. There are fair use exceptions for news, analysis, criticism, and the like. A judge will look at whether the new work transforms the old work, whether the new work is made for commercial purposes, whether the new work discourages people from buying the old work, and how much the new work copies from the old work.

Disclaimers, as far as legality is concerned, don't help you. Copyright infringement doesn't look at your intent. In fact, writing a disclaimer proves that you were aware that your new work could be seen as copyright infringement and you did it anyway. No way you can pretend ignorance when you're aware of the term â€˜copyright infringement'.

JKR can sue any and all fanfic authors for copyright infringement, disclaimer or not. On a practical level, published authors aren't in the habit of suing noncommercial fanfic authors. On a more practical level, I remember an FFN fic complaining about how FFN required a disclaimer and putting in a gibberish disclaimer.

So, disclaimers aren't worth much, don't bother unless someone like the hosting website insists.
