I would 100% agree with you from a technical standpoint, but in Blandge's work not only one but both Harry's stay rather true to character. The fem!Harry in Equal and Opposite is more of an OC than anything; we don't see any elements of the Harry from canon. This to me is what makes "Self Reflection" so good; the characterization of both Harry's and the comfort they find in each other I find very believable and the characters feel true.
