I remember one fanfic which took an interesting take on him being a phoenix animagus. He acquires the form of a phoenix, but none of the abilities of one, beyond the flight that any bird can accomplish.

Personally, I'm fond of the idea of him having a bird animagus form generally, so much so that I tend to find it a little off when he doesn't have one. I personally lean towards him being a Rook, a clever bird from Scandinavia with black feathers.
