I, too, am fond of the idea of a bird animagus form. As alternatives a flying insect or maybe even a bat could work as well. The former has the bonus that he can spy on people while he's unnoticeable while the latter have poor eye sight just like Harry with the added bonus that he can spread the corona virus and become the boy-who-caused-a-pandemic.
