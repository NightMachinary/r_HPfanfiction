I think it also depends on how much you think magic guides the broom. If it just just simple propulsion then you would use a lot of different muscles to move it in various directions and if you think about how hard it would be to keep yourself on a broom hanging upside down or banked in a turn I could see a player becoming very tones, especially core, forearms and shoulders. But if in your headcannon its all controlled by magic and intent, Including actually staying on the broom then yeah, I imagine a seeker would be really tiny and weedy thin with a heavy emphasis on weight control around games.
