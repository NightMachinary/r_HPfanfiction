  I would assume it is the same as race car drivers. I mean, have you seen the Formula 1 drivers? They look like olympic swimmers with the neck muscles of weightlifters. They also only sit in their car and do nothing. But if a normal person that has not done it before and has not built the required muscles over time would experience those insane forces during a race, they would come out with a handful of broken bones, assuming with their lack of muscles they could even make it through the track fast enough to generate those forces, which is doubtful.
