I'm no expert, but I imagine you would develop some muscles by playing Quidditch. There is some effort in maneuvering and staying on the broom, especially in bad weather when there's more resistance, just like riding a horse (or so I'm told). And it would depend on the position, too. Beaters probably would develop their arms and upper bodies to some degree by hitting those bludgers, for example.

Toned might be a better way to think about it for most players. Not heavy muscles.
