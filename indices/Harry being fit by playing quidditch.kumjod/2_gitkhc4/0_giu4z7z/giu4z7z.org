I think it's safe to assume that the players have to train as every player except the seeker has to use their upper body heavily. you don't throw with just the arm normally, you use the rest of your body as well. So you'd probably train so that you can complete those crazy plays. And there isn't a chance in hell that Harry gets out of training with everyone. On the broom front, you summarized everything perfectly. Though I personally hold with the idea that it requires effort. Think about what would happen if you had a stray thought about going to the right on a firebolt. Eek
