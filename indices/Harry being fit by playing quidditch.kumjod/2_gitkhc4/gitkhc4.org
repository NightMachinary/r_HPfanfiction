Entirely depends on how you think the broom works.

Race car drivers are /fit/. They have to be, otherwise they couldn't cope with the acceleration strains (from turns, not at the start!). Professional cyclists are fit ... and not only have they got strong legs, but also strong upper bodies and arms, because they carry the bodyweight for prolonged stretches of time. The position is similar to how one would suppose wizards are sitting on a broom; as is the acceleration strain.

/Unless/, of course, you say everything is magic, and the wizard sitting on a broom can magically make turns on a dime without feeling anything, and the broom basically is steered by intention, not your hands, and essentially you have a flying armchair.

Your call. It's never specified in Canon.
