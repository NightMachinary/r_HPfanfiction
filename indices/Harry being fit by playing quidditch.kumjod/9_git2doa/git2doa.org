Some minor muscles would be worked in the legs, forearms, and core. They would likely be not get jacked from Quidditch however. On the professional level I'd expect to see fitter players. Just like in racing, keeping yourself in shape would allow better performance. Racers watch their weight and exercise to withstand the forces of their vehicles. But at a school level? No way in hell. At best they'd have forearms like Popeye's. They would gain the bare minimum level of muscle necessary to ride a broom at that level. I can see being lean as encouraged though, as Oliver made a comment about a seeker's build when we first met him.

Racers aren't even that crazy though, as being lean is encouraged, rather than being necessary. I think a lot of people think of athletes as musclebound, when they're really not. It's not practical, they only need the muscle to play the sport. Anymore would be impractical.

That's the best I can get before pulling out the reference photos and complex plans

To respond to some other points here, toning is just the ratio of muscle to fat. More lean? More toned. Less lean? Less toned. It's a body composition term. You don't have toned muscles, you have a toned body. This drives me insane.
