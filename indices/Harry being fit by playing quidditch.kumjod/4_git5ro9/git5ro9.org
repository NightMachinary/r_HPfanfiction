Its the fact that he's going through puberty the entire time he's playing quidditch, as he grows up he develops these muscles from living an active lifestyle and because he's getting older and eating proper meals. Think of how much walking they do in that school alone, which would also build up muscles and keep you in relatively good shape. He's got the body type to be naturally fit without much effort, when you add in the quidditch and everything else its natural he would be considered fit compared to some of the other students. The majority of guys in high school usually put on muscle just the same.
