I consider mostly the seven books and Pottermore/Wizarding World as canon.

However, some of Rowling's Pottermore writings do conflict with the books (primary canon), such as the whole Polyjuice can last ten minutes to twelve hours per dose, depending on the quality of the brewing.

In book 4, Dumbledore says that Crouch Jr forgot to take his potion by the hour, every hour. Overall, there's no indication that Polyjuice can ever have a change in effect-time.

You'd think that someone as talented as Crouch Jr, and who pilfered ingredients from Snape's stores (likely high quality), would've ended up nearing or reaching that twelve-hour mark each time.
