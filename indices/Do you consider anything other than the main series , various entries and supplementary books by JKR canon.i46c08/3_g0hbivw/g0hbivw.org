Look at it this way:

- Primary Canon (NOT *cannon*. Please. The firearms jokes are getting boring): The books.

- Secondary Canon: Movies, extra books (Cursed Child). Can be considered canon if it doesn't contradict primary. If it does, primary has preference.

- Tertiary canon: JK's Twitter. Games (?). Others: Can be considered canon if it doesn't contradict primary nor secondary.
