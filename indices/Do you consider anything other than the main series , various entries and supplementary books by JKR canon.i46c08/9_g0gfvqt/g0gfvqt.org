I don't even consider the epilogue canon :D

FB is more canon than cursed child. but to me only the HP books(!) are canon. even stuff they changed for the movies in not canon. like Hermione in pink dress instead of blue... etc. (or the infamous raven and white for ravenclaw) I just don't like the movies, the only ones that didn't bother me were third and sixth. I can't stand watching the others.

I actually liked the first FB movie much better than HP movies. the second one just completely ruined it. it completely trashed the whole series, the rest would have to be brilliant to save it and that probably won't happen. we just can't have nice things. :(

cursed child, definitely not canon to me.
