I just consider anything from Rowling canon but quietly ignore the bits I don't like. If there are two conflicting pieces of canon (which sometimes occurs even when you consider solely the books canon), I just pick the version I like better. Considering I only write canon compliant stuff, I actually don't worry about it too much.
