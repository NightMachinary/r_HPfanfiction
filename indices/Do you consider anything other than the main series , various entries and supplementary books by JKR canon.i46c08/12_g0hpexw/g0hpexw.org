It's all canon, but some of it is canon I ignore and don't mind when fanfiction authors ignore, and some of it is set in stone canon. I consider the books to be the primary source of canon. The Fantastic Beasts films are sort of ... I consider that the events probably happened in some shape or form but maybe not exactly as shown. Pottermore is supplementary canon imo, I don't mind if authors ignore it but I use lots of it myself.

I pretend Cursed Child doesn't exist but tbh I don't mind some details (I'm indifferent to Delphini, I don't mind that Harry has a strained-ish relationship with one of his children).
