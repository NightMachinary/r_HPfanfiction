I mean, personally, I don't really care. What canon is only really matters if stuff being canon compliant or not matters to you - and that doesn't matter to me in the slightest.

At the end of the day, canon is either what the creator says it is or it's what's in the original work. Those're the definitions of the word, in the literary sense. You can have layers of canon, technically, so you can have 'movie canon', 'book canon', 'social media canon', etc without them necessarily having to combine.

But really, fanon matters more to me than canon. Part of the appeal of Harry Potter to me is the creativity of the fandom community, fanon and headcanon and all, and all the stuff you can create in the playground sandpit that is Rowling's original works. Rowling, whatever you can say about her works, created a really great playground for us all to build our own little sandcastles and play our own little games in and that's far more interesting and important to me than what colour she says the climbing frame is.

Which is basically a really rambly way of saying "I agree with Starfox." :D
