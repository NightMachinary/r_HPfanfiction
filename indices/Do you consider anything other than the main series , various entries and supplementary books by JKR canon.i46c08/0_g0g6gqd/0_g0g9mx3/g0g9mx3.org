  Cursed child was written by a playwriter with daddy issues and then given the canon label by JKR. I don't think it was written by her and thus we can consider it non-canon, despite JKR's claims. Fantastic beasts falls under the same thing.

I am afraid the Fantastic Beasts are truly by Ms Rowling. Yes, that cursed Cursed Child is probably just poor piece of fanfiction signed by JKR to get more money (and yes, I know, that she is not greedy for herself, but for the Lumos foundation), but FB is I am afraid all her (and the main piece of evidence, why she should be never allowed to write anything else than novels, yes, somebody else could adapt it for films afterwards, but she herself should be kept sitting on her behind until she really spends time and effort to thought through a novel). Whether you consider it to be part of the HP Universe and canon there is another question, but I am afraid we cannot get out of it so easy as with CC. And yes, in terms of the universe development (and using spells and stuff) it is horribly sloppily written.

There is not much from FB1 which is worthy of salvaging (FB2 should be just mercifully forgotten and never mentioned again and I don't think I will bother to go to watch FB3), but there is something: I like generally the main characters (I would *love* to read the story of Modesty Barebone post-film ... something in the lines of linkffn(12278819), a cross-over between HP-universe and Oliver Twist, a poor beggar witchlette living on the streets of New York in 1920s'), Obscurials are not a bad idea (and the explanation of Ariana Dumbledore), the existence of MACUSA and Ilvermorny (not THE American school, but AN American school). And that's basically it.
