I have a hard time believing FB is all Rowling.

FB introduces so much new magic that it just kind of negates the mystery of Harry Potter. For example, the "blow golden dust out of your wand" thing. If this was /really/ a thing then Riddle would have been caught opening the chamber of secrets and would would be used by Aurors /all the time/. Then there's the "obscurus" thing that Dumbledore does when he's standing on the rooftop. That's reaching extreme power creep. I even disliked how the movies showed random death eaters being able to fly. It's supposed to be advanced dark magic.

And the entire premise of a muggle being able to participate in and see everything makes /no/ sense. I expected that guy to be booted in like ten minutes but he's in every movie!

Edit:

Also that "we killed the family but here's the baby, we need to kill him too" part in FB2 just made me roll my eyes.

And "No-Maj"? Come on.
