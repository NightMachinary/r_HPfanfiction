Unpopular opinions:

I don't consider fantastic beasts canon. I'm still eagerly awaiting the next film. Sure, there are some things I don't like. But it's still HP magic on a screen, I'm excited.

Cursed child was written by a playwriter with daddy issues and then given the canon label by JKR. I don't think it was written by her and thus we can consider it non-canon, despite JKR's claims. Fantastic beasts falls under the same thing.

I think that pottermore content is canon, whether people like it or not. Yes, people make a big deal about wizards shitting on the floor but if you have cleaning spells and vanishing spells, it's not so entirely out of left field. It's written by JKR, and it /is/ canon.

Main books are obviously canon.

For discussion purposes, if someone cites something written by JKR that does not directly contradict the 7 books, I consider that canon and worthy evidence.
