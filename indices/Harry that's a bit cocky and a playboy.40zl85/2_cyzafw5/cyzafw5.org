The one story which popped into my head while reading the title of this post was linkffn(West of Here by MK-ONE). It is unfinished but receives an update every now and then, featuring a Harry Potter who is quite literally from another time and place. Harry is, for once, not politically correct, which is one big reason why any new chapter always teases an amused smile from my lips. Don't take it seriously, it's not meant to be read like that, and you can have your fun too.
