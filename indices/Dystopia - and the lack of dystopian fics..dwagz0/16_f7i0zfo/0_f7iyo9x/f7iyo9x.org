To me, it's not the pairing but the usual characterisation and dynamic present in these fics.

There are quite a few fics of this kind, that have Snape and/or Draco and/or Lucius and/or some other Death Eater sheltering or taking possession of Hermione once Voldemort wins. The problem is that Hermione is usually portrayed as innocent, careless, and flighty; whereas the DE is portrayed as mature, wise, cool-headed, meticulous, and powerful. And, the fic itself is less about trying to resist the new regime---except when Hermione's impulsive, poorly thought-out, inept, and ultimately futile attempts create trouble for the DE, opportunities for the DE to rescue her from danger she had gotten herself into, and to chide her for it---and more about angst and some sort of a Harlequin romance with a side of Stockholm Syndrome.

Not that there is anything wrong if you are into that sort of thing.

Does this apply to the two fics you've recommended? My general sense is that the Snape pairings tend to portray Hermione as mature and powerful far more often than the other Hermione/DE fics.
