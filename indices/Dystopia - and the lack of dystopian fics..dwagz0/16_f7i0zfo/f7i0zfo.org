Unto Their Own by CRMediaGal linkffn(9681003) and Princess of Gryffindor by Aurette linkffn(5490903) are two of my favorite "Voldemort won" stories, by two of my favorite authors in general. They're both Severus/Hermione though, and I know it's an unpopular pairing on this subreddit, so fair warning.
