Sadly, I think a lot of HP fanfic writers going for dark wizarding worlds go for (Edge) Lord Potter setups, which are totally fine, just not my cup of tea. A lot of Marauders era fics have dystopian air to them, and they're usually pretty well written. I don't know how to do links on here & I can't think of names off the top of my head, but there was a series of one-shots focusing on the bystanders and reluctant participants of the first Wizarding War that really captured that air well. If you're interested, I can for sure dig it up & post the title
