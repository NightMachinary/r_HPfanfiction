I would like to add another Voldemort Wins dystopia. It's short but extremely dark and disturbing. I hate this Voldemort and his Harry so much that I would like to skin them myself.It's actually quite rare for me to feel this kind of hatred when reading a fanfic. As portioned from a whole [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6524323/chapters/14925616][As Portioned from a Whole]]

A large portion of well-written harrymort/tommarry,rare as they are,are dystopia. Past Enemies. Future dark kingdom fic. Darker than Prince of the dark kingdom. Much lighter than As portioned from a whole because muggles are left untouched.
