Sorry for the late reply, but here are a few I've enjoyed:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13047893/1/Beyond-the-Curtain][Beyond the Curtain]] (already recommended by many other people in this thread)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6512582/1/Keep-Your-Enemies-Closer][Keep Your Enemies Closer]] - The fic begins in Harry's 6th year. After Voldemort wins he immediately begins reshaping wizarding Britain to his ideal vision.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18851794/][Mi Aedijekit]] - Set thousands of years after Voldemort has won. The technomagically advanced nation he now rules can't remember that Britain was ever without an immortal dictator to rule it. (This is a new fic and hasn't reached the meat of its plot yet, but I think you might enjoy it because it has the same central pairing as 'The Philosopher King'.)
