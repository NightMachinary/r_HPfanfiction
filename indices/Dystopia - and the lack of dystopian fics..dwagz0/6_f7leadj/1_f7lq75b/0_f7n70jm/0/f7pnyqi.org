I'm sorry if it's not what you're hoping for as a description, but I am terrible regarding what I consider to be spoilers (that's what my husband says at least, when I don't watch movie trailers with him...).

In the first book Harry learns to live in this society and we learn about how it works. Harry attracts negative attention.

In the second book, we learn more about the problems of the society, their origins and their possible solutions. Also, Harry plans to change the current situation.

In the third book, Harry's revolution. Voldemort's war (he's not the main event, but he has a nice subplot).

I'm not sure how accurate this is, the last time I've read it was almost a year ago. This is the general gist of it...

Please make sure you're at least 18 and with a stomach for terrible things, sexual things and terrible sexual things.
