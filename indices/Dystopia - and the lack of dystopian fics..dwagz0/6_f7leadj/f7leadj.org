Uhmm.... I'm absolutely appalled that nobody recced one of the most dystopian and probably the longest truly disturbing, mature and horrifying series:

linkffn(8629685) - Firebird's Son trilogy. You have institutionalized slavery, magic used to bound people to the state (worldwide), civil wars, truly fucked up gender mechanics and so on and so forth... it's one of the most terrifying worlds in all of fandom. Even the good guys, so to speak are morally grey at BEST.
