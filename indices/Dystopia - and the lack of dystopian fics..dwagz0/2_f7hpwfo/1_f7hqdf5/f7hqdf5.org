You could potentially introduce some new magic elements to make it possible for the MC to save the world. Maybe it could be that the first MC starts laying a plan, and then the next generation someone finishes it.

Also, why is wizards ruling over muggles a bad thing? Adds to the dystopian feel, in my opinion; also maybe due to the fact that the wizard overlords secretly have quite a few bastard children with muggles, over time non-magical humans become more and more rare?
