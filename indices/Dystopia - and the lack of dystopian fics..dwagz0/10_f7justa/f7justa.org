Here's one where Ariana isn't killed, so Dumbledore never leaves Grindelwald linkao3(9042050).

This fic is more about the Ministry of Magic being corrupt, and isn't an AU. It is quite dark and sad though. linkao3(16586783)

Time travel fic where Harry pretends to be a squib. Deals with discrimination squibs face from wizarding society, gets very dark. Not completed yet, but is almost done and updated regularly. linkao3(35902410)

Not quite a dystopia, but it's pretty dark (though not in the way you'd expect). Tom Gaunt is the DADA professor. linkao3(924488)

Someone else already recced it, so I'll just mention that you should definitely check And the Wolves All Cry.
