It depends on what you qualify as a dystopia frankly. If you take a somewhat loose definition, then most of canon certainly qualifies with the imbalance of wizard activities related to muggles (one gets the impression low level harrassment is much more common by the wizarding population than just the blood purists).

There are quite a few fics I can think of that have various dystopian worlds setup - here are just a few examples linkffn(Beyond the Curtain by Bobika; The Dark Lord Never Died by Starfox5; Reign of the Serpent; Prince of the Dark Kingdom; The Pureblood Pretense; Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is a Dish Best Served Raw; Hogwarts Battle School; Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma; The Legacy Preservation Act).

What you'll notice is practically all of them qualify as dystopias. But the thing is a dystopian society is one based around some sort of injustice being applied to part or all of society. That is ridiculously common in fiction, partly because that is ridiculously common in real life and partly due to the fact that there is an extreme range of variability for "injustice in society."

I think what you are really asking is: why aren't there more fics that depict a society like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nations_of_Nineteen_Eighty-Four#Oceania][Oceania]] in Nineteen Eighty-Four? That good sir can be answered quite simply with 1) that does not mesh well with the tone/style of Harry Potter in general (even the really bad things essentially are all brief and/or offscreen) and 2) it takes a lot of time and effort to create and set up such a dystopia, to really think about both the society and how it would work, which is often well beyond the threshold of most authors (it is for fun after all, not work).
