Oh I just remembered a fic - dystopian, sure, but some of the best world-building ever. Linkffn(3766574). I'm sure you've already read this fic - I don't think any person on this subreddit would ever not have read this "Prince of the Dark Kingdom", but I just had to mention it. Long, but deservedly.
