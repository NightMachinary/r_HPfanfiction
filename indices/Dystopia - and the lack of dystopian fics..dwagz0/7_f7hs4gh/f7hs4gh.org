Well, this story isn't truly the "dystopia" you might imagine, but Emperor by Marquis Black is actually pretty close. Coz while it doesn't focus in the wizarding world taking over the muggles, it does focus in the wizarding world being influential enough to take over the muggles. One of the best stories ever, though drawn out at times, and more importantly, incomplete for the near, or even far, future.
