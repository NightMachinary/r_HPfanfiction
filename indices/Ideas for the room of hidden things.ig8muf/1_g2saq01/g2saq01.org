I don't know if any ofther fic did it, but I really like the take linkffn(*Forging the Sword*) had on the Room-of-Hidden-Things, where, despite being full of items, is mostly useless.

The room is regularly "discovered" by the castle student, and anything usefull would have been plundered by the previous generations, especially Tom Riddle who would have taken anything taking his fancy. All the items we see in the Room are there because nobody though it was worth taking there. The magical items are broken. The potions are either "failed product" or have been replaced by better ones since they were placed there. And the books look more like "/Veracrass, their life, their story/" rather the "/Magik Most Evil/". I guess there could also be some money too, but not a fortune, just a handfull of knuts and sickles, with maybe one or two galleon that have been lost in the last 40 or 50 years. Enough to buy something nice like a broom (but not a top of the line one, and probably second hand), but not enough to crash the market.

Also, I never understood why the MC should look into the Room of Hidden Things to get books, since the Room of Requirement can "create" books like it did for the DA. We don't know the limits of the spell (can it create any books? Only books in the castle? On in the library? Or maybe any book that passed inside the castle? . . .) but it's still better than to look into the trash hoping to find a nice one.
