the SI in linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff) does a lot of delving through the Room and finds pretty much all the stuff you mentioned.

Honestly the coolest thing in there would probably be the hidden books (guess which House I'm in lol) but all the /interesting/ ones would have nasty curses on them.
