Pretty much anything. The elves use it as a lost and found/storage/garbage. There's a lot of leeway just with the elves. Students have been using it for centuries, apparently mainly to hide contraband (horcruxes/potion textbooks with dark curses/empty sherry bottles). That said, most of the stuff in there is probably going to be junk. Either broken, way past it's expiration date or just plain useless.

I think you can also expect it to be at least somewhat dangerous. Think #12 Grimmauld Place taken up to 11. Doxies and boggarts are just a few things we know of that like to infest such places.

I remember one fic where Harry setup a small business going through the place. Harry, Ron and Dobby did the sorting with anything useful being sold through Gringotts for a cut. They didn't make a fortune by any means, but Harry noted Ron was a lot happier with some pocket money.
