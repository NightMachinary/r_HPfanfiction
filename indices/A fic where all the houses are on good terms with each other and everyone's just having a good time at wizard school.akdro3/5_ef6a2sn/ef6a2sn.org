I myself would suggest Hogwarts 1835, linkffn(5461818): a historical period piece as suggested by the title, set in 1825. Criminally underrated fic IMO, it has great writing, house rivalries are mostly just over Quidditch, and students from all houses make friends with one another. This far back there just wasn't any genuine animosity amongst the houses. For bonus it also has a great historical sense of place.
