Tamer, linkffn(7800059), off the top of my head this is an interesting one. This one might not be everyone's cup of tea and it might not be exactly what you had in mind. It's loaded with stereotypes (Lord Hadrian Potter, indy!Harry,' etc.) but there is some originality in it (no harems and Harry isn't uber rich among other things) which is why I bothered giving it a chance to begin with.

Harry and Malfoy are still rivals, but on the whole there's house harmony. The H/R/Hr, Neville, and Ginny are much more focused on their academics in the fic. I can recall some scenes where they all took turns helping people from other houses (including Slytherins) with their homework. Overall it's not the best writing and there are some cringe moments (Sirius and Remus referring to Harry as 'Bambi' for example...bleurrghhh!) but I thought it was a somewhat interesting take on the Lord Potter clich√© with some interhouse amicability.
