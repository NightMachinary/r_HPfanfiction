It's interesting because even in that case, your foreknowledge doesn't have to be guaranteed - just because events in the past have occurred a certain way doesn't imply that the events in the future (especially after your arrival) will be constant.

And I don't mean the small day to day changed but even the long term ones - it's possible that in this world, Wormtail escapes but maybe dies along the way to Albania - and if in any case you had no way to track him until you got the visions pre-GOF, you wouldn't know if he was alive or dead
