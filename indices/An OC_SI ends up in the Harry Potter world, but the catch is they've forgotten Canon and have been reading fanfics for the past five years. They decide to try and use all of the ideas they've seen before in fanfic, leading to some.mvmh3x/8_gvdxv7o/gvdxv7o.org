This actually reminded me of a thought I once had:

There's no way to guarantee that the reality you were thrown into is any version of the story you've seen before. Even if everything you've seen so far is the same, that doesn't mean everything that comes next will be. Reality has no need to conform to fiction.

Any foreknowledge, from canon or fanon, has no guarantees. Maybe Peter is a death eater, maybe he isn't. Maybe Harry is the chosen one, maybe he isn't. Maybe Dumbledore is manipulative, maybe he isn't.

Until you verify the facts in-universe, you can't know for sure. And thus you have no real advantage over the other people. Sure, your knowledge /might/ allow you to solve problems faster, but it could also all be inaccurate and send you down the wrong path every single time.
