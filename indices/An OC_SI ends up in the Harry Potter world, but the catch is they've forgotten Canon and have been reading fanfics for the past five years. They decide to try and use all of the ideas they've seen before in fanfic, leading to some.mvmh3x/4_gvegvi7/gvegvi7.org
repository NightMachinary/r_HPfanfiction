“The Greengrass family has the largest fortune in Europe! We must get them to join my side anyway possible. Preferably a way where Daphne ‘The Ice Queen' Greengrass touch's my penis”

“Yeah ..., mate there's just a couple problems with that plan. One is that Daphne Greengrass is an open and proud lesbian. Two, the reason they call her ‘The Ice Queen' is that her hands are made out of ice. So her touching your penis is a very bad idea. Third, the Greengrass family is poorer than mine. Even their name is a bit of a misnomer. Their ancestral home is located in the middle of a muddy puddle south of Cardiff and is even more haphazardly held together than the burrow. But fourth and most bloody important is the fact that you're already dating my Sister!”

“Those are all just details Ron. Don't let facts get in the way. Plus everyone know that I need a wife for all my inherited houses. Ginny is wife one, Daphne is wife two, and I think I'll make Tonks wife three after I let Remus die for following the werewolf laws and never visiting me as a child. Maybe my mom can be wife four? Since magical incest is fine”

“WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. NONE OF THAT IS TRUE! WHY WPULD YOU THINK ANY OF THAT IS TRUE! MADAME POMFREY HARRY HAS LOST HIS MARBLES!”
