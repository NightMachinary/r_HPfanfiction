"May your vaults overflow with gold and the blood of your enemies never dry on your sword!" 'Harry' announced as he walked in confidently in Gringotts to the first available Goblin teller.

The Goblin gave him a confused look but decided to act professionally, "Good day to you too. With what may I be of help to you today?"

"I, Harry Potter, friend of the Goblin nation have come to give you information of the utmost importance. I believe that the Lestrange vault is host to a Horcrux."

Now the Goblin was visibly confused, "A what now?"

"A piece of Voldemort's (the Goblin gasped at the sound of the name) soul is hosted within the Lestrange vault," 'Harry' repeated.

"And have you come to claim it, Mr. Potter?"

"No. I have come to ask you to destroy it. And while we are at it, I also seem to have a piece of Voldemort's soul latched onto my own. I was wondering whether any of your cursebreakers could remove it."

"I am afraid we do not know much about this Horcrux or soul magic for that matter. Our cursebreakers deal only with - well - curses. Having a piece of soul contained within an object does not qualify as a curse according to bank policy and therefore we cannot destroy it. As for your issue, have you tried St Mungo's?"

"I would like to see King Ragnok," 'Harry' insisted not willing to give up just yet. For some reason this had been the final straw for the Goblin as he yelled, "GET OUT!" while brandishing an axe at 'Harry'.

After he was out and well away from the angry Goblin, Harry shrugged and told himself, "I guess it was worth a try."
