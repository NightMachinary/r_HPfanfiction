Snape is very complicated.

In his teens he began to buy into Voldemort's spiel because he hated his abusive muggle father. His father sucked, and Voldemort offered a way to be more powerful than his father. That is a very tempting offer for any abuse victim.

But he also had strong cognitive dissonance because he loved Lily more than anyone else. Lily was Special. She was Apart.

Then Voldemort targeted Lily and the mirror cracked and Snape saw a little more clearly how deceived he'd been. I doubt it hit him like a thunderclap, but he likely over the years that followed came to understand that he'd been victimised by a powerful man.

By the time the events of the books happened, Snape no longer seemed to think that Muggles were all inherently /bad/ like Tobias was. But he was somewhat indifferent to them. He certainly did not feel that muggleborns were any less wizards than purebloods, though he kept that relatively quiet. Any time he insults a muggleborn student, it's always to do with their appearance or skills, never their lineage.

TLDR: Snape is the master of cognitive dissonance and likely has internally distanced himself from the whole debate
