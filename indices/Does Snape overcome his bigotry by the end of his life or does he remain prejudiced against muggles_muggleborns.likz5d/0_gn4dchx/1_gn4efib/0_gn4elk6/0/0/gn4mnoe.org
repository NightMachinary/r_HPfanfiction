How can he be a spy if he /is/ indifferent to muggleborns? Why would he continue to gamble everything if he didn't care?

Irl spies usually care a great deal about the people they are spying on behalf of, but they are able to “shut down” that part of themselves when they are “on the job”.

Snape has what is called /cognitive dissonance/, which is a series of conflicting beliefs all coexisting. Dumbledore is right and wrong. Muggleborns are equal and they are not. Muggles are evil and they are not. Lily is Better Than Everyone - but Lily is a Mudblood.

If a person with cognitive dissonance examines any of their beliefs too closely, they tend to have a crisis. Which is /exactly/ what happened when he was forced to face a conflict in his beliefs when Lily was threatened.

So he doesn't examine his beliefs too closely unless he's forced to, and they all exist together in a big contrary soup.
