I've never really viewed him as someone who is a 'muggle born bigot' as much as he was a victim of peer pressure. Not that this excuses what he's done, he was a bad person, but not for his views. There is likely some bigotry against muggles from the way he grew up, and his experience with muggles being generally negative. However, I think that his joining the death eaters and his activities during this time, was more a symptom of the people that he spent time with during school, and less because of his view on muggle-born.
