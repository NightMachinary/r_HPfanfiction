While I wouldn't exactly consider Snape a nice person, I don't think he ever was a Muggleborn bigot, even at his worst when he was a Death Eater. He was a halfblood himself after all, and didn't care about Lily being a Muggleborn. I do think he was prejudiced against Muggles, as a result of the experiences he had as a kid (Tobias and Petunia, and I doubt Spinner's End was the nicest neighborhood you could be part of), however, although I figured he got over it eventually. Not because he started caring for Muggles, but more on an intellectual level ("why would they be any different?") after seeing what the Wizarding World itself had to offer, from the best to the worst.

Yeah, he used terms like Mudblood and such in his youth, but I think it was mostly just to fit in with his other Slytherin housemates. I don't think he ever truly believed they were inferior.
