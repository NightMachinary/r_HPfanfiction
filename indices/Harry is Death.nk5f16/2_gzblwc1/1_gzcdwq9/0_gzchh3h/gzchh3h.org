Quite probably for the last of the four, since it takes place in the Buffyverse. For the first one, it only has limited influence from Buffy, so I *think* it should be easy enough to follow without having watched the show, but can't say for certain. I do know that I've been able to follow other crossovers by the same author that involve settings I knew little or nothing about, so chances are good you'd just miss a reference here or a joke there.
