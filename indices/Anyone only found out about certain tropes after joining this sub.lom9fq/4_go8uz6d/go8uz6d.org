The overlap btwn the fics I read and the fics this sub reads/recommends is almost nonexistent, so I thought the prevalence of all these tropes in the "What tropes do you hate the most" threads was just exaggerated in good fun. Then I read a linked fic from this sub, and out of nowhere there's Neutral!Daphne explaining magical cores. It was like going to Australia and seeing a giant huntsman spider right outside the airport. Like damn, y'all really weren't kidding!
