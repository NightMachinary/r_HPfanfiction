Prince Harry has the name Henry on his birth certificate, it's popular among nobility and posh people to do that. So if people are gonna do the “Harry has a posh birth name” trope I always thought Henry would fit quite nicely even if it doesn't have the same bad boy ring to it as Hadrian does haha. I like Harold as well, that sounds like it could be an ancestral name too.

It's quite a British thing to name someone Henry and call them Harry their whole lives (and very weird) so don't worry about not knowing it, it's obscure.
