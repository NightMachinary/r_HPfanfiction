Yeah, Daphne is a canon character, but because she is a blank slate fanon has basically created her character. Some things vary from fic to fic but overall she has become a widespread OC. For me, I mainly know her as Slytherin, Neutral and heiress to the Greengrass family with a little sister normally in Ginny's year called Astoria (although I think she's canonically in the year below Ginny). Beautiful blonde, blue eyes, that is friends with Tracey Davis, a brunette half-blood Slytherin of the same year.
