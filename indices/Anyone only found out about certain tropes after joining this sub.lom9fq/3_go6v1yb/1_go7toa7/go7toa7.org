I thought that was what named OC meant? A blank canon character so people adopt them into their stories because they can do whatever they want. Daphne seems to have acquired a kinda consistent characterization in fanon though lol

"Manipulative Dumbledore" was one I had already encountered many times, but didn't know how common and consistent some of the /real/ bashing was. Like the trope of him stealing all of Harry's money.
