I could be wrong, but I thought Daphne was actually a canon character who is only ever referenced during Harry's sorting? Because so little is known about her in canon she's a blank slate Slytherin that people can do whatever they want with, make her light, neutral, or dark, depending on their story.

Another big one is also Dumbles bashing. It can range from him being well intentioned but manipulative and short sighted to being highly egotistical and wanting Harry to die so he can defeat Voldy, to him being downright evil
