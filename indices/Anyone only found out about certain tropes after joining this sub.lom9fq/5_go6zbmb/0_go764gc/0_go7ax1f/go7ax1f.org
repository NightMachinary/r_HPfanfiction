Hmm. That's interesting. It's possible that I'm just a bit more forgiving than most. (Although I doubt that because Hermione's canon flaws are what makes her so interesting to me.)

The fic you linked wasn't Hermione-focused, so it makes me think that this trope is more prevalent in non-Hermione-centric fics? It would make sense then that I haven't met one. I almost exclusively read fanfic either focused on Hermione or has her as a significant character.

Edit: Yeesh. Why the downvotes?
