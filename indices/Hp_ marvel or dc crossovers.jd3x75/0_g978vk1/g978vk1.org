linkffn(Kicking Gotham) Arguably the best long HP/DC crossover.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-32735/Datatroll+Four+people+with+horrible+luck+Vegas+WTF.htm][4 People with horrible luck + Vegas= WTF!?]] HP/DC/BtVS x-over. Bloody Brandy that actually makes sense for its acceptance, and it's a fun story with a good amount of action. No idea why it has an age rating that high though.

linkffn(Invincible by Kathryn518) Excellent but probably abandoned.

linkffn(Intervention by Clel65619)

linkao3(Surrey Meets Smallville) Abandoned right as it was rounding into the realm of "Holy crap this is cool! What's next!"

linkffn(Harry's Raven)

MARVEL: linkao3(On Punching Gods and Absentee Dads) A few years after the Battle of New York Loki has been serving probation as an Avengers member. Harry finds out his real name is Haraldr Lokison. See title for response.

linkao3(Heroes Assemble)

linkffn(Spider's Web by Merrick Mayfair)
