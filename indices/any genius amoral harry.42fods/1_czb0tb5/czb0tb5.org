Not really genius but an intellectually curious and focused Harry who isn't afraid to go against the magical world's expectations of a "heroic" BWL. I really like it, and the author is moving quickly through the canon years instead of rehashing everything incrementally. linkffn(For Love of Magic by Noodlehamer)
