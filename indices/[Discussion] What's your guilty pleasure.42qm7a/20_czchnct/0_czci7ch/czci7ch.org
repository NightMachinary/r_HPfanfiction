I've read a lot of Harry/Daphne but is there actually any good Harry/fem!Blaise stories? I tried looking once and they all seemed pretty bad. The only good one I read was when Harry was her Grandfathers apprentice but the romance sucked because it was just a big love triangle with Hermione. I'll read H/Hr stories but I hate it when they throw her in as a conflicting love interest just to create angst.
