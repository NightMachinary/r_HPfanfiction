Harry/Slytherin girl. Sometimes this falls under marriage contracts, or political fics... sometimes it's just a typical Daphne story, or if it were 2005, fem!Blaise. The problem is, of course, that 99% of the stories suck. So, it's hard to call something a guilty pleasure if I take no actual pleasure from the badness, but rather, I feel like it's an unfulfilled desire to see one done properly.
