When I first discovered Harem fics I really liked them but soon got tired of the bad writing. Smut is all great and fine but I want some plot too. I feel a lot of writers attempt a Harem story planning to have lots of plot but then get caught up in the whole thing and turns mostly to smut. I found that Harry with two girls is usually more manageable but still has that Harem feel to it.
