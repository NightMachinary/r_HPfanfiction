I really love a smart!Harry, super!Harry (But, I generally only like this if Voldemort [or whoever the Big Bad is] is also super, it gets super boring otherwise), and Wrong Boy-Who-Lived. The thing is, there are lots of /poorly/ written fics in these categories, where it's hard to find a nice story because of either technical writing issues or general plot issues. This tends to contribute a lot to the stigma of these types of stories, I think.

In general, I don't really have strong likes/dislikes when it comes to pairings, if the author can make it work. I tend to avoid slash, but don't mind H/D.
