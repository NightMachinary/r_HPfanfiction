I saw your other post, and it's weird but we seem to have the same preferences lol. I got up to ch10 of Harry Crow before I nope outta that one. However, don't be discouraged from a pairing just because of one fic/author! There are plenty of H/Hr stories that I actually liked, but I think I forgot to fave them :(

Yeah, I didn't want to list all of the things I dislike, but I really am not a fan of plot devices that encourage lazy writing or weirdness. This includes soul bonds, marriage contracts (they are literally pre-pubescents, pls no), and magical oaths. Sometimes oaths work, sometimes they don't, but I feel that they are a crutch, tbh.

As for recommendations, check out this: [[http://pastebin.com/wwtmhSKY]], it's pretty general, but I enjoyed a lot of the stories on there. And I have a few stories faved on my profile, and most of the authors I've faved have good faves, etc, etc. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6029474/]]

Also, you should check out a few communities, the DLP 5 star community is really good as DLP is known to be pretty harsh in its criticisms. You should also visit their forum: [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/]] and check the library section, it's got good works there too. Also, check out the Sacrifices arc, it's a good take on slytherin!Harry (also one of my faves), super!Harry and a H/D: linkffn(2580283), warning, it's quite long though (~3mil words).
