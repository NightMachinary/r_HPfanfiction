JK never said they should have ended up together. She said there was some emotion between Harry and Hermione in DH, but she never said that they should have ended up together. She even said later on that Ron and Hermione would make a good couple given some maturing for both of them.

To repeat, she never said Harry and Hermione should have ended up together
