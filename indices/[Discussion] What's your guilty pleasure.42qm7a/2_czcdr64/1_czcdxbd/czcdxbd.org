If you haven't already, I would recommend Deprived. It's quite a stretch from other stories, but I loved every bit of it and was devastated when I saw when it had last updated. Obviously I wouldn't recommend HP and the Veela, but I think you should look at it to at least decide whether you like it or not. No judgement in this thread:)

I don't know why exactly, but I actually tend to stay away from the H/Hr pairings, despite JKR saying she thought they should've ended up together. Probably because most of the stories I read were a bit like Harry Crow, a story I absolutely detest, again no judgement if you like it. I really don't like the soul bonding trope as it often comes off as forced and a bit of a cop out on the authors part to actually develop a proper relationship with ups AND downs.

Seeing as you seem to have similar tastes, care to compare stories. I'm new to Fanfiction in the ways of having a profile, so not many faves/follows or reviews.

But I'd love to hear what your favorite is, and maybe get some recommendations :)
