Honestly, my fanfiction tastes are almost exclusively guilty pleasures. Marriage contracts, girl!Harry, time turner stories, canon male/OC pairings, book reader finds herself in Hogwarts, the works.

The sheer number of Fred/OC, George/OC, Remus/OC, Sirius/OC, Oliver/OC, Cedric/OC and Draco/OC stories that I've read over the years is truly wild. In my defense, I do limit myself to well-written ones. Mostly.
