Not necessarily. I like /some/ of them, even though the whole idea has been done to death now, but I consider that particular story a guilty pleasure. Clell even wrote a second version to tone that one down a bit, but I prefer the original.

I do like HP/DM stories. They tend - and there are always exceptions - to have more realistic relationships than a lot of other pairings. My personal favourite would be The Pureblood Princess by TheEndless7.
