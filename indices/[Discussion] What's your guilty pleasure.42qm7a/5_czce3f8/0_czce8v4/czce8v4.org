Wait so you like the marriage contract stories? That's cool, this is a safe zone. Tbh I do love a well written Daphne Greengrass. She's like the female Blaise, and Blaise is my fave. I'm also pretty sure there are probably lots of marriage contract HP/DM slash, which, while it might not be your thing, is definitely [[/u/radicalwakebeast]]'s thing.
