I love powerful!Harry. I can actually put up with a lot of tropes as long as he's powerful and otherwise mostly in-character.

Sunset over Britain and Sunrise over Britain by Bobmin are probably the ones I go back to read when I want to indulge BUT I generally admit that pretty freely.

Since you asked about ones we try to hide, I'd just go ahead and own up to liking What a Witch Needs by Petalsoft. I think it covers all the tropes.
