A number of mine have already been mentioned, but also: Harry's life is a video game. They all have the same plot, are heavily mired in the stations of the canon, never complete and I just love them all so much.

I think I've read The Adventures Of Harry Potter, the Video Game: Exploited linkffn(9708318) at least 20 times. Some others: linkffn(8052743), linkffn(10309134), and linkffn(10563477)
