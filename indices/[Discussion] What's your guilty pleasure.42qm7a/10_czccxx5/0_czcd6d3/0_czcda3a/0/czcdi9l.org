I like your take on the idea of guilt. One of my favorite things which I am completely not guilty about is Blaise Zabini. Not pairings or anything, just his character. It's like the whole fanfic community took what little had been said (slytherin, neutral family, possibly killer mom) and decided upon an almost universal character. Sarcastic, smart, politically minded and neutral. Easily the best character out there, and 9 times out of 10, he's written this exact way.

I think that part of my hate for Harry Potter and the Veela stems from the fact that the author seemed to miss the memo. His Blaise was caucasian, blonde and had a crush on the infallible Harry Potter. Plus the older sister he created to play Draco's sometimes funny but mostly 2d girlfriend.

Anyway, I digress in my train of thought. Though I can't give you an engaging conversation of HP/DM slash, I do like the close friendship dynamic they have in some stories, particularly when Harry can influence Draco in a good way. Do you have any good stories that have that, preferably sans fluff?
