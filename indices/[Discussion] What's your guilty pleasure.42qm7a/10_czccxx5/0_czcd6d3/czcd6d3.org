I'm not one for slashes so much, but as I said, no judgement here. I *love* wrong boy who lived stories, or powerful!harry and smart!harry. My favorite guilty is linkffn(Deprived by The Crimson lord). So clich√©d, so OP, so *good.*

I've only found one WBWL that I disliked, Harry Potter and the Veela, because it's so poorly written. I hate the fact that it's updating and Deprived has been abandoned :(
