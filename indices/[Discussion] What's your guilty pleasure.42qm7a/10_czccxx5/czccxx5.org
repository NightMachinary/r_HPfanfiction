I love Harry/Draco fanfic. I like reading pretty much anything with them as long as it's not terribly written. I've always liked creature fics, BDSM etc. I don't have a favourite story in particular that I like to hide. I would hide the fact that I read it at all because I've found that other people tend to be bemused by it. What about yourself?
