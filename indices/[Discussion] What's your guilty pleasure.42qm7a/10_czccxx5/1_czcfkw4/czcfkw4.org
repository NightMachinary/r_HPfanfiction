What are your fave Harry/Draco stories, out of interest? The only one I've liked so far is the Sacrifices arc.

I find it a fairly interesting pairing TBH, due to the history of the parents, etc. That being said, I haven't looked specifically for it as I fear that a /lot/ of stories would have been written that contain heavy shades of Draco in Leather Pants, generally leading to crap writing.
