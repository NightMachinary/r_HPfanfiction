I've been a big fan of any Maya fics. She deleted them all a while ago but I think there's a pdf full of her stuff that's still floating around somewhere. One in particular she wrote called Underwater Light. The characterisation, story and writing are all amazing in it. Another really good Harry/Draco writer is Sara's Girl. Her fics Turn and Reparations are really good reads. I'd strongly recommend them. Anything in particular you'd recommend? I've been reading some gen fics recently and enjoying them.
