Ugh my guilty pleasure would be HP/LV or HP/TMR.

I don't care if Harry goes back to the past, Tom goes to the future, Voldemort suddenly becomes a good person, Harry joins Voldemort or Voldemort is the biggest bastard alive and kidnaps Harry and keeps him as a slave... Well the last one is kinda creepy.

But I love this pairing nonetheless, that's why my favourite author is Athey, even though she never finishes anything.

I also like slut!Harry (be it slash or het) and fics about the twins or Draco.
