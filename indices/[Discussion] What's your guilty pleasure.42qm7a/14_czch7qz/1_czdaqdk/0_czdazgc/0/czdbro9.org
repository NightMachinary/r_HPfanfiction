I do read those, quite often in fact. And while I enjoy them, along with a bit of Dumbledore bashing, I feel like a lot of people are so removed from canon that Dumbles to them is completely evil and manipulative. I really don't like Weasley bashing, which often happens in fix-fics, just because it's so ridiculous that 11 year old Ron and 10 year old Ginny are working for him.
