My guilty pleasure has got to be fics where Harry meets his parents. Either he crosses into another dimension (my favourite kind) or they come back to life somehow or he travels back in time.

I also really like marriage contract stories too. When I first started fanfiction I really loved Harry/Ginnny !SoulBond fics but I have since gotten very very tired of them.
