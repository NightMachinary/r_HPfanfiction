  I really loved Harry/Ginnny !SoulBond fics but I have since gotten very very tired of them.

I still enjoy them if they're at least written well, my biggest problem is that there's only like 4 that are actually finished. Most of them get to like fourth year and then are abandoned especially the really good ones
