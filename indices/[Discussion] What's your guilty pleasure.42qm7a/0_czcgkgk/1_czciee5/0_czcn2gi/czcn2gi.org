I don't know where to start with recommendations, haha. I've read a lot throughout the years, but honestly most of them are pretty similar that they've all melded into one in my mind, and I have trouble remembering and differentiating them.

I don't think I've ever read one where Harry brings back his parents with him. I think most of the ones I read (if they even are complete... which you know, it isn't 99% of the time), the lesson/story seems to be for Harry to "get to know his parents and know their love for him" before going back to his own dimension where now he has the strength to defeat Voldemort. Or to save that world from their Voldemort.

Off the top of my head, the only one I've read where a character from the other dimension goes back with Harry is linkffn(3571753). Not his parents though, [[/spoiler][his sister.]] I like this one.

linkffn(7534131) was updated recently. The story is pretty sound. The writer hasn't gotten into much Harry and James/Lily interactions yet.

linkffn(2987160) is my guilty pleasure of guilty pleasures. The story goes absolutely nowhere. There's this plot point that's suddenly introduced during the last few chapters, but it felt tacked on and jarring, like the author suddenly realised the story's lack of direction. And yet... I dunno, I remember that it made me laugh a couple of times, and characters were fun to read about.

You've probably seen linkffn(8730465) and linkffn(6892925) recommended here.

linkffn(4198643) Time travel fic, where Harry meets his parents as teenagers during their school years. The fic has a fair few grammatical/spelling errors and the writing is pretty simple. But I think it kinda has it own charm. Probably only read this if you want something super lightweight. It's pretty slice of life, kind of, IMO.

linkffn(1513042) Another time travel fic. It's pretty much the definitive "Harry goes back to his parents' time." story. I loved it when I read it, but it hasn't held up well.

Haven't read these in a couple of years: linkffn(2507697), linkffn(1962685). /A Stranger in an Unholy Land/ is one of the classics, but I dunno if it holds up well.

linkffn(5757945), linkffn(9649140) I don't remember these at all even though I know I've read them.

Oh fuck, they're all pretty terrible. And I have a terrible memory. I probably missed out on a lot too; I never used to be in the habit of keeping track of what I've read and titles of fics.
