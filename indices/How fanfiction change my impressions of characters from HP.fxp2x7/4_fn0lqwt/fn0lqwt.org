Hermione: Good student > Bad student.

Her perfect and high grades are a lie. She hands in homework that is feet longer than what was asked for. Hogwarts has a massively high student to teacher ratio. She wasn't doing anyone any favors by handing in encyclopedias for homework. And don't pull a "grading charm" out of your ass

When I went to school, if you went over or under the size of an assignment, you failed. If you can't follow instructions, you obviously didn't do the assignment. Hell, the standardized tests I took? The people who graded it had a cardboard/plastic "frame" they put over the page. Anything inside the frame? They read. Anything outside it? They ignored.

You run into this in college too. If the professor says "I want a 10-12 page double-spaced essay on X", they mean exactly that: they want a 10-12 page double-spaced report on X. One page less? Massive reductions/fail. One page more? Massive reductions/fail. Not double-spaced? Fail, they throw it out. You aren't the only student.

The funny part about this? A Hermione bashing fic pointed this out to me, and now I can't unsee it.
