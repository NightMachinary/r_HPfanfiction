Harry. When I first read the books I disliked him more and more with each one. He seemed annoying, immature and self-centered. After reading fanfiction, however, I can forgive some teenage angst. Also some of the things that I read as egoistic, now seem more like a â€˜dark/pessimistic humor'.

And McGonagall. I first read her like a stern but fair and responsible. Now she seems more biased and negligent.

Everyone else I still view pretty much the same. I can read a lot of different takes, bashing included, and enjoy them, but in the end my own interpretation of the characters stays as it was.
