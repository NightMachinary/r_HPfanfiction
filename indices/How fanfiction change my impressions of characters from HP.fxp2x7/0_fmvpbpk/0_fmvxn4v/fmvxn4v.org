Some of Hermione's flaws in fanfiction do get slightly papered over, sure - but in terms of being a Mary Sue, I've read /far/ more power fantasies involving /Harry/ than Hermione, and those seem to be far more common.

She gets a good number of fics focused on her by default of being the primary female character - but I find the complaints about how perfect/great she is in a lot of fanfiction weird when it's dialed up even further with Harry.
