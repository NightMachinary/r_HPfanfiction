This is probably embarrassing to admit, even in a HP subreddit, but I've read some of the books over 100 times.

I have a very firm canon impression of characters and find the way many are portrayed in fan fiction to be absolutely abhorrent. Therefore I really struggle to find fics that I enjoy... I want to read about the characters I love, yet in so many fics they're completely different. It's a struggle.

Anyway hmu with your best canon-character fic recs thanks.
