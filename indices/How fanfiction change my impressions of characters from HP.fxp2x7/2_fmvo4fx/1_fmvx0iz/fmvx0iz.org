I'm the same. I'm always reading one of the books, I have no idea how many times I've got through them and anything ooc or bashing is just such a nope for me, I have never been able to stick to a fanfic where any of the characters are like this. It means I do t actually read much fanfic at all but when I do it's usually canon compliant.
