You're without doubt my favourite recent fic author, so you're doing something right for me!

I've become such a snob. I need the characters to be canon, I need the world building to be canon, I need the writing to be good, I need the language to be appropriate. Not soppy but a bit of romance. Action but not too much. Bloody hell, after living in England for a few years I now can't read anything that doesn't get the British "vibe" right. I'm the worst.

I never thought I'd get into a next gen story, but the last fic I read was Wood for the Trees which I absolutely devoured. And it was The Aurors that pulled me back in after a couple of year hiatus. So cheers for being the benchmark and making my standards even higher.
