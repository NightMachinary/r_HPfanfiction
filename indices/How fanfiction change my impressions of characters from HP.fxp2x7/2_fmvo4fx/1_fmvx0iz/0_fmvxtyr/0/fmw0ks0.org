Awww you've made my day, thank you!!

But yeah I'm a snob too, I have such a low tolerance for things that don't feel like they could have happened! I don't think it makes us the worst at all, I think everyone has different tastes and comes to fanfic for different reasons.

I remember when I first joined this sub many years ago, and was a lot more active, multiple people told me I would get bored of canon compliancy and move to AU like they did. Perhaps that could still happen but I've found theres so much within canon to explore that I've not yet run out of interest!
