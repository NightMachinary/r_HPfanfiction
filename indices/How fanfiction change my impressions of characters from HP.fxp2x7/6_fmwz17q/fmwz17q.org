Kalen Darkmoon on his fanfiction.net bio has a good analysis of the books that helped solidify my thoughts of Dumbledore being an uncaring manipulative git to an actual evil s.o.b.

When I read the books (especially the first 4) I saw nothing but a budding romance between Harry and Hermione. So imagine my surprise my surprise when in the later books Hermione started to prefer Ron a guy who would always fight with her, belittle her, belittle her causes and her desire to learn and wants nothing to do with the muggle/mundane world.

Bacause of those two main items I started to look for fanfiction that supported my thoughts and I found a ton of stuff that reinforced my thoughts that Dumbledore was not the kindly grandfather but was a manipulative old man who really didn't care how his actions harmed Harry. I also found a ton of stories that supported my thoughts that Harry and Hermione should have gotten together.

Of course that led to all the fanfictions that tried to explain how Hermione would fall for Ron and how Harry would fall for Ginny (a character in the books who had very little presence) ie potions and compulsion charms.

Now I can't say that fanfiction changed my thoughts on the characters. Instead I gravitated to fanfiction that supported my belief in where the story and characters should have gone and expanded on the motivations that I thought were present in the books but were not fully developed.
