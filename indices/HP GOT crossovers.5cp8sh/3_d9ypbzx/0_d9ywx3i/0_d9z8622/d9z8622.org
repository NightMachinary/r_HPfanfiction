Yeah, I agree. Harry was totally OP in that story, and it served his character well and added to his mystery. I love that it's written omniscient style, feels like the way GoT felt- your an outsider watching history unfold, you get a feeling of how rumours flow and add to the legend. Having a narrator made Harry's super power seem less clich√© because of third person detachment, so it felt more like I was reading a fairy tale, and that it had a purpose in adding more to the legend he was becoming. But he really was sickeningly OP. Westeros never had a chance.
