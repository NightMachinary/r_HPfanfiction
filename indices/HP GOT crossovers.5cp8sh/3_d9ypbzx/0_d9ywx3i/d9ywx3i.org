I really like The Wizard of Harrenhal. Harry's character is dramatically overpowered, and thus the story should be boring, and yet DisobedienceWriter manages to pull it off. Yet more evidence for my thesis that if you're a good enough writer, you can break more or less any rule and still have a successful result.
