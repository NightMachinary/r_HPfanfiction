This is my favorite HP/GOT crossover: linkffn(11132113)

The Difference One Man Can Make plays years before the actual series begins. Harry is flung through some dimension-timey-wimey-stuff into the world of GOT. He ends up beyond the wall where he begins to build a society out of the tribes and hordes of Wildlings he encounters.

This new society shakes Westeros and Essos up and the story explores this difference that one wizard beyond the wall makes.

Also weirdly satisfying to read is this one: linkffn(11904771)

However, don't take this one too serious. Its very "anime" in its plotting and storytelling, but one of the few exception where that isn't a death sentence for the fic.
