My favorite HP/GOT crossover is linkffn(The Witch Queen of Essos by TheGirlWithFarTooManyIdeas) It explores the possibility that the veil is a portal to Westeros as opposed to the Other Side one reaches after death. Ginny's family is killed and she tries to follow them by stepping through the veil. Instead she finds herself in Westeros and is soon reunited with Sirius Black in Pentos in Essos... Follows Ginny and what impact her magic can have in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire.
