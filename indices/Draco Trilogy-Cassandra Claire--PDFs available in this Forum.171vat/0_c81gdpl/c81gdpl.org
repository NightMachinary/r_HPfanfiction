Just a quick note:

The PDFs on that site are the originals made by someone (possibly even CC herself) prior to the removal of all her fics. They're also pretty big files because as well as the text, it includes pictures (scene fanart, etc).

So for anyone who's interested, I have the fics in smaller file formats, without the pictures, and I'm perfectly happy to email them to anyone who wants. Available formats include (but are not limited to):

- .rtf or .doc
- .epub (for most ereaders)
- .lit (microsoft reader)
- .mobi (for kindle)
- .pdf (smaller file size - total trilogy is 7.2MB, compared to the original being 55MB)

I can provide each story as individual files or all three combined into one file. Just drop me a message if anyone's interested.
