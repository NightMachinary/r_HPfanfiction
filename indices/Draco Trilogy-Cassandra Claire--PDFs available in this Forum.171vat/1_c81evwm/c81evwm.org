We discussed BNFs of the past whose novel-length fics made a big stir. The biggest of the BNFs that I recall was Cassie Claire, whose Draco Trilogy (now taken offline, but downloadable as PDFs at the site I linked to) sort of set the stereotype for Dracos forever after.

I called it a "guilty pleasure" because CC caused quite an uproar due to some copyright issues. However, as much as I found the later books in the trilogy rambling, I thought that the first one was quite fascinating. It's stuck with me.

So, thought I'd link it. This is what fanfic was looking like when I started reading: speculating about unfinished books and often novel-length or longer.

NOTE: A number of the punch lines in CC's DT are from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and other tv shows/sources.
