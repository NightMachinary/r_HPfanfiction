Linkao3(Correspondence by seekeronthepath)

Correspondence it's an epistolary series in which Harry ends up as Neville's foster brother from second year forward. We only really get a close view of their relationship in part five which is focused on the correspondence between Harry and Neville after their Hogwarts years.

Overall the series leaves you wanting a full-on writing of the events you can get a glimpse through the letters you read, but it manages to leave you satisfied with what you have nonetheless.
