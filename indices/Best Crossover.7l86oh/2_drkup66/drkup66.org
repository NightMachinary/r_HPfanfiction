I'm actually not sure how many times I shared this, but I really do love this crossover so I'll basically quote myself now.

“It's a crossover [with] Captain America the First Avenger and it takes places during World War 2 or known in the Wizarding World, the Rise of Grindelwald. Not to mention, from Tom Riddle Jr's point of view (I hope that doesn't derail you from considering to read the story). It's an interesting plot and very well develop since it goes deeper Tom's character growth as well involves more a WW2 style of war. I highly recommend you read it anyways.”

The next one is unique considering it's a fic where the main characters are Ron and Clint. I loved how the author made the story original since it involves two of the most underdog characters ever.

Also, here's the sequel:

  EDIT:

  Also, there's this other fic where it made Luna Lovegood so Luna and (pardon my language) badass that I absolutely adore the series.

  It's the Under the Moon series by MerciaLachesis or on AO3 Mercia. I'll give you the link to both sites.
