Linkffn(ghosts of the past) is it the sequel to linkffn(child of the storms) and just updated today. It's mostly a crossover with the Marvel Cinematic Universe but the DC Trinity, the X-Men, Harry Dresden from The Dresden Files, Doctor Strange, and a whole bunch of other people are in this crossover as well.

Hands down one of my favorite crossovers.
