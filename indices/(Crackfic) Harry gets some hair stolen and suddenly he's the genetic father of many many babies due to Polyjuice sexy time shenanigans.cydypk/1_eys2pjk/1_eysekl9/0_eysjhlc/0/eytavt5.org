No, Snape in canon is a straight up dick, and a pretty horrible human beingg all things considerd. I won't go into specifics(for which there are many), but will only state this. Snape didn't care if James died(kinda understandable, but still a dick move), or if Harry(a baby, and Lily's child, the person he supposedly loves '/obsessed/'), but only wanted Lily to live. He didn't care that a child was going to suffer, and die, but wanted his obsession to live. Then continued to treat Harry as if he's something you'd scrape off your shoe. He was obsessed with Lily, he didn't love her, he wanted to own her.
