I won't nitpick over everything in your comment, because it's 1am here, but Dumbledore's accusation isn't without proof. Voldemort did try to spare Lily, a muggleborn witch, but killed James without offering to spare him(if i'm remembering things correctly). So while an accusation, unless you can actually give me a reason on why else Voldemort would try to spare a muggleborn's life, the accusation holds weight.
