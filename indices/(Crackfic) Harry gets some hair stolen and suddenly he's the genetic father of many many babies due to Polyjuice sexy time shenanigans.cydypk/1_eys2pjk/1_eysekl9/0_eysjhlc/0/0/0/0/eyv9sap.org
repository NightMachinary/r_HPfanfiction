The accusation is not that Snape asked Voldemort only to spare Lily. That's just a fact.

The accusation is Snape did that because he didn't care if Harry and James died. He did it because asking for James and Harry's lives /from Voldemort/ would A.) be useless and B.) put Snape in danger.

It simply isn't possible to ask Voldemort to spare them. It wouldn't do any good.

But then look at what else he does. He goes to Dumbledore. And that's because he trusts Dumbledore's innate goodness- you can see this in the scene when Snape is shocked that Dumbledore asks what Snape will give, to save Lily's life. He'd obviously thought that DD would save them simply because that's what good guys do.

Dumbledore accuses Snape of using him as a backup plan because Snape doesn't trust Voldemort's word. But Voldemort is the actual backup plan. /Dumbledore/ - who should want to save everyone - is Plan A. Snape only doesn't visit him first because he's afraid Dumbledore will kill him on sight and then no one will be saved, not even Lily. If he pleads for Lily first to Voldemort, then if Dumbledore kills him instead of listening to him, at least there's a chance for one person to live.
