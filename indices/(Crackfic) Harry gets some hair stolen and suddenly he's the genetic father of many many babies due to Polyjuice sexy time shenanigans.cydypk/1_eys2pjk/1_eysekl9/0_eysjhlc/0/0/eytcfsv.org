It's Dumbledore's accusation that you're thinking of, not something Snape says himself. Dumbledore is disgusted that Snape has asked Voldemort to spare only Lily's life without regard for her husband and son. But think about the request here. Voldemort's specifically trying to hunt down the family to kill Harry. Asking Voldemort to spare Harry's life not only wouldn't work, it would backfire spectacularly, Voldemort would not only refuse (thus ensuring Lily would be killed) he would probably hurt or kill Snape for even making such a request (to ask to spare the one who had the power to kill Voldemort looks like you're wanting Voldemort to die). James? I guess he could say spare the parents, but James is an adult who'd already defied Voldemort three times, he can look out for himself, plus many of the death eaters who were in school with them already know that James and Snape hate each other and Snape and Lily used to be friends. That's not a good crowd to do that in front of even if you wanted to, because it wouldn't be easy to explain. Dumbledore would have to be an idiot not to know that.

But by going to Dumbledore, Snape already ensures Harry and James are to be saved. Who in the hell would actually expect DD to just save Lily and leave the other two to die? No, DD is just laying a guilt trip on Snape and making him feel as terrible as possible right before he asks him to risk his life as a spy. The less Snape cares about his own life, the more likely he'll be to accept. Many people say DD did the same thing with Harry and the Dursleys, letting him grow up with people who hated him so he'd value himself less and be more willing to die when it was time.

I'm not arguing that Snape is a horrible human being, but hurting Lily in any way is the last thing he'd want to do. He only did it the once, knowingly, and then regretted it the rest of his life. Gross shit like spelling his sperm into her is not canon Snape, it's bad fanon. I imagine he'd just have love-potioned her like Merope did to Tom Riddle Sr. if he was /that/ type of villain. But his whole shtick was actually caring how Lily felt, soooo...
