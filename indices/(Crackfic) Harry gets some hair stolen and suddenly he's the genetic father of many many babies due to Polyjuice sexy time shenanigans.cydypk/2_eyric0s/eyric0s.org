I know this is in good fun, however, polyjuice does not work in that way. Yes it uses the DNA from the person hair is taken from, BUT it does not alter the DNA of the person who uses the potion. The user is still themselves in every way except the way they look. Look at the Marauders map, when Mad Eye was not actually mad eye, the map knew even with polyjuice position being in use.
