I actually do have a plot bunny for a Crossover...

It would take place after Voldemort's return in Goblet of Fire. Sabrina's Aunt Zelda discovers there is a magic-user over in England who has been using the title "The Dark Lord", which of course, is the nickname for the Devil, and she does not like it! So, she along with Sabrina, Hilda, and Ambrose go to England to get rid of this "Blasphemer"... Sabrina canon would be a bit different, however, because she would be Harry and Hermione's age.

Also when Zelda discovers the Prophecy "The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.." she wonders if the Prophecy is actually about the Devil! Muahahahaha!

It would be a Harry/Hermione/Sabrina ship story...
