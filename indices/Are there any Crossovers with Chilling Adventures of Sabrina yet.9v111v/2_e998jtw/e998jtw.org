It would be interesting to explore the differences between the two kinds of witches. At first glance potterverse magic users seem to be more immediately powerful, with their near effortless wide range of spells.

However, sabrina style witches have some advantages. They live much longer and they can bring people back from the dead. Mostly because of their pact with Satan I think. They might have all sorts of other powers we just don't see.
