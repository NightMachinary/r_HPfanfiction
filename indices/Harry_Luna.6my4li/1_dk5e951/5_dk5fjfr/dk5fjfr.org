Okay, but which of these has a Luna that isn't a complete departure from the canonical character? I find that whenever an author tries to make Luna a major character(Harry/Luna romance or not), she winds up so far from canon Luna that they might as well have made her an original character or used a blank character like Daphne Greengrass or Susan Bones.
