My standard Harry/Luna post.

Edit: To address your request, Tomorrowland and The Quidditch World Cup are slow burning, novel length stories. Pretty much exactly what you are looking for.

The Best:

Linkao3(Tomorrowland by winterfool)

Linkffn(Contemplating Clouds by Tehan.au)

Linkffn(Conlaodh's Song by enembee) should not be read before reading its prequel, By the Divining Light.

Linkffn(The Quidditch World Cup by TheEndless7)

Linkffn(Resurrexit by MasterSlytherin) (Luna is not heavily featured for reasons you learn very early)

Some others, most of which are still good:

Linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle by jbern) (Luna is OOC)

Linkffn(Unspeakable Beauty)

Linkffn(Luna's Year by michelle-31a)

Linkffn(Luna's Hubby by Meteoricshipyards)

Linkffn(Pathetic by A-Kubrick-Spent)

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Hogwarts Rift by Illyich)

Linkffn(Different Together by Hippothestrowl)

Linkffn(Six Impossible Things Before Breakfast by delicfcd)

Linkffn(Protection From Nargels) and it's sequel Linkffn(Harry and Luna Against the High Inquisitor)

Linkffn(RuneMaster by Tigerman)

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Stay at St Mungo's by Natascope)
