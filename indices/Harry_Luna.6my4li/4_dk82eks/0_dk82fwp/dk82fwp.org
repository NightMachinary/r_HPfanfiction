  It's the morning after Ginny and Ron's fight in Half-Blood Prince, and she can't concentrate in DADA class. Unfortunately, that means she incurs the wrath of Snape. But somebody in the class has had enough of Snape's bullying and decides to take a stand. No longer a one-shot, and spinning out from HBP into something AU and silly. Harry/Luna.
