I second these recommendations - with a quick heads-up for Ana Luthor's stories that only the first, third, and fourth of those stories are actually Harry/Luna. [[/spoiler][In fact, in the last one, Harry gets killed off, leaving us with the even rarer Ron/Luna pairing.]]

BrokenWingsHealed is /fantastic/ - and relatively new to the scene as well! All those fics were just published within the last couple of months, and they're some of the best H/L I've read in years. "Flower and Serpent" is more of a Harry/Daphne friendship fic, but with some lovely Harry/Luna cuteness in the background.

Also, both of these authors stay true to Luna's character, which is a plus.
