Have to second this. I put off reading ASOIAF for years and years even with the rave reviews, because I was burned out on high fantasy (was reading almost exclusively urban fantasy at the time).

As soon as I started, I just couldn't stop. I read through books 1-4 in under a week nonstop. It really is an amazing series.
