I've read a couple of stories that were a fanfiction of a fanfiction. In one case the original author had already given carte blanche approval for anyone to use/build on her stories as long as they gave proper attribution. As far as the others they contacted the original author for permission. Then there's a whole slew of stories where the author just states they were "inspired by" another fanfic.

For instance the story Protecting Harry by Fairywm is a fanfic of Potter's Protector by mjimeyg

The story Harry Potter and the Children of Change by T. E. Tanglebrooke has someone writing a fanfic.
