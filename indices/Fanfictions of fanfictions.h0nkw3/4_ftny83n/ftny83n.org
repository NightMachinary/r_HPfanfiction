If you've ever heard of the Naruto fanfic "Dreaming of Sunshine" by Silver Queen, we basically have this down to a science. It's called recursive fanfiction and generally it's ok as long as you either ask permission from the author, or at least give them credit, and state that it's not "canon" to their universe unless the author of the original fic states that it is.
