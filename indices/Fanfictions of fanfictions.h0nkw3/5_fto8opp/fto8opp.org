I am of the belief that no one owns the rights to any fanfiction idea - Rowling owns the hp world but that's it. Giving credit would be polite but beyond that it doesn't really matter.

If a fanfiction author wants to actually own anything they write, they should write original fiction (though I'm glad they write fanfiction instead).
