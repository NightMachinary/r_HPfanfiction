I've always been of the opinion that Voldemort is a sociopath rather than a psychopath. That is, he became what he was through life experiences, not by being born like that. So tossing a sibling in the mix would drastically alter things. I think he would still be dark, and the sibling would probably be the same way, but not the full-blown serial killer nutter that single-child Voldemort became.
