It would depend on circumstances. JKR has said in an interview if his mother had survived - there would have been no Voldemort. Her love and care would have been enough to ground him.

Similar could be true if he had a sibling. I do think effect would be profound. But really would depend on circumstances:\\
- Is his sibling equal to him? If so then they would have one another to lean on, help, comfort. Maybe even experience brotherly love.\\
- Is one superior? Intellectually or magically? It might either devolve into abusive relationship, but could also develop into overly protective one.

From there could really go in any way. Heck they might start close, but grow apart at Hogwarts and maybe while Voldemort would go down dark path, his sibling might feel it their duty to oppose and stop Voldemort. Perhaps even attempt to save their brother ...

Or they could be a dark lord duo - both psychopathic murderers bent on world domination.
