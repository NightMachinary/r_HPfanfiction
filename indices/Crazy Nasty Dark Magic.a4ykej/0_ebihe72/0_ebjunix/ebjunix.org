I love this, but it is essentially just pulling at pure shock factor. The whole core of the fic is to make you gasp. Sadly, I have been ruined by horror and nothing makes me unsettled anymore.

Seriously, this would have been better as a series.

Instead of making another post, trying to remember the fic where the Ministry makes a building and uses bones of people as obelisks and such. That was quite nuts. I loved it.
