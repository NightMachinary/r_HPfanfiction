I do have preference for a more adult characterization and as such I enjoy stories where they start at least at 15, as adult like 10 years old is way out of character. The type of content of the story will also mater, 11 years old having a romantic or sexual relationship is complete nonsense and as such plenty of stories would fit better if they changed Hogwarts to a highschool or college equivalent age school.

Basically, if they are not going to act their age its better to change the age of the students.
