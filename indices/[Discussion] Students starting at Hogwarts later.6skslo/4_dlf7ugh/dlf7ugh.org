Poor Harry...by that time he might think of himself as "Freak" instead of "Harry"...hell, the Dursleys might get even more abusive the older he gets (after all "He can take it now" (at least that might be something Vernon Dursley might say or at least think as a justification))

Also: Why would you let children run around with untrained magic (the older they get the harder it would be to learn IMHO, especially something that defies logic like magic does...especially for muggleborns!)? Not to mention that some might cause all sorts of mischief once they find out they have some control over their "accidental" magic (we have WOG that wandless magic is a thing - it's just not taught in Britain!)
