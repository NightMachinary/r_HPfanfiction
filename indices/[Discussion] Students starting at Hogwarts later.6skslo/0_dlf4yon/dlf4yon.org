Its an idea that has been used before. You're going to have to give me some justification to sell it though. Perhaps the real reason is you don't feel comfortable writing children which is a perfectly valid reason and probably one of the contributing factors to so many fics starting in 5th year. (Not the main one but a small one). What I need to see however before I'm sold is an in-world reason. By this I mean I can already think of a few counter points to why it wouldn't be done, obviously they can all be changed in your story but I just want to alert you to a few. For example;

Hogwarts teaches students to control their magic, without this one could argue their magic would act up more. The more accidental magic done the harder it is for the Obliviators and accidental magic reversal squad have to work. The Ministry has to work harder, therefore they wouldn't support this.

Wizard raised children do not do formal schooling before Hogwarts. No formal education before they're 16? sell that to employers. (Remember its your story so you can change this but it is an assumption people will make until you show otherwise.) Muggleborn students students will be preparing for Sixth form or a job. There will likely be a bunch more muggleborns decline Hogwarts simply because they've invested so much time into Muggle education.

Does Hogwarts still last 7 years? They finish at 23. Now that is the same ages people finish University after a Masters degree with a year in Industry in the muggle world assuming they didn't have to resit any year. This obviously opens up a whole bunch of potential social interactions but how many people need that level of education?

Wizarding coming of age is at 17. Again, you can change this but 17 is when they become in control of their own decisions and can use magic outside of school. For you this is after first year. It also means they have the right to leave school unless there is a law saying otherwise. People might have to leave school to work and support their family. This leaves them with a single year of Hogwarts education.

Relationships. Perhaps the reason you're writing your story like this but if you haven't considered it then it might be worth mentioning. Hogwarts is full of children with little privacy. Sure its is an castle with plenty of abandoned rooms but it has a lot of children in it. Yours won't. The age of consent in the United Kingdom is 16. The same age that they start at your Hogwarts. Are your staff going to have to clamp down on this or accept it? You're keeping them till their mid twenties, they'll have been adults for years. They could marry and have kids legally unless your school bans it. How does the school house system work around that?

Its not a bad idea and there are some benefits to writing Hogwarts as older but there are considerations that need to be made. Is it worth the extra complications?
