Ok i'm recommending this because i liked it a lot but the thing is, Harry is in Slytherin. Ok don't stop reading hear me out here, he joins Hogwarts at his 7th year so no '11 year olds', there are no poltical moves so no Lord bullshit either. And he is in the bad side of moral line. Fic is linkffn(Hail Odysseus) if you're interested. If not, sorry for taking your time :)
