Most stories, including canon, are full of kids not acting like their assigned houses really. Whether that is by design or a side effect of bad writing, I couldn't say.

What I'd be interested in seeing is a (well-written) story where no one actually cares too much about houses in general and are just trying to get by as normal students. You know, until the shit hits the fan and these kids are thrust into a war as realistic young teens, not caricatures of a handful of qualities they had when they were 11.
