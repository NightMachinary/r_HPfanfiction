Linkffn(The Debt of Time)

Not sure if I linked properly, I'm new to Reddit, so if it didn't work, I'm sorry.

I pimp this fanfiction out to everyone, because it's just such a close love to me. Takes a little bit to get into the part that you're looking for, but once it gets there.. It's honestly great.

I have to say it's one of my all-time favorite Fanfictions.

Hermione does end up a Gryffindor, but with Slytherin-tendencies. :)
