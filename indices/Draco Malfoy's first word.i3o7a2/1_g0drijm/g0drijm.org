Lucius was preoccupied with Death Eater business and Narcissa was an incredibly reserved parent (likely due to her own upbringing), so after Draco was born Dobby was his primary caretaker. Dobby would feed him, change him, play with him, and tell him stories before bed. So instead of Daddy or Mommy being his first word it was Dobby because that's who he was around the most.

Luckily the first time it happened Narcissa heard it and she forbid Dobby spending any time with Draco beyond feeding and changing him. She started spending more time with him and whispering Father in Draco's ear when Lucius was around, and showing Draco his picture often. Soon enough Draco learned to say Father instead and he forgot about how much Dobby did for him when he was young.
