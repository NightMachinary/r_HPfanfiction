There's a next gen fic where they spend more time with grawp, although it's not a major part of the fic. I'm pretty sure it's James potter and the hall of elder's crossing or one of the sequels (google for it), but it honestly may be linkffn(albus potter and the global revelation) or one of those sequels.
