linkao3(Do you feel your life is threatened by fabricated stories by iceprinceofbelair) is a wonderful one shot. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3608871]]

linkffn(a thousand words by Ailee17) is really well written and has a refreshing slow burn pace [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10948484/1/A-Thousand-Words]]

linkffn(Digging for the bones by paganaidd) is a popular one [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6782408/1/Digging-for-the-Bones]]

linkao3(exordium by stickersformymac) scratches the hurt/comfort &&& angst itch [[https://archiveofourown.org/chapters/31898880?show_comments=true]]

linkao3(broken mind, fractured soul by Sensiblytainted) can be a little difficult to get through at times and, in the end, was unsatisfying for me, but I still enjoyed it and have reread it and think it's work recommending bc boy howdy angst galore [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8873683/chapters/20344381#workskin]]

linkffn(the first day by little0bird) the first fanfic I ever read and it's stuck with me. while all the other fanfics I've recommended take place while harry is in school, this one looks at his recovery after the war. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day]]
