In case you're unaware and don't get a response here, there's a 'HPSlashFic' sub where you might be more likely to get some takers. Beta requests don't really seem to get much traction here, nor slash stuff.

[[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]]

There's also the weekly beta-bartering thread on the Fanfiction sub too. I think it's on Thursdays, but the schedule is in their sidebar.
