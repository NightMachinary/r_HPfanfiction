Oh...yeah. Sorry about that. I was assuming that everyone is familiar with the stereotype in Harry Potter fanfic that has goblins falling over themselves to help Super!Harry claim his inheritance, and the opposite stereotype where they're greedy miserly loophole abusers who make Scrooge look like Uncle Pennybags. Stuff like I remember there being in Starfox5's work, or in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6344731/1/An-Unwise-Conspiracy][An Unwise Conspiracy]], or such.

But yeah, you're right, in a normal setting beating a goblin up for being a goblin would be a hate crime.
