Using any of the Unforgivables on a goblin isn't even considered a crime (as of 1998), so I doubt there'd be any legal repercussions from the Ministry for beating one to death.

And if you're beating goblins to death with sacks of currency, you're probably past caring about the repercussions from the goblins as well.
