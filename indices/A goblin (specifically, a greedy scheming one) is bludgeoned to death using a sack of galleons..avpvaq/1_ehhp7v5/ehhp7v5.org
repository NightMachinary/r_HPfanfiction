Jebin looked lazily at the goblin tied over a wooden crate. "Get the vamp" he whispered to his friend.

"The vamp's sleepin'" Gary whispered back.

Turning to his friend Jebin says "I guess you'll just have to wake him up now won't ya?"

The goblin, hearing as sharp as it ever was, began a renewed struggle against his ropes. He was pretty sure what was about to go down.

Gary walked over to the nearby coffin. Picking up the tapping stick, he knocked on the lid a few times. A short time later the lid slid over seemingly of it's own accord. From the coffin rose a pale looking man. "What is it? You know not to wake me up until it's night."

"Well uh... sir." Gary said before gesturing to the bound creature.

The vampire, Dolund, smiled. "Well now, this is worth waking up for." He said as he walked to a small chest on a shelf. Opening chest he withdrew a sack that bounced with clinking of coins.

"I believe, Mr. Killgold, that this is the payment you're owed is it not?" Dolund spoke to the bound goblin as he approached. He gripped the goblins face and jiggled the bag of coins before him. "Well, I suppose it's time that you collect."

Jebin and Gary winced when Dolund reared back and bashed the sack against the goblins face. Once, twice, three times Dolunds arm pulled back only to shoot forward, weighted bag in hand, to beat his captive with vampiric strength."

"Still alive Killgold?" Dolund asked the heavily bleeding but still counsous goblin who could only moan into a gag in reply. "Well, I think the bag has one more left in it."

With a mightly overhead swing, Dolund brought down the bag of gold on the back of Killgold's head. His head popped forward with a crack of bone as the bag exploded and coins flew all over the room.

The vampire looked over his work with a smile before turning to his men. "Clean this up, I'm going back to bed."
