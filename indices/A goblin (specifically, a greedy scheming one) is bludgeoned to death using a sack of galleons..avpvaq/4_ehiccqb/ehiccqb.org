/I'd be hungry if I weren't so scared/, thought Waclaw. He was still except for his head swaying this way and that as he tried to assess the threats. He had come to this room with his friend... his only friend... but that one had been led away by a mole-monkey. Why hadn't he taken Waclaw with him?

Oh, but if he lived to ask such a question, there would be time to phrase it later. Right then, there was still the matter of the bear-monkey and the two mole-monkeys.

One of the moles was casting a glance towards Waclaw every few seconds, while the bear-monkey rumbled on about something--Waclaw couldn't understand what.

The mole-monkeys perched atop false stumps and were barricaded behind a false bolder, or perhaps a false fallen tree. Such contrivances were beyond Waclaw's ken, but he was at least clever enough to know that the perched mole-monkeys were perfectly nimble and capable of coming off their perches and over the boulder to do him harm, if they wished.

The little one cast another glance.

"You are making me nervous, and you must keep your eyes to yourself!" Waclaw gave a fair warning. He may be safe from within his false hollow, but then, monkeys were ever more clever than he, and he may not be.

At his pronouncement, both mole-monkeys turned to him and spake tersely on some unknowable matter. They must have been asking the bear-monkey for the secret to the false hollow, because he immediately opened the thing and drew Waclaw from it. Well, he tried to dodge and escape, but there was no room in the hollow, and even when he thought to defend himself, the bear-monkey was rather too large and sure of himself. Waclaw was caught! For all the good his wariness had done for him.

But the bear-monkey had soothing sounds for Waclaw, and gentle hands. He was allowed to stretch, finally. Ohhhhh, but that is a nice feeling!

Then from his languor he roused all at once! The bear had brought him over to the moles who were peering very closely at him, and seemed clearly intent upon dinner.

"Stay off! Wicked mole-monkey! Bear-monkey, you must return me to my hollow!" Waclaw tried to be reasonable. But, ignoring his urging, the smaller mole prodded at him with a sharp claw!

Well, Waclaw had certainly tried to make friendly, but now he must show his teeth! In an instant he had struck the little mole monkey, and with a great deal of vehemence! The would would probably not amount to much, considering the size of the creature, but perhaps it would not be so bold going forth?

It screamed. That was unexpected. It screamed and screamed and collapsed. The other mole monkey got its nerve up, and snatched Waclaw from the friendly bear monkey. It began digging into poor Waclaw, throttling him and gouging his ribs terribly. Waclaw struck back, of course, but landed no blows and could offer little resistance.

Then a new shout rang out. The friend was back! And he carried with him a mighty weapon! A thousands stones fell over a thousand waterfalls as the hero hefted a great weighty gullet. He swung it around his head thrice, until the clatter of riverstones was muted by the force of his swings, and then he stepped forward and delivered the parcel directly into the ear of the mole monkey. At this, the gullet was rent asunder and the riverstones flew wildly and scattered across the ground. The mole person dropped from the impact, and did not seem to be rising again.

"Are you okay, Waclaw?" asked his friend.

The bear monkey spoke and so did Waclaw, "These creatures are horrible, and I never trusted them. Tell the bear monkey that he is not to bring me forth from my hollow!"

--------------

Harry snapped out of the rage that had held him. Two goblins lay in the foot of the room, and his withdrawal was all around, on the desk and floor.. even some coins had landed in Waclaw's cage.

He whispered reassurances to Waclaw, and heard some in return. His familiar was alright.

"'Arry, I don' s'pose we can keep this ter ourselves? Those two'll be needin' a nice rest after takin' a nip from yer krait 'n a swing o' yer crate."
