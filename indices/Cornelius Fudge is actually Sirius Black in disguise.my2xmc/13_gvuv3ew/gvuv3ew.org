It would make no sense for Sirius to be Fudge. He's preventing his own innocence while alienating his godson. It would make more sense if Sirius was fake Moody. Think about it. Sirius is an escaped convince with nothing to do all year. He can't rally up Order Of The Phoenix members because everyone believes him to be a murderer. It would make more sense for Dumbledore to send a Patronus to potential members. So, Sirius being Sirius, decides to kidnap Moody when Harry's name comes out of the cup to protect his godson. All Barty/fake Moody does throughout the year, besides teaching, is brew polyjuice and help Harry survive the tournament. But Sirius doesn't know that he kidnapped Barty Crouch Jr. So both Crouch and the real Moody are inside Moody's trunk. Right before the third task, Barty escapes, kidnaps Sirius/fake Moody, legilimizes him so he knows what happened throughout the year, and then obliviates him so he believes he was actually in hiding, and then makes the cup into a portkey. When he's caught, he's a strong enough occlumens to resist veritaserum but pretends that he isn't so that Sirius isn't credited for his work.
