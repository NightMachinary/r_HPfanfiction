This can work in context (and we ignore the actual outcome of poa) before the reveal, considering that Fudge was the last person to see black before his escape. And in context Fudge was the first to find Harry after he ran away from privet drive and he was in Hogwarts enough to warrant all of Sirius's break-ins.

Yeah if it weren't for canon this would have been a believable twist.
