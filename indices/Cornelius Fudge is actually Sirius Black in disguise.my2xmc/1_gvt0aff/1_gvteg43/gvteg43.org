Okay but I can 100% see something like this in the daily prophet.

'After discovering his boggart, Neville Longbottom discovered a shocking secret. His boggart was no one else but Severus Snape. Now, that may not sound like much, but this Snape looked an awful lot like our dearest Madam Malkin, so we naturally looked into this case and talked with the professor. Not only did he look like a greased bat, but he actually denied it while sneering. This could of course only mean he had something to hide. We talked with several unnamed sources and they confirmed our suspicious: the professor always comments on his students appearances and has a trademark walk with his robe. After this, we went to madam Malkin herself. When we explained why we were there, she (or he?) just told us she didn't have time and had to attend to her customers. This wasn't a surprise at all, it must be a busy life, living this dubble live. After discovering the secret of our dearest potions professor, more witches and wizards came out of their hiding and told us they feel like a wizard, while they were born as a witch and vice versa. Will this be the beginning of a new area?
