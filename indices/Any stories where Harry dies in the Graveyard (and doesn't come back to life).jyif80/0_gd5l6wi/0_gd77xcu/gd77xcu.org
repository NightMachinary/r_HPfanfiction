Some thoughts, if you don't mind:

- I can't see where Neville's motivation comes from. If Harry had died /because/ Neville wasn't good enough, that would make sense, but he wasn't involved in any way. Nor can the prophecy switch to being about him. I can see him getting a bit more motivated when Bellatrix is broken out, but the narrative doesn't connect that.

- I don't buy Hermione's reaction at all: she is acting like someone who doesn't have any ideas or motivations independent of Harry's, and that's a pretty degrading portrayal. If anything, I would expect her to react more like how Neville reacts in your snippet: redouble her efforts, now with more focus on violence.
