The basis of black holes is relativity and the fact that nothing can travel faster than light, as you said. In fact, it can be derived from the basic princinciple of causality. This principle stands in a fundmental conflict with the way magic works. Apparition and Time travel come to mind, two things that could REALLY break physics, meaning it stands in direct conflict with fundamental principles. This conflict makes it impossible for me to think about physics and magic together too formally.

I think Harry Potter magic is just classic children fantasy: Not too well thought out, but really poetic at the same time. And I have to say, with what we already discovered about particles and weird solid state theories (superconduction comes to mind), there is no way muggles would not find out about magic.

About the Higgs field, the process you described is called spontaneous symmetry breaking and happened with the Big Bang. The vacuum state of the Higgs field jumped to a non-zero value, whose potential is the source of mass for elementary particles, but NOT for macroscopic objects. No loss of mass, no shockwave, sorry to disappoint you ;)
