Would it help to use the "view full work" function, so at least you only have to load it once instead of every chapter?

Just add *?view_full_work=true* at the end of the AO3 link. (Make sure it's the link with ONLY the fic number, without /chapters/12345678 at the end).

Examples:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12429789]]The bare-bones link for a fic. You can mock this up when somebody uses the AO3 linkbot to list the fic number.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12429789/chapters/28288686]] The AO3 system automatically adds that last part when you go to the page, to show it one chapter at a time. The number is different for each chapter. Sometimes there's a #workskin at the end, but I don't usually see that on the first chapter.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12429789?view_full_work=true]] This will show the entire work on one page. No idea how long it will take your VPN to load it, but once it's done you'll have the entire thing.
