You have to really flesh them out individually, usually /on their own/ in order for them to work well in a story. Don't you dislike the fact that you keep running into the same added tropes over and over?

Some of it is just terminology. Why would you want people to call them the 'Golden Trio', or the Hufflepuffs 'the badgers'? Why do you want Dumbledore to be called the Leader of the Light?

If you're going to remove a flaw from the story, like Harry's glasses or scar or something like that, why have it done in a frequently used cop-out way rather than make them happen in a novel and entertaining/interesting way that progresses logically from the divergence point?

If you're going to have a pairing, why make it fated by law or birth rather than come into being in a natural way that endears you to both characters?

Using houses as adjectives just seems like a way to stereotype characters and make you not forget which world you're in.
