I love literally all of these except the [family name] Manor one. That's not typically how old English families named their houses, so it always strikes me as a little odd when I see it. It ties into a pet head canon of mine, that the Malfoys are old blood but new money, which is why they do things like name their damn house after themselves instead of “Longleat” or something.
