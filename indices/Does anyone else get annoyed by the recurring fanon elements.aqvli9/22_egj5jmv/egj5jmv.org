  Merlin being used as blasphemy beyond things like 'Merlin's Beard'
#+end_quote

The worst fics have muggle-borns (like Hermione) using "Merlin" as an expletive immediately after they enter the magical world. That's not how it works. Nobody replaces familiar expletives (like "Oh God") they have used for /years/ with different ones from a new culture they haven't even heard about before. Often "Merlin" is used in places where it would not be natural to use an expletive.

  Harry had his wand out ready to do something drastic when he noticed Hermione worming her way into the space beneath the stands.

  "Merlin," he muttered, "she's too clever for her own good."

(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes by sunmoonandstars)

First of all, Harry had been in the magical world for just a few months. He wouldn't have used "Merlin" as an expletive. Second, it's not a good place to have an expletive at all. It feels forced. It feels as if the author is just reminding everyone that it's a different world than we're used to.

Another unnecessary fanon element is /spinning portkeys/. It was used /once/ by Bobmin as a plot device, and afterwards it turned up everywhere by authors that obviously had read Bobmin's fic. Floo spins, portkeys pull, apparition squeezes.
