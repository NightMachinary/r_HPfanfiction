  The worst fics have muggle-borns (like Hermione) using "Merlin" as an expletive immediately after they enter the magical world. That's not how it works. Nobody replaces familiar expletives (like "Oh God") they have used for years with different ones from a new culture they haven't even heard about before. Often "Merlin" is used in places where it would not be natural to use an expletive.

Even Rowling messed that one up. Draco Malfoy, pureblood that he is, uses God rather than Merlin at least once (off the top of my head, when he's making fun of Ron for not knowing about the Triwizard Tournament). Are we expected to believe that Draco or any of his pureblood friends are church-going Christians, or even 'cultural' Christians? Probably not, so where did this come from?
