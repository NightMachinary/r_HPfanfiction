  I think it would be boring if writers didn't come up with new ways to express magic or the world from the Harry Potter books.

Me too! Hence the word recurring.

  I don't even care if i'm reading a Harry potter fanfiction about Harry potter and he's not even close to the personality that is portrayed in the books/movies.

If the fic is about Harry being different, then sure! If it's also about Harry going to Gringott's to have his magical core examined and then being told that he needs to have eyesight and malnutrition potions and to get the horcrux removed, and Harry is betrothed to Draco Malfoy, and the Golden Trio aren't like the rest of my lions, then we start to have a problem.
