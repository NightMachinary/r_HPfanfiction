Character bashing in general annoys me. Or tags like "manipulative!Dumbledore". But that's because character bashing is always bad writing, and anything that talks about manipulative!Dumbledore is almost always just another way of saying braindead!evil!pathetic!Dumbledore. There may be a small number of exceptions, but otherwise...

I don't really get why people look for bashing stories or why authors are happy to write a story with it.
