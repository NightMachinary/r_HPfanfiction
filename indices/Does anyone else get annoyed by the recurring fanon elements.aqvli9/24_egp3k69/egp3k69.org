One piece of fanon I really hate is "House-elves aren't (really) slaves".

In the books, everyone calls them enslaved - even Dumbledore. No one claims they aren't slaves - even Ron, speaking for the average wizard, says "they like being enslaved". Their masters are called "owners". They are inherited like every other piece of property and magically bound.

And yet people keep making up shit about "symbiotic relationship" and "voluntarily serving" just because they cannot accept that Hermione is right about it being slavery.
