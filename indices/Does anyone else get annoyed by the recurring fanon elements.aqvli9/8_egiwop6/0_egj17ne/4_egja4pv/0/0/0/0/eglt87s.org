Can you quote those, please? My memory of them is fuzzier than I thought.

I'm not attempting to justify the Dursleys, I'm just saying that I don't think there were regular beatings before or after he became a wizard. If you want to write fanfics about how terrible the Dursleys are there's enough to work with without exaggerating anything. Exaggeration does a disservice to the character you're trying to insult, unless it's a satire. They were deplorable human beings, and you don't have to reach far to show that's the case.
