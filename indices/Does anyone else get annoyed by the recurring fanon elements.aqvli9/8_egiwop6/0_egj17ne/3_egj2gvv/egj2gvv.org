I'm sure this was just a typo, but it gave me a mental image of Petunia swinging a frying pan which all of a sudden flew out of her hand and started smacking Harry across the head on its own, which made me laugh for a moment despite the implications of child abuse(which would be present regardless since smacking a kid with a somewhat heavy metal cooking utensil is child abuse anyway)
