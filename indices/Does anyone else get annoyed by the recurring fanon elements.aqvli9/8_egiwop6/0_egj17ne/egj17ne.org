Vernon puts the catflap in during his second year. The events that happen there are much more drastic than they've ever been or will be again.

Children were often sent to bed without food, and it's actually quite difficult to develop severe malnutrition unless you're being very, very badly mistreated or regularly lacking specific nutrients in your diet.

Petunia did once swat him with a flying pan (also during his second year) but there's no indication that beatings were a regular occurrence.

I understand why people did these in the first place, what I don't understand is why people continue to use them, and why people used these tropes rather than creating other interpretations.
