So the Dursleys starving and beating Harry is canon actually, not fanon. Its stated in the books, he had a catflap that a single can of soup was passed through, that as a child he was frequently sent to his "room" without food, and that petunia hit him with a frying pan. So yes, that's all canon.

Also, important to note, a ton of those fandom tropes exist because the series wasnt finished. Most of those were created in the summer before the fifth book or during the wait for the sixth and seventh.
