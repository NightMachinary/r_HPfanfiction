Thing about OCs in fanfiction, they often fit the purpose of their being there too easily, and they fit that niche so much that they lack actual character aside from being a plot device, self-insert, background character, etc. plus they're likely to understand the things the readers understand too easily, instead of getting wrapped up in their own theories and experiences and such.

They're by no means an inherently bad thing, after all pretty much every character in an original fictional work is an OC. But in fanfiction they're not often handled well.

Limitations being imposed on the writer are an important thing, at least for narrative tension. In order for conflict to be resolved in a satisfying way, the readers must already understand the thing that's used to solve it. In fanfiction you can skip some of the steps setting it up, but if you change those rules you can't use the readers' pre-existing knowledge of the world.
