  Thing about OCs in fanfiction, they often fit the purpose of their being there too easily, and they fit that niche so much that they lack actual character aside from being a plot device, self-insert, background character, etc. plus they're likely to understand the things the readers understand too easily, instead of getting wrapped up in their own theories and experiences and such

Yes, in that case, OC's are rather bad. But, on the other hand, there are plenty of good fics with Amazingly done OC's.

  Limitations being imposed on the writer are an important thing, at least for narrative tension.

Not nececerally. For example you could use some OC's and do a magic detective/mystery fic. This removes the Hogwarts and the requirment of following canon for a few years
