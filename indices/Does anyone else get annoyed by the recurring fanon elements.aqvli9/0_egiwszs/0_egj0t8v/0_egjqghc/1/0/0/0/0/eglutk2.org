It's a general thing I'm saying about OCs. There have been OCs that I've thought were done extremely well and stood up as characters in their own right.

Have you read the Sherlock crossover fanfic? I thought it was done well.

Having a story which takes place in the same universe but with characters up to different shenanigans, even OCs, is quite a good setup.
