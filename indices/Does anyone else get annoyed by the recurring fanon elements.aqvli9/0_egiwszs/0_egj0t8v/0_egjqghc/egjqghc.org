There's not much of creativity you can do. Look through the TVTropes page. Most of the creative stuff is already tropes. Hell, Harry Potter by itself is a popular trope. And even if you do go creative, the mob comes and screams "IF YOU LIKE OC OR IF THEY DON'T BEHAVE LIKE IN CANON DESPITE THE DIFFRENCES THEN YOU SHOULD MAKE YOUR OWN BOOK, STUPID!". This was somewhat common a year ago at least, and it makes people less willing to write creative, original stuff
