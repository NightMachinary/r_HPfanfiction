A trope as a complex idea, especially as a relation to a particular work can be inherently flawed.

They can be done well (or at least better), but it's more enjoyable to read creative works rather than derivative works. Fanfiction is inherently derivative, but usually there's enough room in the bases the writer hasn't covered that it can still be interesting.
