I did just look it up, and found that Malfoy Manor was indeed used in Deathly Hallows. My point still stands on that being the naming convention for rich purebloods.

Isn't that more of a Quidditch team thing though rather than a way of regularly referring to students?

Magical protections are mentioned in HP, but they're all amalgamated into one thing and used exactly the same way, and mentioned every three pages or so in most fanfiction, despite them not being elaborated on in canon.
