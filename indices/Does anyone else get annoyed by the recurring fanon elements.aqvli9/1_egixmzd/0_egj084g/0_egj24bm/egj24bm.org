Magical protections don't play much of a role in canon - the trio's inside Hogwarts for the majority of the books, and they never have to deal with breaking through magical protections, unless you count Gringotts. Dumbledore does the heavy lifting in the cave, for example.

In fanfiction stories where you have to break into manors and homes, or have to defend them, of course, protections would come up more often. Same if you want to protect your trunk.

With regards to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manor_house#Naming][naming conventions for manors]], it certainly isn't wrong to follow the Malfoy example since that's a real convention, if not the only one and a more modern one - but it's the only example of a manor named in canon.
