Let me ask you a question. When you make a sandwich do you call it "Bread, butter, letucce, ham, cheese" because that's what it is or do you call it by a name "Sandwich". I call it Sandwich. The same is with wards. There are blood protections, anti apparation jinxes, ect, but they all come under one name for easier use. Wards. Just like the Sandwich
