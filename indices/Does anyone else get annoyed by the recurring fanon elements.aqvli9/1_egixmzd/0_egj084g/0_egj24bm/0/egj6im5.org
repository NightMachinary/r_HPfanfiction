There's the blood protection, Gringott's defences which are broken into in the first book and in the last where they're broken into by the 'Golden Trio', Hogwart's defences which prohibit apparition among other things (which they break into), the Age Line, the Fidelius Charm on Harry's original house and 12 Grimmauld Place (incidentally, another pureblood stronghold) there's all of Voldemort's horcrux locations, the Ministry of Magic (which they also break into, twice), and how many times does the word 'ward' come up?
