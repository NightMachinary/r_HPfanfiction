Well, We have spells who can kill, we have spells who can vanish dead bodies - use those two in sequence, and you have a canon way to "disintegrate" someone. Shield Charms are canon as well, so force fields are possible. So, canonically, a trap or ward which does that shouldn't be impossible. That authors choose to add some runestone as requirement, and don't allow it to be cast with just a wand, doesn't seem really out of place either.

I don't really see the problem there. Of course, it's a little boring if everything does the same thing - but on the other hand, it's also logical that if something works, people keep doing it.

How to protect a home from intruders has been a core question in my latest major story, so I've given that quite some thought - and even while striving for variety so not every house has the same defences, there are some things every house defence had in common: A way to identify those who are allowed to enter, a way to keep those who aren't allowed in out, and a way to alert the owner if someone tries to break in. Assuming that the walls are magically protected so a wizard cannot simply transfigure or vanish them, or create a hole in them, isn't much better where variety is concerned. And without "force fields" you need to find reasons why someone wouldn't simply cast Fiendfyre from a broom high above the manor, for example.

And, honestly, if an author isn't writing, like I was, a story which focuses on breaking into heavily guarded manors, then simply using "wards" as a shorthand to explain why this or that location hasn't been destroyed or plundered is a smart choice instead of making up half a dozen different defences or simply ignoring the whole thing.
