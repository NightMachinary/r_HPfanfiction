Ward is usually used to describe a region that is protected from outside influence. If it was HP terminology, it had plenty of opportunities to come up, especially because magical protection *does* play a huge role in canon.

There's a few issues wrapped up with 'wards'.

- Things that aren't wards are turned into wards. The blood protection, fidelius charm, etc.
- The mechanics of wards. This is the real crux of the issue. The mechanics don't align with the mechanics of canon. That's okay, but when those same mechanics are used in so many other places, it becomes tedious.
