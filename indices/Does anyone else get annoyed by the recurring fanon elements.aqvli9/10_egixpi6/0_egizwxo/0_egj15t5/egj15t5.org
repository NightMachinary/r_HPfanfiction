I don't mind stuff that's not in the source material. I don't even mind common tropes being overused. It just has to be done right, which can be difficult, but not impossible. Poorly thought out would fall under the bad writing category though, so I'm with you on that. I can see how all those things could be annoying to other people. I'm just not that hard to please, I guess. Write it well and I'm happy to read it.
