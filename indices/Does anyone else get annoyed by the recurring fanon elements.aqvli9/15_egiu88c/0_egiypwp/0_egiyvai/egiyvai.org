Well then I guess that Star Wars, Harry Potter, Naruto and a lot more are bad because they all use the line orphan who is the subject of a prophecy. That's not cause a lot of people do it that it becomes bad. Fanfictions are bad because they are written from fan, that's the fun in them. I wrote a fanfic a few years ago, I read it again recently, god it was cringy but I had a lot of fun writing it.
