Annnnd that's a trope, and not fanon. If you keep injecting the same tropes into the same work of fiction then it starts becoming fanon, and starts looking a lot more lazy.

I can see why young and inexperienced fanfiction writers would do this, but if it's otherwise well-written it annoys me that I find these elements lurking there.
