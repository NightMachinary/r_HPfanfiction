By CoS he was already attending Hogwarts which heavily changed their dynamics. It wouldn't be probably that out of character, my point was that it's not canon. The other thing is that it usually either serves no point or is used for the purpose of showing how yvilz Dumbledore is (and James and Lily in WBWL scenarios).

And the cupboard was big enough for Vernon to enter so it's not like he is actually squished there in some unnatural position and he spends a lot of time outside it.
