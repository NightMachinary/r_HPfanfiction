Lazy "oh, hey, look at how cartoonishly evil the Dursleys are for treating Harry like this and also Dumbledore and/or James and Lily for leaving him with them" is frustratingly common. I once read two chapters (which was as far as it got, unsurprisingly) of a fic where Vernon physically tortured Harry (an air conditioner was involved somehow) on his birthday, which somehow led to him being raised by ninjas? To also be a ninja? This was probably four years ago at this point, so my memory's not super clear, but yikes.

Anyways, yeah, the idea that the cupboard specifically was somehow responsible for Harry being short, and not, like, general malnourishment and probably his genes is nonsense, I'll not argue with that, I was just pointing out where the idea came from.
