Maybe the short-because-of-the-cupboard thing comes from the aquarium myth where a small tank will stunt a large fish's growth?

It definitely /is/ documented that being malnourished can lead to stunted growth, so I'm not arguing with you. The continuing short thing comes from Daniel Radcliffe, I think, since in the books it is mentioned that Harry is an average/bit tall height by book 5 or 6. I have read medical studies that say if malnutrition is corrected before like 12 or 13, the child will grow to a nearly average height, which is interesting.
