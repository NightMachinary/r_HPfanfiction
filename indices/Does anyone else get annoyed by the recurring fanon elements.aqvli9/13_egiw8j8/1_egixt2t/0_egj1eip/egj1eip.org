Harry is an unreliable narrator; he says that the Dursleys "never starved him, exactly," but would he, an eleven-year-old with no real understanding of nutrition actually know whether he was being starved? And the Dursleys explicitly starve him in CoS; just because that's when they crossed that threshold in canon doesn't mean that them doing it sooner in an AU or FWoaN is somehow OoC.

It's a common idea thrown around the fanfic community that growing up in a cramped space like that would stunt a child's growth, but I've no idea if it had any sort of medical or scientific basis.
