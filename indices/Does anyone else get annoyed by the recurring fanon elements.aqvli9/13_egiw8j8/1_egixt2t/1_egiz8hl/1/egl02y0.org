I'd say it's an understandable assumption for people to jump to. Harry's Wizengamot trial in the movies show the members separated wearing two different colored robes, perhaps trying to lightly mirror the different Houses of Parliament.

With how much of the 'every position is elected', Hogwarts is free, and the numerous muggleborn Ministers for Magic retconned in after the fact, I just assume Rowling is going to say whatever is the most politically correct when asked in an interview regardless of her original interpretation.
