I was never able to reread the books for the same reason until I listened to the audiobooks. I have the US/Jim Dale versions, and found them to be utterly captivating.

I know they're on Audible and Google Play Books, with multi-minute samples, or (most likely) at a local library, so if you do ever want to try to read the books, this could be an alternative.
