When does using a (Hogwarts) house as an adjective help in that way? "That's so Ravenclaw of you!" "You'll need that Gryffindor courage."

Harry is naturally wiry and fast, where does it say that Harry was short for his age?

Hagrid is more sympathetic and less self-righteous to Harry than most adults, and even he at least let things slip accidentally, while very much trying to keep things from him.
