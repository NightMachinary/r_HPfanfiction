I mean, it's supposed to be Ancient and Noble House of.... and that's with canon with Sirius using the full title of "the Ancient and Noble House of Black" in OotP. Houses being used as adjectives isn't fanon as it helps to differentiate which House two speaking/ interacting people are from. Years of malnutrition is actually canon as Harry is rather underweight for his age and probably shorter than he should be from living in a cupboard for a decade. As for children being given a lot of agency and told things they shouldn't be privy to..... I didn't realize Sorcerer's Stone was fanon since Hagrid tells the trio about Fluffy and Snape protecting the stone instead of trying to steal it.
