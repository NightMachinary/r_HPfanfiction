  Harry's eyesight and malnutrituon being cured by potions
#+end_quote

I don't see why not. They can regrow limbs, restructure your body to look like someone else, age you up, potions to be more lucky, fall in love, ect. If all of these are possible, then I don't see why eyesight potions or fitness potions might not be a thing.

  Harry being beaten and starved by Dursleys

But he was. Petunia tried to hit him with a pan, and Dudley made a sport out of chasing and beating Harry up. "Harry Hunting". And in second year, he was fed well below the minumal amount of callories needed to survive.
