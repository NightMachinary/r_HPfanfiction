ITS IN WORDS!!!

I hate these so much! Adding politics to something like Harry Potter is not a good idea. You wanna see why it's not? Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Star Wars: Attack Of The Clones. 2 garbage films that added politics to a world that did not need any politics. AND WHY ARE 15 YEAR OLDS TALKING ABOUT POLITICS?! AND WHY IS DUMBLEDORE SUDDENLY AN EVIL MASTERMIND?! Honestly, I'd be fine with them if they were rare. I really would. But unfortunately, it's almost like every other fanfiction with decent grammar decided that these tropes are worth writing about!!!
