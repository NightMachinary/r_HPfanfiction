I honestly rather like political elements in HP fanfiction provided they're not one sided and different factions can have legitimate, agreeable points even if you are generally against that faction. For example, the Accidental Animagus has two big political events where the Wizengamot votes for a new law for Muggle protection and another one for Werewolf rights.

In the first one, I believe it was Mr. Nott Senior for the "pureblood faction" that went on about how Muggles are ruining the environment and how their own scientists even say it, yet nothing is being done about it. He goes at length describing the problem, the consequences, and the overall complacency that the Muggles appear to have towards such a glaring issue. When I read it the first time, it caught me off guard how, while still with clear fascist undertones, factual the speech was. It wasn't just sprouting some anti-muggle stuff out of a misguided, unproven conception that wizards were superior, but it also tied in actual consideration and research into muggles and using their own information against them.

Now, with the werewolf one, something similar happens, but I'd rather focus on another aspect that made me enjoy those scenes. There was a rather discriminating overhaul of the law presented against werewolves. Andromeda Tonks, that at the time holds Harry's seat in the Wizengamot on his behalf until he comes of age, helped Harry, Sirius, and Remus devise a counter plan. There's a lot of back and forth between the press and the various gatherings. These events eventually lead to the realisation that they can't win it with their current plan, so they do some concessions and revise it. And even then it's still on the edge whether or not they can get their version approved.

I think politics can work to make the world feel larger and more lived in and I especially enjoy it when there's an actual struggle to it. Sure, it's annoying when suddenly everything changes just because the Boy Who Lived took up his seat in the Wizengamot and nearly everyone just does what their great hero and saviour says. I wouldn't like those stories at all, either, but I don't think that that means politics in a HP fanfic are always a bad thing. And I also think that sometimes discussing or thinking about politics as children, especially between the ages of 11 - 18, is great. In my country (western Europe located) kids get encouraged to think, discuss, and write about it and find out what they find important. If you have a werewolf acquintance, it doesn't matter how old you are, you're going to worry if it becomes likely that their lives are being threatened.

The same goes for wards or other fields of (mostly) unexplored magic. I especially enjoy it when it comes on a more international level. I think it's perfectly reasonable that magic from, say Spain, can have a couple different branches than the UK. This is even more so when different continents get into play. I'm not too familiar with the other tropes, though.
