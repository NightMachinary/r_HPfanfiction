Thing is, these elements are ubiquitous in almost any fanfiction. They don't bother me because I don't like politics, they annoy me because aside from whoever first came up with these ideas they're unoriginal. Almost every fanfic recycles so many elements that they become difficult to read.

The best fanfics keep almost everything the same, until a point where it diverges, or explore some aspect of the original story that hadn't been considered.

7/10 works mention wards, when they were barely in the books, if at all. Many of these changes are implemented lazily, and raise far more questions than they answer.
