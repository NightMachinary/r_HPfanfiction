I think that's more just bad writing (or perhaps just novice/inexperienced writing) in general rather than that there's anything wrong with the idea or trope. Sure, any story will have a couple flaws, but I think most tropes will simply work well when it's clear that a lot of thought and consideration went into them.

But that's also the wonder of fanfiction in general. You can get super hyped about an idea that someone else came up with and just get very eager to try something similar yourself. Even if perhaps it doesn't have a place in your fanfic or when it doesn't go well with some of the other tropes. It happens. We all make mistakes and we can all learn from them.

I also don't think that the best fanfics are those that are the most canon compliant. Personally I prefer canon divergence fanfics, but that doesn't mean that an AU can't be an excellent work of fanfiction, too. Besides, canon divergence can be a very broad term already, especially for vast fandom verses like Harry Potter. I want the HP fanfics that I read to add more depth to the HP world, be that by adding more nuance to the cultures, heated politics, exploration of art, high school dynamics, world magics or magics that aren't very well explored in the books, a focus on Quidditch and/or other wizarding sports, or pretty much anything else.

I also prefer it when the characterization at least starts out in what I would expect of that character from canon. Naturally, I would expect something different from a 7 year old Harry than that I would from a 15 year old Harry. From there, I'm perfectly okay with a character building up and then doing a literal 180 /if/ the events that play out in the story make it plausible. Like Draco being an absolute prick in the first three years and then having a year of self reflection and doubt so that in year 5 or year 6 he might be more of a "good" character. Works for anyone, Draco was just an easy example right now.

However, for other fandoms I've read AU and I've read fanfic where characters are quite different from their canon characterization to the point where they had entire new personalities and relationships. Sometimes the AU was in a very different world, but with mostly canon characterization, sometimes the characters were very different in their own world, but something went different that had a large impact which affected them all to grow up and develop differently. They can still be enjoyable reads, especially if you're into that kind of thing, and that's okay. It's just not where my personal preference lies.

You are free dislike anything to do with politics, no matter how they are done, and that's fine. There are thousands of Harry Potter fics out there and yes, it can be hard to find one that you like, but I think just shutting down so many tropes also limits you and denies you a potential to be amazed by what people might do with an idea. I never thought I would like an apocalypse story. Yet my favourite Supernatural fanfic is exactly that. :)
