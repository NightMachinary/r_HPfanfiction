For me, I think a good work will almost always only be different to the source material in one (possibly two or over, but the more the worse) way.

This can be a tweak to the setting, adding a character, being set in a different work, emphasising dark elements, changing how magic works, changing a character in a fundamental way, an event that never happened in canon, etc. but from there any other changes should happen as a result of the first one.

We don't even have to know what the inciting element is, or what its consequences are yet. Some of the fun of some stories is finding out what else is different now that that one thing has changed. The more logical and self consistent it is, the more fascinating.

There is of course also room for a change in tone, adding in elements where there are gaps, but they should fit. Now that Voldemort is a mongoose, it's natural for the rest of the story to be funnier, and it makes sense for the fact that there are snakes hidden in the Slytherin common room to come up now.

For these fanon elements, almost always nothing ever comes of them, and they aren't done in isolation. Suspension of disbelief in fan works has to also hinge on the source material.

I don't hate politics, or even universally hate the way they're done.

But no matter how well-written a story is, if the premise is that Harry Potter is now a red-headed girl who was Salazar's descendant and Hermione is a dog animagus, in a world that overlaps with Anne of Green Gables, then the story is almost certainly bad.

Likewise, if you have too many fanon elements, it becomes more and more likely it's too tedious to read.
