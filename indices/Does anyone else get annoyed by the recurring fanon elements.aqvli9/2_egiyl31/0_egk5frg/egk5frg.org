"It wasn't just sprouting some anti-muggle stuff out of a misguided, unproven conception that wizards were superior"

I just want to point that wizards are superior. They literally can and do survive stuff that muggles canÂ´t. They are marvells superman. What increasing number of people do not seem to get is, acknowledging this kind of fact does not make you want to genocide anyone.

In the end, rational discussion can be had and everyone should agree that it is not a good idea demand that mixed mugle and wizard kids PE class has mandatory broom riding and quidditch games in the name of /insert buzzword/. You just do something else and acknowledge each others streghts and weaknesses. In the end children should have fun and educational class.
