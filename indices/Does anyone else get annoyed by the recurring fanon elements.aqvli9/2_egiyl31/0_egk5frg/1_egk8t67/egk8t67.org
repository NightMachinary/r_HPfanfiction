  I just want to point out that wizards are superior.

Well, that depends on what you define as superior. Yes, magic is cool and handy and wizards usually live longer. However, their culture and traditions are obviously still very flawed. The majority doesn't want to adapt to modern times and won't consider anything the Muggles do possibly valuable even though the Muggles' new/growing perspective, especially in our age and time, could give wizards new insights as well. In the original books, and even in the Fantastic Beasts movies and some of the Pottermore articles, this conservative attitude is the norm. McGonagall is said (on Pottermore) to have quit her job at the Ministry because of their low views towards Muggles while she herself was a half blood with a Muggle father. Even wizards that find Muggles worth more consideration, like Arthur Weasley and Professor Burbage (from Muggle Studies) have a hard time understanding Muggles. Physically speaking, I agree that wizards are superior, but intellectually they're not better than Muggles. They should open that debate, that you also mention, and recognise each others strengths and weaknesses, but the majority of wizards, even those that are not obsessed with blood purity, don't want to have that debate any more than that the majority of people in our world are willing to calmly discuss the difference between masculinity and toxic masculinity.
