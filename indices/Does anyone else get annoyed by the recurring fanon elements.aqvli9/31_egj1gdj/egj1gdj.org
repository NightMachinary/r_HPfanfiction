So basically what you are saying is fan fiction annoys you. The fact is JKR created a pretty empty world and without many of these tropes it is simply either a) boring or b) still empty. Harry Potter isn't LoTR, as JKR literally does almost nothing in regards to world building and thus it is up to fans to fill in the blanks if they choose to write fan fiction. Heck even where JKR tried world building her math/consistency skills are so poor that it still needs a ton of revision/retconning to work.
