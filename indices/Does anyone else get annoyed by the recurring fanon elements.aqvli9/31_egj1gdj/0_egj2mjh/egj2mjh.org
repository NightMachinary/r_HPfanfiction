Nope, I'm not saying that.

Nor am I particularly annoyed about poorly-thought out additions, or biased interpretations, or incorporating aspects of other works.

I don't like these repetitive fanon elements because they've been done too many times, they're not even part of the original work so there's no imperative whatsoever to do homage to them, and they're lazy.
