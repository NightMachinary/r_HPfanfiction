Thing about Magical Cores, is that it shows magic to be the limiting factor, rather than how much of a connection to it people have. Exhaustion, if it's a thing, would preferably be something to do with the strain of having to use that much. Though the books are ambiguous on that topic, and there are many possible interpretations.

It's just one, fairly bland, interpretation that's taken as a given, and mainly used to either shoehorn in an explanation to why things are happening the way they should be happening (mainly solving conflicts rather than creating them, which reeks of deus ex machina) or bragging about/using as a way to big up a character.
