It depends on how such elements are used; for example Magical Cores are usually used for power bragging or something similar but if they are just used as an explanation for why someone can't just Bombarda for hours I find it acceptable. If something can be explained in a way that seems canon compliant just by twisting it a bit I like it; unfortunately most of the time such elements are added without tought or any real intention of expansion on it. Personally I like some of the fanon element more than the canon but it all depends on how someone uesd them
