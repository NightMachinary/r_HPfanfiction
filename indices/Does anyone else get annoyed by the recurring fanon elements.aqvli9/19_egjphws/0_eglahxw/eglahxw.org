  Wizengamot politics is particularly interesting, if well done. Actually a lot of these are interesting, if well done, and you don't come across them in story, after story, after story.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I think so too. But you do come across them story after story after story, and the Wizengamot politics always work almost the same, and Harry always has an inherited seat even though there's nothing saying seats are inherited.

  Interestingly, rereading HP as an adult now they seem a hell of a lot more canon abusive than they did 15 years ago when I was like, “Oh he lives in a cupboard. That sucks.” Now I'm like, “He lived in a cupboard? WTF??” I mean that is seriously child abuse, how they treated him.
#+end_quote

Yeah, good point. Harry's treatment is filtered through the eyes of a child, they're not likely to get that angry if they haven't known any better.

It is child abuse, no matter which way you look at it. But it's taken for granted in a lot of stories that he was regularly getting beaten and was malnourished, and such, when that's not /quite/ true.

  It leaves a lot of holes, and it's fun for us now to fill them in. I think it's OK to do that.
#+end_quote

Sure. But people keep filling them in with the same things.
