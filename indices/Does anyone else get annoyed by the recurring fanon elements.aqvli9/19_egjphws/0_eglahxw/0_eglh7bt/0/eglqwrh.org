Molly is in some ways a stereotypical mother who loves cooking. They are terrible caregivers, but here's the thing: it doesn't need any more exaggeration.

If you want to point out what terrible human beings the Dursleys are, it's just lazy to make out that it was even worse than it actually was.

Petunia may not have meant to actually hit him, though if it did I doubt she would have hit him hard, otherwise it would have come up before. In OotP there's just been a noise like a gunshot, and Vernon's getting him back inside to hide him from the neighbours.

But yeah, fair enough comment all round. It's not a stretch by any means to imagine the Dursleys giving him the occasional session of physical abuse.
