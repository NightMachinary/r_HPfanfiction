True, I suppose. I don't know where the inherited seats idea came from at all - I would actually hope you get elected to the Wizengamot or some such. Though I can see why this may be a thing, with so much importance still placed in pure blood mania.

Back to the Dursleys for a minute - I think the starving might be getting picked out from comments like, say, Molly constantly telling Harry he looks skinny or underfed when he comes over. And again, what happened in CoS, the diet in GoF. And I did get the impression that they were hitting him occasionally at least - like in CoS I believe he said he had to “duck Petunia's soapy frying pan” or something like that. Which she would do so casually? Just for him pretending to do magic? That implies a familiarity with doing so. And in OotP, Vernon did grab Harry around the neck in the beginning. Now I wouldn't say they were just constantly beating the crap out of him nonstop, but I can definitely see where that idea would come from, and I don't even think it's a big stretch of the canon. In fact, I think JKR kind of introduces it and skates over it and by the end of DH, the Dursleys become a bit of a joke - like compared to Voldemort, what are they, really? They're silly! I don't think they're silly at all! I think they're terrible, abusive caregivers!

I suppose people are spending a lot of time reading fanfics and getting inspiration from that for their own. I guess it's understandable. I haven't actually used any of these things in my stories, I don't think, except the use of “wards” which I realized after I read your initial post. But I'm not actually sure why I used that word, I think it's just a word that sounds cool, and also, I've been reading a lot of Dresden Files, must have borrowed it. XD
