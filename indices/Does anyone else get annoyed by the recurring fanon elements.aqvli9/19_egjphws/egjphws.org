Interesting discussion here. I think some of the things you mentioned are interesting, some are annoying. I've seen some of these used very well.

So, to trail off on a sidebar, I used to be very into FanFiction during the long summer before OotP when almost none of these things were things, and now, as I've rediscovered fanfic in the last few years, I'm noticing a lot of these things - ie, Lord Potter, Lord Black, Harry/Daphne, manipulative Dumbledore, Wizengamot politics....

I think it's very interesting how lots and lots of different authors use these same concepts across their stories. Wizengamot politics is particularly interesting, if well done. Actually a lot of these are interesting, if well done, and you don't come across them in story, after story, after story.

Abusive Dursleys... that one was always popular and I don't even know that that is so much fanon, considering they practically starved Harry in CoS. Interestingly, rereading HP as an adult now they seem a hell of a lot more canon abusive than they did 15 years ago when I was like, “Oh he lives in a cupboard. That sucks.” Now I'm like, “He lived in a cupboard? WTF??” I mean that is seriously child abuse, how they treated him.

As mentioned above, JKR didn't give us a lot of info on how a lot of things in her world worked. Probably that was intentional. It leaves a lot of holes, and it's fun for us now to fill them in. I think it's OK to do that.

But yes, I do get really annoyed by some of these elements if they are not done well!
