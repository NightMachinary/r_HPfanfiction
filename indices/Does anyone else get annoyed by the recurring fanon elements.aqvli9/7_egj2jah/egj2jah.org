I have very uneasy relationship with them. Some are benign (limited use of wards), but most are disgusting ("Lord Potter could you pass a salt to Heiress Greengrass, please, Scion Longbottom is in the way?").

OTOH, while reading linkao3(Accidental Animagus) I was not offended that much. [[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=829344]] Yes, I prefer fics which are keeping universe more in the middle-class/bourgeois (Northumbrian's ones, for example), but it is possible to imagine that very small closed community would develop some kind of inherited aristocracy rule. And Hermione finding out who was W.H. and Dark Lady of Sonnets is just too precious to miss.

Or, again, the bingo card has (rightfully) “Marriage Law” as one item, but linkffn(11916243) is just great even though I generally dislike Harmony (and yes, it is firmly in my headcannon, that Audrey is a Muggle).
