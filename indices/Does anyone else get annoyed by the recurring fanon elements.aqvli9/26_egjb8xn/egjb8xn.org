  Light-Dark factions
#+end_quote

Oof. This one bothers me more than most. I recently read a story where the baddies refer to themselves as the 'Dark faction' all the time, like they know they're the designated villains in the story.

That's not how reality works! People like Voldemort and his Death Eaters think they're the *heroes* of their story, not the villains! They're preserving their traditions or saving their world from a ruthless Muggleborn invader who threatens to expose them to the Muggles, that sort of thing!

But yes, everything you wrote drives me nuts. I'll read the stories if they have one or two of those and are well-written, but I cringe internally every time I see "Lord Potter-Black" talking to "Heir Malfoy" or "Heir Longbottom" about the Wizengamot or an ancient alliance.
