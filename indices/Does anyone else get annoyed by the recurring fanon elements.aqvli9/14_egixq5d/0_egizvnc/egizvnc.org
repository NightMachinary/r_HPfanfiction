I was more talking about seats on the Wizengamot being inherited, not them being talked about.

Animal description isn't a bad thing, it's just that Gryffindors keep getting called 'lions', Slytherins 'Snakes', etc. by almost everyone when nobody does it in canon.

Nowhere is called 'Malfoy Manor' or 'Potter Manor' or 'Black Manor' in the books, and nowhere is suggested that old pureblood families all have mansions.

I don't mind the factions themselves as much as them being explicitly called Light and Dark.

The Goblet of Fire thing wouldn't have been so bad if so many people hadn't done it. But it raises questions too, like: "If you can strip people of their magic, why don't they do that to literally anyone, including criminals?"

In so many stories do we find out that Harry's huge pile of gold is a 'trust fund', and in actuality he has a family one, the Black one (nevermind he never inherited anything Black in the books until Sirius died), the Riddle one...

Merlin's expressions are often of a different nature in fanfiction though, you get things like "Merlin only knows" which sets him up as kind of a god figure despite him having been a student at the school they are currently attending. 'Merlin's Beard' is the kind of old-timey expression that they might have used for great heroes, and Merlin's pants was a Hermione-original.
