  Magical cores
#+end_quote

I'm not completely opposed to them, but they don't really fit the more whimsical nature of the Potter-verse magic.

#+begin_quote
  young children being afforded a huge amount of agency and told things that no adult would ever tell a child
#+end_quote

This is a pain in the arse. Unless it's Hagrid letting something slip, it really doesn't fit for schoolchildren to be told these things. The Trelawney prophecy is a possible exception but it is rarely written well.

#+begin_quote
  children politicking
#+end_quote

This sucks. This has always sucked. This will never not suck. And it sucks even more in the real world.

#+begin_quote
  Great and Noble House of
#+end_quote

We literally only ever hear the Blacks call themselves this. Nobody, not even Draco Malfoy is as in love with themselves as the Blacks were. So yeah, it got old.

#+begin_quote
  ward-obsession
#+end_quote

I don't mind this when it's done correctly, but that's a big if. It's rarely given proper attention.

#+begin_quote
  seats on the wizengamot
#+end_quote

That depends. Is it Amelia lamenting the state of affairs or is it the little students being on the Wizengamot, despite not knowing anything about how laws actually work?

#+begin_quote
  goblins instantly finding horcrux
#+end_quote

I've only seen this a few times, given my inclination against goblin-heavy fics

#+begin_quote
  years of malnutrition and Harry's eyesight being cured (and curable) by potions
#+end_quote

This does get old--especially since Harry's glasses give him a flaw that can be exploited (how come no bad guy ever said /Accio Glasses!/).

#+begin_quote
  houses being used as adjectives
#+end_quote

If you mean things like "Gryffindor courage" or "Ravenclaw wit." I don't come across these often enough to form a real opinion, but I am inclined against them. If I've learned anything as a writer, it's that adjectives should be used sparingly.

#+begin_quote
  people in houses being described as the house animal
#+end_quote

I don't mind people being described as animals--my favorite fanfic /Faith and Understanding/ has Ginny note that Luna's large, unblinking eyes and twitchy nose make her look somewhat like a rabbit. But within the context of House animals...well, it's not really Rowling's style. C.S. Lewis on the other hand--that sort of thing was his style. It can work, but it takes a special tone of story-telling to do it.

#+begin_quote
  [Last name] Manor
#+end_quote

Within reason, this can work well. But less is more.

#+begin_quote
  betrothals
#+end_quote

Marriage fics were never my thing in the first place, so I don't think I can fairly answer this.

#+begin_quote
  Golden Trio
#+end_quote

I got used to it.

#+begin_quote
  Light-Dark factions
#+end_quote

I actually like this. The Death Eaters and others pursue the Dark Arts to twist magic. The Aurors fought them because laws were broken. The Order fought them because that sort of magic was wrong.

#+begin_quote
  the Dursleys regularly starving or beating Harry
#+end_quote

Though the Durselys regularly gave Harry only a minimal amount of food and occasionally manhandled him, the degrees to which fandom often goes is rather disconcerting.

#+begin_quote
  Harry has a bunch more secret bank account,
#+end_quote

Given that Harry's grandfather, according to Pottermore, invented several important potions in common use, I never understood why people didn't just have ongoing deposits into Harry's existing account.

#+begin_quote
  Goblet of Fire making you lose your magic
#+end_quote

Fandom needed some sort of Consequence that would prevent forfeiting the Triwizard and while magic cannot be stolen, I can't exactly blame them for coming up with this.

#+begin_quote
  Merlin being used as blasphemy beyond things like 'Merlin's Beard'
#+end_quote

Iff used creatively, this could be fun--Hermione even says "Merlin's pants" in canon.
