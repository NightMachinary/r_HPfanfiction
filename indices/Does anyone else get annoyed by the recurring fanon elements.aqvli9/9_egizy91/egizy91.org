#+begin_quote
  Magical Cores
#+end_quote

It's an interesting idea for sure, but one I don't really see written well or believably enough.

#+begin_quote
  Young children being afforded a huge amount of agency and told things that no adult would ever tell a child
#+end_quote

This one depends for me, Harry was completely stupid, he was a teenager and teenagers do tend to be rather stupid, but he's a part of the reason why Voldemort has to go down, if Dumbledore was slightly (Not overly so; but slightly) more open with Harry with some things, he (might) not have done so many stupid things outside of not knowing things.

#+begin_quote
  Great and Noble House
#+end_quote

Technically speaking, the Blacks; are, as far as we know, the only family with this type of title. (It could just be a self insert title, created by them as well. We don't know.

#+begin_quote
  Ward-obsession
#+end_quote

Like the magical cores, it could be done in interesting ways, but rarely isn't. And it's just a part of the Blood Wards that Harry had at the Dursley's, as well.

#+begin_quote
  Seats on the Wizengamot
#+end_quote

This is often an overdone trope that I'm annoyed with, it's normally just used to show that Dumbledore was a manipulative and evil Wizard, keeping things from Harry; which got old, fast.

#+begin_quote
  Goblins instantly finding Horcrux
#+end_quote

You'd think that Gringotts would have magical protections to show dark objects like Horcruxes, but apparently not? Which is an odd thing not to have. I don't really see this one used in fanfics all that much, myself; though.

#+begin_quote
  years of malnutrition and Harry's eyesight being cured (and curable) by potions
#+end_quote

I could see it working, if he was still young enough, like 11 or younger, but any older than that, and I don't think that'd work. I mean there are potions to grow your arm back, and the like; it wouldn't be too far of a stretch to fix some of the malnutrition problems. (I feel).

Though I rather like him keeping his glasses, (Though that does make me wonder why Death Eaters never went like Accio Glasses, that would give them quite an advantage). But I digress.

#+begin_quote
  people in houses being described as the house animal
#+end_quote

I don't really see this done that often, honestly.

#+begin_quote
  [Last name] Manor
#+end_quote

Well, Malfoy Manor is a thing. (Unless that was made up by fanon? And I'm confusing the two?

#+begin_quote
  betrothals
#+end_quote

Yes I have a very strong hatred for them, there was a phase where every other story I came across had this idea, it got old very quickly.

#+begin_quote
  magical guardians
#+end_quote

Not entirely sure what you mean by this? Maybe I didn't read as many stories with this idea? I don't know.

#+begin_quote
  Golden Trio
#+end_quote

It was annoying at first, but I've gotten used to it. I don't see Harry, Hermione or Ron saying it, but I could see someone like Fred and George or someone like that tease them and come up with the name that way.

#+begin_quote
  Light-Dark factions
#+end_quote

What exactly do you mean by this? I'm not entirely sure.

#+begin_quote
  the Dursleys regularly starving or beating Harry
#+end_quote

To be completely fair, this was canon. Though the fanon levels they go to; are often even more extreme.

#+begin_quote
  Harry has a bunch more secret bank account
#+end_quote

Yes annoying. After Sirius was killed, I could see him giving him his bank account as well; but the Potter's and Black's would be the only two he would own, I feel.

#+begin_quote
  Goblet of Fire making you lose your magic
#+end_quote

It's rarely written well; but I understand why people thought this idea up. (Why let Harry compete when this has been known to kill people? So they come up with this idea).

#+begin_quote
  Merlin being used as blasphemy beyond things like Merlin's Beard
#+end_quote

Didn't Hermione once use Merlin's pants in canon? So it's not too far off, and I don't mind this one, really. (It can often give me a good laugh when it's a particular good one). And I don't see this one done to the point of calling it a trope, myself.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore holding onto the 'Greater Good' philosophy
#+end_quote

Wasn't this canon though? The need of the many, outweigh the need of the few? For his mind.

I personally really like certain ideas, depending on how they're written. The whole idea of fanon is using canon ideas and expanding them, or using a quote or something and bringing forward a new idea, or the like.

Stuff like Children politics and the like are definitely irksome and unbelievable, but there are good stories out there that utilize something from canon, and make it their own fanon thing quite well. (IMO).
