It's one thing for Dumbledore to tell Harry he has to sacrifice himself to kill Voldemort at 15 (which didn't happen, but wouldn't have been that unbelievable), quite another for adult after adult to lay the cold hard truths of politics, horrific crime, finance, etc. down on Harry's lap at minimal prompting. Particularly at 11 and below.

Not only that, but Harry announces that he wants to make huge withdrawals, sue, have a duel, drop out of school, have Sirius Black set free, etc. and suddenly they're at his beck and call?

Horcruxes are particularly hard to find, and they're meant to be. If goblins could easily find them, then Voldemort would never have given one to them, and if they could be easily removed without damaging Harry, then Dumbledore would have found a way.

I'd thought Malfoy Manor was made up by fanon, and it was, but apparently JK Rowling did use it afterwards. All the other '[Wealthy Pureblood] Manor's are apparently made up though.

In fanon, 'Champion of the Light', and such are tossed about, even though that's not done in canon, to say nothing of what that would say about the opinions of society.

Dumbledore certainly stopped spouting that slogan, and was certainly quite remorseful about the things that he felt he still had to do.
