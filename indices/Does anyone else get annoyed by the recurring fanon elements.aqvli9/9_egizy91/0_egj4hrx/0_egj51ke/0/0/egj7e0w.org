I'm not exactly meaning there's a way to tell that there's a Horcrux per say, just to show that hey this magical protection we have around Gringotts is going off, something's odd with this object; we should check it out.

Again, it might have been a poor over sight on Rowling's part, but for a bank like Gringotts, that's suppose to be pretty well protected, I would have thought that they would have had something, even though Horcruxes are incredibly rare; not for the Horcrux itself, but to show that hey something is odd/off/weird about this object.

But again, that might have been an oversight on Rowling's part.

But yeah; I don't mind if fanfiction takes liberties with things; or if it's not even from the source material, heck; in my mind Cursed Child does not exist at all; and certain things that Rowling has said after the books about how Squibs are born, I do not agree with; and other similar things like that.

It can even use a trope that's over done, as long as they do it in a interesting way.
