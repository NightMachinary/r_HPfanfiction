  It's one thing for Dumbledore to tell Harry he has to sacrifice himself to kill Voldemort at 15 (which didn't happen, but wouldn't have been that unbelievable), quite another for adult after adult to lay the cold hard truths of politics, horrific crime, finance, etc. down on Harry's lap at minimal prompting. Particularly at 11 and below.

  Not only that, but Harry announces that he wants to make huge withdrawals, sue, have a duel, drop out of school, have Sirius Black set free, etc. and suddenly they're at his beck and call?

Yeah, all of that is ridiculous, though the having Sirius be set free isn't. I don't know if Rowling never thought of this or what, but why didn't Harry and co use a Pensive and stuff to show that hey Pettigrew is alive and Sirius is innocent? That just seems like a great oversight on Rowling's part. (She had likely not thought up the Pensive after the fact, but still).

  Horcruxes are particularly hard to find

True, but you'd think if Bellatrix had a Horcrux inside her vault, something would be triggered; letting the Goblins know. Again maybe Rowling didn't think of it; or she did and decided against using the idea? I don't know. And again I don't really see this often enough to be considered bad or a trope or anything.
