A wand is 7 galleons, the money won was 700. Them winning the money is not something that's particularly crucial to the argument, I just wanted to point that out.

I wasn't talking about the intentions (let's not go there, even though that's absolutely not the same thing) I was talking about what it amounted to. He's a particularly rich dude who happens to have no parents, and he gave up a small amount of money that meant nothing to him. Ron is a valid argument though, but I guess it's his money?
