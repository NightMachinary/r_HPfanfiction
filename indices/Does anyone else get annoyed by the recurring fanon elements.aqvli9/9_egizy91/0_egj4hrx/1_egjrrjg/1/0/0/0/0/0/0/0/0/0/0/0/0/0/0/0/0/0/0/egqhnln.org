Well, Hermione wheedling the money isn't the same thing as leaving out clothes, for example, which I think we can agree is a case of well-intentioned extremist, which I personally think there's adequate evidence to make a case for Hitler not being one.

But okay, in retrospect wheedling money out of a poor child is actually quite a thoughtless and cruel thing to do.
