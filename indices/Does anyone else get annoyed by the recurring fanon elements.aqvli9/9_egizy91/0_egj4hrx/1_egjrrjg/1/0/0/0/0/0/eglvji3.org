  That's not the way adults tend to think about children: "Welp, his sister died in front of him. Time to tell him how Grandma got betrayed by the rest of the mafia!"

Not exactly comparable, I think. It's more of, "Hitler tries his best to kill him and has a hate-bonner for him. He also fought him off. Maybe he deserves to know something about our plans to protect him"

  And wizards suck at mental health in general.

We have no proof of that.

  But usually, it's "Leave the talking to us." rather than "Here's how to win a vote on the Wizengamot, Lord Potter of the Anciente and Noble House of Potter-Peverell-Black-Riddle."

Fair enough.

  The Dursleys originally lie to Harry, but when Hagrid arrives, Petunia rants about Lily being a witch, being friends with (Snape), and getting herself 'blown up'.

  "Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!" Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, "Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!"

Huh, it appears you were right.

  It's difficult to bribe people with a legitimately sinister agenda. You can bribe them to get away with stuff, but bribing them to enforce justice? No chance, if there are powerful people bribing them so they don't do that.
#+end_quote

Except the Wizarding world doesn't consider muggles as anything more than silly creatures with silly toys that sometimes kill eachother. And, bribing people to not do justice is not that impossible. Some people even do that without bribery

  I thought Hagrid didn't let him spend too much, the Weasleys weren't going to tell him how to spend his money because they were in such a poor situation, the rules were relaxed when they found Harry alive and well, Bill got a set amount of money for Harry, and I can't really remember the other times.
#+end_quote

Hagrid advised. Harry to take only a small amount, so he wouldn't just spend it all immediatly. He did nothing more.
