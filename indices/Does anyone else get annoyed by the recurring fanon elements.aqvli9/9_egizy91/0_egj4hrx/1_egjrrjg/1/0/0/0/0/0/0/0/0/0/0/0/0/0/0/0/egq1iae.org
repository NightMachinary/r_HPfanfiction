And that makes it better? Hitler killed all the jews because he thought he was helping Germans. Doesn't make his holocaust good, nor does Hermione's bullying and you could even call it extortion, make it any better just because she had a nice idea. Another example would be Grindelwald. He thought he was helping magical people. Possibly would have stopped muggle wars too. Doesn't make his actions any good
