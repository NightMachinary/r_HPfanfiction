  His specific circumstances and attachments make these actions realistic.
#+end_quote

That's true. And Harry having battled Voldemort is probably ready to hear some shit. That reminds me, he never got any therapy for Cedrics death did he?

#+begin_quote
  If Harry had actually asked deeper questions about it, would anyone have gone into the subtle intricacies? I suspect not.
#+end_quote

Arthur might have, although his views would be biased. To be fair, probably nobody could give him an unbiased version.

#+begin_quote
  Children need to know not to take candy from strangers, but do they need to know what happens in the stranger's van? Nobody tells them about being raped and killed specifically, just that they need to not do that.
#+end_quote

Yes, but if your word might help to let someone like Lucius enable to hunt Muggles, then someone would inform him to be careful about his words.

#+begin_quote
  Petunia was the one who said they got 'blown up' in an angry rant.
#+end_quote

Had she? 'Cause I remember car crash. Looked it up, I was right. Here's the quote:

#+begin_quote
  The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. "In the car crash when your parents died," she had said. "And don't ask questions."

  Hagrid felt he had to make up for complete lack of information when almost every child in their world knew about it.
#+end_quote

Does it make a diffrence?

#+begin_quote
  Are you saying Harry can just bribe the government? They're already being bribed.
#+end_quote

He sure can. Both Muggle and Magical. Hell, Muggle one is likely even more corrupt, at least nowadays.

#+begin_quote
  Besides, no rational mature adult is going to give a child free reign with all of their inherited money until they come of age.
#+end_quote

Weird, I remember no actual limitations on his vault. He could take as much as he pleased.

#+begin_quote
  Harry has compared to someone like, say, Lucius Malfoy? Or Fudge?
#+end_quote

Less than Malfoy, more than Fudge. Besides, Harry is way more respectable than say Lucius who once was tried for being a Death Eater. Even if the changes never stuck, the stigma likely has. Same things happen IRL.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore didn't ask anything of Harry that he wouldn't do himself
#+end_quote

Well, he certanly didn't go to Voldemort and killed himself there.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore was often saddened by the sheer amount of trust and admiration Harry had for him.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I think I recall that in book 6.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore no longer believes in committing great acts of conquest and such 'For the Greater Good' and no longer trusts himself with power
#+end_quote

But he still believes in doing stuff for the Greater Good.
