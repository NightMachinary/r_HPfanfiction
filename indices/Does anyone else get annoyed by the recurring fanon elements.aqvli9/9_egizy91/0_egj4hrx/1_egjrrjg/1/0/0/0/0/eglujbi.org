  That's true. And Harry having battled Voldemort is probably ready to hear some shit. That reminds me, he never got any therapy for Cedrics death did he?
#+end_quote

That's not the way adults tend to think about children: "Welp, his sister died in front of him. Time to tell him how Grandma got betrayed by the rest of the mafia!"

And wizards suck at mental health in general.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, but if your word might help to let someone like Lucius enable to hunt Muggles, then someone would inform him to be careful about his words.
#+end_quote

Okay, sure. It's feasible that they might tell him to watch his words, which they do on a couple of occasions. But usually, it's "Leave the talking to us." rather than "Here's how to win a vote on the Wizengamot, Lord Potter of the Anciente and Noble House of Potter-Peverell-Black-Riddle."

  Had she? 'Cause I remember car crash. Looked it up, I was right. Here's the quote:
#+end_quote

The Dursleys originally lie to Harry, but when Hagrid arrives, Petunia rants about Lily being a witch, being friends with (Snape), and getting herself 'blown up'.

#+begin_quote
  He sure can. Both Muggle and Magical. Hell, Muggle one is likely even more corrupt, at least nowadays.
#+end_quote

It's difficult to bribe people with a legitimately sinister agenda. You can bribe them to get away with stuff, but bribing them to enforce justice? No chance, if there are powerful people bribing them so they /don't/ do that.

#+begin_quote
  Weird, I remember no actual limitations on his vault. He could take as much as he pleased.
#+end_quote

I thought Hagrid didn't let him spend too much, the Weasleys weren't going to tell him how to spend his money because they were in such a poor situation, the rules were relaxed when they found Harry alive and well, Bill got a set amount of money for Harry, and I can't really remember the other times.

#+begin_quote
  Less than Malfoy, more than Fudge. Besides, Harry is way more respectable than say Lucius who once was tried for being a Death Eater. Even if the changes never stuck, the stigma likely has. Same things happen IRL.
#+end_quote

Lucius donates money to Mungo's, and such. He's popular with the aristocrats, we just see the opinions of those that dislike him more than those who are in favour of him.

#+begin_quote
  Well, he certanly didn't go to Voldemort and killed himself there.
#+end_quote

You think Dumbledore wouldn't have done that? He gave up on searching for a cure pretty quickly so Severus could kill him, and basically had to plead him to do it.

#+begin_quote
  But he still believes in doing stuff for the Greater Good.
#+end_quote

Before he matured, Greater Good was his /excuse/. I think now he does actually understand what he's fighting for, and he's doing it for the right reasons. He more of Harry than himself, and probably rightly so. He's still fallible though, and makes grave mistakes.
