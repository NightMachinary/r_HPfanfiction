  Okay, that is fair, I'll admit. Although Serius did tell him some stuff about the Order of the Phoenix meetings.

Sirius is in some ways a manchild, and the other adults were against him doing this. His specific circumstances and attachments make these actions realistic.

  Because Harry doesn't care for it. But we do know there are two factions, the Purebloods and everybody else. In second year, Lucius tried to frame Arthur with a dark artifact to prevent the muggle protection law from passing.
#+end_quote

If Harry had actually asked deeper questions about it, would anyone have gone into the subtle intricacies? I suspect not.

  You think Prince Harry wasn't told to be careful of being used as a child? Or any very famous child? Besides, even us common folk are at least told to not accept candy from strangers and not get into their van, which is very simple manipulation by child molestors.
#+end_quote

Like I said, need to know basis. Children need to know not to take candy from strangers, but do they need to know what happens in the stranger's van? Nobody tells them about being raped and killed specifically, just that they need to not do that.

  Car crash is what Dursleys said. And Hagrid did tell Harry that Voldemort murdered his parents. As for the bank, it was supposed to be the safest place on earth bar Hogwarts. That is a pretty horific crime
#+end_quote

Petunia was the one who said they got 'blown up' in an angry rant. Hagrid felt he had to make up for complete lack of information when almost every child in their world knew about it. Again, Harry wasn't told by adults, but by a newspaper. (It's not exactly 'horrific' either, given that it was of little actual consequence and children wouldn't grasp the deeper implications, but that doesn't matter because even if that were the case that still wouldn't prevent it being in the newspaper.)

  Political power doesn't matter much if the government is corrupt and can be bribed. And either way, even if he is naive but he has a good laywer or something like that, they can't oppose him much. He is the most famous person in all of Magical Britan that is still alive. And he has fuck ton of cash to back up his fame.
#+end_quote

Are you saying Harry can just bribe the government? They're /already/ being bribed. A good lawyer isn't always enough, either, especially since there are other good lawyers. How much cash do you think Harry has compared to someone like, say, Lucius Malfoy? Or Fudge? Besides, no rational mature adult is going to give a child free reign with all of their inherited money until they come of age.

  Dumbledore still basically had Harry try and kill himself.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore didn't ask anything of Harry that he wouldn't do himself. He understood Harry, and he understood the terrible choice they needed to make, and he knew the choice he would make. Dumbledore was often saddened by the sheer amount of trust and admiration Harry had for him.

Dumbledore no longer believes in committing great acts of conquest and such 'For the Greater Good' and no longer trusts himself with power.
