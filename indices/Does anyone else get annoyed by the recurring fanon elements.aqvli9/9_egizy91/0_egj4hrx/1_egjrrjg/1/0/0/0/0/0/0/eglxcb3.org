  Not exactly comparable, I think. It's more of, "Hitler tries his best to kill him and has a hate-bonner for him. He also fought him off. Maybe he deserves to know something about our plans to protect him"

I'm okay when this happens. I'm deriding more extreme examples of telling the child everything.

  We have no proof of that.

Mm, It's might be more of an assumption I made. Is it not a little bit self-evident?

  And, bribing people to not do justice is not that impossible. Some people even do that without bribery
#+end_quote

Bribing corrupt people to bring other corrupt people to justice, particularly those that they might be in cahoots with, is a difficult thing indeed. Especially if you fear something happening to you if you did so.

  Hagrid advised. Harry to take only a small amount, so he wouldn't just spend it all immediatly. He did nothing more.
#+end_quote

Hagrid didn't lay down the law by any means, but I imagine he would have tried to stop Harry if Harry tried emptying his vault, not that Harry couldn't have found a way to manipulate Hagrid but...

Anyway, Hagrid's hardly a responsible and mature adult.
