  In canon, it's on a need to know basis. Harry needs to understand the danger he's in, but he isn't told about Sirius until he escapes, and isn't intentionally told what Sirius actually 'did', he's also kept from knowing what's going on in the Order of the Phoenix.

Okay, that is fair, I'll admit. Although Serius did tell him some stuff about the Order of the Phoenix meetings.

  Never is there an in-depth discussion of the political parties, or the inner workings of major institutions.
#+end_quote

Because Harry doesn't care for it. But we do know there are two factions, the Purebloods and everybody else. In second year, Lucius tried to frame Arthur with a dark artifact to prevent the muggle protection law from passing.

  This makes sense. This is realistic. Children, even famous children, are told only what adults think that they 'need to know', or at best what they think they'll understand as a rule. Some adults are different, but powerful adults especially don't want or need a child to know what's happening behind the scenes.
#+end_quote

I'd argue against that. You think Prince Harry wasn't told to be careful of being used as a child? Or any very famous child? Besides, even us common folk are at least told to not accept candy from strangers and not get into their van, which is very simple manipulation by child molestors.

  Overpoweredness can apply to social power also.

Your point being?

  He was told his parents were blown up by the Dursleys, the bank being broken into by a newspaper, and he wasn't told he burned him to death, he was told Voldemort left him to die
#+end_quote

Car crash is what Dursleys said. And Hagrid did tell Harry that Voldemort murdered his parents. As for the bank, it was supposed to be the safest place on earth bar Hogwarts. That is a pretty horific crime

  You know who else is not only also famous and rich, but has institutionalised political power to boot? The people who would oppose him in these things. Maybe not to the same extent, but Harry Potter is a 'naive child' while they are 'experienced philanthropists'.
#+end_quote

Political power doesn't matter much if the government is corrupt and can be bribed. And either way, even if he is naive but he has a good laywer or something like that, they can't oppose him much. He is the most famous person in all of Magical Britan that is still alive. And he has fuck ton of cash to back up his fame.

#+begin_quote
  He really should have had someone check up on him. Maybe he thought Figg was enough?
#+end_quote

Perhaps. I mean, he did admit that he knew what happened so I assume there has to be a good reason why he let that happen.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore didn't actually let Harry die, though it's unclear how certain he was about whether or not he was going to die. Would you not have done the same thing to vanquish Voldemort?
#+end_quote

But Harry did die. Temporarely, yes, but he did die. Either way, suppose he didn't, Dumbledore still basically had Harry try and kill himself.

Maybe, even if that isn't the point.
