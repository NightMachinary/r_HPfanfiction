In canon, it's on a need to know basis. Harry needs to understand the danger he's in, but he isn't told about Sirius until he escapes, and isn't intentionally told what Sirius actually 'did', he's also kept from knowing what's going on in the Order of the Phoenix.

Never is there an in-depth discussion of the political parties, or the inner workings of major institutions.

This makes sense. This is realistic. Children, even famous children, are told only what adults think that they 'need to know', or at best what they think they'll understand as a rule. Some adults are different, but powerful adults especially don't want or need a child to know what's happening behind the scenes.

This isn't just bad because it's unrealistic. Overpoweredness can apply to social power also.

  Like what? Because he knew that his parents were murdered, Goblin Bank was broken into, and he burned a man to death, all at the age of 11.

He was told his parents were blown up by the Dursleys, the bank being broken into by a newspaper, and he wasn't told he burned him to death, he was told Voldemort left him to die.

  He is increadibly famous and rich. These people can make anything happen.
#+end_quote

You know who else is not only also famous and rich, but has institutionalised political power to boot? The people who would oppose him in these things. Maybe not to the same extent, but Harry Potter is a 'naive child' while they are 'experienced philanthropists'.

  Yet, it doesn't change the fact that he let Harry be abused and later die for the Greater Good. He knew about Harry's treatment. It's canon
#+end_quote

He really should have had someone check up on him. Maybe he thought Figg was enough?

Dumbledore didn't actually let Harry die, though it's unclear how certain he was about whether or not he was going to die. Would you not have done the same thing to vanquish Voldemort?
