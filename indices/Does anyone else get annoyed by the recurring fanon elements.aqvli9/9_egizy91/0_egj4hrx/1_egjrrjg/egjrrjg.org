  quite another for adult after adult to lay the cold hard truths of politics,

Well many people will want to manipulate him due to his fame. He needs to be aware even if he doesn't like it.

  horrific crime

Like what? Because he knew that his parents were murdered, Goblin Bank was broken into, and he burned a man to death, all at the age of 11.

  Not only that, but Harry announces that he wants to make huge withdrawals, sue, have a duel, drop out of school, have Sirius Black set free, etc. and suddenly they're at his beck and call?

He is increadibly famous and rich. These people can make anything happen. Mega corporations using slaves, harming LEDC horribly, child labour, not paying taxes, stuff like that. And they don't get much punishment besides a slap on a wrist. Smosh was able to tell police to stop traffic because they wanted to film a scene in the middle of the road. Famous people don't get arrested for drugs. Media calling people Nazi's with no proof and encouraging mobs to hurt that person. I could go on. Famous people can make stuff happen. And Harry is famous.
