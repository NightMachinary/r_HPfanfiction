I don't mind one or two fanon things in fanfiction. The concepts of "wards" was never a canon element, but I like them, as long as they're explored well and not OP.

I only have a problem with (and drop stories) if they completely run on fanon, and there's nothing of the original HP style or universe left. By that point, the story has become a Self Insert Gamer fic, where Indie!Harry treats everyone else like NPC's while he collects a harem. That's not why I like Harry Potter. That's not what I want to see in Harry Potter fanfiction.

I made a [[https://i.imgur.com/2xMtG9x.jpg][*HP fanfic cliche bingo card*]] that lists all my least favorite fanon tropes just so I could tell when it was time to drop a fic. Note: These apply mostly to Indie!Harry fics, which are an incredibly popular subgenre on FFN and here.

Though I will insta-drop if I see "Mother Magick" or "So Mote it Be" anywhere in a fic. I can't stand that shit.
