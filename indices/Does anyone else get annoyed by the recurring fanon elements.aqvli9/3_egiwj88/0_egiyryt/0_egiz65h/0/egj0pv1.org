To be fair, the books suffer a lot from the "Harry is an unreliable narrator (as well as an idiot)" problem.

Magic is never explained in the books, like ever. We don't know how anything related to magic works because the books never tell us.

- We know that wand movements and pronunciation is important (until they aren't in the later books)
- We know enchanted items exist, but not how they are made because Harry never bothered to find out.
- We know some wizards can turn into animals but we never learn how being an animagus works because Harry couldn't be bothered with it.
- Potions is little more than following directions from a cookbook where a single counterclockwise stir instead of a clockwise one can destroy everything. Unless you are Snape, then just change the entire recipe without consequences. We also don't know how this works or why.

This works great when you are writing a mystery novel fairy tale where the magic is merely a backdrop setting, but in a more adult setting where you need some hard fantasy you need to either extrapolate on what we do know or borrow from other works.
