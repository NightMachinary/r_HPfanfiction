By "concept of wards", I meant the fanon use of the word itself, and all the extra details that are commonly associated with them. That's the use of ancient runes in casting wards, runestones, leylines, pagan rituals, spilling literal blood on a magical site to set the location, and tying them into charmed objects so that Dumbledore can look at the doodads on his desk and yell "The Blood Wards are falling!" when Harry leaves Number Four to go on indie adventures.

The book version of wards calls them "enchantments" or "defenses" and has nowhere near as much detail as fanon has.
