If it's a parody, it's a very paint-by-numbers parody. Chapter One is like a checklist of bingo card tropes. If someone is doing this ironically... Well, I find it hard to imagine anyone would want to torture themselves that much for a laugh.

  He couldn't believe this. He couldn't believe he'd been lied to his whole life, by the man he thought he could trust. How dare he? How dare he lie to his parents too, and effectively get them murdered? All for his own selfish need for power. How could he? Harry was fuming as he stomped down the hallways of Hogwarts, unaware he was muttering aloud.

  He had suspected the lying since his 2nd year, though always dismissing it as paranoia, but now he had be told by them man himself, Dumble-fuck had confirmed his worries and still asked him “Can you still trust me?” in his most grandfatherly, and sickeningly "kind" voice.

  Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were in on the whole thing, he was sure, as he overheard Fred and George discussing the fact that none of their friends had gotten the trademark Weasley sweater for Christmas and how their dad was happy that Dumbledore and managed to get to Harry's vault and finally pay them back for the' hard work'. Ron was more interested in the fame associated with him then he himself, which hadn't been true (or noticed) until the Triwizard Tournament had occurred and he showed his true colours of jealousy and greed.
