This is fascinating. It starts out as a cracky fic about the insanity that is life at Hogwarts (and the author has a real flair for inventing odd situations that would only happen in the magical world) but the latest chapters have been hinting at either a sinister mystery or Tom having a mental breakdown and it's still not clear which it is.
