The only ones I remember for this are Novacaine, which has him basically using his money to become a Rockefeller type and rebuild the Wizarding World post-War; that one with the secret society in the Sun Chamber I can't remember the name of; Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, which has him time-travelling and becoming an enigmatic Lord and investing money and home-ownership and such (still have no idea if I actually like this fic or not); Charon/Passageways which both have him adopting himself into an older House with estates and serfs and a village to look after; and that's about it.

I don't know if we can link to Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, what with the grooming paedophilia and all, but it's easy to find and the rest are below. They're interesting enough, but there's nothing utterly spectacular I'd rave about to recommend to you. Hopefully others know more examples than I do.
