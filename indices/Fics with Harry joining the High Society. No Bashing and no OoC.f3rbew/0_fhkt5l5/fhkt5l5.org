Harry is actively working on empowering his own name and his status as the Boy-Who-Lived. Not only by showing strength and skill, that he is a promising youngster and a leader of his generation - but by also making alliances with strong families with marriage contracts.\\
He realizes that he needs more than just magical power to realistically beat Voldy, so he starts learning about traditions, customs, how to behave in front of important people. How to use his name... etc.

PS: The first task in this story is truly epic!
