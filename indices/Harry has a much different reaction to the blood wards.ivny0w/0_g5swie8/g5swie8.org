Harry just looked at his Headmaster as if he was seeing him for the first time.

"So, the reason I had to go back /there/, was because of these protections, that extended to /them/ too?"

Dumbledore felt that maybe talking to him about this just as he returned from the Ministry may not have been the best idea.

"Yes, you see Harry, the wards, or enchantments, are based on your mother's protections, they use the blood you share with your aunt, and the fact you consider her house your home to charge them during summer."

There was the sound of glass breaking.

Harry's hands were trembling.

"Sir," Harry gulped, "do they work outside the house?"

Dumbledore frowned at the question, "I am afraid they are limited to the property."

A small device made of glass and metal exploded on one of the shelves.

"So...if one of /the Death Eaters/ tried to get me at the market, or at school, it wouldn't do anything."

Dumbledore breathed, "Then you would only have the original protection your mother left you, the one that protected you during your first year."

Harry was now gritting his teeth, and his eyes were full of such hatred Dumbledore was taken aback.

"The same one he neutralized by taking my blood in the Third Task. The same one that didn't work against others in all the other times I was attacked, including today."

With a sigh, Dumbledore nodded, "An unfortunate side effec-"

"I am not going back there, I am moving to Grimmauld Place, or another place, I can pay someone to make a Fidelius, I am /not/ going back there."

Dumbledore looked at Harry with a pitying look, "Harry, I know you and your relatives don't have a good rela-"

"DON'T HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP?" Dumbledore flinched as Harry hit the table with both fists, rattling it, and at the same time, several objects exploded, or broke in his office.

"A GOOD RELATIONSHIP? THEY. ARE. NOT. MY. FAMILY. I HATE THEM! THEY HATE ME! THEY /NEVER/ WERE MY FAMILY!"

Harry took a deep breath and sat down, taking deep breaths.

"I honestly don't give a fuck to what you think, /sir,/ Petunia is not my aunt, and that's not my home, it never was, I deny any association with her, she's not my family, she's my jailer, they all are, that's how I see them, that place is not my home, it's my prison and I am not going back there."

Harry barely noticed two devices in one of the shelves that went dark, but Dumbledore did.

"Harry, please, the protections."

"I go to the marked you know."

Dumbledore stopped at the non sequitur.

"To the market, to the park, I used to go to a school near there, and I used to see many people that I now know are wizards, recognize, me, some were passing through the same street."

Harry raised his head, and his watery, furious, and regretful eyes bore at the Dumbledore, his voice quieter, but still carrying.

"They could've gotten me at any of those places, couldn't they? If they really wanted to get me, especially after I came to Hogwarts."

Dumbledore deflated.

"One of them could've asked Snape for the address and he would've had to give it. To keep his /cover/."

Harry shook his head, and spoke with a smaller voice.

"But they never did, did they? They never really tried to know where I was, and before the Fourth Year, they never tried to."

He gave a short, rueful chuckle that almost made Dumbledore grimace.

"The only people who would hurt me there were the Dursleys, the only ones I know wanted to do it, were them," another bitter laugh, and Harry rose from the chair.

"I know Sirius gave me Grimmauld Place, and his family's money."

Dumbledore sighed, removed his glasses, and pinched the bridge of his nose while he nodded.

"I am going to live there now, and maybe go and visit the Weasleys later, but Grimmauld Place is where I will live. You can keep having the meetings there, but there will be rules, and even Snape can come, but if he speaks one bad word against Sirius or my Father, he's out. If I had to go back to Privet Drive for five years and /tolerate/ /them/, he can keep his mouth shut in a meeting."

Harry breathed, calming himself a bit, before looking at Dumbledore.

"Good Evening, Professor, thanks for the tea."
