*Harry's choice*

â€‹

'So, you're saying my blood protects them,' Harry said, thinking. He was thinking of Dudley, who got attacked by a Dementor, Dudley whom he had saved, and his Uncle, willing to throw Harry out for that. He remembered the complains how much he cost them, and fought to restrain a grin. 'And they know?'\\
'Yes.'\\
Well, that sealed the deal. 'The bond does not stop?'\\
'Not until you're 17, no.'

'I heard you need me to protect your family against a newly-risen dark lord,' he told Vernon later. 'So, I provide you a valuable service. Dudley took a lot of money from me in the previous years.' He grinned. 'I want it back. I want to be paid for the privelege of my protection. You won't last /seconds/ without me.'
