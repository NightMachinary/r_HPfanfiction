Frankly, I agree he did what was easy, instead of what was right. Malfoy was a cornered animal who showed regret, not remorse. He would have killed that year if it wasn't for Harry. I agree he should have been imprisoned. Dumbledore went with what was right, not what was easy. And the Dursley's were a choice that could have been worked around. Or letting Sirius go to jail without a trial. Or leaving a hateful man in a school of children. Not that fics which work around this do much better. McGonagall was an incompetent deputy in the school. The most flattering interpretation of Dumbledore by his actions is a good man trying to do too much and failing at most of it. The pairings in the epilogue don't bother me. Malfoy being free only bothers me slightly (Provided he paid his debt to society, but his father being free is unexcusable). Ron confunding a driving instructor bothers me quite a bit. But it's the fact Harry names his son after an abuser and an enabler. Snape frankly never was good. His motivations were to a dead woman who he was obsessed with.
