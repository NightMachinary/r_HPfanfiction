Killing in a civil war, at least on the non-genocidal side, is perfectly fine by me. You are defending your life and should not endanger yourself to save those who want to kill you. To quote Patton, the objective of a war is not to die for one's county but to make the other guy die for his. And if your agenda is enforcing racial segregation by means of concentration camps and death Squads, then you deserve no mercy.

And the one area where Dumbledore clearly fails to do the right thing is Malfoy. Dumbledore is sprouting some BS about saving Malfoy when he, at that point, had already committed enough war crimes to warrant an execution for it, even by Allied standards. And then he does it again with the second attempt at Dumbledore, and yet there is no action.

Dumbledore's willingness to gamble with everyone's lives for one who had repeatedly violated one of their most sacred laws (ban on unforgivables) and carried out several murder attempts is unforgivable. It's one of two character defining moments for Dumbledore IMO (with the other being "ten dark years").
