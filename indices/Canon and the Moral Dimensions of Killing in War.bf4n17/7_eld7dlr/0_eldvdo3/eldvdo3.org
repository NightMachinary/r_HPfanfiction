I'm German and I completely disagree with you. There is a time for capture and fair trial. But staging a magical fascist coup and running concentration camps as well as death squads is long past that line.

As my county's history proves quite well, the best way to stomp out such an ideology is by having it totally annihilated on the battlefield. A lot of people at that time argued that the First World War wasn't really lost for Germany since little to none territory was occupied in 1918 and we had soundly smashed Russia. Kinda difficult to argue the same when ten million Soviets with tens of thousands of tanks and artillery pieces flooded across your border while your towns have been reduced to ruins and all atrocities of the Nazis have been exposed.

And that kind of resolution is missing from the HP canon, but that is a different debate.
