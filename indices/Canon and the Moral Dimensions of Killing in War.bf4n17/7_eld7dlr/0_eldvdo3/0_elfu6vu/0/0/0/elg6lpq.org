His attack on Katie via Rosmerta was in violation of the Hague convention, especially article 23, subsection a,b and f. It was also an attack on civilians, which is in violation of the Geneva convention. Add to that treason (for being a Death Eater and actively helping them), attempted murder, using unforgivables and all the minor stuff, and it is surprising that he was not executed on the spot, nevermind being welcomed back into society.
