I really don't think Hague convention applies, this was either normal criminal activity or even civil war, so he should be just guilty according to normal criminal law.

And yes, you are right, I forgot attempts on Katie and the poisoning of Ron. But still, I think these are two attempted murders under the British wizarding criminal law. I don't attempted murder on Dumbledore won't stick either, he actually didn't do the deed, which (at least according to Czech and I believe all European civil law countries criminal law) makes it just preparation of crime, which is not crime in itself (of course, other crimes committed in the course of preparation of this one are punishable, e.g., that breach of Hogwarts' defences and assisting Death Eaters in murder). So, yes total of three attempted murders (committed or assisted), that should give him quite a time in Azkaban, you are right. However, he was a minor under duress, so the penalty should be somehow lesser, and (if the wizarding world had anything like that) in the juvenile correctional facility.
