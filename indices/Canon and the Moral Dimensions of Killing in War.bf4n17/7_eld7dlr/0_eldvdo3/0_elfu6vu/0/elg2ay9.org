Which law enforcement. Before the Ministry fell, it was doing PR stunts rather than actual law enforcement and afterwards, they were the ones running the Genocide. And calling a vigilante group law enforcement stretches that term a lot. Not that the Order did anything other than running a radio show, but that is a different debate.

Draco Malfoy was out of prison long enough to father a child in the same age as the trio's. Therefore, he was not in prison long enough. That we know. Also, he does not seem to be shunned for his war crimes, so there is little evidence to support a successful de-deatheaterisation.
