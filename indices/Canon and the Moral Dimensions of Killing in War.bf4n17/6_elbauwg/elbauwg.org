One of the problem good guy have in Harry Potter is that they can't really know if the guy they are fighting is truly a bad guy or not.

Of course there are some obvious Death Eater (like Dolohov, Lestrange or Malfoy) but there are also a lot of "innocent" forced into the war either by fear or by the Imperius curse.\\
For example, in DH Lupin is angry that Harry used "Experliarmus" because it's what gave him away, and say to Harry that this is war and he should be ready to hurt, or at the very least stun. But he used this spell on Stan Shunpike, a completely innocent guy that was just there because he tried to seduce a girl by making things up and a politician threw him in jail to look like he was making progress. Then Death Eater took him out but put inside their controle. Would it be just to kill or hurt a guy like this?\\
There are other case like Pius Thickness, a puppet minister under the controle of Malfoy, he fought with the Death Eater during the Battle of Hogwarts.

In the end I think that unless if it's the only way for you and your friend to survive, the good guy should not kill if only by fear to kill innocents. The "confirmed" target are limited to the Inner Circle, and even in this case it would be best to not kill because :\\
- Inner Circle member have a lot of informations that could be usefull\\
- All of them are big racists but some of them may just be there because if you don't follow Voldemort like a dog, you end up like Karkaroff (still asshole who joined freely 20 years ago, but hesitation is acceptable in this case)\\
- Some may be spies (like Snape)

Not to mention that the average wizard don't have the same informations than reader about the Inner Circle. We knew who they are because Harry was there for their first meeting after Voldemort resurection, and he did gave an interview but can wizards follow blindly the words of a 15 years old kid? (Not to mention the average Wizard put Sirius Black in the 2nd place of people they need to kill so . . .)
