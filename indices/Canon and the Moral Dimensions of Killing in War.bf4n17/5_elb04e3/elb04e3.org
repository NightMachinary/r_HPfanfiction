This is actually Sirius, which I bring up only to say it's another interesting way canon treats the subject. He is arguably the person aligned with the "light side," other than Moody himself, who seems most okay with killing (if his treatment of Peter, and even Snape, is any indication). But he praises Moody for sparing Death Eater lives. Rowling certainly tries to draw a moral line in the sand with killing and makes sure to fit all of her good characters on one side.

It's hard with fan fiction when you attempt to treat the subject in a more adult way. It doesn't always make sense or fit the characterization consistently.
