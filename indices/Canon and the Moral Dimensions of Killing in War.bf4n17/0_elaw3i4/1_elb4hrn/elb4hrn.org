With respect to not killing Dolohov and Rowle in that cafe, the Trio had good reasons to do so. Besides wanting to cover their tracks, Weasleys were basically Voldemort's hostages at this time. Killing these two might prompt Voldemort to kill the Weasleys in retaliation, and that was something they couldn't afford.

But later, Dolohov went on to murder Remus at Battle of Hogwarts, and was the primary culprit in turning Teddy into an orphan. These two Death Eaters should also have tortured and murdered countless Muggleborns and Muggles.

I would really like to see a scene in which Harry felt guilty about his misplaced mercy and resorted to do things differently in the future.
