I suspect that JKR didn't want his teenage protagonists having to kill in a children/YA series.

On the other hand, she's mightily proud of Molly killing Bellatrix and has made clear this point in multiple interviews.

She wanted to write a fairytale in which innocence and passive sacrifice trump the evil. Fine for me in a children's series, but NOT something I want to read in fanfics for mature audiences.
