I feel like part of the reason he fears dumbledore stems from his childhood though. Dumbledore best grindelwald and is seen as a god, he showed him in the orphanage that he has more power so he is to be listened to, and most of all he didn't know for sure the horcruxs would work. He couldn't test to make sure he did it right or anything.
