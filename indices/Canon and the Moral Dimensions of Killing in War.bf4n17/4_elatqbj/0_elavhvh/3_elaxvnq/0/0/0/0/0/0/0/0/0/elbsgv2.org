Look at it this way, Voldemort's failure to understand love meant he sorely underestimated the lengths people would go for it. Because he didn't understand it, he didn't realise that Snape was playing him nor that the Narcissa would lie.

Lily's sacrifice was voluntary, and against Voldemort's expections of what someone should do because he doesn't understand loving someone so much you are willing to die for them.
