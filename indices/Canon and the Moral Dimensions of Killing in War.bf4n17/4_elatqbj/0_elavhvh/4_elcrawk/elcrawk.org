I think part of it was that Voldemort was just below Dumbledore in terms of power and skill- Dumbledore was the only man he ever feared he couldn't beat, after all. I suspect most characters were genre savvy enough to recognize that imprisoning and torturing someone that powerful would just lead to them eventually breaking out and being even more unstable and unpredictable than before
