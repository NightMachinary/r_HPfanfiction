It's Voldemort. He takes on three of the most powerful people in the Wizarding world (McGonagall, Kingsley, Slughorn) post-Dumbledore's death and still swipes them away like flies.

In the Fantastic Beast films Grindelwald takes on a group of Aurors with similar ease and is only taken down by a beast (and not taken at all in the second film). Voldemort is meant to be even more impressive.

So essentially Voldemort is practically speaking undefeatable-even without the horcruxes, that's why everyone fears him so. They don't even know about the Horcruxes in fact.
