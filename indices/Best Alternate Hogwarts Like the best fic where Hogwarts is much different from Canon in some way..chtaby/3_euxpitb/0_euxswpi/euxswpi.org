I've tried reading this /so many/ times and I just can't get past the first handful of chapters. Something about it just doesn't do it for me. I don't know if it's the constant references to the "Year of Exploration" or Hermione being a weird slave girl in public or what but it's just dull. Which sucks because I love most of Starfox's other stuff and I keep meaning to give it another go but i'm at like 5 readings now and the bit that I don't like I just get stupidly bored at and give up so it's a bit of a cycle of abuse at this point where it's not as bad as I think it is but i've read it so many times I can remember it all really well so it's not fun.
