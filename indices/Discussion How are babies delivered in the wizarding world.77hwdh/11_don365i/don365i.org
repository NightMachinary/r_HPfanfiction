Apparation. It's a different technique to side-along someone, so when the baby is ready to be born you just stand in the birthing pool and apparate. If the baby is really ready, they'll be left behind, if they're not, then you can just try again later.

The same principles hold true for portkeys and floo -- once the baby is it's own person, then the mother traveling leaves it behind (this lead to the inventor of the floo powder being lynched in Diagon Ally after an expectant mother accidentally burned her baby alive instead of going to the store). This is why midwives are so popular, it's dangerous for expectant mothers (or, rather, for the unborn children) to travel magically during the last month of pregnancy.
