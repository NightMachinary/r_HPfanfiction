Pottermore does mention a "midwife" overseeing the birth of Neville, so probably it does happen pretty much the Muggle way... or at least close enough that they have a job title that's exactly the same as with the Muggles. :)

Most of the ideas you present here sound... kind of messy and dangerous; even more so than an actual birth. Now, I'm sure magic is used to make things easier, like magical painkillers or what have you, but I'm pretty sure the actual birth is pretty much the same.
