Of course via Vaginal Portkeysâ„¢.

When labor begins a trained mediwitch simply enchants a wristband, levitates it into the woman, and a portkey activates, porting the baby right out.

This avoids any complication and pain, and is the preferred method, since it reduces the amount of accidential magic a baby can do during the stressful birth, which otherwise might be painful for the mother.

In fact, the mortality rate for witches and women of muggleborn children during childbirth was much higher than for normal, muggle, birthings -- which is why it was often said that witches kill their mothers, worsening the witch-hunts.

And the converse sadly was also misinterpreted: If your mother died during your childbirth it was very easy to be accused as a witch, leading to more innocent deaths.

In modern times the ministry informs muggle doctors to advise a c-section if they are lucky enough to detect a magical child in the womb, or will covertly help during childbirth otherwise.

The doctors are of course memory-charmed afterwards, but usually voluntarily consent to that.

Edit:

When Merope was pregnant, she never told the ministry out of ignorance, and they didn't detect Tom Riddle being magical because she was magical as well.

Some education probably would have saved Merope Gaunt, and might have changed Voldemort.
