The magical midwives reading this thread are shaking their heads.

"No mention of pointing the legs towards the current celestial House. Nothing about the incense and inscriptions to keep away changelings and such. No consideration of what en-spelling an unnamed child could have on its magical development."

"No discussion of Divination or Astronomy at all!"

"If this is what they're teaching at Hogwarts, it's no wonder we're seeing fewer magical children born in each generation."

"When was the last time you were consulted on the right day during the first trimester?"

"Molly Weasley; it's like they all think she was an idiot and had all those strong children by happenstance."
