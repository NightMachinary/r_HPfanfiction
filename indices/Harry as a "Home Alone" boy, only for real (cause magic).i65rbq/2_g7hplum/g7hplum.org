This sounds really fun. I imagine that Harry would have to learn a lot of grown-up stuff quickly, like paying bills, signing his own school reports, and eventually property taxes. He wouldn't know the Dursleys' pin numbers, but with a lot of practice he could figure out how to forge their signatures on letters and checks in order to do many things by mail, and copy the examples from their files. If he figured out how to make illusions or mess with people's minds, that would solve a lot of his problems. Then there is the problem of the nosy neighbors, particularly friends like the Polkisses and Mrs. Figg with her spy cats. Harry could make up an illness for one or more of the Dursleys to explain their sudden reclusivity. To make the story interesting, he would have multiple close calls. He should also definitely figure out how to do a few wandless spells, like Lily and Tom Riddle did.
