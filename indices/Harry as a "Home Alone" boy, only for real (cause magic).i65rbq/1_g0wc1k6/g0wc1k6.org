I love this idea, maybe Harry mistakes Hagrid when he shows up with his hogwarts letter as the burglars and he tries to protect the house in the 3 seconds before Hagrid can break down the door with limited success. Then once he learns the truth he's like oops my bad maybe I overreacted a little mr Hagrid... I'm sure your beard will grow back in no time
