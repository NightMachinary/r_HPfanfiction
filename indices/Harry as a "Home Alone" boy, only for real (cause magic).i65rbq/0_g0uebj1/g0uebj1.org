It would be funny also if said homeless person was one of the order, either Lupin or my personal favourite for this role: Mundungas Fletcher.

You can imagine him getting pulled in for what is effectively a job consisting of living in a nice house (given that Harry is mostly self sufficient by this point) with food and stuff paid for. Then he sortof warms up to Harry and...
