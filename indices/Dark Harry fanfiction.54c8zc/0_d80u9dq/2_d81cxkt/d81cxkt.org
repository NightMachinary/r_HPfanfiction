Damn it, I've been spamming *Emperor* recommendations during the last 6 months. I need to cut back.

Ok, I have a new favorite 'dark Harry' fic called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw][Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw]], linkffn(11574569). On surface, I should hate it because it contains quite a few tropes:

Wrong Boy-Who-Lived, bad James and Lily

Evil Dumbledore

Lords and Ladies, Most Ancient and Noble Houses

Harem

Betrothal Contracts

Over mature 10 years old

Daphne Greengrass as the Ice Princess of Slytherin

(Almost) pureblood Hermione

Super Luna

Magic Core

Quantifiable Magic

Incredible Magical Trunks

--------------

But that story is such a fun to read!

That Harry is definitely dark and he's dragging his harem along for the ride. The latest two chapters are called 'Necromancy for Fun and Fun, Part 1 and 2'.
