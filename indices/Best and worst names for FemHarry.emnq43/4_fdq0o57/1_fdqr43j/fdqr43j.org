Harriet is really good from a meta perspective - it communicates very clearly to the reader that it's a female version of Harry. I think in-universe, it might be more believable for the flower names (since it's shared by Lily and Petunia)... but that's not always /better/.

Personally I like Harriet, just because it sounds closest to Harry.
