My comment from the last fem!harry name discussion:

Henriette (diminutive: Hettie) is a name I would rather see used than Harriet. Please don't nickname her Harry.

Following the convention of James and Harry being royal names, other examples: Victoria Elizabeth Alexandra Charlotte Louise Mary Anne
