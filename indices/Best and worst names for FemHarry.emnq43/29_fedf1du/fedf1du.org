I prefer it when the name still sounds like Harry. Harriet is the best since most of the time she is just adressed as Harry and it still makes sense why people would give her that nickname. Holly is okay too. I personally like Hailey. Harley wouldn't be bad but it just reminds me of Harley Quinn.

I'm not a big fan of names that don't sound like Harry at all because then it mostly feels like an OC and not like fem Harry. When I read Iris Potter I don't think of fem Harry but of Harrys OC sister.

Honestly, if there is a fem Harry fic with a name that doesn't start with an H most of the time I won't even bother to read it.

Worst I've seen is Neveah Hope Potter. I noped out of that fic as soon as I saw that name.
