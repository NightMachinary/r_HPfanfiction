Huh, apparently more people like Iris than I thought.

I'm partial to Iris and Holly. Jasmine and Violet are okay too. Don't really like Rose as a name in general, but I guess it still fits.

Utterly dislike Harriet and any variants of Harry. Can't really picture a girl when that happens, and to me it's a sign that the author isn't putting much thought into the genderbend concept.
