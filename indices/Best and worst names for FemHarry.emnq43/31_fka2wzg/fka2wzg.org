The best ones? Belladonna, Holly, and plain Harry. Belladonna was an iffy one at first but I got used to it when the characterization got real good.

The worst... probably the more nonsensical/out there versions. Like the ones that I can't possibly pair with "Harry"- the examples op gave above seemed like ones that I would absolutely abhor to read over and over again in a fic. It just feels too fanciful to be "just Harry", you know?
