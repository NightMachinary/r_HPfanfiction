If you don't consider your sexuality (no matter in which of the XYZ directions you lean) as a part of your identity and an integral part of your personality... Then you are pretty damm weird. But let me break it down for you.

A fem Harry would have probably been treated at least a little different by the Dursley, the perceived vulnerability of a female would probably have invited either some sympathy or even worse abuse

A female is viewed differently from the outside, the treatment of your surroundings affect how you develop so we can at least elucubrate that a fem Harry will have a different social behavior due to this

A fem Harry would have a totally different set of hormones influencing her growth, which leads to different strengths, weaknesses, and behaviors

A female Harry would have shared a dorm with the girl's side of Griffindor (If she goes to Gryffindor at all) and they would have been a different influence compared to the boys

These are just some of the points, you could make an entire book about the reasons as to why a fem!Harry SHOULD always be an OC but I think I made my point
