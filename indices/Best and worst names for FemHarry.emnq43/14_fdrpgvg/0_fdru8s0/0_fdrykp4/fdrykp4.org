I don't see gender as a thing that defines a person. A what-if where Harry is blond wouldn't make him an OC. A what-if where Harry was raised differently also doesn't necessarily makes him into OC. I can easily imagine fem!Harry having the same experience with the Dursleys and doing the same things as canon Harry. The name and core personality should stay the same, what interests me in this AU is how everyone else would react to her and what additional obstacles her being a woman could bring.
