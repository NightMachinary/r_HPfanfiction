I really don't get all the Harry/Harriett hate here? I'd much rather read a fem!Harry called Harry than anything else. I wouldn't mind Holly, Lily or Rose either I guess but anything else along those lines seems too unusual to fit with the themes of canon. It feels sort of like when people arbitrarily change Harry's name to Hadrian or Harold.
