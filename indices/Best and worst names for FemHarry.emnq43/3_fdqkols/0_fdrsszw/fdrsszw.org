The problem with the name "Harry" is that it is not very dignified/aristocratic, so it just doesn't fit with the theme of a lot of fics out there, as long as the fic itself is not crap, I actually welcome the change. As far as Harriet goes, I just hate the sound, said Harriet out loud and tell me that sounds like a nice girl name, it just doesn't and while I know that some women are called Harry, either as a name or nickname, it just isn't feminine at all
