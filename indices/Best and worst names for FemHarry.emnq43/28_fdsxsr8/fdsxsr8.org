I used Rose for my Slytherin Fem!Harry in Keystone Council, but Marigold for the gryffindor twin sister of a deceased Harry. It was a way to emphasize that they were very different characters (as opposed to the three Harrys also in the story). Even in different houses and with different personalities, the names set them apart.
