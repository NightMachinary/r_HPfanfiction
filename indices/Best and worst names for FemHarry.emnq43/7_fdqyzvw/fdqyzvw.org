I'm surprised at how unpopular Harriet is! It's not a name I like on its own, but it's one of my faves to read. It makes sense to me as the feminine version of "Harry," and it means the author can continue to use "Harry" as a nickname throughout the fic, which helps a lot with confusion.

I always get lost reading updates to a half-remembered fic if the name is something ridiculous---is "Rose" meant to be fem!Harry or Rose Weasley? Or some OC?

I also (personally) feel like a lot of flower names veer sharply into Mary Sue territory. To me, a solid name like Harriet means the author isn't getting distracted by how shiny and beautiful her fem!Harry is and is more interested in the plot.
