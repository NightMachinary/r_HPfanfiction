On your quick question, I'd suggest you do a search for similar stories to see how you're comparing to them.

Like

- Language = English\\
- Words < 5000\\
- With primary characters as you've tagged it\\
- Rating = All
- Sort by Publish date

This last one should help in that you'll see the newest stories and be able to compare interest for readers using particular search parameters. The difference would be to check whether more successful stories are being posted by authors with other stories under their belt already. That way you won't feel bad since they've got a pre-existing audience boosting their numbers.
