I always liked the theory that magic evolved just like other things. In the beginning there was rudimentary magic (stuff that people do that Dumbledore calls magic but we can also do it such as music, art or words). Initially it was charm... women would seduce men for protection, while men would use charisma to gather people together in groups to hunt. Then there were curses which were ill-wishes upon people that offended you and words that made other people uncomfortable. Over time some people's will would become so strong that they could influence nature through such acts. They would dance to bring about rain, or they'd make drawings or recite incantations to protect the loved ones and to punish the enemies. Gradually this affinity evolved into magic. Muggles and wizards have a common ancestor but the purebloods had so many generations of wizards before them that they thing of themselves as purebloods, while a muggleborn may pop up in a non-magical family after hundreds of generations.
