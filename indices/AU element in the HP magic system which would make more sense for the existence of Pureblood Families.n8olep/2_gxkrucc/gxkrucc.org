The Rigel Black Chronicles (starting with linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense)) has a slightly different take, although gifts like Parseltongue and Metamorphmagery do run in pureblood families and don't tend to just appear in first-generation mages. The key difference, though, between old and new magic is wildness. The more generations pass, the more magic becomes tamed and easily controlled, whereas a muggle-born witch or wizard with large magical reserves will find them acting up in response to any strong emotion.

So, in the present day, under Tom Riddle's influence, non-purebloods have been banned from Hogwarts on the grounds that they are dangerous to pureblood children and not able to control their magic well enough to keep up with the curriculum properly. Harry sneaks herself in, but does actually experience some of the challenges associated with her mother's wild magic; she learns spells really quickly by just asking her magic to cooperate, but if she's not careful to keep a lid on her emotions, it may do things she didn't intend (like casting a very dangerous shield charm that dissolves anything it touches).

There's a further possible reason for prejudice, in the fact that young babies are able to sense magical auras around them, and instinctively associate them with the presence of their mothers - causing them to shy away from people who don't feel like magic, and thus feeding into an instinctive aversion and isolation as they grow older, even after they've forgotten the reason.
