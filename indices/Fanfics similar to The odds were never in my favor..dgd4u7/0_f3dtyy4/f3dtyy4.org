A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh features a deep dive into history, and is far removed from the prophecy/Voldemort storyline. Unlike The Odds Were Never In My Favor, Long Journey Home is beautifully written with good dialogue. linkffn(9860311).

Murkeybluematter's Pureblood Pretense and its sequels also twist the storyline quite a bit, and feature a Slytherin Harry. linkffn(7613196). Also features really strong writing.

Flamethrower's Of a Linear Circle series features unique history elements and also a not light Harry: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028]]
