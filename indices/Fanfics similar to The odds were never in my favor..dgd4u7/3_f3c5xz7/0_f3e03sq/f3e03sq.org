So its not centered around the Boy-Who-Lived storyline, but around ancient lore, like powers of darkness (like chaos, death etc) and powers of light (Michael, Horus etc) that each have Champions in form of wizards. Basically a part of a bigger plot based on mythology. I dont really know how to say what I like about it. It is just that the storyline is combined in such a way that I love it. If you have time then read it for sure.
