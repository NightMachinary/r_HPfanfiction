I really liked MC/Potter-hero(-ine) universally perceived as a villain. That setup is almost absolutely perfect, later it seems to be moving suspiciously into super!Hero and daemonic!overlords territory which I really don't like, but the first two years were absolutely perfect. I guess the third year will be saving her Daddy from Azkaban, but I am afraid it won't be as good as I hoped for.
