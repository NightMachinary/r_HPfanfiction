There's a whole lot of reaching you have to do to get to that point:

- Where does is say the equal opportunities act doesn't apply? One, it was enacted in 2010, nearly 20 years AFTER Harry went to Hogwarts. And two, you could argue it only applies to humans.

- Muggle laws not applying because ONE law isn't represented in the Ministry is a fallacy.

- With student attending Hogwarts year round with trips home only authorised during the holidays, it is right to assume that parents would expect Hogwarts professors to act in loco parentis. As for seven years of their childrens lives, they will be having more interaction with them than their actual parents. Additionally, you can extrapolate from McGonagall's mentioning of Houses being like family that this is the case.

- We have nothing that suggest the wizarding world as a whole doesn't believe a child can be abused. No one knows if Neville being thrown out of a window was reported to the Auror's and Harry's circumstances were exasperated by the fact that Dumbledore wanted Harry to stay at the Dursley's despite knowing what they were like.

Don't state headcanon as fact.
