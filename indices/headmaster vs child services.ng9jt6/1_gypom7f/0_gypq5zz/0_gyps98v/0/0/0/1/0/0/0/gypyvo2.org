As the equal opportunities laws does not apply in the Wizarding World we can infer that muggle laws do not apply. Therefore it would fail to the Ministry of Magic to write such laws. And therefore would the Wizard think that teachers are acting in loco parentis ? I don't think so because it isn't in their culture that a child could be abused.
