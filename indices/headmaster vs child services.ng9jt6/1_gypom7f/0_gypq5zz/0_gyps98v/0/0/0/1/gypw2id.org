That's not how ethics works, you idiot. But it is further compounded by the fact that Dumbledore was aware that Harry's life with the Dursley's was poor and he apologised for leaving him there. So, under normal circumstances, Dumbledore should have been expected to look into the situation.

Yes, Dumbledore is an unknown. But he is also his HEADMASTER and has given him no reason to distrust him. It's not like he hadn't seen or spoken to him at previous points in the year; Harry should have gotten detention (for being out past curfew) when Dumbledore caught him at the Mirror of Erised, but Dumbledore just gently explained the dangers of the mirror and urged him along. That's more than enough to give Harry the idea that he is both trustworthy and willing to help him.

You're not winning this. Harry was in the right to ask Dumbledore for help as he had no reason to believe he was:

A) Unwilling to help.

B) Completely unable to help.

and,

C) Not knowledgeable on the subject.
