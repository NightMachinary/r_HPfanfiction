All teachers have this moral obligation:

"The term in loco parentis, Latin for "in the place of a parent"[1] refers to the legal responsibility of a person or organization to take on some of the functions and responsibilities of a parent. Originally derived from English common law, it is applied in two separate areas of the law. First, it allows institutions such as colleges and schools to act in the best interests of the students as they see fit, although not allowing what would be considered violations of the students' civil liberties.[1] Second, this doctrine can provide a non-biological parent to be given the legal rights and responsibilities of a biological parent if they have held themselves out as the parent.[2]" [[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_loco_parentis]]]

The Ministry of Magic writes laws relating to magic, we have nothing in canon that suggests other British laws (such as against theft and murder) do not apply just because there are wands involved. Thus this^ principle still applies.

Meaning even his headmaster is responsible for this. In loco parentis means Harry should have been able to go to ANY Professor (even Snape) and expected them to do something.
