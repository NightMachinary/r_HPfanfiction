I'm sorry, are you seriously suggesting that Harry should have gone to Draco Malfoy's parents for help? Harry didn't get along with Draco from the first time they met at the robe shop, where his parents weren't present. He didn't “meet” Draco's parents until his second year - when Mr. Malfoy proceeded to: brawl with Mr. Weasley in the bookshop, was present when Hagrid was arrested and taken to Azkaban, and when Harry realized that he was the one who gave Ginny the diary. None of these actions scream “this is a trustworthy adult who I should ask to help me get out of abusive home.”
