Fucking WHO?!

The only parents of people in his school that he is om speaking terms with are Molly and Arthur, and she doesn't exactly react with horror when the boys tell her about the bars on his window. And he didn't really know them like that until long after he asked to stay at Hogwarts.

Harry is a private person, has few friends and doesn't even tell them about the full extent of what was going on at the Dursley's. Harry's hasn't even met Hermione's parents on page or screen, it is not on Harry to flag down a completely unknown adult and ask how child protective services works in the Magical world.

Again, Harry was correct to reach out to Dumbledore. It was up to him (if the laws and people for child protection exist in the Magical world) to either look into what was happening to his student or have the correct authorities look into it. And if there aren't child protective services, from an ethical standpoint (both as his teacher AND as the person who left him there in the first place) Dumbledore was the one to step up and find out why Harry was so adamant not go home.
