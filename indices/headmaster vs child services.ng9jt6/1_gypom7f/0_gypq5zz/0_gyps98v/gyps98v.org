Harry was eleven.

Like it or not, he wasn't some cynical super genius, he was an eleven year old boy who didn't even know he was able to leave the Dursley's. Hence why he asked and then begrudgingly accepted Dumbledore telling him to go back to them. No kid has any real grasp on how these things work at that age unless they've already been exposed to the system.

Harry's perspective on the situation isn't just lack of knowledge (which I highlighted in the other comment). He's young and has no idea how anything works in the Muggle OR Magical world. Why would he even think to go scouring through legal books that the Hogwarts library may or may not have and he would absolutely NOT UNDERSTAND AT HIS AGE. Hell, I argue that even Hermione would have no clue how to navigate through legalese in first or second year.

You claim that's what you would do, but I doubt that if you were in Harry shoes (having lived the life he'd lead) that you would do any differently. Again, if Harry had been exposed to the system at a younger age (e.g: a social worker was sent the Dursley's way at some point) then he'd likely see if the magical world had equivalents, but it is likely he didn't even know what they were, or that there were people that look out for abused children (as there is no way the Dursley's would have brought that up). So, he can't go looking for something he doesn't know exists.
