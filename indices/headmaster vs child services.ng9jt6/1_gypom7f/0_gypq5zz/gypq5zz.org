If I was in Harry shoes with the same lack of knowledge, the first think I would do is research in books this knowledge and then reach out to the legal authorities.

In the muggle world it may be the responsibility of teachers but in the Wizarding World it may be different. We may even infer that in the wizarding world family is more important. Therefore it would be responsibility of the family (cousins, other with blood ties) not the responsibility of teachers. As demonstrated when Hagrid was sent for Harry or when Hagrid was given teaching responsibility.

And it is flagrant that Harry hasn't any adult in his live, because they all think that they know him because of the boy who lived business , he doesn't have the privilege of being a child.
