THERE ARE SO MANY REASONS WHY HE SHOULD REACH OUT TO DUMBLEDORE (OR MCGONAGALL)

Harry wasn't raised in the magical world. His sole exposure to it was Hogwarts and Diagon Alley.

He didn't really know much about the Ministry (let alone where it was) until fifth year, only having snippets to go off of from then onwards.

We don't even know if the Ministry HAS a child services department, or if the DMLE even handles these sorts of disputes. So put yourself in Harry's shoes:

He's effectively alone in a world he doesn't know or understand. I doubt he even knew about social workers or the like in the Muggle world, so I don't think it would click to try a magical equivalent.

Like it or not, the Dursley's put on an image that they are upstanding citizens, which likely deterred Harry from making them out to be anything other, as it's his word (as a grubby ruffian who they graciously took in) against theirs. He has no reason to believe that the Aurors would see it any differently.

If he is taken from the Dursley's, then what? Privet Drive, as much as he hates it, is still the only home he's ever known (with the Dursley's the only family he has). Yes he's desperate to leave, but he has no idea who or what awaits him beyond. We know he can't stay at the castle, it's a school. And the Weasley's are poor, he'd refuse to impose on them.

It's likely that as much as Harry doesn't like living in Little Whinging, he doesn't register his childhood as filled with abuse and neglect. He rationalises it as the family not liking him, but never seems to make the leap that what they are doing to him is wrong. So I don't think that, even if he knew child services existed in the magical world, that he would reach out to them. Also because he's proud, and would likely just not see it as abuse.

So, of course he'd reach out to his teachers (who, like in the Muggle world, should get child services involved when faced with evidence of possible abuse).

This is the most important part. IT'S THEIR RESPONSIBILITY.

No child is expected to reach out to child services themselves, they tell teachers or other adults in their lives about things and it is THEIR responsibility to pull that trigger and get them involved. It's not on Harry to get the DMLE involved, because if he has to that means the adults in his life have failed him.

Assuming there are child protective services in the magical world (which we'll never know, as Dumbledore would have never contacted them anyway) Harry was absolutely in the right for reaching out to his headmaster.
