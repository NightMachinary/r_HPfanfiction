As far as Dumbledore knew, the Dursleys were his last remaining living relatives. It's something that was done, back in that time, giving an orphan to their (close, of course) family.

Dumbledore never intervened more than that in Harry's living conditions. For all we know, it was also perfectly legal- we never know if Dumbledore has or hasn't filled the proper forms for taking a child and bringing them to their family.

"On which authority Dumbledore had Harry placed with the Dursleys?" As a simple deliveryman. As a friend of the family. And remember, Hagrid and McGonagall also were there when the delivery was made. Do you believe Rubeus "oh yeah I actually told someone how to defeat the first layer of defence to a powerfull artefact by mistake" Hagrid kept it a secret that he brought Harry to his relatives?

So, I believe that Harry being in the Dursleys' care is, strictly speaking, legal. It's at least legal in the eyes of the Muggle world, since, y'know, he went to school and shit.

I also believe that, despite letting him in front of the door like a bottle of milk, magic makes it so that Harry was never in any danger. You know, heat so you don't die of cold, sleep until your aunt come and accept you here or not so you don't wander off, the whole package.
