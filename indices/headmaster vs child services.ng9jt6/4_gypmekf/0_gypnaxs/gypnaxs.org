On which authority Dumbledore had Harry placed with the Dursleys ? Discretionary power of being Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot ? It is my understanding that Dumbledore did it illegally and the ministry closed their eyes. Like a gentleman agreement that Dumbledore had legal power over families within order of Phoenix.

Harry discover that Dumbledore placed him with the Dursleys without legal authority with any ministry employee or Gringotts => Dumbledore manipulation.
