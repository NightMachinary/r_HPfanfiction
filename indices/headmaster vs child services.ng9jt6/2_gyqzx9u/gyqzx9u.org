Ok, reading the other comments, I'm pretty sure you are disingenuous and just want people to jump of the Dumbledore's hate train (and did you seriously propose the fucking Malfoy as a better alternative than Dumbledore for questions?). Anyways, here are some facts :

- Harry went to Dumbledore because Dumbledore is the archetype of the old mentor who answers the heros question (not to mention that Harry respect him and listen to him). If you don't like it, ask Rowling because she is the only one who could answer it.
- We don't know if the Magical World even has a child service. Canon shows us 3 orphans (Tom Riddle, Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom). And judging by the fact that one of them grew up in an orphanage, and thee 2 others lived with relatives, I want to say that it doesn't.
- As seen with the discussion between Fudge and Harry at the start of PoA, the Ministry knew where Harry lived and approved. They may have changed their mind if they knew everything that went at Privet Drive, but since it's the same organization that let Umbridge torture Harry because he was an annoyance, I wouldn't bet on it. Also, Fudge would be a terrible guardian, as would anyone chosen by him (such as the Malfoys since he seemed to like them).
- Outside of his position as Headmaster (and maybe all the other political ones), Dumbledore never had any power. Outside of Harry's living arrangement (that was also supported by the Ministry), nobody was ever forced to listen to him. In OotP, Ron and Hermione didn't give any information because they chose to listen to Dumbledore, and Sirius never left the House because he chose to listen to him. Technically they had the freedom to do what they want but decided that Dumbledore gave good advice.
