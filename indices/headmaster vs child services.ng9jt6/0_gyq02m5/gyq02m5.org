In the books, Dumbledore is the main authority figure. We have no real indication that the ministry has child services or that the DMLE really looks into that sort of abuse - along with the abuse itself being more used in a Roald Dahl style and played off as a joke (for an out of universe reason).

Back to in-universe, the ministry is fairly incompetent, and Harry was not placed with the Dursleys by them - but by Dumbledore. Harry doesn't know how the laws work, he eventually learns that Dumbledore is the one pushing him to go home every summer (for the blood protection), etc. In the end, him going to someone /other/ then the main authority figure in his life would have to rely on a lot of changes - a more explicit legal system built into the Ministry to deal with child services, a law that Harry would then have to look up/find out about, then go to contact them (presumably without Dumbledore finding out about it), etc. That's a lot of hoops to jump through.
