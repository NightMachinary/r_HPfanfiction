I actually found a decent one myself but it's the exact same plot but with Harry and Hermione in the place of Katniss and Peeta with Voldemort as Snow. The entire story plays out /exactly/ the same, it's infuriating.

Oh then there's the one that's Battle Royale but with Hogwarts people but unlike the above there's not even magic so it's literally identical.
