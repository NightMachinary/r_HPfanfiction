There's The Snow Queen from Darklooshkin, linkffn(8724634).

Female Harry, lost in time as a child and raised as the adoptive grand daughter of President Snow, summoned back to the Triwizard Tournament of an alternate Hogwarts. Great paranoid Hermione too, her reaction to the attempt to take her as a hostage is a sight to see - and compared to Rose Snow, she's the sane one.
