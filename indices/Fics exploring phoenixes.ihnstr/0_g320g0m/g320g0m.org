Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Veil of Mystery)

This is the first in a series (has 3 fanfics in it). While the main focus isn't Phoenix's they do play a fairly good-sized role and has good discussions regarding them.

-Note: I HIGHLY recommend all of semprini's works. There's 5 fanfics, with limited reviews so I feel like they don't get as much attention as they should. One of my favorite authors, honestly.
