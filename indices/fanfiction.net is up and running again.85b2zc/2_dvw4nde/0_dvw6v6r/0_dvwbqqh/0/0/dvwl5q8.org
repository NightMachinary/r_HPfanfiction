[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanFiction.Net][Xing Li, creater, owner, and maintainer of FFN for almost 20 years]]

Edit: Actually according to [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Xing_Li][fanlore]]

#+begin_quote
  Xing hasn't been heard from in years according to the former [FanFiction.net] staff members

So I'm not really sure?

Edit 2: So I think it's probably still Xing, he seems to semi-regularly post to the [[https://blog.fictionpress.com/][blog]] and even replys to some comments.

Edit 3: Also on his blog he says 'We', so I figure there are other people helping, but as far as I can tell they're nameless to the general public.
