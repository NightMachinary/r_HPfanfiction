It would be hilarious if Harry had no clue and all of this played out during canon events.

Example: Fleur conspires with the merpeople to have them kill Harry after rescuing his hostage but because Harry took Gabrielle the merpeople couldn't follow up with her plan. Cue to Gabrielle gushing about her hero while Fleur curses her fifteenth failed attempt.
