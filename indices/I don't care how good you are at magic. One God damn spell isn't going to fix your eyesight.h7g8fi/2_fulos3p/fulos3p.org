I don't see why not. Three of the four types of eyesight problems are caused by the SHAPE of a certain part of the eye. The fourth type is stiffening issue. There's no reason you shouldn't be able to transfigure the eyeball or cornea into the proper shape.

- Nearsightedness (myopia) is caused by an elongated eyeball.
- Farsightedness (hyperopia) is caused by a shortened eyeball.
- Astigmatism is a mis-shaping of the cornea.
- The farsightedness that you get from aging (presbyopia) is caused by the lens of the eye losing elasticity. One spell should fix that. Granted, curing this AND one of the others would require two spells.
