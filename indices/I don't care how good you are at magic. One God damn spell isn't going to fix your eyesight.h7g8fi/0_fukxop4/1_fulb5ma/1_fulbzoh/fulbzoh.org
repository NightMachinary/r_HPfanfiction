Maybe it's just not that big a deal to them. Honestly, I like my glasses, sometimes I walk under things that would've poked me in the eye had I not been wearing glasses. Like tree branches on a windy day. I don't like the fact that I can't see without them, but I'd probably wear sunglasses or something if I didn't need corrective lenses, so what does it really matter?

Maybe there is a fix but it's really expensive or time consuming to make. Heck wasn't polyjuice supposed to be expensive to make? I know it was time consuming, it took them a while to make it in the book.
