First thought off the top of my head is that glasses are almost certainly easier to charm than eyes. Rather than restorative, bringing your vision to normal, they could be enhancements. See normally undetectable vapors, things like that. Would be handy for a talented witch or wizard to have on them. A quick tap and anything you need seeing or highlighting will be shown to you.
