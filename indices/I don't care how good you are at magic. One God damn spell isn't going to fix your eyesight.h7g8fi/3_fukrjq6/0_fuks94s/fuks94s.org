That's not how that works. Sure we have Lasik but that doesn't work on everyone. First you would need to figure out what is wrong with that specific persons eyes. It will be different for everyone, and it's not like they'll have a spell for every possible eye. Now you could make the case that they could just replace the eyes entirely akin to mad eye, but that's probably way too expensive when you could just wear contacts. Oh wait contacts don't work for everyone what the fuck eyes? If there was a surgery that could fix my eyesight don't you think I would take it at this point. I swear to God if one more person why don't you just get Lasik man after they hear an ad on the fucking radio I'm gonna lose my shit. What was I talking about?
