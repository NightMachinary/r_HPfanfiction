The shape of the eyeball has the most to do with many vision problems as it impacts how the eye focuses so i can see a spell that diagnosis the problems with the eye and then spells to correct it. For instance cataracts are simply the lens getting cloudy (eg turning yellow versus remaining clear) so I can see a spell to clear the lens.

I would agree that since it is so sensitive that it only be performed by experts and i can see it being quite painful.

I know plenty of people who prefer wearing glasses and refuse to wear contacts or have surgery even though they've been told that they are great candidates.

And I agree with other posters that it's much easier to charm glasses than to charm eyes.

As far as canon do we actually know if whether anyone besides harry are actually wearing prescriptive lenses versus clear glass as either a fashion statement or because they are charmed?
