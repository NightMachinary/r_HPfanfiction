People always seem to do weird things with the Dept of Mysteries. There are a lot of stories where the members go hooded everywhere and no one knows who they are. In the books Arthur points out two of them by name. They always have them as spies or commandos or people who do practical magic research. The last is closest to what they do in my opinion, but not quite right.

It always seemed to me that the department itself is not mysterious but that it studies the "Mysteries." Life, Death, Time, Love, Sentience, those kind of things. The magical equivalent of theoretical physics researchers. Arthur doesn't know what they get up to because he doesn't read theoretical magic journals.
