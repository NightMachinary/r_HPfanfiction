You've probably read some/most/all of these before, but here is what I have bookmarked.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7352166/1/Protection-From-Nargles][Protection of Nargles]] by Arpad Hrunta. "Harry and Luna meet in the Room of Requirement. Mistletoe appears. Will Nargles be a problem? Takes place in during Harry's fifth year, as he and Luna get closer. Basically pure fluff, largely consisting of conversations. NOW COMPLETE." And its sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725072/1/Harry-and-Luna-Against-the-High-Inquisitor][Harry and Luna Against the High Inquisitor]] which is incomplete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][RuneMaster]] by Tigerman. "In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language." There is some very slight Harry/Hermione, but it ends up Harry/Luna.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1327362/JJ-Rust][JJ Rust]] has several good Harry/Luna oneshots worth checking out.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/565797][Marriage In Mind]] by AzarDarkstar. "A marriage contract. They want him to sign away his freedom and his future and his life on a girl who didn't even attend her best friend's funeral. Harry has other ideas."

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/565778][White Lies (And Other Misdemeanors)]] by AzarDarkstar. "'I was never a child. Just a very short adult.' In which Albus Dumbledore is perturbed, Voldemort is disturbed, and Harry is just Harry."

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/387057][Courting Luna Lovegood]] by kalisgirl. "Harry never imagined that trying to protect Luna's reputation would be so difficult."

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/99714][Full of Surprises]] by Vipersweb. "Fleur likes Hermione and goes to Harry for some help. Meanwhile, Pansy discovers she has a lot in common with one Ginny Weasley." Harry/Luna is the background pairing in this, and it is incredibly AU -- takes place at a high school in America, no magic.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/565801][Doubting Thomas]] by AzarDarkstar. "After all, every child deserves a mother who loves them. Even those who grow up to be monsters. Luna just never imagined things would turn out this way." There is no actual mention of Luna/Harry, but it is hinted at. You should read it anyway because it's really good and an interesting premise.
