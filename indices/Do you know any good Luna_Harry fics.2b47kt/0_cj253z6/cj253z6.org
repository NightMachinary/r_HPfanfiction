- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1500318/1/Luna-s-Year][Luna's Year]] by michelle-31a is the oldest of the lot, and you've probably read it a lot. The world-building is nothing spectacular, but it's a neat little story with some interesting ideas and characterization.\\
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5241798/1/Pathetic][Pathetic]] by A-Kubrick-Spent has a whole host of content and style issues, but there is a lot of good to say about its imagination. It's also the only take on a darker Luna I've ever found remotely interesting, but your mileage may vary.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5971274/1/Conlaodh-s-Song][Conlaodh's Song]] by enembee should not be read before reading its prequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light][By the Divining Light]]. If you haven't read them before, you should do so---not because of the pairing, but because they're among the best examples of Harry Potter fanfiction.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=116462][Harry Potter and the Hogwarts Rift]] by Illyich follows a somewhat cookie-cutter template, if I remember correctly (read it years ago), but I recall some rather compelling moments that may make it worthwhile.
