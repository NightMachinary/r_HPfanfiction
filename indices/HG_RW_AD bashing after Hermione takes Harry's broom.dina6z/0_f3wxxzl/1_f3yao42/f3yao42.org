Because Ron only uses Harry for his fame and money, and would probably be pissed at harry for ending his friendship with Hermione.

Also, Ron and Hermione probably worked for Dumbledore before he died. Think to when he met Ron, you think there was any reason for a family of witches and wizards to be standing outside the barrier shouting about it and being around the muggles. And Hermione always listens to authority; you think she wouldn't take the offer of more political sway through Dumbledore or the weasleys, than just being a muggleborn in a pure blood society where all she needs to do is rat out her friend.
