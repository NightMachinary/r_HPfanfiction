Well, I use AO3, so kudos, subscribe, or bookmark for me.

Kudos - when I liked it or thought it was well written, but it didn't make much of an emotional impression on me. If it's incomplete, I most likely won't return to read the rest after it's finished.

Subscribe - when I loved it but it's incomplete. This says little about its quality (although I'm not very likely to love a story that's poorly executed), and a lot about my emotional reaction. It will only move to my bookmarks if I still love it when it's finished.

Bookmark - same as above, except it's already complete and I loved the whole thing.
