I favorite stories that are both well-written and enjoyable. In other words, stories that I'm proud to say that I've enjoyed.

My follow list consists of guilty pleasure stories, stories that I've enjoyed but are objectively bad. Basically, stories that I'm not proud of, and so I place them in my follow list, which no one can see except me.

I turn off alerts for follows, since I don't use follows for that purpose. WIP stories that I'm truly interested in are on my favorite list already, and I check them often enough to not miss any new updates.
