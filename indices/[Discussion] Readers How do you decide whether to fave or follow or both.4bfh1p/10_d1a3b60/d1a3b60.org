I have an email just for accounts I have set up on the Internet, and I don't get notifications for that particular account on my iPad, so I'm fine with email alerts.

I favourite when I really, really adore a fic, almost always it will be completed. Back when I first started reading fanfic, I used to fav any fic I finished, just so I know I had read it. When I finally created a doc dedicated to read fics, I switched over to favouriting actual favourites.

I follow anything that is a WIP and I'd like to read. I'll even follow fics that say they are on an indefinite hiatus or abandoned... Because you never know.
