Pretty much every story that isn't finished by the time I get there I follow, but if I liked it and it's finished I favourite.

Unless its /really/ good then I'll favourite while it's in progress.

But honestly whenever I look for a good story to reread I'll go search through both lists so it's not like I only ever go back to favourited stories. I do like getting email notifications, but that's probably because it's on a super old email account that pretty much only gets FanFiction emails.
