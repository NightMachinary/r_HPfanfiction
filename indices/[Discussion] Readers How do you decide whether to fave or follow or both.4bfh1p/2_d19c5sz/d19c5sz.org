If it's a story that looks like I'll want to read it, but isn't complete, I'll follow it. I generally don't read works in progress. When I get an update email, I'll go see if it's complete. If it is, it gets unfollowed and put into my "to read" bookmark folder.

If I read a story and enjoyed it, and think it's worth either rereading eventually or recommending to someone else, it'll get added to my favorites.

For some authors, I'll automatically follow one of their stories even if it might not be my thing because I enjoy the author's work. It'll still get unfollowed when it's complete, but it'll still only get added to my favorites if I thought it was good.

Follows are for only my benefit, favorites are for all of us :)
