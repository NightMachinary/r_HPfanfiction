I like to believe that people aren't that fucking creepy, or that they may think it through the next day (polyjuice takes a lot of time) and realize "oh wow, that is pretty fucked up. Also, what am I gonna do with cedric?"

Also, I find it hard to believe that there aren't any laws against polyjuice, or even just taking materials compatible with it and various other pieces of magic. Your appearance and wand are pretty much the only means of identification, and not having a punishment for stealing either is ridiculous. We punish identity theft irl, and we can't make ourselves look /exactly/ like the guy we're impersonating.

And like apart from that, it's just fucking creepy. It's stalker behavior.
