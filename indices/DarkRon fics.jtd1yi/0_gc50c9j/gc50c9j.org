I always thought I would love to read something along the following lines: after Ron leaves the tent in DH, he is actually captured by Snatchers, but since he is a pureblood, Voldemort pardons him with the condition that he becomes a Death Eater. Ron accepts with the condition that his family or Hermione won't be harmed. In order to win his trust, Ron gives Harry's location to Voldemort, as well as the fact that he is hunting Horcruxes. Voldemort finds Harry and kills him. This makes Ron one of Voldemort's proteges and everyone (not knowing that Voldemort is immortal) expect for Ron to be Voldemort's successor. Meanwhile Ron is hunting Horcruxes and destroying them one by one. Once he is done, he poisons Voldemort and takes his position as the leader of Magical Britain. From this position he gives Muggleborns protection and more rights to the House Elves. Despite being hated by his family and the love of his life, turns out Ron did all this for Hermione.
