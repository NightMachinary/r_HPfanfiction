Thanks for the link.

Also my comment was but a fanfic prompt. I would have written it if I were not so shitty at writing dialogs but I think, that while what you said might be very valid for canon, I think there could be ways to develop the story while avoiding the conflicts you mentioned without altering the story prior to that point. For example, Ron might have taken seriously the fact that Hermione was insisting on Harry to learn Occlumency and while still being supportive towards Harry., he secretly learned Occlumency using tips that Harry was telling him about that he got from Snape. Also Ron could play the Horcrux hunt as Harry doing something that he didn't feel like sharing with his friends so that's why he left. All he knew was that Harry stole a locket from Umbridge.
