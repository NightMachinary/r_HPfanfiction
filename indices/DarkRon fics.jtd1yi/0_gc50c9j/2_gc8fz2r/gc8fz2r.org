That might work but Voldemort kills anyone who even suspects of his horcruxes, and that Hermione is a Muggleborn and knows of the horcruxes (as does Ron), and Voldemort is a master Legilimens and Ron doesn't know Occlumency so can't lie to him or betray him like that. So Voldemort is far more likely to take what he wants from Ron and then kill him.

I posted a prompt once that got this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/egtpoi/-/fcm4u0m][amazing comment]] in answer. You might want to take a look.
