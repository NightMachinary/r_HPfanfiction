Seconding [[/u/wordhammer]] 's shout-out to Makani. I'm also a big fan of [[http://nesskain.deviantart.com/][Nesskain]]'s collection of HP comic panel works - [[http://nesskain.deviantart.com/art/Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-509812228][this]] one in particular. It's my favourite depiction of the Dumbledore and Voldemort's duel by far.
