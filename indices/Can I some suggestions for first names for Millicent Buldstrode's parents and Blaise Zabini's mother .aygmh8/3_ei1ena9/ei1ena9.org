I never understood why fanon is so enamoured with an Italian Mrs. Zabini (or whatever last name she currently has). Unless I've forgotten some canon detail, Blaise's surname would come from his father, not his mother. As Blaise is a French form, I would suggest either a French name (if you wish her to actually be French) or a French form popular in England (if you want her to be something like the Malfoys, i.e., presumably descended from French transplants).

If you want a name with some meaning, for the former I'd suggest Isabella (for Isabella of France, Queen of England and eventual regent for her son, one of the most famous beautiful and talented 'femme fatales,' who has been thought responsible for the death of her husband (Edward II of England).\\
If you want her to be Italian, you could name her for the notorious "femme fatale" Lucrezia Borgia.
