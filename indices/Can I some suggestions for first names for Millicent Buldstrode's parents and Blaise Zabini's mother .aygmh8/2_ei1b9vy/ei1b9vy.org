I looked up the history of the name Bulstrode and found a cool story:

  "When William conquered English ground, Bulstrode had per annum three hundred pound." The Conqueror gave the estate to the Norman follower, "he and his adherents, mounted upon Bulls, resisted the invaders and retained possession. Afterwards, accompanied by his seven sons, mounted in the same fashion, he went under safe conduct to William's court, and the Conqueror was so much amused wit the strangeness of the scene, that he permitted the stalwart Saxon to hold his lands under ancient tenure, and conferred upon him and his heirs for ever the surname of Bullstrode!"

Millicent was a popular British name in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Going off of that, and because Bulstrode is a traditional British name, I'd go with classic names like Edward or Richard for the father and Elizabeth or Edith for the mother.
