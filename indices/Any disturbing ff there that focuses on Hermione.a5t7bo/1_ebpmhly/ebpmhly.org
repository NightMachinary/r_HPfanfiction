I'm fond of linkffn(Resistance by Lorien829) - it's a great dystopia where Voldemort captures Harry and essentially wins. The surviving Order of the Phoenix has to find a way to upset his takeover, which seems to be supported by ten times as many wizards as they were expecting to fight. Hermione-centric, HP/HG, and though the Weasleys aren't bashed, they suffer as much as anyone in this harsh landscape.
