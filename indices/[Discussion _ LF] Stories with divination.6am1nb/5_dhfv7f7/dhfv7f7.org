If time turners allow you to pass info to your past self without breaking things... at that point you've already won. At the very least, it allows instantaneous computation.

Also: I claim reasonable the following: The only reason memory-strand transfer to gain knowledge or skills is not a thing is that you can't place someone else's memory-strand into your own mind. Therefore, using a time-turner and the memory in/out spells, you should be able to learn all the things, and practice until perfect anything that does is not muscle-building-based, in the space of several realtime hours, by passing back memory strands each time you reach the end of the day, and your past self then starts the next loop from wherever the last left off.

For a Time Travel to make sense (why isn't everyone, or at the the antagonist doing it?) you need to either nerf TT terribly, or have TT be so broken as to be useless (i.e. it is given the MAD treatment), etc.
