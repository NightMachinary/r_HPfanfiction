  The only reason memory-strand transfer to gain knowledge or skills is not a thing is that you can't place someone else's memory-strand into your own mind.

In my opinion the best way to rationalize this limitation without it being a transparent nerfing is that by incorporating other people's memories you are incorporating not just the basic information of what happened or what was learned but their entire perspective/experience of the memory.

Because a large part of who we are comes from our experiences, loading up on other people's memories would make you less and less yourself and more and more a jumble of other people or a single other person depending on how you source the memories. Best case scenario, you are no longer you and are now someone else; worst case, you've gone insane.

Most people would find major issue with this side effect and decide it's not worth it. Even if advanced occlumency could somehow mitigate this, that's difficult to learn in and of itself and something tells me it still wouldn't be a perfect solution.
