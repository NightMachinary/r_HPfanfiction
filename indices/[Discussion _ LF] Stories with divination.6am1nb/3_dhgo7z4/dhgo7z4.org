I assumed that Divination is the "Quantum Physics" of magic. If you're a competent diviner, you also know when and when not to say something, as in when and when not to measure what you have before you.

The prophecy, for example, could have been one of the thousands upon thousand of prophecies in the DoM that never came to be, but through the words being spoken to someone who was willing to follow them - they measured the information - it came true. And those who had the information reacted differently, according to how much of the prophecy they knew.

In real life cultures there have been a few different types of diviners. There are those who read nature to find an answer, true diviners that interpret messages sent by [insert supernatural force]. Then there are oracles, who divine the future by being in trance through the intake of fumes, drugs or by ritual. The last of the general categories are prophets, who derive their knowledge of the future form a divine being directly.

I'd like to think that Divination in the HP world categorizes similar to this. There are competent diviners, such as the centaurs that can make predictions upon observations. Then there are oracles, and I always interpreted Trelawney as such a diviner. People who are mouthpieces of prophecy, but unable to "measure the words" as they themselves don't know them.
