The school might require all the kids have their own copy.

Not only that, but playing musical chairs with textbooks is harder than it seems. They might have classes on opposite ends of the school. Homework would get really tricky, really fast. Sure, they don't have classes at the same time, but they may all need to read the book at the same time.

Sharing is trickier than it seems. I grew up with three other siblings and we had to share everything.
