Having Harry give the Weasley's money, would just embarrass them. Even ignoring their pride at hand, Harry is the same age as their youngest son, even if he did it as an adult, it'd make the Weasley parents feel like they couldn't take care of their children.

And really, they did rather well, imo. All children were fed and given what they needed, sure there were things that they wanted, that they couldn't have, but overall they were still good.

And that's even considering the fact that Molly didn't work, though that did make me wonder... why she didn't work once Ginny went to Hogwarts, she could have done odd jobs here and there, while the children were at Hogwarts...

Wouldn't be surprised if she did, and just didn't say anything to the children about doing it. Also wouldn't surprise me if Charlie or Bill sent them occasional money. Getting money from a child that's yours is less embarrassing then getting money from a child that isn't. (Though that'd probably only happen in very intense moments, or much needed moments).
