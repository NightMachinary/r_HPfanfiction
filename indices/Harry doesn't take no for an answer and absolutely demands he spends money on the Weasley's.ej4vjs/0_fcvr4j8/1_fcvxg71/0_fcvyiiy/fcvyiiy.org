Ron never told his parents that his wand was busted; until later, then their parents got him a new one, otherwise both of their wands worked well for them.

While money is nice to have, I've went without before, it helps you learn what to do with it, and how/what to buy stuff on.

Ron never wanted Harry to buy him expensive looking stuff, and a wand is expansive and would have told Harry not too, same as Ginny, she would have as well.
