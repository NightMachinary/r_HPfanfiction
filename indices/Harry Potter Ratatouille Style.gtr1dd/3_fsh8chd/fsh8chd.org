Now I'm contemplating a variation of this where Bowie is instead brave enough to deal with making potions in the bat-wizard's presence... so long as he's not noticed.

Cue meeting the shy, reclusive young Herbology prodigy you really /gets plants/ and can easily make friends with the timid Bowtruckle... and also happens to have problems with confidence in the Potions classroom.

Neville and Bowie, working together to make potions without mean Professor Snape catching on!
