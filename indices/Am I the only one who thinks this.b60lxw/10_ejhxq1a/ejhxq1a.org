But I suppose Richard Harris played Dumbledore up to the point were things started going wrong. Both book one and two had the loving magically fantasy feel to it. Whereas everything becomes significantly darker once Michael Gambon took over. I wonder if Harris hadn't died when he did would we have a different interpretation on the Gambon = bad thing. Was it more a product of the series taking a turn in a darker direction?
