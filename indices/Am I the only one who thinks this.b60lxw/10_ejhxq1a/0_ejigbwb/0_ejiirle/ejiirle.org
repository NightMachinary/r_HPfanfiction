I dunno, it's very easy to blame an actor because they're what we see. Who's to say that “DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FIRE?!” wasn't in the script? I think Harris lacked the fun youthfulness associated with dumbledore. I could imagine Gambon flying on a broomstick and having an obsession with sweets. Harris looked like he was exhausted the whole time.
