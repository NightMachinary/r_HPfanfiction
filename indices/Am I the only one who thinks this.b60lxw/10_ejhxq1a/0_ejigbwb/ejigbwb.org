No, it really wasn't. Because from my recollection of the books, even after the series starts getting darker with /Prisoner of Azkaban/, Dumbledore himself never really stops being the same slightly eccentric, grandfatherly old man he was from the beginning.

IIRC, Gambon had not and did not read the books before acting the part, and pretty much just did whatever the hell he wanted, which is how we ended up with */"DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FIRE?! DID YOU??!!!!"/*

He gets marginally better in the last couple of movies, but he still feels /off/ to me when I compare Gambon to the mental image of Dumbledore I get from reading the books.
