I think I'm sort of the same way but I agree with the other comment that the super weird evil manipulative Dumbledores are so ooc that my immersion is immediately broken and I cant imagine what that Dumbledore would look like. But for manipulative somewhat evil Dumbledore I always imagined he appears younger later because he doesnt destroy the philosophers stone and then waits for the flamels to die to start producing elixir for himself.
