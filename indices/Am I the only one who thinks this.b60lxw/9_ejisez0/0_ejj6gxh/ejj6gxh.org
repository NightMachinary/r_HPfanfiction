Yeah exactly. Harris seemed to be of the grandfather old man JK Rowling was trying to portray, while Gambon seemed to be of the "Poweful, listen to me, leader"

Example reading linkffn( Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure Part 1) it's much easier picture Gambon then Harris as the Dumbledore in that story.
