So instead of raising Harry for certain death, he instead raised Harry for almost certain death. After-all Voldemort, the most feared dark lord in recent history, so powerful he only feared Dumbledore, is going to definetly lose to Harry. Don't forget that he did actually plan out Harry's death at least in the later books with the whole sharing his mothers sacrafice thing. Again he is at the least a bad man with noble intentions. Even evil people can convince themselves that what their doing is right.

Dumbledore is manipulative, thinks of the larger picture instead of the individual brush strokes, and condemned Harry to a hard younger life knowingly. These are all actions that would label anyone as either a misguided, incompetant fool, or a bad person. Just because it worked out in the end doesn't change the fact that it was not the morally right thing to do. To say otherwise makes you either a hard core Dumbledore fan, or a fool.

In the end it was luck that Harry lived. Dumbledore was a very secretive man(as most manipulative people are), he didn't fully trust anyone, and because of that he truly believes he knows best. Sadly that is why i'd put him in the "bad guy" column. When people who believe they know best actually start manipulating other people into these situations to further their goal is when they go from good intentioned to bad guy.
