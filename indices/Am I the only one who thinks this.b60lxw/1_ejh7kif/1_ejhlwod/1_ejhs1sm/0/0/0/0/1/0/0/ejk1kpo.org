Obviously I won't be able to convince you. You seem to be a really big fan of Dumbledore, and sure if you look at it differently, and don't apply the logic of the real world to it, it's easy to believe what you do. So i'm just going to give up on arguing about Dumbledore's character with you. You believe what you wish, and i'll believe what I wish. In the end, that's one of the great things about stories, different people read different things. I believe he's a manipulator with morally greay intentions. You don't.
