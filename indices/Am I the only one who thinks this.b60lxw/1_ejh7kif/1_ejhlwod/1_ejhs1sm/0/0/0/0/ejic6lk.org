I disagree with pretty much all of your post, but I am not trying to change your opinion, just want to leave mine here.

Basically I agree, it was luck that Harry lived. Harry was meant to die as one year old, like all the other people who died during the first war. There was never really a good life option for Harry Potter after Voldemort heard that prophecy. He miraculously survived (Lily's sacrifice and Voldemort's mistake). But now he had a horcrux in him (un-extractable as far as we know and no one knew about it), a prophecy about him, a target for revenge by Voldemort and his followers and people wanting to use him. He was doomed and none of it was Dumbledore's fault.

Yet he lived to have 2.5 kids and happy ending. Sure his life was hard but it wasn't bad, but he survived, had friends, avenged his parents. All thanks to his own luck/courage and people who were willing to what they could to defeat DL: including Snape, his friends, Order, and most of all Dumbledore shielding him from DL for a time and making some very risky hard calls.

Most of the arguments against Dumblerdore seem to relay on hindsight knowledge or existence of some unproven "better choices", but I found non of them very convincing yet. I don't really wanna go into details though, it was done so many times here.
