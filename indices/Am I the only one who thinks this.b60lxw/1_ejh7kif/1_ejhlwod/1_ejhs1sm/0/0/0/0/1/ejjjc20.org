You seem to be forgetting the most important parts. You can hand wave as much as you want, but the fact remains that Dumbledore truly believe he thought he knew best, therefore he never shared his knowledge fully, but used it to manipulate others. He truly believed he knew best, and therefore he should be the only one that knows the full picture, and will only release information when he wishes too. Hocruxes for example are something he could have at least shared with his closet friends, and allies with the hope that they could help woth it's destruction, but no he left it in the hands of Harry. Yes Harry is meant to defeat Voldemort, but why couldn't Dumbledore have at least helped with the Hocruxes.

How about Dumbledore not telling Harry about the prophecy until Sirius died, Arthur was injured, and Hermione, and co got greatly injured. No he kept it a secret, because he thought he knew best. Let's not forget about how stupid it was to have bait(Philosophers stone) for the Dark Lord, or his Death Eaters in a school full of children. That is just plain incompetent, or manipulative(after-all why did he do it on the very first year Harry attended Hogwarts). I'm pretty sure Dumbledore said somewhere that he was letting Harry try his strength.

Over-all you can believe what you want, but the evidence is strong that Dumbledore is a manipulator who truly believes he knows best. Did he, well we will never know. The fact remains though is that he treated everyone as chess pieces. Maybe he truly did care for them, and such, but that doesn't change the way he essentialy used people.
