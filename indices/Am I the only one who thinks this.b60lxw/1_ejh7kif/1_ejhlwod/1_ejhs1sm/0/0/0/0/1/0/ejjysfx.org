I didn't forget anything trust me. Used people for what? Money, power? What did he get from it all besides grisly death? You say like Voldemort was his personal problem. He fought for what he thought was right, along with the people who willingly joined him. They weren't all easily manipulated idiots, they understood the need to know basis.

Dumbledore had all the information because he is one who figured/found it out, so obviously, it was up to him to decide whom to give it and how much. If he gets it wrong, the war could be lost. Ever hear of security clearance? What is the point of Arthur knowing the prophecy? What if he got caught on assignment? In the world with legilimency, imperius and veritaserum it's basically guaranteed he would spill it. And Harry is no different, but with a direct link to Voldemort's mind and no desire to defend against it.

Dumbledore was finding out about Horcruxes during the fifth year, he didn't want Voldemort to get wind of it, so he stayed away. If Voldemort would move them, all is lost. And even so, Harry, Ron and Hermione knew, Snape knew at least some of it, Slughorn too. Hardly no one. And none of them told anyone else even after Dumbledore's death.

And what do you mean he didn't help with them? He figured out what they are, how to destroy them, where to look. He basically gave Harry a list and said: "go". He took out two of them and died in the process, otherwise he would have certainly went after the rest. No one has done more, besides maybe Harry.

Philosophers stone was moved because Quirell was about to break into Gringotts where it was kept, into the safest place besides Hogwarts, not because he wanted to. It was a year Voldemort decided to make his move. So it was moved to Hogwarts. Then Dumbledore got an idea to set a trap to get Voldemort while he is weak, if it succeeded the war would have be over to the best of anyone's knowledge at the time and Harry would live a safe life. Also Voldemort couldn't actually harm Harry then.
