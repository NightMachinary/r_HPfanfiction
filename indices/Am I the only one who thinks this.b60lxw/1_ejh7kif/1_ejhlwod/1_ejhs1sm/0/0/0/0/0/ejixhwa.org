I also think that, considering the informations he had at hands, Dumbledore did for the best.\\
Dumbledore, while he probably had some suspicions (there can be only so many ways to not die in their world), only confirmed the existence of Horcruxes at the end of Harry's 2nd year.

As for Harry himself, I don't think he confirmed it before Harry's 4th year at the earliest, more likely end of 5th.

By this time, the 2nd war had already started, and Harry had a big target on his back, not only from the prophecy but from the several times he had bested Voldemort.

From Dumbledore point of view, without all the personal feeling (he seemed to really appreciate him), Harry was :\\
- Someone he could trust to not join Voldemort (already proved his character and easier to trust when you know the bad guy would never accept him in his ranks).\\
- Someone who could not escape the war (Voldemort made sure of that).\\
- Someone who proved he was talented to stay alive, and yet seemed condemned by his scar.

Might as well use him to the war since he will likely have to die for the enemy to fall, and if by doing so you can grant him a tiny chance to survive and live long after, might as well do it.
