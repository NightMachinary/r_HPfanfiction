I like to think Dumbledore as a "Greater Good" guy (even if he should not like this description).\\
Like, he did place Harry with the Dursleys knowing who they were, but his reasoning was "Ok, he probably won't be extremely happy there (and let's be honest, Harry did not suffer nearly as much as what fanon said he did, just the cupboard seem to enter in the abuse realm), but it's the only place he is completely safe, so it's the best solution if you don't want to have a baby murdered.
