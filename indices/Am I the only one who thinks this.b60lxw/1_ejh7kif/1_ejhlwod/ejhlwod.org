He is very manipulative though. He placed Harry at the Dursleys knowing what he was condeming Harry to, and he did engineer Harry's death to protect everyone else(hopefully) with the chance of Harry coming back(hopefully). I find manipulative, greater good Dumbledore to be a pretty accurate representation of him, as long as it's not taken too far.
