Exactly!

Dumbledore being manipulative =/= Manipulative!Dumbledore.

The former is the chessmaster figure of the books. The latter (aka "evil Dumbledore") is the fanon archetype taken to its utmost extreme. Fanon Dumbledore doesn't send Harry to the Dursleys knowing that it's the best out of a set of bad choices. He does it because he wants to isolate Harry, so he latches onto to the first person to be kind to him, the first people to introduce him to the magical world... Hagrid and the Weasleys. One of them is brainwashed into loyalty to Dumbles, and the other tempted into falling in with the plan because of the potentinal payout from the Potter Vault, and for Mrs. Weasley, a chance to make Ginny the future Mrs. Potter.

There's a difference between the two. A very, very big difference.
