Yes but most fanfic authors seem to write this Dumbledore as if he gets off on those facts. Like he loves the fact that he's hurting Harry and he's only doing it as a way to keep power. I truly believe that Dumbledore hated the fact that he had to do these things and always felt incredibly guilty about them, but truly thought it was the only way. It doesnt make it right but there is a significant difference between the two. One is misguided and the other is what I would categorize as evil.
