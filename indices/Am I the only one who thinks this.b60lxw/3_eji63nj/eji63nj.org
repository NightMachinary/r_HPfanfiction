No you're not. Michael Gambon later ( or earlier I'm not quite sure on the timing) played an extremely convincing Scrooge-ish character for one of the Doctor Who Christmas specials, and given his performance as Dumbledore, what with the "FIYAH!?" and his generally surly portrayal, well, yeah he's the face of "secretly evil Dumbledore" for me.
