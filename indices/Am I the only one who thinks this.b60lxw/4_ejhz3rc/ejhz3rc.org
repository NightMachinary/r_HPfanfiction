I think of an age-progressed Jude Law Dumbledore more for manip!Dumbledore nowadays. Gambon's Dumbledore definitely has his fingers in the pies, but he more seems the "weary war hero" which I think Gambon was going for. Harris has more of the "cheery grandfather" vibe.

If only McKellen took the role. We could have had the "fabulous" Dumbledore, complete with the book wardrobe.
