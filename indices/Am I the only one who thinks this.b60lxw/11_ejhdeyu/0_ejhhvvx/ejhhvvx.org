I can see him as a powerful wizard who is secure in his power and feels no need to show it off. He doesn't do showy power moves because it's much more efficient to just take them down with something small. Kind of like the way they did Thranduil in the Hobbit. He was once like Legolas, but is old and wisened enough to know that energy is much more important than flippy stuff, and silence can be terrifying.
