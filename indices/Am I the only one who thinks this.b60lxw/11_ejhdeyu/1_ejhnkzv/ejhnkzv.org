I actually think that was the point. Think of the Voldemort- Dumbledore fight in Order of the Phoenix. Before that, I feel like Harry only saw Dumbledore as how you've characterized Harris' Dumbledore- soft-spoken, wise teacher. That duel was the first time Harry sees Dumbledore do the kind of magic he's famous for doing. IIRC Harry says something like "he could see how this was the only Wizard Voldemort ever feared."
