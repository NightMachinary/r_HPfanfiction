Frankly, I don't think of a lot of the actors when I'm picturing fanfic characters. My headcanon Harry/Hermione/Ron/Dumbledore/Snape (and on and on) are all pretty different from what we got in the movie.

This isn't shitting on the movies, it's just a totally different medium. There's a lot of fanart that's probably closer to how I imagine Albus, rather than the movie version.
