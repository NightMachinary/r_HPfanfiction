Rather than an accurate representation, it was more a popular one. Too old, too good looking, too mature (we don't see Rickmanacting extremely picky like book Snape, like when he ignored Hermione teeth or thrown Harry's vial on the ground to give him a 0).\\
Yet a lot of people (myself included) really liked this representation of the character. It think it's better to see books and movie as 2 different entities on this point (at least to not have his image of Ron destroyed).
