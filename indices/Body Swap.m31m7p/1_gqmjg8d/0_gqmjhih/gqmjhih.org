  There are certain segments of the Harry Potter fandom which more or less idolize Hermione. You know, the people who think that Hermione really should have been the main character of the stories all along, because she was the only one of the trio with a brain. Now, I don't necessarily think JKR did a great job portraying her as very intelligent in the series, but I'm still one of those people who wants to see what she could have been if she were actually the main character, and not just the brainy sidekick (or, as in Mary Potter, a mostly-independent secondary protagonist doing her own thing on the sidelines). So this is that story: What happens if you put Hermione Granger's mind into Harry Potter's body, effectively making her the Boy Who Lived?So she wakes up in his body, and vice versa. While he revels in his new-found loving family (which more than makes up for the strangeness of waking up as a girl), she drastically re-evaluates her priorities, endeavoring to act like the story-book heroines with whom she is so familiar and deal with this unpleasant development as efficiently as possible.
