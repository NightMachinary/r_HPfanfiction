Haven't heard of anything like this.

It would be really fucking hard to write as-well. You'd have to not only figure out the world-building aspects of it (What has changed in Wizarding Britain in those 10 years), not only would you have to nail down the characterisations of the original cast, 10 years later but you also have to somehow figure out a plot. An antagonist, something that forces the plot to progress and the characters to evolve. All that while also creating new characters that aren't boring or walking cliches.
