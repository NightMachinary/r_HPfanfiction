Lol @ these recs. The summaries make me want to stay as far way from them as possible.

In any case, the only good fic you'll (probably) find in this genre is linkffn(Yellow Submarine by Deadwoodwoodpecker). It is very well written, has no OOCness or bashing, and actually deals with the matter somewhat realistically.

It is, however, incomplete. It has a good 200k words before abandonment though.

EDIT: linkffn(Exile by bennybear) also has a hurt/comfort theme, dealing with Draco's recovery from the war. It is quite well written as well, and I'll recommend it if you don't mind Draco. WIP, updated last month.
