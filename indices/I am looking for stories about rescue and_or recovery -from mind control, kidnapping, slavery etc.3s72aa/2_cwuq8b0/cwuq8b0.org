This will probably not be what you're looking for: It's slash, contains liberal body horror and angst and almost the entirety of the fic is focused on the awful pain filled rescue. It's /very/ dark as far as I remember.

This is the only one that comes to mind immediately. Hoever, I've had a phase in which I read fics like that obsessively in order to work through my own problems, so I've read a lot of them - I just can't think of them rn. As soon as I remember more, I'll post them here.

If you're really desperate for that sort of fic I'd go as far as suggesting checking out different fandoms. Harry Potter fics this dark tend to be written by rather young and inexperienced writers who don't really know much about trauma anyway. Marvel is a rather widespread fandom that contains a gold mine for fics like that: The Wintersoldier character in particular has the biggest amount of well written trauma centric fics I've ever seen in a fandom.

Good luck with your search!
