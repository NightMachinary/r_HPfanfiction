This isnt a harry potter fic, this one is actually a slash omega/alpha fic from supernatural, but you don't need to know the supernatural fandom at all to enjoy. Alpha/omega literature has a lot of dark undertones to it - you'll find a lot of the themes you're looking for there, as long as you can get beyond the genderbending and 6 different gender combinations, as well as the male pregnancy. Some people can't get beyond that and its fine - but its worth a shot to see if you enjoy it. Here's the best omega/alpha fanfiction I've ever read.
