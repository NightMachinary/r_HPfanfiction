/'Goddamnit I should check out other species before settling on long lived snakes'/ hissed Voldemort while hitting, yet again, baby Potter with an Avada. Potter burst into the flames, and kept crawling, leaving after himself another charred spot.

His Death Eaters shifted uncomfortably. It was getting embarrassing. Baby Potter gurgled and sat heavily on his bare butt. Bellatrix cooed.

Perspiration appeared on Voldemort's brow. He should hasten his mortal enemy demise before her maternal instincts kick in.
