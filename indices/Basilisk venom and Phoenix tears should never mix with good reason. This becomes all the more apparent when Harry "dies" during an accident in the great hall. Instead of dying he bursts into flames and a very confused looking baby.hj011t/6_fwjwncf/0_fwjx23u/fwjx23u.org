If you're gonna get immortality from a Phoenix you might as well get the drawbacks to add a little drama to your immortality. Plain immortality is boring as shit. But if getting it from a Phoenix means you also inherit bursting into flames when you die and becoming a baby for awhile with a smidge of pyromania then it becomes waaaay more interesting.
