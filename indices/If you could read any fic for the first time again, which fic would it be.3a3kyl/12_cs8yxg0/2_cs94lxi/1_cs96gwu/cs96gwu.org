Kinda? I saw FF, but barely remember it. In fact, I didn't like it much, so was very hesitant to actually read BCGE.

I'd say you should definitely read a summary of FF before you read BCGE, there's a ton of plot stuff that won't make sense without it. Also, the characters aren't really rehashed, you're meant to know them beforehand.
