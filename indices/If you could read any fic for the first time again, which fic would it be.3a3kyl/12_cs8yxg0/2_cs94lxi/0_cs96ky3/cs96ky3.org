You'd be missing out on a lot of the back story as far as the description of the crew, ship, and local politics go, but I think you'd be okay. There are a few jokes that play directly off of "haha he was that way in the show lol" but not many. Hmm... Over all, I think you'd like it more if you'd seen at least one whole episode, but you'd probably still enjoy it without that. Plus I'm sure you've seen most of the Firefly/Serenity spoilers so you should be fine.

If you read it and really don't like it, you probably wouldn't like it anyway. If you read it, and kinda like it but are confused, watching the show and then reading it again would be best.
