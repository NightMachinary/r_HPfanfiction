For me, it'd probably be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9754483/1/Para-Bellum][Para Bellum]]. I really liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] so when Lord Silvere started a sequel I was looking forward to reading it. I was totally blindsided by how hilarious Para Bellum was. It's definitely not in the same style as Delenda Est, but it made me laugh quite a lot. The Black triplets are awesome.
