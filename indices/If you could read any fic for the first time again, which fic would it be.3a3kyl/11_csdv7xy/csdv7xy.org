Well, the fics I love the most even now are the Severus' Rose series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1901751/WrittenWord1][WrittenWord1]]. Years 1 through 7 are complete, but sadly the post-war sequel is unfinished and /appears/ to be abandoned (or at least on a very long hiatus)

Severitus(biological father Snape), fem!harry, eventual HP/FW pairing.
