There was 2 fics that spring to mind. Unfortunately I can no longer remember the titles of either.

One was a Harry/Tonks story, set from the end of 4th year through to the eventual defeat of Voldemort. It was following canon but in a way as if Harry and Tonks bonded a lot more during their time at Grimmauld Place together. Her initial rejection by Remus leads her to turn to Harry and they get closer and eventually (it's a slow build romance) they date.

The other story was a story set in I think it was Harry's 5th or 6th year and was an alternate to HBP.

EDIT: Found the latter one. It was called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1420986/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Phoenix-s-Flight][Harry Potter and the Phoenix's Flight.]]

I choose these over others because they were among the first fanfictions on Harry Potter I ever read and I still think they're quite good.
