try "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3415504/1/Prodigy][Prodigy]]" He has a serious drinking problem, I would explain the fic further but I think is better if you just read this for yourself.

"[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die][Gryffindors never die]]" is also a good one, it involves an alcoholic Harry and Ron going back in time to their 4th year.

They will be smuggling alcohol and generally fucking everything up.
