Partly - I mean he was a tag-along for the most part, a groupy in a way who hung out with the popular kids (James and Sirius!) and their "token smart-guy with a dark secret" (Remus) - that is also what probably made his betrayal easier! He wasn't really treated as a full member of the group! Otherwise he might really have died for them!

Still, fanfiction writers often exaggerate this (like Sirius and James know that Peter isn't trustworthy and thus he's marginalized which wasn't exactly true!)

ps: At least the few marauder-era fanfictions I've read have done this...it's not my favourite genre because we kind of already know what went down (the broad strokes/important parts: Pranksters, James was good at transfiguration, animagi, map, Lily is friends with Snape (till he calls her a mudblood), Lily marries James and Harry is born...Lily and James die, Harry survives, Sirius is locked up, Peter hides with the Weasleys and Remus (the fucking coward!) leaves to god knows where and Harry is tucked away at the Dursleys!), so it's not all that interesting IMHO!
