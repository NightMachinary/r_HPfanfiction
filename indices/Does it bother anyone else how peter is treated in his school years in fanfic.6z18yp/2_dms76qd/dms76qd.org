My personal characterization of Peter has him as an average wizard, who is friends with geniuses. A standard person who is surrounded by those who excel. He grows to like these people. These people who everything comes so easily to. He finds that they help him, they protect him. Sure they poke fun at him, but he does the same! Remember that one liner he told Sirius? Yea he got them good then!

But we see this naturally in relationships with males. Especially when one is less talented, and believe me, Pettigrew was /talented/. But compared to James, Sirius, and Remus? His star was weak. This wizard was competing with a Black, who grew up around magic and had a bone to pick with his family, a Potter who was a transfiguration prodigy, and a Werewolf who would eventually hold at least one mastery in a country where he shouldn't have even went to school. There is no way an average wizard is going to compare!

Peter grew to loath that... maybe not openly, but definitely it grew. Then Voldemort showed him favor. maybe he was left alive in a raid, maybe he was passed by, or captured and not tortured. All because Voldemort said that he was "the best" of his friends. Slowly that ate away at him, and he switched sides around the same time that Severus did.

The thing is, this characterization relies on something that the fanfiction portrayal does not show. In fanfiction, Peter is always the traitor! Always the filthy rat who would gladly sell them out to Voldemort and the teachers. But the fact is... that just isn't true. He would have died! He would have gladly died... until he realized that he didn't want to die for people who he felt didn't care for him as much as they cared for each other. At this point, James married Lily, Remus was away at the werewolf front, and Sirius and James never stopped being close. What happened to Peter? Who cared right? In comes Voldemort, who knows his Death Eaters by name, asks how their children are, and makes people matter.... at least in their minds. And he strokes that damaged ego, that broken confidence, and all it take is betraying people that already in Peter's mind, betrayed him.

That ^ would be a good Peter Pettigrew.
