I read the title and for a few solid seconds wondered who the fuck is Peter before having a "Oh..." moment. Guilty as charged, honestly I don't think it's far-fetched that he could have been the "tag-along guy". James clearly was an asshole as we already know and I assume Sirius was one too just in a more sarcastic and mocking way. Remus was the guy who didn't really like some of the things that were happening but never spoke out (Which happens a lot in real life anyway) with Peter kinda being there just to be there. There dynamic is actually pretty common, two people who do their own things. One who sometimes may disagree with some of those things but never says anything, and the one who is there but never really gets noticed.
