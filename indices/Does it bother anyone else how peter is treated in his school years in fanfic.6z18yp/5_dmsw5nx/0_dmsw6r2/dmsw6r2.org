  This story doesn't have a point. I just dislike how rats are portrayed. And Wormtail makes a convienient villain, but he was just as human as Snape, or anyone. I think he truly believed Voldemort was undefeatable. The bit about him asking for his friends lives to be spared is my headcanon, everything else is canon.
