My redemption fic was going to play on the idea that the more time you spend as an animagus, the more you take on their characteristics, so Peter becomes a fucking awesome pet to Percy because rats are fucking awesome pets. Think Scabbers biting Goyle, and now think of him defending Percy and seeking revenge. Especially on the twins.
