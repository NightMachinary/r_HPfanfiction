Not just fanfiction - I very much disliked how Sirius spoke about him in Snape's worst memory. Granted, he was overdoing it applauding James every time he caught it, but that's on James and Sirius just as much as it is on him. They were contemptuous of him - but he also clearly felt he needed to grovel to his 'best friends'.

None of them were nice boys. James started to grow up into a decent man, apparently, Remus did, Sirius never got the chance, Peter didn't, Severus didn't, but found redemption. Peter never did, but I think he had just as much potential for it as Snape. But I don't think canon or fanfiction do him justice.

Anyway, I wrote a sort of thing on Peter, Linkffn(The Rat by Brynmor) because I really hate how everyone calls him a typical dirty rat, when rats are amazing animals. That led me to believe that most of Peter's problem was how he saw himself. As a rat animagus, he could have been so awesome, and I want to write a redemption fic for him, but that's not what this ended up being. It's mostly canon, except the bit about him asking for his friends to be spared. That's my own personal belief.
