I'd honestly be a lot more sympathetic to Peter if he was actually treated the way he is in fanfiction in canon.

With friends like that, who needs enemies?

I think a lot of people underestimate him too. His character is pathetic but he's no slouch as a wizard and he probably got overlooked due to the natural charisma of the others. I honestly think the Marauders dynamic was centred around James and Sirius while Remus and Peter tagged along. Remus was immensely grateful despite this because of insecurities regarding his condition but Peter let his resentment fester. (I'm just as gifted as them! Why do they get all the attention? etc) And James and Sirius were too busy being James and Sirius to notice.
