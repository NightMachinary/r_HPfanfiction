You sound like Dumbledore. Have you thought about what that night would have been like for Nevil? Who already has CPTSD, for sure. Anybody with a wand and not afraid to use it is in a position of power. Next time you want to go on a date with somebody I don't like, I will come over and tie you up so you can't go and leave you in a less than safe position. Do you get how wrong this is?
