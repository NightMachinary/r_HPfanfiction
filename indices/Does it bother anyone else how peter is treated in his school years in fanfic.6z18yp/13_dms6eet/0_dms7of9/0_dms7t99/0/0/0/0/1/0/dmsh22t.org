I'm trying to stay vulnerable and with you here, but I have to admit as somebody who does have Cptsd, I can't. It feels like we are in a victims race to bottom. You sound a little triggered and I will admit that reading your messages triggered me. So, sorry. Hope you have a good day. Take care of yourself, cuz life is too hard on everybody to fight over stuff like this.
