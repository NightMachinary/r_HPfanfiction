The only thing you've shown here is that you are incapable of looking at the exact circumstances because it is easier for you to decide that the characters must have been oh-so-damn evil.

Even if what they did was wrong, it is a justifiable action because given what they knew they simply could not have known that they didn't need to go out and /protect/ something. They acted in good will, and when he tried to stop them for the sake of stopping them, which was not intrinsically bad but which means that their need to act outweighed his need to stop them, they stopped him from doing it with as little harm as they could have caused. And no, his alleged PTSD or whatever (doubtful he had that, for all we know he just had massive problems with self-confidence) does not mean they automatically became the worst people ever when they used probably the only spell they knew that could stop him without causing him harm because stunners are an upper-year thing.

So, yes, the fact that you compared this situation to /you/ deciding that you have the authority to fuck up someone's life on a whim with no real justification of why that would be necessary is /very bad/. But that's about you, not about the situation in the books.
