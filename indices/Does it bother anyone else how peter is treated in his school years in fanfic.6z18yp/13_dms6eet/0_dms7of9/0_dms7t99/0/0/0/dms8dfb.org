If anything it was bullying, not abuse. Abuse needs the assailant to be in a position of power / authority that he - hence the word - can abuse. And I'm not gonna say that it would've been okay as some sort of schoolyard "prank". However, in the situation, they assumed that without them going out there, someone would steal the Philosopher Stone. Its not like they did that for no reason whatsoever, at least in their *11 year old* minds.
