Everyone in the common room was laughing, except for Hermione, who immediately ran forward to perform the counter curse. Is that the part you're talking about? Yeah, it's a little asshole-ish for the kids to all be laughing at him, but from my experience, lots of kids laugh at the misfortune of others.

When they froze him when leaving the common room to protect the Philosopher's Stone, none of them were laughing. It seems like you combined the two situations.
