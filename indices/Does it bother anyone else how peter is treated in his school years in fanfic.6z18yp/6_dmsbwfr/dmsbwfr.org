I don't read a lot of past-era fanfics, and the things I do read generally don't portray him as an already irredeemable arsehole, so I haven't experienced this issue personally, /but/ I get where you are coming from, having stuff like that happen seems bad.

That said, I don't really get why people do that kind of thing. I mean, I do get the “catharsis via putting a character you don't like down” thing, but I find having the characters be portrayed as humans, flawed as humans are, and yet choosing the better thing that we've already seen them choose, to be much more cathartic and in a way better way.

Case in point, “Coexistence” manages to give us a flawed Peter who manages, for whatever reason, to choose differently, and it just gives you the fuzzies; the same about Severus in the same story. And then you have “Last Chance” which gives you a /Tom of all people/ who struggles, really struggles through his flaws and the darkness that he has, to do the right thing, sometimes succeeds and sometimes fails but /he tries/ and that is incredible to read about.
