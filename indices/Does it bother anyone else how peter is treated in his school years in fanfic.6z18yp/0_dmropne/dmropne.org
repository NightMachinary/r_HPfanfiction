Yeah, actually, it really does.

That's the thing - there are definitely some uncomfortable dynamics going on in the Marauders, I have no doubt. James and Sirius were "like brothers", and plainly had a very close relationship in school, even more so than their relationships with Remus and Peter.

But Peter...

Look. Peter Pettigrew, just like the other three, became an Animagus as a teenager. We see him performing some relatively powerful feats, like travelling out to the middle of Albania and somehow tracking down Lord Voldemort, acting as Voldemort's (perhaps not ideal) right hand, but we even see some non-verbal magic from him in Deathly Hallows, just before he dies.

Now, people sort of brush him off as being a weak wizard and useless compared to the other three, including McGonagall and Rosmerta, but we also have some evidence that kind of conflicts with that - what I'd /guess/ is that Pettigrew has a lot of, for lack of a better word, performance anxiety. He's obviously an extremely nervous man, and I imagine that was actually way worse back in school, so the support from the Marauders probably helped him a lot.

Which means they must have supported him.

Now, don't get me wrong - I definitely feel like if there wasn't another target to play with, Sirius and James would likely pick Peter as the butt of their main jokes, because despite his lycanthropy, Remus is described as tall and charming and humorous, whereas Peter is fat and bumbling and ugly... But they were still close friends.

People more interested in the Marauders have analysed this better than me, but James probably insisted on keeping Peter and Remus around: I'd take it from the analysis that he was very arrogant, but also quite concerned with the /nobless oblige/ of his position; Sirius, on the other hand, was a lot more impulsive, and a little bit more cruel.

But Peter was one of them. Yes, he was the weakest of the four, but that probably means that the three of them were just more protective over him, and G-d help the guy that chooses to pick on Peter from /outside/ of the Marauders, because he's within the "pack", you know?

It's a shame that people throw Peter aside, but it's hard to think of him as being a friend to the people he betrayed, you know? Peter is actually my favourite of the four of them, but I don't like that era much, so I never write for them.

Alas.
