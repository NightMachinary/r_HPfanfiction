peter pettigrew is evil- that doesn't make him not also a loser and a coward, because his actions were done out of preservation and fear for his life, and unenthusiastically. as opposed to say, a belief in voldemort's cause and person, or vague personal advancement. he's sad that he's sacrificing james, but selfish and cowardly enough to still go through with it. the threat he was under would be his own perceived sense of voldemort's power. we know his motivation because it's the only one provided or suggested in the books themselves, and explicitly confirmed by jkr
