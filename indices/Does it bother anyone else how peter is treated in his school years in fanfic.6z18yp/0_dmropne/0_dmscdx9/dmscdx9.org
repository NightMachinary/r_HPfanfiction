What really gets me is when Peter is described as /cowardly/. He's certainly a very anxious person, but he wasn't sorted into Gryffindor just because the Hat thought it'd be a funny joke. I think he's more like Neville than anyone---typically overlooked and unwilling to speak up, but more likely to show his bravery through action.

The difference is, Peter is much closer to the other Marauders than Neville is to Harry's group. Neville is acknowledged as a good sort, but Peter is close enough to James and Sirius that he becomes an Animagus with them.

That isn't even a "whole group" kind of thing, since Remus /doesn't/ become an Animagus---iirc, they thought Remus would have disapproved, and kept it from him until they'd achieved it already. Peter is canonically no more on the "outside" of the group than Remus is... and it's not unusual for two really close friends, or brothers, to be part of a larger group of friends. It doesn't mean they like their other friends any less.

And even if Peter isn't remembered as being /particularly/ gifted, he's no slouch at magic. Sure, James and Sirius were the popular kids, and Remus was enough of a teacher's pet that he was made prefect, but /all four of them/ were the Marauders. And again, Peter was /also/ an incredibly young unregistered Animagus.

It's more than that, though---do you /really/ think the Dark Lord would have taken some weakling for a servant? The man was a huge snob. He didn't mind weak /sycophants/, but all of his most trusted Death Eaters are terrifying. And there's no question that the Dark Lord trusts Peter. Peter's "betrayal" would have made a great trap if it'd been Dumbledore waiting instead of the unsuspecting and totally unprepared Potters, and Peter was to all appearances loyal to the Order, but the Dark Lord trusts him enough to go, alone. It... actually does lead to the Dark Lord's temporary demise... but he /still/ trusts Peter years after the fact, since we see that Peter (somehow) has guardianship over his creepy-withered-baby form.

Which brings me to the point that I think people /really/ miss: Peter Pettigrew is /evil/. It's something that a lot of fanfiction ignores or undermines by making him into some bullied loser. Peter Pettigrew is not a coward. Peter Pettigrew told the Dark Lord about the Potters, even though he was under /absolutely no threat to do so/, since nobody---not even Dumbledore, apparently---knew that he was the Secret Keeper. Peter Pettigrew became the Dark Lord's /most trusted servant/. He's the Servant that /prophecies/ and /rituals/ call for. Consider, in /Prisoner of Azkaban/:

  /The Dark Lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned by his followers. His servant has been chained these twelve years. Tonight, before midnight, the servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master. The Dark Lord will rise again with his servant's aid, greater and more terrible than ever before. Tonight... before midnight... the servant... will set out... to rejoin... his master.../

This is /not/ some half-assed "I was conned into it" kind of service. Peter Pettigrew has gone fully to the Dark Side, and there's no "Luke I am your father" last-minute redemption for him. It's only through the efforts of Peter Pettigrew that the Dark Lord rose again! In GoF, the "/Flesh -- of the servant -- w-willingly -- given/" is a crucial part of the ritual. Barty Crouch might have sent Harry along, but Crouch was more than half-mad already, and /he/ didn't cut off any flesh. Peter Pettigrew /wanted/ the resurrection of the Dark Lord so badly that /he cut off his own hand/. He wasn't tricked into it. There were plenty of other Death Eaters still around. Peter Pettigrew was just the only one brave and powerful enough to act. Peter Pettigrew was evil.
