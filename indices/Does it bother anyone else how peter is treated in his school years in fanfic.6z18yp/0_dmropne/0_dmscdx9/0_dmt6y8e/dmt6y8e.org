See, I find it so interesting to think about Peter's actual motivations when it comes to Voldemort - so like you said, you can totally view it as feeling very unappreciated and like he's the least valuable of his friends, so why not betray them and go to where he is valued instead?

But I often see him viewing it as an eventuality - like, when Peter's talking to Remus and Sirius in the Shrieking Shack, he's talking very quickly and trying to explain himself, saying, "You don't know..." to the two of them... And they're like, yeah, we do know, you monster.

I feel like Peter genuinely saw it as an eventuality.

If you're viewing it as a straight fact that Voldemort is going to win the war and that Voldemort is going to kill all of your friends... Doesn't it make sense to betray them? On the one hand, he can kill all of you; on the other hand, he can kill everyone else, but you survive! It's only logical!

And I think that if you look at Peter, who is obviously very, very anxious and paranoid and jumpy, and is very much a rat willing to jump ship when he sees a few drops of water...

From his point of view, he was probably only doing what made sense.

Which in many ways, I think, is more evil than simply feeling unwanted: in this scenario, he /does/ feel wanted and does love his friends, but feels it's pointless to try to fight for them.
