Or they just let him tag along (which is also a - minor - confidence boost if you are insecure but are allowed to hang out with the popular and smart people!)

As for "but of their jokes" - not to mention that Sirius and James probably kind of felt sorry for Remus (so they wouldn't mock him!) and he probably checked their homework, too (like Hermione does for Harry and Ron)

Yeah, nobless oblige describes James - he'd let you feel that he thought you were lucky to be allowed around him, but he wouldn't go out of his way to mock you either (unless you are like Snape (Slytherin, knowledgeable in dark magic and close to Lily Evans!)) and he'd help you if he saw you were treated unfairly or needed help (I am sure he helped the lower years if they asked for his help)

Hm...would they protect him? Good question, I'd say Remus would and James probably as well, but Sirius? I don't know (young Sirius probably is/was even more selfish and arrogant than James...especially since he felt superior to his own family, who he kind of saw as a lost cause!)
