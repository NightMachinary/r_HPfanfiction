Did you know that technically Cerberus is actually named Spot? At least, it's a theory.

Basically the theory is that his name comes from a Sanskrit word meaning 'spotted'.

There's another theory that it comes from something else(I can't remember what right now, give me a bit to find it in my notes) that means something like 'to growl' so you could take it as meaning 'dog' or some other animal that growls.

I'm sorry, I just get really excited about this.
