I would disagree on your assertions of the tales differencing from men and women.

I would wager they differ based on locations, locations that had a strong athena bias would belive in the version that made athena looked good.

and places where posiden was more popular would make her look like a crazy nutter.

Places where hades was disliked, he was a terrible person who kidnapped poor persephone.

Places where hades was liked, demeter was an over bearing mother and persphone had eloped with hades.
