I disagree. 'According to Ovid, Medusa was once a beautiful young maiden, the only mortal of three sisters known as the Gorgons. Her beauty caught the eye of the sea god Poseidon, who proceeded to rape her in the sacred temple of Athena.' So according to Ovid(a poetic from circa 48BC to 17AD) she was raped. Hesiodos(another poetic, this time active from around 1750 BC or maybe 650 BC), however, disagrees with this and states that whatever happened between the two of them was perfectly and completely consensual. Although he is generally attributed to having one of the only surviving records of the myth in which Medusa was neither cursed by Athena nor raped by Poseidon. I could find more, but as I stated below, it's 2-fucking-am and I need sleep. Good-bloody-night. Also, power is of no importance. They are both gods(Hell, they're bloody Olympians), irregardless of power level. There are several stories in which a 'lesser' god punishes a more powerful one. I can't find any at this moment, but it's like 2am so I can't fault myself on that.
