Here! Also, as for the power play, I remember a time in a myth or something where she attacks two other Olympians. I don't remember who, though...

So as for her reasons, there are quite a few. I'll bullet point my favorites below.

- To humiliation him. Whichever version of the myth you're talking about, it would've been humiliating for Poseidon to have been with someone who is now a hideous monster.
- Because she was wise. She can't outright attack him because A) it would've been bad for her because it would anger Zeus and B) It would most likely start a war which would be shitty for the mortals. As such, she goes the passive aggressive route.

As for my least favorite, there's one where it's just because she was biased. I disagree with this, myths have changed a lot as they were handed down(mainly orally) and so when at the trial she stood up and pronounced that she was a champion of men and not women as she was born from Zeus and Zeus alone(technically), I think it might've been something different but still *shrug*

There are different versions of the myth. It's hard to find exact examples because nowadays people love to focus more on the whole she-was-raped version because, you know, /rape/. But there are. There are versions where it's consensual and their are versions where it's not. There are versions where she was born a gorgon and their versions where /she has fucking donkey legs/. Point: There are different versions. Fucking deal with it.
