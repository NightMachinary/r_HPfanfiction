I never denied there was sexism in the old myths so that is putting words in my mouth.

I merely disagreed with your version that they where the male and female versions of said myths.

merely that the various myths changed based on what gods the towns recording the myths favored.

a town that favoured posiden would have a version of events that favoured him. and a town that worshiped athena would have a version where she is the good guy.
