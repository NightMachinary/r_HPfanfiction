Well I still stick with the men/women; we'll just have to agree to disagree. The Iliad and The Odyssey definitely have misogyny and sexism in them. One example: Penelope leaves her room to approach the assorted suitors who more or less occupy her mansion, waiting for her to give up on long-lost Odysseus and marry one of them. When she requests they stop singing such songs, she is met with resistance from the youngest male there: Her adolescent son, Telemachus, chastises her. Return to your room, he tells her; public speaking is for men. Well either way, you cannot deny that the most popular myths have sexism and misogyny in them. Hell, Hercules was a fucking rapist and he's still praised. I have more points to argue my point, but it's 6 passed 12:30am right now. Not meant to anger, but you seem to be coming across as if you believe their is no misogyny in the Greek Myths(and other culture's myths, I reckon, but I can't really speak on that. I study Greek Mythology).
