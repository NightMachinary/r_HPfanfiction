An important thing to remember is that the majority of these myths were made up by men and told by men. The women's versions are rather different in quite a few aspects and much more interesting to read. For example, in the tale told by women, Poseidon was raping poor Medusa(who was a priestess of Athena) in Athena's temple and because she was a goddess and technically a women and couldn't do much to help her, Athena decided to curse her so she could protect herself and no one would ever hurt her like that again.

In the one told by men, they(Poseidon and Medusa, obviously) were having consensual sex in Athena's temple(by the way, any sex whether consensual or not was a big no-no to do in temple's as they were sacred places) and a jealous and spiteful Athena cursed Medusa so neither Poseidon or any man would ever come near her again.

Of course, it all ended up backfiring but still.
