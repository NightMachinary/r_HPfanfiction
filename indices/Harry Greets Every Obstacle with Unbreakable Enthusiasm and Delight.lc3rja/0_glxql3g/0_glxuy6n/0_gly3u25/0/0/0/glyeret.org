It's been a hot sec since I've studied Greek Myth; I had to drop both that and Latin as they we're eating up too much of my time. But I think it's both. She's the goddess of spring growth separately, but shares the domain of agriculture and all that. She's also called Kore, fun fact.

                                                                                                            So the myth is basically that she spends the months of what we now call Winter in the Underworld. I've heard meany reasons why for this; the most popular being that, when Hades abducted her -which is a whole nother conversation, btw- she saw a promergranic and couldn't stop herself from eating the gorgeous fruit. She only ate about half before something or someone stopped her. The fruit made her stay in the Underworld indefinitely. As for why she spent the months of what we now call Spring above on Earth, there are about two different versions of the story that I remember, although I reckon there are more somewhere. One is that Dementor begged Zeus(her younger brother) to do something and get her daughter back. Zeus agrees(acquiescence but still, he agrees) and makes a deal that Persephone spend Spring up above making the flowers bloom and the plants and crops thrive, but she will spend everything else in the Underworld and Demeter's grief will wither the flowers and damage the crops. Another myth has Persephone and Hades making a deal so she can be with her mother and still belong to him and the Underworld because of the fruit.
