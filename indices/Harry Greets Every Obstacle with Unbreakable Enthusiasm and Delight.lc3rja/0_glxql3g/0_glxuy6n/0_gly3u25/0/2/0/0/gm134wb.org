Never watched that show ðŸ˜… But yeah I always think of harry dresden, the main character in dresden files as a magic welding sherlock holmes with a wise ass personality and a lot of adult humor lol

Edit: the characters are all well built too. The main charector isn't infallible, has his limits, and does get outplayed sometimes. And every book in the series builds on the previous books, so while every book has its own plot so to say, they ALL tie into one giant over arch that's leading up to what Jim butcher, the author, describes as 'the big apoplectic trilogy'

There is currently 17 books out, but books 16 and 17 are really the same book split into two pieces
