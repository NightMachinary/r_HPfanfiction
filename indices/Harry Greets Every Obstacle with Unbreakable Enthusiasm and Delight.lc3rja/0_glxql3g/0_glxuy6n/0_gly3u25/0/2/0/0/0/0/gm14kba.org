I have a feeling you will really like the series. Each book just gets better and better and the author loves to torture his MC, and he's very deffinetly not afraid of killing off characters to make his MC evolve. The last two books 16 and 17 had one such event where I was like 'damn...' after reading it. Someone got killed off and shit almost hit the fan because of it (well shit almost hit the fan while shit was ALREADY hitting the fan of that makes sense lmao)
