Dude you should. Imagine the most realistic representation of mystical arts you can find (based on laws of physics etc), very interesting plot containing realistic fairies, 3 different types of vampires, angels, fallen angels, all wrapped up with a main charector who is essentially a magic welding sherlock holmes with a VERY wise ass personality. I fucking love the series
