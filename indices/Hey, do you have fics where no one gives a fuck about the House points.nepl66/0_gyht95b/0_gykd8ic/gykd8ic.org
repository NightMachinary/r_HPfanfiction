In my experience, people did care about house points all the way to age 18.

It's not about the silverware/winning. In the years you won, you celebrated for about 5 minutes before you got on with the business of celebrating the end of term.

Rather, people valued house points/the house cup because they were proud of their achievements and the house cup is a way of recognising those achievements. If you won the inter-house rugby, you were proud of that. If you'd performed a piano recital, you were proud of that. And so on. The house cup is innately tied in with what you've done to earn it, and gains value because all those endeavours have value. Even when you did not win the cup, you still fondly remembered the points you had earned. Even now, almost 20 years later, I still get satisfaction out of the commendation I got from the Headmaster for a particularly good performance in a rugby game against another school.
