That reminds me of a crackfic I read once. In it, Harry gets told something like "may your coffers be ever full" by a goblin and, having no idea how to respond to /that/, comes up with "may your enemies shit their pants when they hear your name".

Surprisingly (or perhaps not), the goblin liked this response.
