I really enjoyed The Dragonmasters by Naia, linkffn(979216) was one of my favorites. A fairly original dragon rider series (as far as I can tell) with bits and pieces I recognized from others (Pern, Eragon, etc.).

Definitely and oldie, but still good.

Another good one is linkffn(The Queen who Fell to Earth by Bobmin365) and it's sequel, which unfortunately will never be finished since Bobmin passed away. But Queen and it's sequel are definitely still worth a read. Based on Pern lore and some background, but not required reading (I haven't read much of the Dragons of Pern myself, but on my list).

EDIT: Bot got it wrong. Updating the link to Dragonmasters.
