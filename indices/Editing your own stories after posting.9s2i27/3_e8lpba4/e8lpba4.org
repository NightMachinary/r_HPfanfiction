I'd prefer it if you leave the whole thing out there, edit privately, and put out the whole thing with a small author's note that it was updated on xyz date.

Obviously, if you are just fixing misspellings or whatever, that's nothing, but a 20% increase that is stealth /unannounced would drive me bonkers.
