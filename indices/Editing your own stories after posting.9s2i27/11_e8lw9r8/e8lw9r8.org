It's your work, do what you want with it.

I've seen this tackled a few different ways that I liked as a reader:

1) when adding a new chapter, the author included a /short/ note that changes or corrections were made in XYZ chapters (this is for ongoing stories that might be mostly done on paper but not on the website)

2) when an author was making major changes, they started a new copy of the story and left the old one up while doing revisions, then when done they took down the old one. (drawback to this is if you're big on review/fav numbers, but to be fair, those favs and reviews were for the old version anyway)

I personally don't like starting a /complete/ story then halfway through see a note from the author that they're actually rewriting chapter by chapter so the point I've gotten to might not actually mesh fully with the rest of the story that hasn't been rewritten.
