It depends on how it's done.

​

I collect Harry potter fanfics, and I think I must have like three versions of some stories, some don't change much, while others change quite a lot.

​

Harry Potter and The New Life, Harry Potter and the Second Life, and Harry Potter and the Wand of Uru.

​

I think the last two were taken over by someone else, and even they couldn't finish it, which is a shame because there are quite alot of good stories that end up abandoned...
