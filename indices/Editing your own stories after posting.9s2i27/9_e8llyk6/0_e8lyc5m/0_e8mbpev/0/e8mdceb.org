I know what you mean. I turned a humorous one-shot in a fluffy murder-mystery with only a few tweaks and it came back to bite me. Admittedly, a wall of exposition was bad for a one-shot but it was entirely unnecessary for the longer story since most of it was touched upon later on anyway. I simply deleted the whole part while working on a proper rewrite of the first chapter.
