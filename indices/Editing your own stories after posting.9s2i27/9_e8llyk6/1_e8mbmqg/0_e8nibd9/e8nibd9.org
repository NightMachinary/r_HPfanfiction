That is true. But then again, terrible stories with good premises have been known to, ah, 'inspire' good stories with similar ones. One writer goes 'I will write my own story with nobility titles and money and bashing... You know what, forget the story!' And then another writer comes along, tears their hair out at the badness and then writes a much better version. And so the fandom evolves, frustrated author by frustrated author.
