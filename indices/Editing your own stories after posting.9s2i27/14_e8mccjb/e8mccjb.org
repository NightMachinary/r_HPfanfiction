My personal experience with this was, I had published 10-11 chapters of my story before meeting my editor, so I had edited them all myself. We decided to leave them up, but go through them all and edit again, then switch the new versions in once they were ready. Some drastic changes were made, mainly in terms of chapter breaks and structure, so anything I did add or remove would have little or no bearing on the future of the story.
