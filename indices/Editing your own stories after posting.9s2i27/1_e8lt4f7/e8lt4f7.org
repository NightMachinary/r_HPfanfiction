You have a right to do pretty much anything you want with your story (besides selling it), but I think there are best practices for this kind of thing.

For minor edits like fixing typos, go ahead and do it. No problem. People might not even notice, but future readers will have a better reading experience.

If there's a problem with a specific chapter, I'd say yes, go back and fix it. I've done that a few times when I made a serious mistake. In that case, I think it's good etiquette to put a note at the top of the chapter to say that you made changes. This will inform repeat readers to look out for things being different. If it's a recent chapter, I think it's also good etiquette to make a note of it on the next new chapter so that your followers can go back and see the changes.

Now, if you have already /finished/ the edits to your story, I would say go ahead and post it. It's almost certainly going to be better, after all. I would lean toward replacing your old story. Don't take it down, but just replace the chapters, and put a note on the first chapter that you've done edits. Posting it as a new story is also acceptable, though.

However, if you're thinking about /starting/ a full edit of a story, I would say that's a /bad/ idea in general because even very prolific writers almost always fail to finish a full edit. If you tell your readers you're going to do a full edit, they're going to assume the story is dead.

And either way, I think it's bad etiquette to take the original story down. You can if you want, but people who followed or favorited it are only going to see it missing and not know why. Because of that, it's better to leave it up while you replace the chapters or post a new version.
