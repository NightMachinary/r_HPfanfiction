My take:

You are completely free to edit your story at any time for any reason and you owe nobody anything.

You can take your stories down, do wholesale rewrites, edit a few lines in situ, fix a comma fault, whatever. You have no obligation to tell anyone anything if you do change stuff, no need to put a "Hey, I'm rewriting for reasons [stating reasons]" or whatever. It's your creation and you alone control how it's viewed by the world (provide you meet the terms and services of the medium on which you're publishing, blah, blah).
