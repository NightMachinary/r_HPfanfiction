I don't believe there are ethical implications to keeping up fanfiction or not; you may disagree, but I think it's far too trivial a matter to seriously apply the principles of utility to. Nevertheless, I'll try to respond to the point. When talking about happiness, are we talking about Bentham's pleasure-pain principle? Or are we talking about Mill's higher and lower pleasures? If the first, is this not a grotesque slap to the face of individual rights; couldn't we justify practically anything that could damage an individual from the most simple to the most heinous by using weasel words to say it might bring pleasure to society at large? And if the second, who's to say whether the fanfiction is a higher or lower pleasure, or if it's even a pleasure at all? Mill himself said it was better to be Socrates, dissatisfied, than a satisfied fool. They may be dissatisfied and distressed, but if it is a poor pleasure, it's not worth bemoaning the loss of.
