You will, I hope, forgive me for being somewhat unclear; it's the first time I've seriously debated philosophy in quite a while. What I mean to say is that there is no practical way to objectively determine whether fanfiction is a higher or lower pleasure. I could say that it is not a higher pleasure because it's not intellectual, in that the vast, vast majority of fanfics are mental rot. I could find a great deal of people within the community that would likely agree with me on that. You may argue that it is a higher pleasure because it requires the mental stimulation of reading, which is inherently an intellectual act. And you could find a great deal of people who agree with you.

The question becomes, which one us is right? According to preference utilitarianism (as far as I recall, of course), it's whichever of us has the greater number of proponents. If I am right, fanfiction is not a higher utility and the dissatisfaction of people in regards to it being deleted is negligible. If you are right, fanfiction is a higher pleasure and is worth keeping up.

However, now I can ask those very same people if every fanfiction is equally as high in utility as every other one. Take something like The Real Us, a fic that quite a lot of people despise for a plethora of reasons. It's very possible that after getting a population to read a few chapters, the majority might agree that it isn't helping overall society, but rather harming it. And say the author themselves came out and said the fic was harmful and they wanted to delete it. But, according to a post you made elsewhere, those people's opinions wouldn't matter because others (even if they're fewer in number) are benefiting from it. Now, despite the fact that the majority population and the creator have decided that this is a harmful pleasure, leading people to become "satisfied fools", you argue that it would still be morally wrong to delete this fic because a fewer number of people have had increased utility due to the fic. This is, of course, contradictory to the general rule of utilitarianism: the greatest good for the greatest number. It is essentially a perversion of the philosophy so that the artist can never be in the right when in regards to controlling or destroying their creation, and declaring that it is somehow an axiomatic moral good that they follow the unwinnable rules of your rigged game.

I hope that makes some sense.
