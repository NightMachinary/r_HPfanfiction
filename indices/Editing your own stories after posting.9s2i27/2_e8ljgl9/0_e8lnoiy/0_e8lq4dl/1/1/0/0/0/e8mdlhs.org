The way I look at it, fanfiction is a type of literature, and literature a type of art, and by definition art is a higher and not lower pleasure.

As for your argument as to how my axiom violates "greater good" morality, I think a key point of my argument you're missing is that aside from very few fringe cases, it's not people who want fics deleted and people who want to keep them: it's people who want to keem them and people who are indifferent to their existence. "Keeping them around" is a good to one of the groups and neutral to the other; "deleting them" is an evil to one of the groups and neutral to the other.

If a fanfiction story is found to be harmful (and I think few would be) then it could be argued that it needs to have a warning added at the beginning or something like that, but to remove it on this basis would be censorship.

And if it's bad, as I said elsewhere on this thread, "don't like don't read". The people who don't find it pleasant to read can just go read something else.
