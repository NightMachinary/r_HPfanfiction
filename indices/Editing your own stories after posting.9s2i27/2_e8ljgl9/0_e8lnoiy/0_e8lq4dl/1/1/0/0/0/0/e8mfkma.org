  As for your argument as to how my axiom violates "greater good" morality, I think a key point of my argument you're missing is that aside from very few fringe cases, it's not people who want fics deleted and people who want to keep them: it's people who want to keem them and people who are indifferent to their existence. "Keeping them around" is a good to one of the groups and neutral to the other; "deleting them" is an evil to one of the groups and neutral to the other.

Fair enough, I see where you're coming from here. Nevertheless, you'll have to forgive me for being unable to agree with this, because I legitimately cannot stomach the idea of an ethical philosophy that's so actively hostile to artists being "Good" in any sense of the word. Maybe I'm biased by the fact that I write myself, but the idea that I have a moral obligation to bow and scrape to a faceless mob that have done nothing but read some words I've written is honestly stomach-churning. However, while I might not agree with your viewpoint, I understand that ethics is never an easy subject, and I think I understand and ultimately respect your views in an intellectual sense. Thanks for indulging me.
