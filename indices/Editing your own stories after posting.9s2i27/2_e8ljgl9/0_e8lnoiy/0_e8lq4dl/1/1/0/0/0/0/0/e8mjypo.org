Same. (Oh, it's so very nice to have an Internet debate where both sides greatly respect each other's opinion, for once.)

Note that I am a writer myself, and live by my words. My first story was, in hindsight, a complete mess riddled with plot-holes and just plain bad ideas; but I got several reviews, even recently, from people who read and enjoyed it; and for their sake I keep it around, albeit with a note at the beginning stating "/If like me you begin to read this and think it's bad... I agree, why don't you check out some of my newer stuff instead?/"
