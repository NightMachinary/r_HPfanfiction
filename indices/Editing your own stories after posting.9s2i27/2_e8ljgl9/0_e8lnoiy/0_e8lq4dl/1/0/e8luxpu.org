Practically speaking, it's a hard call to make in most instances.

As a case in point, take my most popular story on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]], one I that haven't reread in nearly a decade so I'm working off fuzzy memory as to what's actually in it. It was my rookie novel, one that I recognize now has so many glaring flaws that I could spend a half dozen posts enumerating them all. I get equal parts scathing and glowing reviews from readers. It's continually cited on "this is a horrible story, the worst scene of which has resonated with me for negative reasons for years" lists as well as on, "This is an example of high-quality writing in the fandom" lists.

So what's the verdict? Is it good? Bad? Both? Neither?

Suppose that I am a far better and, by objective measures, successful writer than I was ten years ago and writing fiction is just a side hobby for me at any rate, not something I need for personal validation, so I don't need this story to stay up for my own ego. From a purely utilitarian standpoint, is it your sense that I should pull the story from the site, as I've considered several times over the years, or do I have a "duty" to readers to leave it up? I'd propose that the answer is ambiguous at best and that utilitarian arguments are, like in most cases, hard to make in any convincing way.

Same with most fanfiction, so I say burn your babies if you wish to.
