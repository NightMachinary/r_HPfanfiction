In this case, I would say that it doesn't matter much how many negative reviews you get as long as you also get several positive ones. People who dislike your story aren't going to be distressed by its continued existence --- "don't like don't read" is a principle that's so simple it's their own bloody fault if they miss it. Whereas people who like it /will/ be unhappy if it goes away.
