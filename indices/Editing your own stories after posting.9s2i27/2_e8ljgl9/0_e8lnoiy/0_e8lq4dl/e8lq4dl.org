Upvoted for honesty, but hard disagree here. I think that it's probably /preferable/ if you leave the fic accessible in some fashion, but I disagree that writers have a /duty/ to leave it up. To be very blunt, who cares if people are distressed when they can't find the fic? They didn't put any work into it: they didn't spend countless hours writing it, they didn't spend even more editing it. They have no say, relevance, or bearing on whether a fic should be kept up or taken down, because all they did was read it. You think it's loathsome that artists think they can burn their own creation? I think it's absolutely loathsome that readers can be so entitled to think that they are owed anything at all from nonprofit writers.
