I think the author has every right to do what he wants with his story.

But with how much is lost each day by accident as the internet goes on I think it sad if authors takes down a story. Whatever you have to say about the story it is still part of our culture and worth preserving as testament of our time.

Do I read fictions from 2000? No usually I don't. But being able to would is an amazing thing. It shows us how far we have come since then. And one time in the future fanfics will be a part of history and will have an impact on our culture.
