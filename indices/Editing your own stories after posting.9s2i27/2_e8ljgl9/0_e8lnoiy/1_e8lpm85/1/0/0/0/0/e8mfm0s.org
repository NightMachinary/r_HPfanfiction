I don't think whether you make people pay for it makes a difference between one piece of art and another. The nature of art is that you take an idea or set of ideas, and then transmit it to other people.

And there is /still/ a difference between showing it to one person you know and trust, and put it up on the Internet where literally anyone (even people whose existence you don't even suspect) may see it.
