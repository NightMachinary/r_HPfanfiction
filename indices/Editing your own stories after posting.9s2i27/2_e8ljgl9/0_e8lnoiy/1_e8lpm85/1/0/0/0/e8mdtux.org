But it isn't! It's still something totally personal that you made up, then decided to show to someone else totally for free and spontaneously! The only difference is HOW you showed it to them. But that shouldn't make a difference either, whether it's written down, on a word document, or just a photograph you took of the paper. :( I do not agree Achille and I don't understand really how you do think that. No matter how it's shown to someone, it doesn't mean someone is owed anything. Full control is always with the maker.
