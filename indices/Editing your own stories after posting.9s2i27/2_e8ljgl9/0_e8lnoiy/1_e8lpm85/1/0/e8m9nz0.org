So if I scribble out a drawing on a piece of paper and show it ONCE to my sister, then I give up all rights to crumple it up or put it in a drawer somewhere? And I would just HAVE TO keep it up, because someone saw it? Achille no! Personal creations are personal creations, and nobody else gets any say in what you do with it. Especially not just because you showed it to someone once! That's just weird and stupid.

Fanfictions are not payed contract gallery or publicized things, they're just things we all scribble down and then show to other people BECAUSE WE WANT TO. Informally and randomly. Nobody we show it to is OWED us keeping it available to them, or showing it to them again. Nobody is owed anything out of it. That's arrogant and entitled and stupid.

:( It's very sad to know now though that if I deleted my fanfic.net account and my stories there that you'd be really mad at me just for doing it.
