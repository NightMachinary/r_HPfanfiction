I disagree, because I'm not seeing this through a legal lens, but a moral one. /Since/ these are all moral matters, you have every right to have a different opinion --- but whether the art was sold doesn't make a lick of difference to /me/. Once someone else has seen a work of art, it's simply no longer "the artist's prerogative" to conceal or destroy it.
