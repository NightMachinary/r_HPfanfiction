  Once it's sold, once it's the property of another, she has no other rights to her creation save for the right to cash a check and go make more art. Until then, she can burn it all down in a bacchanal bonfire, dancing naked before the flickering flames, bedding any and all who would come celebrate the demise of her works, and it's totally within her rights to do so.
