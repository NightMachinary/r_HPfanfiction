There's a distinction here that you're not drawing with your example.

Fanfiction is unsold art. It's the equivalent of a canvas in a closet among a stack of other canvases and velvet Elvises. It may have been shown in a gallery some time back, perhaps now it's sitting in a restaurant with a consignment sticker on it, waiting to be sold, but it isn't yet. And, likely, never will be.

If the author thinks she can add a brush stroke here or there to improve the piece, or if she thinks, "This isn't my look anymore, let me take it down," it's her prerogative to do so. This is the thing with unsold art. It's the artist's and she owes nothing to the world.

Once it's sold, once it's the property of another, she has no other rights to her creation save for the right to cash a check and go make more art. Until then, she can burn it all down in a bacchanal bonfire, dancing naked before the flickering flames, bedding any and all who would come celebrate the demise of her works, and it's totally within her rights to do so.

Same with fanfiction, friend.
