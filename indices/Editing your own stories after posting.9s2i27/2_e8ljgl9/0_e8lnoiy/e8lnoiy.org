I couldn't disagree more. Once a piece of artwork has been revealed to the public, I think you have a duty to leave it available to them in some fashion. If you want, you can take it off your ffnet profile and, say, post it as a text file on the Internet Archive, or something.

But I loathe artists thinking they can go and burn their own creations even when there are already people in the world who may be distressed not to find them if they go looking for them again.
