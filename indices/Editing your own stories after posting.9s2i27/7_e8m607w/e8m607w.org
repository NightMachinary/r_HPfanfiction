I don't much care what others do, because I think it's a personal decision.

I have written several stories and I know that if I go back and revise, I'll never stop. I'm a bit of a compulsive editor, so once I release something, I won't touch it.

Even though I've had stories where I know my writing at the beginning was not up to my standards, I'll leave it alone. I can always write more new material and just keep improving.
