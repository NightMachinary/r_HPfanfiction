I have done both: I have rewritten and reposted an already completed story and I have made significant edits to another. Mainly because on revisiting them after a couple of years I wasn't happy with them and thought I could make a better job of it. And I am happier with them now.

I don't like the idea of knowingly leaving material I don't even like myself out there for public consumption. Why would I want to do that?
