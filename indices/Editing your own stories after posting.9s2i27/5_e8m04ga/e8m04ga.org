It's your story and you have a right to do what you want with it. However, I think it's polite to let readers know ahead of time if you're going to make significant revisions.

I gave my readers about a month warning when I did a significant rewrite of one of my old, popular stories. I also downloaded a copy of the original version and have let readers know I would send them a copy if they requested it. It's not necessary, but it's a nice thing to do.
