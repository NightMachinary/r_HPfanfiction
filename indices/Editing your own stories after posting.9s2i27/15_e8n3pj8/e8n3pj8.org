It's your story, so the decision to make changes is ultimately your sole prerogative. If the changes are major enough to actually affect the plot or reader perception (e.g. clearer foreshadowing) then it's probably polite to mention in the summary somewhere that you've made changes, but that's about it. And maybe save a private copy of the unedited version somewhere just in case you need to refer back to it for whatever reason.
