I'm not sure if you're just getting that off your chest or actually asking, but in the latter case it's most simply because the fandom is made up of people, just like society, and people are people whether they're out on the streets or at home on their computers. If something exists out there, it'll exist in here. We're not somehow privileged from bigotry just because we happen to like reading a book series. Hell, we probably have some actual Neo-Nazis who read fanfiction.

I take it you expected otherwise?
