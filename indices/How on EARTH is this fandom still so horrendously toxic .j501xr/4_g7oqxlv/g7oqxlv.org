Harry Potter has grown into a huge franchise, there's always people that are new to it, people that have been in it since the start that may have developed /very/ strong opinions and conceptions throughout the years, people that recall more of fanon than canon and are influenced by its trends, people that really are just doing it to be massive trolls, and people that have known tremendous success precisely because of their brand of bashing of certain characters. Shipping, for some reason, renders itself especially well as a breeding ground for toxicity. That's not just the HP fandom either.

take a deep breath, report if necessary and then just block and forget. I think you'd be happier if you don't bother giving those people the time of day beyond that, though that's of course easier said than done, especially if it pops up in unexpected places. Still, if others rather want to fester into that sort of negativity, let them. It's their loss. I find that it helps to just kick back and imagine them as described in this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA1bB6WUKkY][song]] when it /does/ get a bit too much.

Have a great day!
