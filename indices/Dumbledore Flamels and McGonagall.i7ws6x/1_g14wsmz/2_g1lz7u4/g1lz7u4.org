  AU Lily and James Potter give up their eldest son Harry in favor of their youngest son, Jamie Potter, the supposed boy-who-lived. They come back to get him from Petunia years later but to find that Harry Potter was far away, living another life. They want him back but will Harry (Cadmus) come to accept his real parents who left him?
