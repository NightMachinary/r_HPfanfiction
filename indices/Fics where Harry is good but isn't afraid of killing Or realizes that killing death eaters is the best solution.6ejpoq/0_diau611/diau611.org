  I always hated how DE would be stunned then escape to go and commit more murders. I hate it when Harry is going up against murders, torturers and rapists, and it's just stupefy stupefy stupefy from Harry.

As I recently mentioned in another thread, the obvious counter to the good guys reductoing Death Eater heads is to imperius the friends and family of the good guys (or just random bystanders), put them in Death Eater masks and cloaks, and put them in the front lines. Death Eaters would only need to do that once or twice before the good guys were back to stupefies (though, yeah, ideally followed up by bone-crusher to the wand hand or something else which can be healed easily after a battle but not during a battle).
