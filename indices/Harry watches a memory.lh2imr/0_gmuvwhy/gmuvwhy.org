I don't recall which one it is either, but can supply more details. The main thing that sticks out to me is just how over-the-top and unnecessary that whole sequence was, its only relevance to the plot being the existence of living relatives on the Potter side because the Potter in the memory got pregnant and she and/or the baby were sent away.

- Harry hides in the RoR to avoid the Tournament
- He watches things in the school through a magic mirror

  - IIRC he follows classes and even has Dobby slip his homework into the piles to be graded.

- He ends up fleeing to America to live with the descendants of the raped Potter
- I /think/ it's also the one where he had Dobby sneak a stuffed Acromantula into Ron's bed after Ron was a dick to Hermione.
