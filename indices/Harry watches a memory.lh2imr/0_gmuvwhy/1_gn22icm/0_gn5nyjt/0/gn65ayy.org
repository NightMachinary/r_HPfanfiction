This is how I search for fics I where I remember just a portion

Enter this into the Google search:

Site:<url of site where you read the fic> <a line you remember from the fic or character names plus a unique detail>

For example:

site:[[http://fanfiction.net]] Percy Jackson Aphrodite Realm

Google will search only FanFiction and tell you which pages contain words Percy Jackson and Aphrodite Realm.

I tried the same with the stuffed acromantula and it returned some fics that had this.
