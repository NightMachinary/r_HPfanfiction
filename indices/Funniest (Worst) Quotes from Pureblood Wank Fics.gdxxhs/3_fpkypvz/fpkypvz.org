I read one fic where lord!harry decided to use his uber God-level political skills to fight the ministry of magic. He ended up going to the Queen as she was still technically head of state for magical britain. I shit you not, she had a full indy!harry worthy part rant, part monologue at the ministry of magic for there ancestors subjugating magical creatures. The Queen of ENGLAND was angry at magicals for there ancestors being oppressive.
