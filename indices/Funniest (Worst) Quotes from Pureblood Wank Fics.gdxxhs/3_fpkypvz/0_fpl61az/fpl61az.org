I have nightmares about "Dame Augusta Longbottom" and it might have been a different fic where she forced Harry to drink milk bc I shit you not "Lactose Intolerance is for muggles only. Wizards drink milk from magical cows which don't cause any problems" (not a direct quote because I can't be bothered to find a fic I read years ago)
