Political!Harry is 80% of times ridiculous rubbish - speaking of experience.

Why these stories never let Harry grow up to a full adult before they make him overthrow the government in a single day, I don't know. But their laws must be pretty shitty if an eleven-year-old boy can march in and shred hundreds year of history to pieces.
