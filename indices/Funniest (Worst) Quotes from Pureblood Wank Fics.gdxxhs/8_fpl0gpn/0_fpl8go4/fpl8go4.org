I think pureblood children swearing oaths on their magic is what gets me the most. Honestly, I would avoid those like the fucking plague. What the hell is up with that? These kids were raised to their squib family members being outcast or killed, and they just willy nilly swear a completely spur of the moment oath that'll turn them into one?

It's especially grating when they do it to prove their innocence. Like, this is a world where any dark wizard can just say "imperio. Kill this dude. Obliviate." and you /literally don't know what just happened/. So then you go to swear an oath and it turns out - oops, you're now a squib. Tough luck. Better run before your dad drowns you or something.

Not to mention, magic is of the soul, and the soul is known to only be damaged when you kill someone in cold blood, and to actually take away a part requires ritualistic murder and like a whole thing and a ritual that was so disgusting JKR's editor vomited when he read it. And you're telling me that a flimsy little oath can just do the exact same thing?
