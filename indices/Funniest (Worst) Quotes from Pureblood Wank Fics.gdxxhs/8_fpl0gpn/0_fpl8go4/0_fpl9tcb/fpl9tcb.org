  I think pureblood children swearing oaths on their magic is what gets me the most. Honestly, I would avoid those like the fucking plague. What the hell is up with that? These kids were raised to their squib family members being outcast or killed, and they just willy nilly swear a completely spur of the moment oath that'll turn them into one?

I think the first thing they would be taught is to NOT, ever make an Unbreakeable Vow while in school

  It's especially grating when they do it to prove their innocence. Like, this is a world where any dark wizard can just say "imperio. Kill this dude. Obliviate

This depends on your take on how magic interprets the truth, and while your question is valid it doesn't mean a young person would think about it.

  Not to mention, magic is of the soul, and the soul is known to only be damaged when you kill someone in cold blood

This is fanon right? I don't recall anything like that in the books or Pottermore.

  like a whole thing and a ritual that was so disgusting JKR's editor vomited when he read it
#+end_quote

I remember her editors removed some stuff about Harry and the Dursleys, but I would like to know the source for this, I would be interested in how much they filtered JKR's ideas of rituals and magic.

  And you're telling me that a flimsy little oath can just do the exact same thing?
#+end_quote

Honor today may be cheap for many, and people may go back on their word a lot, but this part is to symbolize how important oaths and your word are. This is a significant part of many belief systems, where making an oath willingly can be extremely binding, and breaking it is supposed to have grave consequences.

This was intended to make people more honest in their dealings so society could be minimally functional.

There's nothing flimsy about an Oath or Vow made willingly, the person offers it of their own free will, and chooses to risk whatever it is they want to risk. This is very different from the Horcrux ritual(of which we know little about) and the person has to shatter their soul forcefully and place it in an object, something unnatural.
