  I think the first thing they would be taught is to NOT, ever make an Unbreakeable Vow while in school

agreed

  This depends on your take on how magic interprets the truth, and while your question is valid it doesn't mean a young person would think about it.

If a person could just obliviate themselves or get someone else to obliviate them, then the oath wouldn't be acceptable as proof of innocence, which it often is in these fics.

#+begin_quote
  This is fanon right? I don't recall anything like that in the books or Pottermore.
#+end_quote

Magic is definitely alluded to being a transcendental property much greater than mere biology. Souls exist and they can be magically interacted with. Additionally, Grindelwald says something to the effect of "Magic blooms in souls" in his movie. We've proved multiple times that magic can't be explained through genetics in this sub. It would need to be both a dominant and a recessive gene and be all sorts of fuckery.

  I remember her editors removed some stuff about Harry and the Dursleys, but I would like to know the source for this, I would be interested in how much they filtered JKR's ideas of rituals and magic.

I originally found it here, but now that I look back on it it seems to be insubstantiated. Still, both sides of the argument accept it without question.

  Honor today may be cheap for many, and people may go back on their word a lot, but this part is to symbolize how important oaths and your word are. This is a significant part of many belief systems, where making an oath willingly can be extremely binding, and breaking it is supposed to have grave consequences.
#+end_quote

That doesn't at all follow. An oath is a flimsy thing because soul manipulation in HP canon is intricate, complex and dark. Fracturing your soul takes an arcane ritual of unknown magnitude. For an oath to be able to surgically extract only your magic it would be at least on that level, but probably even further beyond.

And, as you say, Honor is cheap today. If it works like you say it does, then the oaths become meaningless because nobody cares like they did in the old days.

Not to mention, Honor is not enforced magically in HP canon. There are duels, but they serve as challenges. Honor itself doesn't get in touch with magic in any way. It's still a societal thing, even among magicals.

  This was intended to make people more honest in their dealings so society could be minimally functional.
#+end_quote

same thing.

  There's nothing flimsy about an Oath or Vow made willingly, the person offers it of their own free will, and chooses to risk whatever it is they want to risk. This is very different from the Horcrux ritual(of which we know little about) and the person has to shatter their soul forcefully and place it in an object, something unnatural.

Yes there is. It's a single spell, vow, whatever. We know of one other magical vow, this one binds your life, and it requires a specialized binder and is a lot more intricate and ritualistic. The Unbreakable Vow is one such magically enforced contract, but it has NOTHING to do with honor. All it is is a contract.

If you break it, you die, it's as simple as that. Nothing to do with Honor.

For a person to just willy nilly do "I swear to tell the truth on my magic" is fucking ridiculous based on what we know about splitting the soul, extracting parts of it and other binding vows.

It's fucking lame, too.
