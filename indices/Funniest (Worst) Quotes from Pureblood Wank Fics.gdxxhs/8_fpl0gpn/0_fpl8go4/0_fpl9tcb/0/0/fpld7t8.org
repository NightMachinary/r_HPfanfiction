We know almost nothing about splitting of souls, nor there is ANYWHERE saying removing one's magic requires soul magic

I was talking about honor because if a person has it they don`t need a magically enforced vow/contract.

  The Unbreakable Vow is one such magically enforced contract.

An oath is just supposed to be another type of contract, and while I do agree just taking out your wand and saying a few words is a bit dumb, I am not averse to the idea of people doing it in similar way to what what Snape did, just that the contract is with themselves.

I also dislike it because it`s just a cop out to get characters to believe the others fast and without drama.
