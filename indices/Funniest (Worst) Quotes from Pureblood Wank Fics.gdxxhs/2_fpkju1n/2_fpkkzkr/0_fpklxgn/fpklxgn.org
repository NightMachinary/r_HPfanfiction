It's from the Lightning Lord. I saw this request, searched for fics with Daphne, sorted by favs, scrolled down a bit until I saw the summary which screamed cringe fic the loudest, went to a chapter I thought was likely to be at the point where peak cringe dialogue would be reached (chap 6) and found this bit of gold.

Based on this section, I have to assume the previous five chapters involve Harry being raised by Geoffery Chaucer and Jane Austen. But I can't say for sure.
