As somebody who basically drops everything when I see that Prince of Slytherin has updated: /yes/, Harry (and quite a few other characters, for that matter) are often written like they should at least be a few characters older, but for Harry there is actually a reason for him to be entirely too erudite. It even becomes a plot point sometime during second year.
