I just got caught up to the most recent chapter- a mean feat as I literally physically cringed at the dialogue so often. Like holy shit please shut the fuck up about 'How Slytherin of you'. I swear there's only four adjectives in every characters vocabulary- that being the Hogwarts houses. Not to mention the weird obsession the author has with lying by omission? As if it's not technically lying and people who do it are cool and smart, rather than annoying.
