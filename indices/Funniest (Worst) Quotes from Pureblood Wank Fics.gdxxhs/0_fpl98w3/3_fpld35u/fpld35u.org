If that's the case, then muggles shouldn't be aware of those people. If Shakespeare was a muggle born, for example, he probably married a witch, wrote at least a few direct references to magical affairs into his body of work, and was expected by the wider magical community to hide his magical nature from muggles. As such, I would expect the Ministry to go around "rescuing" his works from muggle hands after the Statute was signed. When Victorian romanticism came along, the muggle world wouldn't find any works by Shakespeare, but there were plenty of other authors and playwrights from the same time and place as Shakespeare. The Granger's might be giving their daughter a different name, sourced from a different literary work.
