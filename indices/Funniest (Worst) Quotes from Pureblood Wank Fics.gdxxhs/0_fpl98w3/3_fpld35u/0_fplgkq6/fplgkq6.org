Shakespeare would have been pre-SoS, so he wouldn't have had to hide. There are references to magic and potions in his plays. Pretty much all pre-Enlightenment literature has references to magical things. People historically believed in magic back then, because they were superstitious as hell.

It is still a silly trope, of course.
