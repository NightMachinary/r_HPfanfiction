Well, I've never seen your first example. "I swear on my magic" is one of the most common lines in all HP fanfiction. "So mote it be" is again, extremely common in any fic that has an element of ritual magic, because it historically has strong ritual connotations via the Masons. And honestly, I can think of far worse tropes than oaths of vassalage.

I'd say the worst sort of pureblood wank fics have things like "Lord Potter, your great-great-great-great-great grandfather signed a marriage contract with Lord Edward Selwyn, which neither family has acted upon yet, and the contract has a deadline which runs out next Friday at midnight. I'm afraid you'll need to marry an available heir to the Selwyn name by that date or forfeit your magic."

Another bad one is when Harry bestows "wardship" or "guardianship" of muggleborns of his choosing, which apparently makes them off limits to other purebloods who don't want to fight him.
