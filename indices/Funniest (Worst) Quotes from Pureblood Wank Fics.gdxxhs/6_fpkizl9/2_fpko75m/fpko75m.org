  Another bad one is when Harry bestows "wardship" or "guardianship" of muggleborns of his choosing, which apparently makes them off limits to other purebloods who don't want to fight him.

I could see that in a variation of canon, though less 'ward' and more 'vassal' - if we take pureblood nobility as similar to muggle nobility from earlier periods, it'd make sense to have a system of bringing in retainers like that.

The bad part is when the system is presented as fair and good, and whoever it is that becomes his legal vassal (eg, Hermione) is completely content in that role.
