Yeah, my issue with it is when Hermione, or whoever else, just accepts it and doesn't get angry about it.

I'd also say its a bit ridiculous in the context of a school. I'd accept such a tradition existing, but I think it would likely be governed by mores which say it should only be used for important things, not school yard squabbles. Likely on a basis such as "if a muggleborn can't even deal with a school bully, how would they bring any glory, honour, or other benefit to the House?"
