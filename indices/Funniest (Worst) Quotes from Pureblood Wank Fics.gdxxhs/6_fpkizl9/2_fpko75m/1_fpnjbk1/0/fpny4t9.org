I think in school, we could /maybe/ excuse it as the only place where the top purebloods might meet with the muggleborn - but yes, I'd normally expect it to be used after graduation (eg, once the muggleborn have proven themselves 'useful' and 'worthy').

For use at school, I'd picture it more of a loophole getting exploited.
