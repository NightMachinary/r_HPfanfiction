Right, a vassal swears fealty in exchange for protection/patronage - and in such a more noble focused world, it could easily be setup such that the more powerful/wealthy noble purebloods would control things much more. A muggleborn might normally be harassed/attacked, since they have no wizarding protection/family - but by tying themselves to a noble, that'd put them under that protection.

In the case I was thinking of, it'd be less of a mutually benefactory setup, and more Harry extending protection to a friend (but in a way that then evolves into just actual/willing/happy societal submission, if that makes sense).

To me, a society that would have such power disparity that vassalage is good for them is going to be inherently bad - and should be /heavily/ reformed. For instance, one where Hermione, by virtue of being muggle-born, would be incapable of getting jobs, heavily disadvantaged, subject to repressive laws, etc, whereas Malfoy or Harry or any other high nobility among the purebloods, well that's not a good society.
