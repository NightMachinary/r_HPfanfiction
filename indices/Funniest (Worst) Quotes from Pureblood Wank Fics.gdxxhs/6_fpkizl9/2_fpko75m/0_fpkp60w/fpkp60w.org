But it still makes little sense at Hogwarts. A vassal is someone who swears fealty in return for protection and possibly other advantages such as favourable business terms or marriage ties. Frankly, nothing of that would make sense until both sides are adults. Colin Creevy does not offer Harry anything and 14 yo Harry would be unable to protect him.

And if you want to include political marriages, Harry has to marry another pureblood because otherwise he gains nothing out of that marriage and loses that avenue for connections.

That is honestly the least concerning bit. If both sides are true to their word, vassalage is a fair, mutually beneficial affair.
