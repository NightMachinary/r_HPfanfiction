Two words: Slytherin solidarity. Every single fanfic with a Slytherin protagonist has Snape/the Slytherin prefects make the exact same speech about how you cannot let other houses see you disagreeing with other Slytherins because they all hate you and snitches get stiches, bla bla bla. Then the protag is bullied by other Slytherins, then they get their private, Slytherin-approved revenge and suddenly everyone respects them regardless of previous prejudices because /akshtually/ Slytherins value power, more than blood (and saying that makes them the good guys, somehow. Bullying the weak is ok, I guess). They also call each other allies instead of friends and love to talk about politics (because apparently every pureblood is trained to be a politician /eyeroll/). Did I already mention these kids are 11?

Where did this trope come from? Canon Slytherins aren't hated by houses other than Gryffindoor (they might be envied for winning the quidditch cup too often, though), and they aren't automatically distrusted by adults! Slytherin families often are the most influencial people around, their ideology is prominent and accepted by many witches and wizards, including the Minister for Magic himself (according to Dumbledore). While some people close to Harry are personally prejudiced against Slytherins, there is no proof of society-wide ostracism. Or a very specific speech at the beginning of the 1st year. Or 11-year olds prefering to make 'allies' instead of friends, because a hat told them they belong in the sneaky house or smth.

Stop trying to make all Slytherins misunderstood geniuses. This is the house Crabbe and Goyle went to, after all.
