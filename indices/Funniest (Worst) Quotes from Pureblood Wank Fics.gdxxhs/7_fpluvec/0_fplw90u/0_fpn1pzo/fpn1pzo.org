And this is definitely less of an issue, but every time that Snape makes that speech, it's after the Sorting Feast on the first day. If you read the Philosopher's Stone, Harry and all the other first years basically collapse into their beds, exhausted, as soon as the feast is over. Why would you keep them up late for important speeches when they can't keep their eyes open?
