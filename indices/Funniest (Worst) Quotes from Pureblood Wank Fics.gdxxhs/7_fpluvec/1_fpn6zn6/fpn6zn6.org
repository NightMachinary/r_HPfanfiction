Even in Harry close circle, Slytherin are not that hated. Outside of Hagrid, a really pure man (to not say simple), that has reason to be a bit crossed with the house (Tom Riddle/ Voldemort), the only character that seem to have problem with the house as a whole is Harry himself (and because he thinks that they all dislike him "Because he keeps beating them at Quidditch).\\
For the rest of the cast, like Ron or maybe Hermione, they dislike some Slytherin a lot (mainly Draco and his goons), but could not care less about the rest of the House.
