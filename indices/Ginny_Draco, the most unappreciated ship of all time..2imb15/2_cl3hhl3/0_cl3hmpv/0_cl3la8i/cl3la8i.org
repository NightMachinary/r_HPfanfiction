From the summary of that fic:

  "Draco Malfoy wasn't guilty of anything until no one could find him after the last battle"

You know, except for him being part of a recognized terrorist organization. And performing /at least/ two instances, likely many more, of the Unforgivables: Madam Rosmerta with the Imperius and Thorfinn Rowle with the Cruciatus. And that time he poisoned Ron Weasley and almost killed him. And, as part of the Inquisitorial Squad, accessory to assault of a minor, multiple counts. The hits really just keep coming.

This isn't how you do an anti-hero, by straight white-washing. In that story, they have Draco not having the Dark Mark, as well as an even more contrived excuse for his crimes. And that isn't even mentioned until like chapter 17/49.

It isn't fair to canon, and makes it more Ginny/"Draco in name only". Neither is the classic "Old magic is best magic" Pureblood apologist stuff something that makes Ginny/Draco work.

That's all fine for heavy AU stories, but it changes so much that the motivations and goals of the characters are entirely different, as well as their upbringing and abilities. It isn't a "post-Hogwarts" story anymore, it is just an AU being set in an entirely different world.

Makes me want to write my own canon-compliant Draco-centric romance story, just to show people how it's done.

I really want to see an example of Draco/anyone done well, but as you suggest, this isn't the best out there. Because it isn't /about Draco Malfoly./ Just some character with the same name.
