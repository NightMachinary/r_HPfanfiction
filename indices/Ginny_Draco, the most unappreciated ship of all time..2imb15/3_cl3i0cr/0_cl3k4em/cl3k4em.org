I'm very sure that's /not/ how relationships are meant to work.

Which might be why people have a hard time writing something with this "ship" that isn't a rapey forced marriage or post-Voldemort-victory abuse fic. Or if not, simply yet another [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants][Draco in Leather Pants]] hooking up with girl X. All of which are really boring and predictable, once again misusing the possibilities of Ginny's character.

Hard to have the series' second, and least well used, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress][Damsel in Distress]] fall in love with the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel][Heel]] and have it not be very contrived and forced from beginning to end. Usually, /literally/.
