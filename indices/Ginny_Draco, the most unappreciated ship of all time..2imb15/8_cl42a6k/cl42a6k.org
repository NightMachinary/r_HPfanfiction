Ginny/Draco makes me grit my teeth in anger. Enough so that even just seeing this thread bothers me. I've tried ignoring it, but I can't.

It's ok though, almost any non-cannon pairing does that to me. I just can't get a grip on the idea of Ginny without Harry or vice versa.

Funny story, I almost didn't watch that new show "How to Get Away With Murder" because the guy that played Dean Thomas is on there, and Ginny/Dean nearly makes me fly off in a rage. I blame Northumbrian for that one.
