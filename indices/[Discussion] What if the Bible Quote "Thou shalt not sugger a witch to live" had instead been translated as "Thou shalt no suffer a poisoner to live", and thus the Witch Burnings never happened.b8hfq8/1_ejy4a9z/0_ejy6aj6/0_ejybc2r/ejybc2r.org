That could actually be a great twist on a tired cliche. But the trope is not necessarily the problem - it's the type of author that's most attracted to the trope. It's not as if the /justification/ is the root problem of most marriage law stories, it's other issues endemic in the author, like fairy-tail romances, dangling plot threads, or stereotypical gender roles. The same could be said for self-insert stories or OC-focused stories.
