Well, not much, I'd assume, because there's no line in the Bible that says "Thou shalt not sugger a witch to live."

Being serious, the reason that it was translated that way in the first place was because of the biases at the time and the tensions that existed. For one, even the [[https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-18.htm][/literal/ translation of the phrase]] includes the word "witch" - it was specifically referring to an unmarried woman who practiced magic. But even if we disregard that, there was definitely a tension between the people at the time and displays of the supernatural, obvious or subtle. After all, the witch hunts happened in /our/ reality, and we don't even have witches! (so far as we know)

A more interesting question would be if there was any other way for witches and wizards to hide themselves aside from seclusion. I would say that, had they accepted subordination to the church (or more likely, used magic to take it over from the inside) and claimed to be a race of people blessed by God with the power to create miracles, the kind of integration between muggles and wizards you seem to be asking for could take place. Of course, a premise like that is almost /too/ interesting for fan-fiction.
