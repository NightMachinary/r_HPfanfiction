I don't know. There would still have been /cause/ to prosecute if you looked, certainly, but did the catch-all term of "witch" to bandy about not help rally the 'torch-and-pitchfork mob' mood better than if all those people had instead been accused of various independent crimes?

Besides which, do not forget this is a /HP/ sub, and the question was probably meant to be about the /Harry Potter/ universe. Whether the Muggles hanged a bunch of suspected wreckers, poisoners and murderers for being those things, or for being suspected wizards, would make a world of difference from the Wizarding World's point of view: would Grindelwald and Voldemort have been able to rally the support they did if they didn't have the "the Muggles would hang or burn us all if they only could! Just look at the witch trials!" excuse?
