I think a fact the /HP/ fanfiction community is inordinately wary of (because it admittedly makes one's brain hurts) is how suspicious any pre-Statute of Secrecy history as we know it should be. I am of the opinion that the rewriting of Muggle History to erase magical influence was a /massive/ undertaking, and Ancient and Medieval History were in truth not at all very much like what we Muggles learn about in school nowadays. Too little is made of the fact that we know for a fact that King Arthur and Merlin were real, and lived /in the days of Chretien de Troyes/, not int he VIth century.

This handily fixes any such problems of Rowling getting her history wrong: /we'/re wrong because we've been Obliviated, what we learn about in canon is the true part. Hence, for example, any "rational explanation" at all that we can find for witch trials, at any point in history, is most likely nothing more than a fabrication to disguise whatever imbroglio involving real magic /actually/ happened.
