  Which, frankly, is an even more absurd notion than King Arthur being an eternally-youthful blonde girl who had Merlin give her a magic dick to consummate her marriage.

Why? Once you accept that Muggle history before the Statute has probably got about the same fiction/truth ratio as folklore does, one /should absolutely/ weigh the apparent chronological contradictions with the fact that most fictional depictions of Arthur & Merlin in popular Muggle culture look much more like the 11th century than they do like the Dark Ages.
