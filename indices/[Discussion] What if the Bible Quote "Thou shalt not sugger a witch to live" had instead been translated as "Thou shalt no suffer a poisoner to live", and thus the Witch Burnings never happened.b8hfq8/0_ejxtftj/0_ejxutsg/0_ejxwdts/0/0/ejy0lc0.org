  Too little is made of the fact that we know for a fact that King Arthur and Merlin were real, and lived in the days of Chretien de Troyes, not int he VIth century.

Which, frankly, is an even more absurd notion than King Arthur being an eternally-youthful blonde girl who had Merlin give her a magic dick to consummate her marriage.

There just comes a point where you have to shrug and just not sweat the details, because the details have become a nigh-insurmountable obstacle.
