I think a big piece of why this is a discussion at all is that JKR's grasp of history is nearly as bad as her grasp of numbers: during the period of the witch trials - less so toward the end but massively so at the beginning - magic was a part of everyone's daily life. Every locality had its cunning-men and wise-women, people who mixed herbal medicines and performed various magical services. Witch trials happened when practitioners stepped over the socially- and legally-accepted line, whatever it was in their place and time (and it could and did move with religious, political and social tensions, and moved /very/ quickly with the outbreak of war).

The Doylist explanation is that JKR sucks at history, and 'printed the legend' from the likes of Murray's /God Of The Witches/, which remains remarkably influential in popular culture despite the fact that it's sixty years discredited as academic work.

The Watsonian explanation is that the likes of Grindelwald and Voldemort's propaganda about the witch-hunts is of the same character as any other blood libel: politically-useful lies. "They hanged us when we murdered them and destroyed their livelihoods" isn't much of a rallying cry when you're trying to convince people to commit acts of terrorism, now, is it?
