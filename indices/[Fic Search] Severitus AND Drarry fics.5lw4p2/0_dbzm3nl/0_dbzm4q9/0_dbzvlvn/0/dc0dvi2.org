Honestly, Cunning and Ambition is not really all that big of a deal since it's basically a straight canon retelling with Draco and Pansy as part of the Golden Trio instead of Ron & Hermione. It isn't a terrible read, though - it just has an uninspired plot, IMO. The author didn't write the 6th & 7th years because they likely couldn't/didn't want to think of an original plot to go with Death Eater Draco and Snape that appeared in book 6. Years 1-5 are complete though.

Leo Inter Serpentes was more original than Cunning and Ambition but it was still a canon rehash. Years 3 and especially 5 have the Severitus aspect.
