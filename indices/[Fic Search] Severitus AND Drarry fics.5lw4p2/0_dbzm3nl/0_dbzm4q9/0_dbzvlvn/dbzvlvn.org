Thank you guys! I already read Chaos Theory, Family Means More than Blood (<3) and Inter Vivos, I saw Cunning and Ambition, but how the author abandoned the fic I didn't start it (do you guys think it is worth reading? Even if it's incomplete?). Leo Inter Serpentes was also without an update for a while when I first saw, but I checked now and she just updated it, so I'll probably start this one. And For the Price of a Siul is new (for me), I never heard about it, I'll take a look on it! Thanks again!
