Chaos Theory was one I was going to rec and has already been said below. [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=3386][Secrets]] by Vorabiza also has a Severitus plot line with a Snape/Lupin pairing.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1049966][Azoth]] and [[http://thetwobroomsticks.slashcity.net/sansa/OntheLastDayindex.html][On The Last Day of our World]] are not really severitus but they do both have a strong mentor-mentee relationship between Snape and Harry and both have a Drarry pairing.
