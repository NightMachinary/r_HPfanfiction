I seriously /cannot/ recommend Shoebox Project enough! It's Marauders era and full of crazy shenanigans. Not only is it hilarious (first and only fanfic to literally make me laugh out loud) but it creates a whole new depth for the HP universe. It's full of hand drawn illustrations and is just awesome. Only thing that can be a possible deterrent is that it is eventual slash (Sirius/ Remus). [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/page/4/]] Enjoy!
