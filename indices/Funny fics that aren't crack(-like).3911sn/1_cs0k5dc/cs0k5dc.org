/The Inner Eye of Harry Potter/ was never finished, but is worth a read if you want some comedy. Harry Potter, if he was raised by Trelawney.

/The Seventh Horcrux/ is very funny. What if the horcrux in Harry took control early in his life, and tried to one day achieve its original ambition - becoming DADA teacher?
