Whats your threshold for over the top?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth][A Curse of Truth]] are both fics that are funny, but also follow a plotline that isn't /just/ comedic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4389875/1/Gossip-Queens][Gossip Queens]] is a oneshot with Harry and Neville drunkenly lamenting their underlings poor writing skills.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] has hilarious moments, but isn't really a comedy, despite the sorting hat's best efforts to the contrary.
