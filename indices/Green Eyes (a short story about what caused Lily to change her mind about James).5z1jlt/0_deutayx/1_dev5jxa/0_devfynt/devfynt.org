I'm sorry that you didn't find what you expected. I personally have an aversion to lyrics in the middle of a story, it is just jarring to me. It takes me out of the story, sort of like the POV issues that have been discussed in other threads. Maybe we should have bypassed your thread, but then you would have wondered why it had no responses. Can't take it back now. All I can add is that writing is a muscle and if you keep writing you will find out what works and what doesn't. Every story isn't going to appeal to everyone, and that's ok.
