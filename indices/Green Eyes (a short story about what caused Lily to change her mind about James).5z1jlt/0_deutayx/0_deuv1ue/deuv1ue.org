I'm not sure why "song fics" aren't allowed, but i'm grateful. Seeing that flashed me back to fanfic of 1998 where it was in every story. Other than the lyrics, the story was alright. I didn't see any spelling errors and it was coherent, but there wasn't really anything pulling me in to make me really crave a second chapter. Keep working at it.
