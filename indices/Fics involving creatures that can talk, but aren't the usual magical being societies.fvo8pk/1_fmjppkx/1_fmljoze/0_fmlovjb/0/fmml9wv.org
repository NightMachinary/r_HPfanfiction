Eh. No biggie. I don't pay much attention to Usernames either - they're almost impossible to remember unless I interact with the person regularly. I only remember yours because we talked before and it's on all the Bot-Links for Basilisk-Born. :D

Nio, huh? I look forward to seeing those interactions for myself. :)

I was trying to say that you enjoying writing those interactions is good, but I couldn't find a way of expanding on that point without sounding immensely patronising, so I'm leaving it at 'interaction fun, writing good /does cheesy finger gun motions/ cool beans'.
