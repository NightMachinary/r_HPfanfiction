The creatures are not cannon, here's a description from the fic about a "bloodbeast"

"Bloodbeasts were half humanoid creatures that lumbered upright but easily went down on all fours, bounding along at great speeds. They often grew very big and this one was exceptionally so. Muscles bulged at its haunches and shoulders. Murderous red eyes peered out from its face, under peaked ears. Hair melted into fur at its neck, short and fuzzy around the upper torso and long and shaggy near the rear where a tail with a tuft on the end whipped back and forth. The claws where the crowning glory of the beast; they were large, shiny, and very impressive."

There are also "silents"

Most of them are just people with wings,Harry is one of "cursed" silents.
