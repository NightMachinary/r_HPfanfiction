Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux). Dumbledore doesn't appear often, and when he does, he mostly just engages Harry in philosophical debate, but it's one of my favourite interpretations of him in fanfic. Fair warning, the first story in the series is complete, but its sequel is abandoned.
