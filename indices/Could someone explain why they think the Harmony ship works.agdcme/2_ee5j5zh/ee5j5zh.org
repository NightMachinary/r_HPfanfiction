First. Obvious bait is obvious.

Second. Why not? It's fanfiction, and Harry/Hermione is far and away the most believable of the non-canon pairings; if you put some work into developing the characters (particularly if your fic is post-canon) then there's no reason why an H/Hr ship can't be better than the canon ships, let alone plausible. If you're asking why people think the ship works in canon, then I'd agree with you that it mostly doesn't. However, I think it's a more than fair argument to suggest Jo poisoned the well because she so desperately wanted the canon ships to happen: that bit at the end of HBP where Rowling basically assumes omniscience to contrast Ginny and Hermione by saying Ginny would accept his decisions and not tell him to be careful is pretty much proof positive of that. A few changes here and there to canon and there'd be a great big lot sitting here and on [[/r/harrypotter]] dumbfounded as to how anyone could think H/Hr wasn't the perfect pairing.
