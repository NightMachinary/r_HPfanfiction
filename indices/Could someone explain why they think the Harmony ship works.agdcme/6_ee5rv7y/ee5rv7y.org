My view is that Harmony could work well if you made some slight changes to one or both of them, and those changes would probably be improvements. For example, having Hermione appreciate Harry's sense of humour a bit more, or take more time to listen to him without judging. Having Harry be a bit more considerate of Hermione's challenges, a bit more committed to his studies. Those changes would help them to simply enjoy each other's company, not because they rely on each other to save the world, but just because being together is fun.

Since those are positive changes, and hopefully some form of them would happen as the two grow up, I think it's reasonable for fanfic writers to see potential in the relationship.
