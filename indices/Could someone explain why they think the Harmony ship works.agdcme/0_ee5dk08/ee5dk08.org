well why not? I mean at least from harry's point of view hes definetly closer to her than any other girl. similar age, similar background, theres plenty in common between the two. theres at the very least trust and love between them of a platonic kind, it doesnt take much to lead to more. I think ships that work in the tent after ron leaves work well, both are angry and vulnerable and desperate and there is literally only one other person around. people often turn to friends for romance, its not an uncommon thing
