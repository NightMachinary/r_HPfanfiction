i mean, this still feels like condemning ron based on thoughtcrime. he isn't choosing between one or the other- caring about his family or being forgiven or hermione loving him. he has visceral insecurities over being worthy of hermione. he can't control how he feels. you may as well condemn anyone for having personal feelings at all. it isn't moral to care about your family and loved ones more than any other innocent being. why would dumbledore see his family alive and whole in the mirror of erised, as opposed to world peace, or all the innocent people alive that were killed because he stalled defeating grindelwald?
