It still seems like very bad priorities. If we were talking about leaving Hermione with someone who very well might force himself on her, I would understand the worry. Or had they actually been in a relationship and he pulled a Lupin.

But at that point his worry should be about being welcomed back after his stunt, not if Harry and Hermione had sex.
