Ron has even fewer in common with her than Harry. And Ron abandoned them twice, and although his second leave was unintentional, it was Harry and Hermione against the rest of the world for months. They had no help, no one to fall back onto, while Ron had the choice between Bill, Charlie, the Burrow and probably also somewhere with the twins. And that is discounting extended family like Muriel. But Harry or Hermione? It was "fight together" or "run away together". Maybe they would be able to track down Hermione's parents, maybe not. That is a whole different level of threat than what Ron faced.
