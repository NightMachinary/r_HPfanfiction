Normally I see people have Hermione credit her being saved in 1st year to Harry and not Ron, and really is only friends with Harry as Ron is more a tag-a-long. Since Harry is Hermione's only real friend she's ever had in 17 years of life it's practically expected for her to have very strong feelings for him, especially since he almost dies every single year.

As for Harry well most of the time he is just like wow, I've been neglected my whole life and don't know what love is. Then Hermione proves she loves him by never abandoning him. Eventually they kiss and then are inseperable.
