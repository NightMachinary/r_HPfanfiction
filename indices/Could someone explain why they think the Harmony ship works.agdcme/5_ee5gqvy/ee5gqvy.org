I think there are enough hooks in canon to hang a relationship on. They share a relationship of deep trust, friendship and loyalty more than any other character. There is evidence of a physical attraction on both ends in canon as well. They are both from the Muggle world.

Hermione/Harry also works better than Hermione/Ron in the sense that they are not complete opposites. Rowling even said herself that the relationship between them was a mistake.

Biggest thing of all though is that there are so many moments in canon where you can realistically start of the ship. End of third year with the rescue of Sirius, when Hermione is the only one to stand by Harry after he gets picked by the GoF, after the first task, Yule Ball, after the second task (honestly anywhere in fourth year would be appropriate), anytime during fifth year with the Umbridge detentions and Occlumency, after Sirius dies, when Harry goes looking for her when Ron snogs Lavender, Slughorn party, when Ron leaves during DH and post war are all perfect opportunities from the top of my head.
