Yes, so many natural points for it to happen unlike nearly all the other canon ships (imo) finding her crying in the classroom in HBP was another scene for me where i was like "wow Rowling is actually going to go with this after all???" then... no lol and by the time DH and the tent stuff rolled around the idea was pretty dead in my head but when Ron leaves i defintely felt that Harry and Hermione shouldve hooked up in that tent even for only one night. ( clearly imply it and be subtle as its still a childrens book even though by DH its pretty adult now so you coudl write it tastefully) I mean, they are lost alone and theres no one else to turn too they are also horny teens who could die any day now ahha it was so obvious and also would have added such depth to the scene where the locket shows Ron what he fears may have went on while he was gone...well what if it actually did happen in a time of weakness but Harry and Hermione regret it or hide it? will Ron be consumed by rage or will he be a true Gryffindor and destroy the locket as its the right thing to do maybe he leaves again after or choses to stay but the rest of the story has this dark cloud hanging over the three? I mean you want the last book to be dark go dark Jk!! lol anyway enough rambling from me haha
