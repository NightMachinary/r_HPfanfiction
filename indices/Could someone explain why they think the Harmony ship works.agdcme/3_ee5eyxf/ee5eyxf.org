Shared Muggle childhood experiences, the 'child prodigy' treatment from adults around them (which in particular is something Ron doesn't share with them), Harry relying on Hermione's intelligence and vice versa to a small extent (it's more an outlook, a point of view, that I feel Harry has that's valuable), and just sheer time spent together, especially during traumatic events. There are people who become couples after living through something terrible that seem to not have any other things in common, and it still works. The military studies that phenomenon, I think.

​

I wasn't a fan of the idea until I watched a music video back in 2005 or 2006 that really caught an angle I liked, which was the 'feelings for each other we keep hidden so we don't hurt Ron' angle. I think they'd be an all right couple in public as well, though. Besides the whole 'Rowling deliberately wrote feelings between Ron and Hermione' thing, I think there's a solid friendship turns to more basis in the Harry and Hermione relationship. I mean, how many movies are there where two people were best friends and one of them realizes they have feelings, and has to either reconcile that with the lack of them from the other person, or convince them to realize they also feel the same way? It's not a stretch. I find it way more plausible when *just* looking at canon events than Hermione and Draco, for example.

I think a good writer can make nearly anything work. Whether you end up liking it has to do with how well they wrote it and how willing you are to see it the way they wrote it, if that makes sense? If you don't like it, that's totally fair.
