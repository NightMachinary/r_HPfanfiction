1. They have a great friendship.

2. They are actually complementary, making up for each other's weaknesses instead of just opposites.

3. They are both stoic and can endure hardship. They'd both work on a relationship instead of thROwiNg in the towel at the first sign of resistance

4. They are proven to be able to work as a team and achieve their goals.

5. They take care of each other and support each other even when they disagree.

6. Hermione is the only female character (besides maybe Tonks) who sees Harry for Harry and not as "prophecy boy". He needs to be in a relationship with someone like her, not Ginny (and this is not a dig at Ginny, she's great).

7. Hermione would never allow Harry to name one of their kids Albus-Severus.

The biggest objection: /They just aren't into each other/ can be solved by a single line written by the author, so it doesn't really interest me that much. Of course they aren't interested in each other if the author goes for different final pairings...
