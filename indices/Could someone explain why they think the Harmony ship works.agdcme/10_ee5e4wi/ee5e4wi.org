It's better than the trash rowling left us, and if you're sticking to canon characteristics, aka not changing how they characters act, it makes the most sense, Rather than what will obviously be a frustrating and tiring relationship with Ron, at best their relationship/attraction was sexual tension, And harry who hates his fame ending up with a fangirl? Sure she grew out of it, but still all we know of her character from canon is temper, bat boogey hex, and hot quidditch girl.
