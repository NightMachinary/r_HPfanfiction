  She seemed happy with Dean?

Popular opinion around here is that her relationship with Dean was doomed even without Harry triggering their break-up with the luck potion. I got downvoted into oblivion because I tried to argue that Harry, at the very least, sped their separation up. People seem to believe that it was done for early in HBP.

Ginny in OotP was an amazing character (much like Hermione and Tonks). HBP and DH shat all over that. She goes from "strong, important character" to "nothing but the love interest" as soon as the sixth book starts.
