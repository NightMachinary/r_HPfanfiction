That was perfectly in-character for Lupin to do. I mean, that was the only "out of school" interaction they really had. Harry laments that Lupin didn't write after Sirius death, Lupin, unlike Sirius, did nothing during the TWT and didn't bother to visit Harry even once for 14 years and then only does so to get him from one prison to a slightly more gilded cage.

Honestly, Rowling should have used the runner to break them up and make a point about loving divorced parents. But due to her pining after the ex-husband who dumped her, we get the Tonks character assassination which is their romance (she admitted that it influenced all her romances in the last book).
