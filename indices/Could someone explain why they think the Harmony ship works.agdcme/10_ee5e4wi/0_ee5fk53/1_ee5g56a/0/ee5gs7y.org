I didn't see it as much spiteful as looking for evidence for your position on her, no worries. I don't really like her character as much as others, but found as I read the books that personally my view of who she was as a character felt like how Rowling *meant* to write her, but when I actually go back over the parts in the books that are about her specifically, they lack the nuances I thought I'd seen. I think my brain fills them in, if that makes sense.

Harry and Ron hadn't been very kind to Hermione (not specifically unkind, except for maybe one comment), and she hadn't grown up knowing vaguely of him, so it makes sense her reaction was different to being saved. Plus, Hermione's view of him definitely changed with his actions. They became far more favorable, just not hero worship :)

I think what isn't said about Ginny in the books is actually a net positive for her. She isn't an extension of the trio, she has her own stuff she's into, she isn't always around, because she's doing her own thing. This ends up meaning that we don't know as much about her, because the books are in Harry's PoV, but I do think it shows something healthy about her that she has her own group of friends and such.
