I have Thoughts about how Ginny was written vs. how Ginny probably was intended to be seen, but I think it's ridiculous to call Ginny a fangirl. She spent a decent amount of time growing up with Harry and the fact that she had a crush on him before she attended and in her first year--during which he ends up saving her life, let's totally blame her for crushing on the hero--is not something I think that should be held against her. If she was as vapid a fangirl as it seems like you're implying she'd never have settled for anyone else, even to make him jealous. She seemed happy with Dean?
