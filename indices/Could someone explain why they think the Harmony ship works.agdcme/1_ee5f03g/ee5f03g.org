For me i just found their to be moments of such sweet tenderness between the two which were not always expclitly romantic but could serve as a bases for that kind of relationship to grow and seemed to show Harry and Hemrione having more chemsitry together than other canon couples that didn't feel forced but very real and natural(imo).

For example, Think the first time i was reading GoF i kept seeing Rowling was going out of her way seemingly, to put Harry and Hermione on their own together and having these little moments together that seemed out of step with the series till then.

Like when Hermione showed up the morning after Harrys name gets picked out of the goblet with some toast for him and they go eat by the lake and she listens to him and is vey suppotive and comforting its very sweet and tender. The kind of moment that shouldve belonged to Ginny in order to make that future relahstionship feel less forced and out of nowhere but instead it is given to Hermione. I love that little moment and when i was ten i was like OMG toast by the great lake??? this is the height of romance!! lol).

Anyway a scene like that, It tells us how much Hermione understands Harry like not many other seem to. She knows he doesn't want to eat in front everyone else and also doesn't even ask if he put his name in the goblet becuase she already knows the answer and Harry is greatly cheered by this and its just a really heartfelt wonderful display of their bond. While everyone else just assumes Harry to be a cheat and mostly runs off and abondons him(A recurring theme throughout the series everyone else leaving him and its back to being Just Harry and Hermione for ages).

There was also all the studying amd training together to learn Accio and Rita skeeter writing articles about the two being an item(even though they clearly deny it)

There's also the strange final moment of the last chapter of the book where its all "Hermione did something she'd never done before and kissed Harry on the cheek" Like why do we need to know she never done that before? why is that written like its significant? Perhaps suggetsing their relathionship had deepened or changed somewhat or is going to go somewhere in the next book? I think that at this point in the story JK was maybe unsure what pairings to go with and was trying stuff out (no matter how much she says the pairings where all planned from day one)

Anyway at the cost of going on and boring people any longer those kind of moments i can see defintely shaping people to see Harry/hermione being viable.

Ps. I'm not die hard on harmony or anything so please don't shout at me ahha all my ships get me enough trouble already Like Hermione/Luna Hermione/Pansy and other stuff people give me funny looks for lol
