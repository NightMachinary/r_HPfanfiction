In the interest of better understanding the story I spent some time googling and it seems "indigo children" is a pseudoscientific theory, something about synesthesia, auras and children who are [[http://skepdic.com/indigo.html][gifted souls with an evolved consciousness who have come here to help change the vibrations of our lives and create one land, one globe and one species. They are our bridge to the future.]]. Further googling showed no evidence that Hermione uses her vibrational powers to realign Voldemort with the cosmos.
