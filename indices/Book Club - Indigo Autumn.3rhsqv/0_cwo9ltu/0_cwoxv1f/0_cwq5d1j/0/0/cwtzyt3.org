I started reading the next one, and so far it's awful... the MC is Remus's twin, and she likes picking fights and is super protective of Remus. The writing and characterization is well done... but it's a total self-insert fic. I'm going to try and stick around until the plot picks up, but I don't know how long I'll last.
