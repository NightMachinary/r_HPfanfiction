I've read a bit more, and it's just... not good. "Mina," the main character, [[/spoiler][instantly becomes friends with all the Marauders, has a tragic past (apparently her and Remus' mother drugged them to get them to stop bothering her), she has an awful temper and everyone just seems to be okay with it, she's really pretty and has guys all over her even though she's known to have serious issues... bleh.]]

It's bad. The writing is actually quite good, but it's a shame the author is wasting it on poorly-done OC fiction. Don't worry--you wouldn't have been able to tell from a quick glance, so don't feel bad. The writing is deceptively good. I envy her style, but her characterization and storyline aren't that great.
