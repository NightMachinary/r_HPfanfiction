If you're looking for ideas on tasks, I posted on a similar thread by Miqdad a week or so ago -

  Well, inspiration-wise, I'd say start with the fact that the tournament is supposed to be both a display and a test. Goblet picks the best of the applicants, they do the tasks to prove it and entertain people. So, every task should be difficult and require them to do something people can watch (something canon failed dismally at). I'd say the next part is just finding a combination of two things - what it tests and how it tests them.

  You could make it physical (test of fitness or adroitness), magical (cast a big spell or solve a problem with magic), technical (in a sense of requiring specialist interaction or knowledge, not electrical engineering), logical (riddles or logic-puzzles), intuitive (poker-game type thinking), artistic (maybe poetry writing or interpretive dance as part of a ritual), Chance (playing with probability or games of chance, or some kind of Leap of Faith choice), willpower/stamina (how long you can do a thing), emotional literacy (knowing what you're feeling and dealing with it properly, eg. with Dementors), an arcane test of mind/belief (think the Gate from D&D: Scourge of Worlds or the Grail from Indiana Jones), preparation (like the Golem thing in The Lie I've Lived), intellectual (needing to have read a thing or studied a thing to complete it, eg. Norse Poetry has these metaphor/rhyming-slang things called 'Kennings' that you'd not get without knowledge of the myth they represented, like 'Otters Ransom' meaning Gold after a myth in which a sum of gold was paid after Loki killed an Otter brother of some dwarves), creative (having to make something to impress a judge), morality (doing what's right even when everything is telling you to do something else), etc.

  Then think about whether a task should be cooperative, person vs. environment (fight through a place to get somewhere/thing), a gated competition (do this to get to the next bit!), speed-trial/race, person vs. person (duelling), randomised (one person gets a Dragon, the other gets a mermaid, or wind and water, etc), with tools or without, etc.

  Find a cross-section of the two and you'll get some inspiration, I think. I'd also recommend looking into puzzle games and such stories. Apologies if that's quite over-detailed or long, I've been running D&D games for a decade now and it tends to seep into near everything I do. :)

In terms of examples, I think Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise, The Lie I've Lived, and a Fleur one I can't currently remember the name of where they had the choice of four areas based on ancient civilizations (a Pyramid full of mummies, a Greek Maze, etc).
