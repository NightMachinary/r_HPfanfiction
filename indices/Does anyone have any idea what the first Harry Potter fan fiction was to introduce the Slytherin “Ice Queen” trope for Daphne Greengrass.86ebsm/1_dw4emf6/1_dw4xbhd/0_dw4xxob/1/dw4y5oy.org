Huh, okay. That's where I read it earlier but didn't think it was the original version. My bad.

Do you have any idea if they've done any other stories (especially with Daphne as the pairing), besides the sequel to Perfect Situations, which I just finished (I wish there was more than the 20? chapters though!)?
