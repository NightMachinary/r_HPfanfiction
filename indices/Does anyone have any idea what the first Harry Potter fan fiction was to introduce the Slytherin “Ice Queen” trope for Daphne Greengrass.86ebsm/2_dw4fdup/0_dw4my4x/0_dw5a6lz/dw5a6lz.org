I'm a Slytherin. I used to bake cookies, brownies, and other food / sweets and bring them to class to share with everyone. Being charming, generally polite, considerate, and well-mannered also helps others to automatically assume that you're sweet, caring, and kind. Appearances, however, can clearly belie the brains that lurk just beneath the surface...

Another good example of this, in canon, is Tom Riddle. Practically everyone at Hogwarts worshipped him, save for Dumbledore, when he was a Hogwarts student...and yet, he was also a Slytherin. He even managed to fool young Hagrid, Ginny, /and/ Harry with his charm and friendly appearances.
