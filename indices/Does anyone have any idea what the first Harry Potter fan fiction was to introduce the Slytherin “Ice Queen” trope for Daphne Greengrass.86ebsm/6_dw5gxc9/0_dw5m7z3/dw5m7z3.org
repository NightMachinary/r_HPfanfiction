She is only mentioned as a name in passing in the series. The most notable thing about her in canon is her sister ends up marrying Malfoy. Her family has mentions in Pottermore, but nothing about her specifically. There is no indication as to what she looks like like, how she acts or if any extra was meant to be her in the movies.

As for lords, Pottermore mentions "the sacred 28" which is just 28 tracably pure-blood familys according to some book. This doesn't make them Lords or any other nobility. I think a lot of that fanon comes from the name "The Most Ancient and Noble House of Black" and the general superiority purebloods tend to convey in the series.

All the Lords, inherited Wizengamot seats and all that nonsense is pure fanon.
