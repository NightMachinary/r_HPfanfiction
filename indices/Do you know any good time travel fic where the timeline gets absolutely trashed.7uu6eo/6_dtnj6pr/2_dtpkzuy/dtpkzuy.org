You mean where Luna goes back in time to save her mother but accidentally causes a time wave that sees Harry dead, James Potter as a depressed, drunken Wizard Who Lived, Lily Potter going insane and becoming Voldemorte's right hand, Dumbledore captured and experimented on by the government, the English and French going to war over a broken marriage contract that basically destroys the muggle world... Hermione as an agent of the muggle government desperately trying to stop the wizarding war from destroying the world..

I am telling you HP Fanfiction "The Flash" has legs. Although I do not know who you would cast Professor Zoom as. Luna doesn't really have an arch enemy. Maybe a Snorkack?
