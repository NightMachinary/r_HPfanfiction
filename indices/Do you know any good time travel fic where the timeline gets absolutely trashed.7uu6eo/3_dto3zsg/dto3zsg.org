The first I thought of is linkffn(5511855). There is a pairing but the timeline is changed greatly. HP/BB

Another one you might want to look at is linkffn(4068153) again there is a pairing but the changes are vast. HP/FD

The last one is linkffn(4101650) here Harry, Ron and Ginny return back. It is my favourite timetravel fic because of the way Dumbledore and Snape. Again signifanct changes to the timeline but a HP/GW pairing. This one is heavy on the pairings.

I understand that these are pretty popular stories that don't exactly give OP what he asked for but they are my favorite fic in the genre and I felt I should rec them.
