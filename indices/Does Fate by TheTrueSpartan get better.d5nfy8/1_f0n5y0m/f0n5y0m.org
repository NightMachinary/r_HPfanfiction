I read pretty regularly through chapter 60-70 ish, and the writing technically does get better. As far as the "MC wankfest" that you speak of, it still happens. Ron is suppose to be a prodigy or at least /be viewed/ as one. As the story continues, it becomes pretty clear that outside of his "ability" he has no innate talents. His ability lit a fire under him that other characters his age don't have. He's crafty, but is still prone to the temper tantrum that blows up his plans quite frequently.

I'd continue reading. It's probably the only Prodigy!Ron on the internet even close to this size. Ron does show his cracks and there will be chapters where you as a reader and other characters will absolutely disagree with him.
