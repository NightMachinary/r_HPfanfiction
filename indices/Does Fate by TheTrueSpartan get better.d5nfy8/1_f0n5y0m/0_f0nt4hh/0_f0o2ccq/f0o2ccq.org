It does get a bit better, once they are in Hogwarts and there is all that “inside of Slytherin house” narrative, but later it gets weirder and weirder. Also, the trope I really deeply and passionately hate, “main character keeps for no reasons whatsoever secrets from his/her friends to increase the dramatic tension” and then after the chapter fifty or so, it starts to shift into some kind of “our super-hero is bigger than anybody else and communicates with the secret $DEITY behind our all lives” crap and that made me finally snap and stop following it.

I mean the basic premise of the story was a bit interesting, but it gets really weird eventually.
