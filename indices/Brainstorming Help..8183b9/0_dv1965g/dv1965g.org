That first sentence is a doozy.

We're told that all the Purebloods know each other more or less. So it's plausible enough that they know of Augusta Longbottom. The catch being that Marius is canonically listed as 20-25 years older than Augusta. But no one is going to harp on them being away of each other in a society as insular and small as the Wizarding World. So it's fairly easy to just have them drop in to say hi to an old family friend on the return to England.

That being said, stories don't need love interests.
