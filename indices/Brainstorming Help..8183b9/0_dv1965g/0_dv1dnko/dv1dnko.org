As much as they don't "need" them, if written well they certainly add a dimension to your story.

I've read most of what you have, and from your perspective it's true. You seamlessly integrate romance making it appear "normal".

On the flip side, not everyone can do that. I am not a strong enough writer to manage that so my options are either forgot the pairing or write it while the quality of the story suffers.

If I forget the pairing then I lose the opportunity to gain experience with writing romance and all that it entails. If the quality of my story suffers for it so be it. The goal is to improve my skills as a writer not the quality of a singular story.
