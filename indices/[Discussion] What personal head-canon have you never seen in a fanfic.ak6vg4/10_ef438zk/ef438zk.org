It's not strictly fanfic-based, but I do have this personal headcanon based on the uniform design for the Hogwarts robes from the movies - which I believe is based on a pretty stock school uniform design, with robes added.

This came about one time when I was rewatching /Sorceror's Stone/ and I noticed that during the Sorting, every single first-year is wearing exactly the same uniform, including a plain black tie with the Hogwarts crest, and it's not until the first classroom scene that you see them wearing their House colors IIRC.

So I developed the headcanon that the robes sold to first-year students are all plain, but that they carry a temporary enchantment that allows them to change colors to reflect the student's assigned House once he or she has been Sorted.

Obviously, robes sold to second-years and up are sold already in their House colors, since they already know it. But I find this is a good magical solution for First-years who don't know their House yet. Of course, it doesn't address the question of secondhand robes, I'll concede that.
