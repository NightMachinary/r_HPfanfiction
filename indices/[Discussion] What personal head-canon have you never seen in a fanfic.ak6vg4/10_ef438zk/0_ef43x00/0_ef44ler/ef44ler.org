That's true. Though I've noticed that the "wizards can't dress like Muggles to save their skins" aspect(which I always felt was rather silly) does seem to be severely downplayed in the movies.

I think if I had to think about it, the novel "robes" are probably meant to be traditional robes that are worn /as/ regular clothing or, in the case of students, their uniform, rather than what the movie does which is to have them wear light robes /over/ a more normal uniform.
