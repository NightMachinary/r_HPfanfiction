I'm sure that these are in some fanfictions, but these are just things I've come up with.

People are able to Apparate or use the Floo way of travel to different places around the world.

It takes more magic to Apparate, but you can still do it; if you concentrate hard enough on the location outside of Britain (Or wherever you live).

So you could visit America, France, German, Italy et cetra just by Apparation or Floo.

There are houses inside Hogsmeade, that are hidden. (I don't know if I remember reading this or not, but I've thought of this idea).

Using different languages make the spell more powerful. Say French, Italian, German, even Parseltongue makes the spell more powerful.

Andromeda Black was the one that was meant to marry Rodolphus, but she fled from it, and Bellatrix married him instead.
