During Christmas of /Order of the Phoenix/, Luna and her father went to visit the Weasleys. Because of the enchanted clock, they realized Arthur was in Mortal Peril.

Luna and Xenophilius spent the remainder of the holiday maintaining the Burrow--gathering vegetables, cleaning the rooms, etc. so that Molly and Arthur would find things easier when he returned home.

Luna never told Ginny this.
