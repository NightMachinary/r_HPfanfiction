This is dumb, but after watching the movies I developed a headcannon that Lavender Brown was a metamorphmagus (like Nymphadora Tonks) because of the race change of the actresses.

I know she obviously isn't, as nothing in the books or movies supports this, but it's a fun way to explain the obvious difference in actresses.
