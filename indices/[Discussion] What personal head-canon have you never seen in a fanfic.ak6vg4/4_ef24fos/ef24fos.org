Witches and Wizards cross countless borders if they want to eat regional food. If you can Apparate from London to the Highlands, then you can also reach Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt, Bordeaux, Hamburg, Copenhagen and Berlin. Fancy some Fries? Off to Belgium it is? Pizza? Germany/France and then Italy. Wanna buy a good wine? See previous example. Want to smoke weed? Amsterdam it is.

Obviously, someone like Malfoy wouldn't be caught dead with muggle beverages, but Tonks or the older Weasley brothers come across as if they were down for such shenanigans.
