The entire HRE would still be a thing since there is no Napoleon or 30 year war to overthrow it. And the low countries should still be a member. Although the HRE should be closer to the EU than a sovereign, unified nation.

America is also interesting because there is no reason for the magical colonial powers to sell off their parts of NA, since they were not involved in the Muggle wars. Or maybe Norway rules all of Canada.
