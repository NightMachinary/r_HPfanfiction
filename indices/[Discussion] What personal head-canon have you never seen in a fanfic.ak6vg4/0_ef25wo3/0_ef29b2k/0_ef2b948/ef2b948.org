My headcanon is that Magical America is separate from Britain and other European governments, but not because of the American revolution--it was always separate, Magical Britain and other European countries never had colonies, Magical societies in the New World were formed by immigrants who wanted to get away from stodgy European governments controlled by wealthy purebloods.

Don't really have a headcanon for Germany, it never really comes up in canon or fanfiction.
