Harry is worse in DH, but Hermione and Ginny are reduced to annoyance and sporty girl in HBP. I mean, in CoS Hermione comes up with Polyjuice on a mere hunch but when there are really suspicious circumstances around Malfoy, a simple stunner from behind and pulling up his sleeve is too much? Or a severing charm in the Great Hall? Of course, brewing Veritasserum is always an option as well. And Ginny loses all agency. She goes from "I will go with you" to "let's do this incredibly transparent ruse and you go off to win the war".

Tonks is fucked in both. Simple as that.
