HPB is character assassination? What is DH then? Seriously, Harry looks like a bumbling fool with the intelligence of a particularly stupid monkey in DH (he had MONTHS to prepare to hunt the 'cruxes and what does he do? "I will bring the clothes on my back and my wand, good enough - right?" Seriously, at that age I could plan things better! I would have raided muggle warehouses for food (or bought it, if I had enough funds!), especially the canned and non-perishable kind! I'd have had the tent (instead of Hermione! Hell, I might have done away with the tent and would have gone with a Fidelius instead on a property or hell, a small patch of land to set up the tent permanently!), I'd have had each of the trio carry one of those super-bags, I'd have purchased books for learning (you can't hunt day in and day out and some defense or potions learning is a good idea!) and potions ingrediants etc....seriously, Harry is such a moron in that book! That is IMHO character assassination! HBP? Nah...not really IMHO)
