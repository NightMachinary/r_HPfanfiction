Demelza Robins is the Daughter of Bellatrix Lestrange, who had been found abandoned by the Muggle Authorities after the Lestranges were thrown into Azkaban. The timeline fits if she was born between September 1st and October 31st 1981. And unlike her parents, Mel is perfectly adjusted and has no desire for magical fascism. She has been adopted and raised by a pair of Muggles and considers them her parents.

Obviously cracky, but something I came up with after reading the play which must not be named.
