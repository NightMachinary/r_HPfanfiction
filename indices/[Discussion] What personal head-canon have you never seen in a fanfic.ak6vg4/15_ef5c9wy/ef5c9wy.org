The only one I've got is of the genius halfblood that runs an assorted goods shop on the corner of Nocturn and Diagonally, Diagon-side, and a Gringotts magical ATM and hotel (read prison) on the Norturn-side. He has a Dark Room storage under the biulding, as well as a bunker incase the world goes to shit, and he lives on the second floor. He has the best wards money (and a friendship with the goblin nation) can buy, and he's never had a single customer.

Atleast, that would be my answer, If I didn't make a chapter of my misc fic in his name. I'm no good at writing, but what can you do when headcanon gets involved?
