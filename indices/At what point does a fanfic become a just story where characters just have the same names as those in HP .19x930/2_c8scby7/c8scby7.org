Easy one is removing the magic, all of the "normal high school" fic are basically "insert-teen-school-drama" plot with HP characters, regardless of how many other plot points they try to include. It's like an HP episode of Degrassi.

Changing schools, especially if it is to an original school...I can think of one or two REALLY GOOD stories, where Harry moves to a different school and it barely pays lip service to the fact that he is Harry Potter...in fact in one of them he actually changes his name. The whole story could stand on its own by removing the HP portions.

Complete personality switch, especially for main characters or multiple characters.
