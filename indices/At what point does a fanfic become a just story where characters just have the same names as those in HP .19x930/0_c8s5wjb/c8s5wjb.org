It is quite similar to haystack definition problem: remove straws one by one, define moment when former haystack is something else.

Story where this happened, or at least is near this: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son]]

But I would define it as moment when simply changing characters name will allow normal story publication without risk of rabid lawyers running around you.
