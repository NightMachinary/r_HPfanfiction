Most of the characters have established personalities, or at least the bare bones of one, based in canon. When the very basics of their personality are thrown out the window or ignored, it's just an OC with a shared name. Like, I personally like time travel Hermione/Sirius, but a major problem with the genre is Hermione's personality when in Marauder era. It tends to devolve into giggly teenage girl, which she is not.

Another way- lack of magic. There's no point. I understand AU and all, but seriously. The characters are magical, with a few Muggle/Squib/family exceptions.

Pairings that are ridiculous and far fetched, like Severus/Ron, can still be defended in an amazingly well written and developed plot. Anything can happen. But don't start a story where Snape and Ron are raising two gingers.
