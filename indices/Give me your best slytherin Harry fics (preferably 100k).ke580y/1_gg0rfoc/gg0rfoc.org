#+begin_quote
  Everything changes the summer of 5th year when a mere letter causes Harry's magic to react wildly and he finds out that Dumbledore has been controlling him and his friends a lot more than first thought. With the truth revealed to him, Harry shows everyone he isn't the Gryffindor Golden Boy everyone thinks he is and he isn't the only the one with masks. DarkEvilTrio! SLASH
#+end_quote

Okay, so Harry's /technically/ not in Slytherin, though he does show a ton of Slytherin tendencies with Ron and Hermione.

#+begin_quote
  On a dark and stormy night, the staff and students of Hogwarts were taken by surprise when four mysterious figures appeared outside on the grounds. Who are they and why do they look like the Founders? What does this mean for the war? AU Time travelling
#+end_quote

Harry's /literally/ Slytherin in this.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2697767/1/Founders-Heirs][Founders' Heirs]]

#+begin_quote
  AU preHBP. Harry and Company are sent to an alternate universe where his parents are still alive, he is dead and Voldemort is still very active. The twist, they have just beaten Voldemort in their dimension by uniting Hogwarts as the Founder's Heirs. HG, RH.
#+end_quote

Harry is also literally Slytherin in this one, too.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9622538/1/Travel-Secrets-First][Travel Secrets: First]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19162495/chapters/45546637][Harry Potter gets smart and takes control - The Goblet]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry's name comes out of the goblet and he's had enough, he's sick of pretending to be stupid, he's sick of constantly fighting against the whole world. It's time to step up and take control of his life.
#+end_quote

Not a Slytherin Harry fic (/yet/) but I figured I'd recommend it since it's pretty much my all-time favourite fic at the moment (when you can get past the first few extremely cliche chapters) and I recommend it to everyone.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19793110/chapters/46860157][Burning Red]]

#+begin_quote
  Around the time most young children's do, Harry's hair goes from his father's dark locks to his mother's bright, most-likely-magical red hair. It changes everything about who Harry identifies with, who he wants to grow up to be, and who he thinks he is. Instead of having James Potter as his idol, Lily Potter turns out to be a much better influence.

  So instead of seeing a scruffy, most-likely-a-muggleborn boy standing beside him in Madam Malkin's before their first year, Draco only has eyes for the scarlet haired, green-eyed creature who just walked into his life and instead of an enemy, he finds a reason to be better than he'd been raised to be. Not that Harry will ever notice, given he's trying to simply survive at Hogwarts.

  And Severus might not make it to see these boys graduate when his heart kept giving out seeing his very-Slytherin godson repeat his own history and go chasing after a green-eyed, red-haired Gryffindor.
#+end_quote

In which red-haired Harry Potter gets sorted into Gryffindor (due to his ambition to bring the Hogwarts Houses together, which couldn't be done if he was in Slytherin) and plays politics with the Slytherins to gain favour among them.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22901587/chapters/54739021][Harry Potter and the Secrets Within]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is unprepared for the day a heavy, yellow envelope arrives at No. 4 Privet Drive with his name on it. Perhaps his friend and scaly ally, Forest, knows something about it.
#+end_quote

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461][Evitative]]

#+begin_quote
  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn.

  Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.
#+end_quote

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1144601][Grounding Magic series]]

#+begin_quote
  Last time Harry was lead around by his nose. Only seeing what others wanted him to, only doing what others wanted to. Everyone had their own agenda, and it eventually got them all killed. Except Harry, who couldn't die thanks to accidentally becoming the master of death in his teens. Now he's back. A new timeline, a whole new world of opportunity. He'll save the world, but not by following anyone's script for him.
#+end_quote

It's not Slytherin Harry /yet/, but it has some of the best world-building and characterizations I've ever seen.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8671198/chapters/19877506][Pathetic, Ordinary, Liars]]

#+begin_quote
  Dark AU where the trio is sorted into Slytherin\\
  Hermione, who wants to use knowledge to change the world\\
  Ron, who wants to finally be free of his family's shadow\\
  Harry, who wants to be great, to be admired, to be /free/
#+end_quote

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13893606/chapters/31970736][souls touch, and the future changes]]

#+begin_quote
  Albus Dumbledore watched two visionaries start as driven, powerful, brilliant young men, and become monsters. He has no heir, no protege of equal power to step in should another one rise, and he is old. So when he hears of a Chosen One with power the Dark Lord knows not, he thinks maybe he doesn't want this boy prophesied to defeat Lord Voldemort to grow up in the Wizarding world. He thinks of the bonds of family, and the opportunity he has to shape his world's politics, and of a corrupt magical elite who've signed on with two Dark Lords over hatred of Muggles. He thinks Harry Potter should grow up loved by his family, and Voldemort be destroyed so there is no need for Harry to ever realize his power, and he acts to make both of those things happen. Because he's Dumbledore and what he wants, he gets.

  Usually.

  When you dabble with improvised ritual magic, you should be aware there might be unforeseen consequences. For example: souls touch.
#+end_quote

In which Harry grows up in an orphanage after Voldemort is destroyed (completely) and is a little more similar to Tom Riddle than Dumbledore expected. It has excellent world-building, characterization, and very much appreciated Slytherin politics. Oh, and magically powerful and independent Harry.

Its sequel is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24096307/chapters/58001593][right under their noses]].

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2352896/chapters/5191223][Gelosaþ in Écnesse]]

#+begin_quote
  Caught in the backlash of Voldemort's Killing Curse, Harry is thrown through time to a world so very different from his own.
#+end_quote

After being thrown back to the age of the Founders, Salazar Slytherin is the one to find an extremely injured Harry. He promptly heals Harry, finds out about his past, promises to find a way to bring him back to the future, and invites Harry back to the newly-opened Hogwarts as one of his snakes.

*I know some of these aren't what you asked for, but I hope you enjoy them anyway!*
