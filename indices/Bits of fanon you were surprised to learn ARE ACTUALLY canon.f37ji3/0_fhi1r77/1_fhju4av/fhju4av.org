There are two things (in a canon sense) I have trouble with in CC. One, Harry's scar hurting. Two, this. And hopefully I'm misremembering the scar thing.

My solution? Cursed Child is a Skeeter book. Voila. Everything in it actually happened but nothing specific is believable.

I'm pretty sure the Trolley Witch appears in the books too (off the express) but CC also makes her seem like an automaton so it doesn't really add up. Which is exactly the same as reading Skeeter's news articles (which /are/ canon) and concluding that Harmony is canon.
