I've read the books and watched the movies, as well as obviously read fanfictions. Sometimes though it's easier and faster to watch the movies more, then it is to read the books, even though there's a LOT with the movies I don't like.

Mudblood being written in Hermione's arm in the movie, when it wasn't in the books, the characterization of Ron Weasley, Peeves not being in the movies, many lines or moments given to Hermione as exposition in the movies instead.
