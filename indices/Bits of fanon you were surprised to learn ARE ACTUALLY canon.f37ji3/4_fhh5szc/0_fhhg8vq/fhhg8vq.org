That's going to depend on how you define canon.

In the books we see /tents/ that are magically expanded within them to the size of a flat and Moody's trunk has seven compartments but all we know about them is that the first six of them only held normal amounts of trunk stuff . The last and biggest compartment isn't a flat. It's a deep, bare pit of a room large enough to hold an unconscious man and enough oxygen to stop him dying. Moody /survived/ living in there for months but I don't think he enjoyed it.

OK so there's a trunk with it's own little world inside it in Fantastic Beasts but honestly, I'm pretty sure the invention of trunks with flats in them predates those films by a decade, if not more.
