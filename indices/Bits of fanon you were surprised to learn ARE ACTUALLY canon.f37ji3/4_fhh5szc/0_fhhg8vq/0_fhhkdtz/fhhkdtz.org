I'm pretty sure trunks with flats started from a reasonable extrapolation of Moody's trunk. We know that the space inside an object can be expanded. The one that's shown is a quite drastic expansion of a tent, with the implication that this is a very basic expansion and more extensively expanded models exist (IIRC, it's been a while since I read /Goblet/). It's canon that a trunk can have multiple instances of its own innards accessed from the same point, see Moody's trunk (also in /Goblet/). There is no word on whether instance overlapping and space expansion destructively interfere.

Therefore, the flat-like trunks and even the trunks with /multiple/ flat-sized compartments are not entirely unreasonable.
