I mean they're obviously possible

Space can be magically expanded and contracted (King's Cross, Hermione's beaded bag)

Moody's trunk exists

Newt's fucking planet-in-a-box exists

It seems to me though that these things are most likely extremely expensive or have to be made yourself. Another possibility is that the charm is difficult to cast at greater strengths, to the point where few people are capable of performing it. It probably follows some sort of math, requiring more skill and concentration as the inner volume multiplies.

Any writer adding these absurdly powerful items needs to keep two things in mind:

1. If this is so easy to get, most people need to have it.

2. If not everyone has it, then it needs to be hard to get.
