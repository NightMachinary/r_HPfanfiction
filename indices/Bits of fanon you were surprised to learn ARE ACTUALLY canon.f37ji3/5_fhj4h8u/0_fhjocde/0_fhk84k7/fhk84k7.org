  Wdym, JKR spends several pages on it. To be precise, 7 whole pages. 1600+ words. I just checked.

Sure, but indy!Harry fics would use less time to set up the entire story for the year. Given that Harry is an abused kid that just left an abusive situation to live alone with copious money he has sole control over & absolute freedom before going back to school, he uses that time pretty tamely.

  Tbh not sure what else you wanted here. [...] If anything, I could do with less giants.

Sure, but from a writing standpoint its a bit of a strange choice to spend so much time on something that never comes up again. Arguably it also tokenizes Madame Maxime given that we never get even a throwaway line to refer to her again, as the only surviving Head of any of the major wizarding schools by the end of HBP. Compare if JK had introduced Luna for OOTP and then dropped her with no further reference for the rest of the series. It's especially odd given that JKR's writing style generally brings back past characters & ties off loose ends e.g. Lupin, Moody, the epilogue, even Mrs Figg!
