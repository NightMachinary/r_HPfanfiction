  Harry as a 13 year old actually spending two weeks living alone in Diagon Alley while staying in essentially a hostel or hotel. You would think that how he spent those weeks would have been worth covering in-text but no, not for JK.

Wdym, JKR spends several pages on it. To be precise, 7 whole pages. 1600+ words. I just checked.

  That weird side story of Hagrid and Madame Maxime going off to visit the giants' colony that never came up again.

Tbh not sure what else you wanted here. They failed with the giants. We get Grawp (unfortunately - never liked that subplot). And the giants that attack Hogwarts later. And the ones that attack muggle villages that we hear about. If anything, I could do with less giants. They were boring imo.
