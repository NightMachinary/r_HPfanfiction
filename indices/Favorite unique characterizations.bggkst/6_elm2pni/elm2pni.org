Ew, sure, this seems fun!

Daphne Greengrass in Cage and Key by Faromir linkffn(1022385) and The Legacy Preservation Act by James Spookie linkffn(10649604) For Cage and Key: This has always been one of my favourites (though fair warning, it is unfinished) she isn't really her typical “Ice Queen” in this story, even though I actually enjoy that gimmick. Without giving too much away, she is definitely still Slytherin, but she is genuinely just a normal person, all be it a very driven one. It's probably the most realistic portrayal as well, that is, while still being enjoyable.

As for James Spookie's story, I'm sure most of you have read this, but I really do love Daphne in this fic. I can't actually remember if she has the “ice queen” moniker, but I don't believe she does. What makes this one so great for me is the many layers to her character and it is definitely the best case of Daphne character development in any story I've read.

For Wormtail, I second Prince of Slytherin for all the reasons already mentioned. linkffn(11191235)

Also, see the above link for a very interesting Gilderoy Lockhart, definitely OOC, but I enjoy him nonetheless.

Harry Potter: Harry Potter and Delphini Riddle: A Matrimony Made For Peace. linkffn(10205249) I may get nuked for this since it contains a character from the most hated Harry Potter work ever, The Cursed Child. I promise you though, it does not use ANYTHING from that play. It is set in Harry's sixth year. It's not a perfect fic by any means, but I think this is one of the most accurate portrayals of Harry ever written, and I actually love Delphini's character as well, so I won't add her as her own character as I haven't read enough fics of her to tell, but this is my favourite portrayal of her that I have read. Another fair warning though, it's also unfinished.

Draco and Lucius Malfoy: Travel Secrets Series by E4mj. linkffn(9622538) linkffn(966829) linkffn(10139565) To be fair, I'm not really sure if this is my favourite, but I think it is DEFINITELY the most accurate one I've read. Draco is still kind of pathetic, and doesn't play a huge role, but I think it's a good story for what would have happened if he had a contender for power in Slytherin.

Tom Riddle (not Voldemort, Tom Riddle) En Passant linkffn(10857053)

Also unfinished, but this one NAILED TMR!

I could go on for other characters but I'll leave it here. Also, if you disagree, I'd be happy to discuss, but no attacks please.
