Honestly though the whimpering fool wormtail irritates me so much I mean he was able to fool the order, fool his friends, become an animagus before school was over, find Voldemort and help resurrect him. Where does it even come from the only thing I remember is learning he wasn't as brave and talented as james and Sirius which is honestly most people.
