Some of these aren't really unique, but I really liked their characterization there.

- Hermione's parent in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10914042/1/Sympathetic-Properties][Sympathetic Properties]], it explains how Hermione could turn from 'We could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled' to turn Snape's robe on fire in just a couple of chapters.
- Wormtail in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][HP & Prince of Slytherin]]. It shows how he cunning he can be, not a whimpering fools we see in other story.
- Protective!Dudley in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4113087/1/A-Different-Fate][A Different Fate]].
