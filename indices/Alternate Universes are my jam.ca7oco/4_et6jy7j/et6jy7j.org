Linkffn(Patron by Starfox5)

Ultra-traditionalist AU where the only reason Hermione wasn't sold to the highest bidder (Malfoy) is that Harry got her first. Characters are mostly the same, just a little bit more badass.

Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died)

AU where Malfoy finished where Voldemort left off and took over Britain back in 1981.

Harry, Ron and the Order all live in France while Hermione is brainwashed with all the other mudbloods as soldiers loyal only to Malfoy himself. They don't meet until Ron returns to Britain as a spy to prepare the coup. Things get kinda interesting between the two.

Linkffn(The Granger Principle)

Modern AU by the same author. So far only 4 chapters but weekly updates and the author has more than a dozen finished stories so it probably won't get abandoned.
