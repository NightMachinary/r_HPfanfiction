Non magical AUs:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(half awake and almost there): nice Harry/Ginny romance in which Harry is an interesting celebrity.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: my favorite non magical AU so far. Here, the Purebloods are the European aristocrats, the Weasleys become the Wellesleys, Hogwarts is a spy school for the British elites, and Riddle is an aristocratic mad scientist bent on overthrowing the British democracy. It's also a 660k words long completed epic with an awesome Trio.
