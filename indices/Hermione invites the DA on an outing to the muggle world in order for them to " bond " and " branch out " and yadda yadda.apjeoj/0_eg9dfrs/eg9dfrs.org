"So this ship - it swims without sails, oars or magic?"

"I guess it could at some point, but not anymore," Hermione replied. Harry watched with amusement how his best friend had become an impromptu tour guide once they had entered London. Umbridge might have busted them and forbidden any meetings, but the educational decrees didn't apply to Hogsmeade. Nor did they forbid flooing to Diagon Alley and taking the bus from Charring Cross.

"It's - big," Hannah said slowly and a few of her house mates burst out laughing while she blushed fiercely. "I - How many people were on that thing?"

"Over eight hundred, although the exact number changed over the years."

"Wow. How do you feed that many people? They didn't have house elves, did they?"

"Of course not, the UK outlawed slavery almost two centuries ago. There were food stores for several weeks, and you could filter the sea water -"

"I still don't get what's so special about it," Zacharias Smith threw in with a dismissive wave at the grey and blue hulk on the River Thames. Six inch guns - my wand is twice that size."

Hermione did her best to ignore Alicia's shouted /you wish/ but couldn't stop the smile tugging on her lips. "The size refers to the diameter of the shells, not the length of the weapon. And it is common knowledge that grith is more important than length."

It was perhaps a little harsh on Smith, but as far as Harry was concerned, he deserved to be taken down a peg or two. Although Katie's next comment made him wonder if perhaps there was anyone the Hufflepuff had not yet annoyed.

"Poor Megan."

At that point, Hermione abandoned any attempt to tell the DA about HMS Belfast and joined the laughter. They might not get the tour she had envisioned, but they were having fun free from Umbridge.
