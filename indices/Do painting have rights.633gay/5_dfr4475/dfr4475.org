I've always found this an interesting question. By modern ethical standards, one would think that any sentient being must have a few basic rights. But in the Wizarding world, which seems to only give any serious rights to human wizards? Perhaps not.

I have a feeling that most wizards treat paintings as nothing more than a curiosity - regardless of sentience.
