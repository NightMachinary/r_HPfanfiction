The portraits of Hogwarts serve the Headmaster, is this because they choose to or are they bound to the castle and its Headmaster when they are created? I can't imagine they are sentient in the traditional sense or else it would be seen as a form of immortality. They're an echo and little more or else they wouldn't be content just sitting on walls.
