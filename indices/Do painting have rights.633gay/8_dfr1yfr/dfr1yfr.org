This is a Harry Potter fanfic subreddit none of it is serious. But I was just thinking as I know they need to be enchanted, yes most paintings probably only have simple tasks like talk/laugh/move a bit, could you enchant them well enough to become as intelligent as humans maybe more so. I mean the paintings in Hogwarts can have conversations to people in the real world interact with other artwork and they feel emotions like when the fat lady says she 'sees' Sirius black and is genuinely terrified. So they are showing human traits feelings and communication which may lead to the ethics like you can't destroy a painting if they have their own thought and conversations and can make their own choices even if they are simple. I'm kind of looking at them more as like AI of the wizarding world and if you can enchant them well enough you could make life in a sense.
