This isn't serious, right? or is it? I can't tell.

If you are serious, then no, paintings don't have rights, because while they are sentient, they aren't alive. Neither are they the person they're representing. They're just sentient only due to enchantments, and they can't do anything beyond what they've been enchanted.

You probably don't need permission to make portraits in the HPverse, but laws there are finnecky.

Again, it's not ALL paintings in the wizarding world which are sentient, it's only the ones that have been enchanted to act and move that way. So no, graffiti wouldn't be sentient, unless it's been enchanted.
