My guess? There would probably be laws akin to animal cruelty laws, but maybe not in Britain.

If you think about Animal Cruelty laws, they are more about restricting human behavior we find repulsive rather than protecting the actual rights of animals. That is why these laws apply even to animals (like insects) that generally aren't viewed as 'thinking'. We still allow them to be ... manhandled for certain reasons (Science, art, whatever for instance), but the idea of someone doing it to get their gollies off offends us and we ban that.

Or another example, we find someone taking an ant-hill cast ok but the concept of someone sitting torturing ants to be repulsive.

The portraits are reasonable facsimiles of humans. Even if everyone agreed that they were completely anatomic, people would still find the behavior of tormenting one to be repulsive and self-destructive, which would be enough to imagine laws banning it.

Exactly what laws would depend on the legal framework you are sticking it into. After all, even something like pornography is considered repulsive and self-harming, but is generally not banned in the US because of free speech concerns. For exactly how the laws would be structured, you'd have to imagine the legal system you are talking about and what similar laws would be in place.

The reason I say maybe not in Britain is because the Ministry of Magic is generally depicted as backwards and archaic. I would suspect this could easily be put into the catalog of 'laws that are behind the times'. If they did have something, it might be based on the older principals of nobility. i.e.: A crime to defile the portrait of a noble house, or for anyone outside of the family to do so, or something.
