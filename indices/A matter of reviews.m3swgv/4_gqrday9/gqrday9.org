I'll review any time I have a thought.

So pretty much every oneshot I read ills review.

If it's a multichapter fic I won't review every chapter but I will end up spamming every few chapters with just incoherent yelling of approval... I'm sure those authors hate me as they wake up with 10-20 emails of just me....

But yeah, I know how just stoked I get when I get a review on my story so I'll always review other people's. It's just polite.
