First of all, thank you for taking the time to comment on people's work. It really means a lot to writers. Every time I get a comment, it makes me grin like an idiot!! I like to reply to comments (as much as humanly possible), so it makes it easier if people comment on the most recent chapter. My work is currently floating at chapter 32, so it makes it A LOT easier for me if it's on the last chapter. That being said, if people want to leave a comment, I don't really care where they leave it. It'll make me happy all the same! :)
