You didn't specify, so I suppose I ought to ask: have you any issues with pairings and subjects? I have a few pre-HBP fics to offer, but several focus primarily on pairings--specifically some Harry/Draco, a couple of Hermione/Snape, and one Harry/Ginny. Also I have a rec that contains a lot of graphic gore and violence, plus some Weasley/Dumbledore bashing.
