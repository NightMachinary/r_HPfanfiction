[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6365342/1/Unintended-Consequences][Unintended Consequences]] is a really good one. Basically Ron and Hermoine leave Harry one night after an argument while looking for horcruxes so he finds Ginny at Hogwarts and they end up going on the hunt themselves. It's hard to impress how good of a story this is without giving away any spoilers but I thought it was great.
