Back when I was younger I thought I was really really good at writing. Today, when reading the stuff from when I was younger, I cringe hard and want to hurt myself.

My point is - dont worry yourself.

The story you want to tell should be playing in your head like a movie. Doesnt really matter if its a frame-by-frame movie or running in 60 fps HD 3D VR-Holodeck Quality. Write it down as it happens. You can easily edit sentences later on. Phrasing comes with experience.
