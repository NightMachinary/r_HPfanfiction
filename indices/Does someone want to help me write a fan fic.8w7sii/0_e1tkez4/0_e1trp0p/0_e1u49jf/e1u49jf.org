It can work though. I'm currently writing a collab fic with my friend, and it's going quite well. I'm not saying it's easy, but it does have benefits. If you find someone who can compliment your strengths and weaknesses, it can work really well.

To be honest though, it probably won't work that well over the internet. You'd probably do best looking for a writing-buddy/beta who can look over your stuff and you can bounce ideas off.

Good luck!
