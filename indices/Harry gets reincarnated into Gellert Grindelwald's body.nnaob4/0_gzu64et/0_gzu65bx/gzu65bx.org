  Harry started laughing madly. When he woke up in 1883 as a baby Gellert Grindelwald, he thought his life couldn't get any crazier. Now as he looked at his two best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, sorry, he meant, Arcturus Black and Honoria Dumbledore, he had to swallow his words."Â¡Shut up, Harry!" Hermione yells, tossing her hair."You've got it easy, 'Mione," says Ron through pursed lips. "At least you won't be your own grandmother's mother, some of us don't have the same luck"
