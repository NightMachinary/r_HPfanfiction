I found this one yesterday and have been junk reading it... damn it hits heavy. I really like these types of stories... but whilst I'm reading them really gets me in a mood, one that I can't help but feel sad about. It's been an excellent read so far and I still have 10 chapters to go! Thank you for the suggestion, if I wasn't reading it already it would definitely be on my list!
