Linkao3(14340108) It starts with the number 3. Voldemort died at the DoM battle and Harry wants some freedom but the order make him stay the whole summer at the Dursley. Harry rans away and start living alone working as a waitress. Harry/George/Fred It's really good and the author has another story that is time travel.

Linkao3(12391806) One shot with a really good take on Harry, Ron and Hermione's friendship

Linkao3(14016627) Paranoia and puns. One the best short works that I've read. It's Cedric/Harry, really funny with great takes on the characters

Linkao3(14164617) An hour of Wolves. It's really dark, Harry's been raped and deals with the aftermath, it hasn't been updated in a while but it's not abandoned. At the end it starts getting better, so if you can put with all the bad things at the begining at the end we see a little bit of light.

Sorry if my descriptions are kinda bad, English it's not my first language. If you like the fics I have a lot more
