My favourites would be the works of FloreatCastellum, inc her latest, Wood for the Trees. Also Annerb, Queen of the Changeling story and its wonderful sequels. She has also written other Hinny stories which are great. I have to recommend the Its TeaTime series by frombluetored. And I have to add Jenorama to this list, she started writing back in the Checkmated days, and she has written a great series of one shots and small stories before she wrote the multi chap California Dreamin' and several more short stories, all in her Potterverse. Shout outs to gryffindormischief and the distantdusk, they have great stories worth checking out. All the above authors write the characters so well, so realistically, and their stories are Hinny. I will give a shout out to starlightpeddler's The Quietly Series too, which is Scorbus based. Im sure Ive missed heaps of great writers and stories, but these are ones i can read over and over!
