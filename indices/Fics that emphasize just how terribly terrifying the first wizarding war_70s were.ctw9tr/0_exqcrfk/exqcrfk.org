I'd also add something a lot of people seem to forget is that Voldemort was a terrorist with essentially government backing. His followers kept the aurors from fighting efficiently, people up against him might come home to find their family had been tortured and killed. You never knew who was really your friend and who was secretly spying or imperioused or polyjuiced. It wasn't a conventional war and that's what made Voldemort so bad. He'd attack innocent people to make a point.
