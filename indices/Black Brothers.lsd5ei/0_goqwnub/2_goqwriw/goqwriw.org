  In the summer of 1979, Regulus Black vanished from British wizarding society with horcrux in hand, ducking his head down into the obscurity of a French village to complete his task of destroying Slytherin's locket - and with it, a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new.

  I'm going bonkers, Harry thinks to himself as he tears through the pile of Muggle pamphlets. He scowls at the titles, things like ‘Foolproof Guide to Losing a Loved One' or ‘Navigating the Stages of Grief.' Like another tasteless advert in the Daily Prophet: Muggle Therapist Version.But what can he do? One, he's desperate for any answer, magical or not. And, two, he's pretty sure that it is not normal to cope with Sirius's death accident by hallucinating his dead ex-Death Eater little brother as his personal pet ghost.Which is why, as he checks over his shoulder, he's hoping really, really hard that the problem is gone. But---“Loath as I am to say it, Potter,” drawls the flickering, irritated spirit of Regulus Arcturus Black, “I'm inclined to believe that we are stuck together. Indefinitely.”...( Or, a foolproof guide to mourning your dead godfather, getting haunted by his dead brother, befriending snakes, smashing lockets, and defeating the Dark Lord in the process. )
