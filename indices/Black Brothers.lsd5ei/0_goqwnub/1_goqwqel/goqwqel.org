[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23261428][*/He Comes Out of the Black Lake Quite Mad/*]] by [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/BennieLee/pseuds/BennieLee][/BennieLee/]]

#+begin_quote
  Regulus Black comes out of the black lake quite mad, very much his mother's son. Hogwarts will keep him safe, says Dumbledore, who offers him the post of Charms professor.But Regulus hasn't stopped drowning (lungs saturated with water, mind torn apart) and the face of Harry Potter, who looks too much like James, makes him realize the war is never over.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23594878][*/My brother, the escapee/*]] by [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/BennieLee/pseuds/BennieLee][/BennieLee/]]

#+begin_quote
  The underlying fact is that Professor Black is the brother of the mass-murdering, You-Know-Who supporting, escapee: Sirius Black. And Harry's feelings are quite mixed---because Professor Black was never really a teacher Harry got along with yet, at the same time, Harry knows too well the feeling of being blamed for something you didn't do. (In which the events of PoA are retold with a surly, sneering, Slytherin Charms professor).

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.

#+begin_quote
  Regulus was five when he learned that his mother was a cruel woman. Fresh from the cave and with revenge burning bright in his heart, Regulus was determined to restore his honour and rectify his mistakes - starting with his brother's godson. Faced with the inevitable return of the Dark Lord, Regulus prepared as best he could, but not even he foresaw all the consequences of his decision.

  At the end of the war, one man lost his freedom and one child went missing. Regulus was unable to act at the time, out of touch with his brother and unaware of the Dark Lord's actions. Now, nearly a decade later, Regulus's world changes again when his brother is released back into his care- damaged but alive. Regulus can do nothing for Sirius's sanity now, but seeing his brother reminds him of who Sirius used to be. A fighter. A Gryffindor. A proud man. A good friend. A strong ally.A godfather.
