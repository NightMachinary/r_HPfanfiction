Ah, my two favourite boys!!

I love everything by TheDivineComedian, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663/chapters/34132413][Blackpool]] linkao3(14760663) is magnificent.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20233435][Bindings, Bindings]] linkao3(20233435) is an ongoing work, but there are great moments with Regulus and Sirius, the other Marauders, baby Harry, and the wider Black family!

And if I may throw in a couple of my own?

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24095437][is this hell?]] linkao3(24095437) is from Regulus's POV and explores what might have happened if Kreacher didn't leave Regulus in the cave as ordered, but took him to Sirius instead.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26691385][Brother]] linkao3(26691385) is from Sirius's POV, set during his first mission with the Order during the first war.
