  Regulus waits for hours. For hours, he stands on that cursed cliff, the black waters churning and gushing and crashing far below. Even as far up as he is, the air is heavy with spray. He breathes in the salt, and tries to cast his mind back to childhood visits the seaside. He can't. It smells too much like blood.There is an odd noise behind him, inhuman footsteps, nails on rock-Regulus spins around and finds a large, wet, dog. It's huge, and black. The dark eyes are wide and intelligent; far too intelligent to be a convenient stray.  Regulus laughs hysterically. He has been sent a Grim. An omen of death that should be sent to the unwary, not to someone who is attempting what is tantamount to suicide.   The Grim walks closer, eyes wary, and Regulus tells it helplessly, "It is alright, I already know." His voice doesn't waver, and he takes a moment to be viciously proud of himself for that. "I am going to die."Or:Regulus hopes for a chance to say goodbye to Sirius, and somehow that changes everything.
