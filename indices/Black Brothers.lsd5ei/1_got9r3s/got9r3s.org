Ummm... Am totally not reading The Heir of House Black on my other device at all right now!

The fic with Regulus being an auror in Australia - it might be the infamous Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, though you might remember it if it was. POS is a WIP on the fourth book at the moment. There are a couple of prophecies, and a secret power in Slytherin. Regulus does end up in England, and I will not give too many things away because honestly, the second book has an inumerable number of plot twists and is completely amazing. Jut saying.

Even is it isn't the fic you're looking for, it's an amazing one to read and I would recommend it many many times over. It takes the usual WBWL, Slytherin!Harry trope and turns it into something amazing - loads of people have tried to copy its style, and the only one anywhere close to it (that I've read) is ACI100's series.
