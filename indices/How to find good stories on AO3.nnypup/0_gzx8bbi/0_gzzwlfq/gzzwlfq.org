Is it common for your ship to be purely porn whenever you search for it? Because mine has 20 beautiful recs.\\
The first one is romance and disgustingly cute. The second one is actually a really awesome fic I've read a couple of times. The third one is legit tagged as 'Fluff'. The fourth one is rated teen and is a fucking brilliant fic like dude that's such a good fic. The next is 'fuckng hell guys there's so much fluff' or something like that. You get the idea.\\
So is this just common for your ship or?
