Great. I don't care. Not my point.

I don't like 'Harry/Death Eater' fics. I like drarry. That is my ship.

I followed your advice. I searched for my ship, and then filtered out some tags I don't like (I'm pretty liberal with this, since I don't care much), etc. etc.It gone me fluff and teen fics. Fics with brilliant plot.For example, it gave me Running on Air. Surely you know that fic, don't you? The one written beautifully without any slash sex scenes whatsoever? With a clever and well-written plot?Surely you've heard of it.

Also, are you sure you have never, in your life, read a sex scene? ever? so is the problem with slash sex or just sex in general?\\
And not to mention you have just equated 'one (1) sexual content scene' with 'PORN'.\\
Really I see some issues with your thinking.
