Start by going to the filter button, scroll down to exclude, then check off Explicit under Ratings and apply it.

AO3's tagging system is exhausting. You'll have to start out with filtering out the main tags you don't like (m/m, , multi, etc) then also do things like manually type tags to exclude out under "Other tags to exclude". Note the common tags on stories you don't like and type them in there if they're not listed by default.

It might take an hour of filtering out 100 or more commons tags that are all slight variations of the same thing. Once you have yours created, bookmark it in the browser.

Edit: you'll also want to change the sorting to either Kudos or Reviews. Those will be the most popular. Make sure that you filter out explicit first or the top will be all porn stories.
