Oh, there's this fic, I'm pretty sure it's called Second String, Harry got his soul sucked out by a dementor before 5th year and got sent back in time, to a slightly different but very similar 1975. People assume he's a squib, so he rolls with it, and in secret practices spells from a book of household charms, and gets really good at them. Pretty sure he does use a scourgify or similar the way you mentioned, but also uses other household spells unconventionally. It's WIP but currently updating, on Ao3, and Harry is eventually in a relationship with a man, but it's not a main part of the fic, and easily skimmed if you'd rather not read it. I'm on my phone atm, but I'll edit the post to link the fic later.
