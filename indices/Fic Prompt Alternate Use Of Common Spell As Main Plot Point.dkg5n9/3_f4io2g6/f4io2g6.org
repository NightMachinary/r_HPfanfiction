I remember reading a fic once where Harry used a cleaning spell in the final battle with Voldemort, and Voldemort chokes on dust and dies. Then, he levitates the body back to Hogwarts and freaks everyone out. I think is was a longer fic, there was more to the story than just the alternate usage of a common spell, but the cleaning charm scene was hilarious. Can't remember the name of it, though.
