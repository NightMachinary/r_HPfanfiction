In linkffn(A Black Comedy), Harry has completely and utterly mastered both the Summoning and Banishing charms to the point that he basically has straight-up telekinesis. In-story, it manifests as a bunch of normally-invisible magic arms because reasons or rule of cool or whatever, but without special glasses to see them it just looks like he's moving shit with his mind.

Obligatory warning that it has a very particular type of humor which hasn't aged terribly well, but the plot is still good IMO.
