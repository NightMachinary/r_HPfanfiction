I actually wouldn't recommend my fic for OP. I went for what I thought would realistically happen, which was a gentle escalation of violence over the course of the year as the Death Eaters struggle to maintain an aura of civility and control, as well as most people simply trying to survive. While my fic has dark moments, I think OP would be disappointed.
