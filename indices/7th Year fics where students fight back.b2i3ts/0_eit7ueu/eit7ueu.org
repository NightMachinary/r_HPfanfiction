The most notable one is Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, but both the fic and the author are, lets say, /controversial/. The fic has now been deleted, but if you want to find a mirror you might be able.

In trying to track down DAYD I came across [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7kfxke/does_anyone_have_a_copy_of_dumbledores_army_and/dt3wu71/][this comment]] from [[/u/Dina-M][u/Dina-M]] that gives a few recs.
