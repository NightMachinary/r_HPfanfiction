I didn't last one month in the ASOIF fandom, between the hardcore fans the books and the fans of different characters. I realized it made me hate the universe more than liking it. So I would say they're more extreme. Some fandoms are like that tbh and others not. /Wink/ star wars /wink/ .What's good with HP is that it's been years since the release of the books/movies so all the tensions decreased a lot. I'm glad you don't get comments like that in your HP fanfics and sorry for the unfair critics you get on your others fics.
