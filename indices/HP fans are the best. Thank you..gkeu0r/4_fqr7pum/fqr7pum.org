ASOIAF world is crazy complex, keeping track of what canon events do to the world is hard; imagine with a fanfic. I think that the only way to enjoy a ff of this world is to ignore the huge world building that will be probably ignored, and it goes against the canon setting.

I just don't think the ASOIAF books are a good area for fanfiction.
