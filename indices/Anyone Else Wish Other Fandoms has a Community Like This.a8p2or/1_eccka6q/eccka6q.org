The Parahumans/Worm fandom is really good. Based around the web series written by Wildbow (proper spelling: Willybboopip), they are:\\
1) Worm- a superpowers story in an original world.\\
2) Pact- a story of magic users set in modern times.\\
3) Twig- a biopunk story set in an alternate history.\\
4) Ward- sequel to Worm. Currently in progress.

The dedicated subreddit to his writings is [[/r/parahumans][r/parahumans]]. Worm/Ward by far has the most active fandoms with [[/r/Wormfanfic][r/Wormfanfic]] and [[/r/wormmemes][r/wormmemes]].
