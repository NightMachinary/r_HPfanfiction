I made a post a while ago on [[/r/whowouldwin][r/whowouldwin]]'s "Sell Me On: Worm" thread, which was basically an open invitation for people who keep seeing Worm get recommended but want to know if it's worth the bother of reading it. They do something similar each week.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/a1snof/sell_me_onworm/eat1clg/?context=3][Here's my post]], but if that's too long, most of the other comments are more succinct.
