There's only four Pokemon stories that I currently follow and they are all sort of similar to each other. Traveler, The Challenger, Legend and Uprising. I've tried going through ffn a few times just trying to find something new to read in this fandom but it's all either from the pokemon's perspective or it focuses too much on romance.
