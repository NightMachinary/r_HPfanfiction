I wish more of the comic book fandoms - specifically Spider-Man had an active fanfiction community like this one. So much of those fandoms are just smut, It'd be nice for more what-if type stories like there are in this community. Especially because Spider-Man and Marvel already have a "multi-verse" established as canon.
