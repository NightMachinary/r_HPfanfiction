Oh god, so much cringy kirk/spock, I think I now understand a little what ptsd must be like. For context in my early teens when tng was comeing out there was a huge resurgence of TOS fanfic, and it was the first fandom I read, i remeber searching through absolute oceans of kirk/spock writen by fangirls in search of space combat centric fics.
