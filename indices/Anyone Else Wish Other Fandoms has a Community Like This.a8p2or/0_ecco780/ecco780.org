It would be nice for sure, but most fandoms simply lack the numbers to support this level of activity. On average active fandoms have around 5000 fics on ffnet. Harry Potter has 800000. Twice as many as the second biggest fandom.

The activity levels here are a subproduct of the mindblowing amount of content.
