I know what you mean. I think I might just be burnt out on fanfiction in general but I've found myself having a really high bar these days.

I'm only about a dozen chapters in this one, Robb Returns linkffn(11384558) but it seems promising. The author really knows the source material and it's over 400k words which is nice.
