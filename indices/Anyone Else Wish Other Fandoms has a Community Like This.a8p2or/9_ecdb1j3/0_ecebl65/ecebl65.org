The Firefly corpus is pretty static at this point (though there are a few people still writing new pics for it) and I think that's part of the reason why there's no community around it. There's just not enough content (and new content) to justify talking about :/

My personal recommendations for the fandom are: - linkffn(Forward by Peptuck): Great "Season 2" continuation that really feels like the show and is even divided into episodes. Focused on River post-Serenity, but everyone gets some character growth. If you don't read all of it, make sure to skip ahead and read the Last Man episode, starting on chapter 66. It's one of the best Western stories I've come across and is a perfect depiction of Jayne. - linkffn(Two Gorram Days by Dyce) and the rest of the Horseshoe Nail series: A somewhat fluffy shipping fic focused on River/Jayne. I don't normally go for shipping fics, but this has an actual plot and is the best explanation I've seen for why River and Jayne are actually a good match. Definitely white-washes Jayne a bit though. - linkffn(A man of honor by thescarredman) and the rest of the Firefly Mythverse: Hands down, best writing in the fandom. The series develops all of the characters nicely, but Jayne, Simon, and Badger get masterful treatments that turn them into utterly fascinating characters. Badger's arc in particular makes you realize how shallow canon's depiction of him was. Cannot recommend this enough.

To be honest, I've been waiting a long time to be able to make those recs XD
