I used to re-read the HP series dozens of times as a kid. These days I'm a little tired of it and haven't actually read the books other than re-reading a chapter for some detail when writing HP fanfiction. I think because I read HP fanfiction I'm a little exhausted of the canon material itself. Those plot points are discussed and re-done so much in fanfiction. I'll re-read books / fanfiction sometimes. I don't think I've ever re-read it more than 2-3 times, and usually it's been a few years so I've forgotten some of it and it's fun re-remembering some of the stuff like "oh yeah! that happened!"
