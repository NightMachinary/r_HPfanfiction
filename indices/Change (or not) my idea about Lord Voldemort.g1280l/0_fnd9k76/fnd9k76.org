I think Voldemort has the /potential/ to be an amazing villain.

Orphan child growing up in an abusive environment, surrounded by death and war. Develops the idea that his mother didn't love him/betrayed him by dying, further cementing his revulsion to death. Grows up guarded and with no one he can trust to look out for him. Eventually discovers magic and lashes out against his bullies, but by this point he has been way too alienated by the rest of the orphanage to enter some form of normality, so magic is the only thing he has.

Eventually, this old man comes to him and tells him he is a wizard, dispelling his greatest fear that, maybe, just maybe, he really is a demonic freak like the rest of the orphanage thinks he is. In the span of a few minutes, the old man turns into a judgemental prick and makes assumptions about him without having any insight into his life.

Tom marches on, and gets sorted into Slytherin, where it's safe to assume he gets instantly bullied and humiliated. Just like in the orphanage, he has nobody he can rely on, and he has to resort to subterfuge and martial prowess so that he won't be beaten to death by the time he graduates. He probably pours over the Library and disregards Wizarding social customs and laws regarding Magic, which makes Dumbledore even more wary of him. Each summer, he has to go back to a place where he is hated and which he hates, with German bombs exploding in the background.

Eventually, he discovers he is the Heir of Slytherin. I imagine this was similar to first hearing he is a wizard. It was something that dispelled him of his subconscious fear that maybe he really is an unwanted freak. He finds his father and confronts him about abandoning him to that hell, and Senior is just snarky and tells him to fuck off, so he lashes out again and kills him. Meanwhile, his uncle is barely above the rank of animal.

In the end, he comes up with /I am Lord Voldemort,/ as a way to finally break from his past. Voldemort is everything Tom was told he isn't, and the conqueror of every fear Tom has. Voldemort is powerful, famous, has followers, he is immortal, rich. He is Tom without any of the insecurities and weaknesses. But instead of freedom, Lord Voldemort forever chains him to his past. He will now forever be that scared little boy taking shelter from the bombs and blaming his mother for abandoning him, just now with a different name. he doesn't integrate his traumas, he supresses them as deep as possible. As time passes, he looses himself more and more in the mask, until even he can't make the distinction anymore.

Tom is by far my favorite character in HP, and /to an extent/, I relate to him quite a lot. Rowling dropped the pieces to make a fantastic and tragic character. One of her best, imo. Sadly, when it came to piecing together her thoughts, the end result was something along the line of */hhhhhhhh Killing Curse go brrrrrrrrrrrrr/*
