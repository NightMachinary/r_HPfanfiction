Honestly, I never really delved quite this deep into Voldemort, but your analysis makes perfect sense and brings in a new outlook, prompting people to find themselves sympathizing with the 'enemy'. I have always liked Voldemort's character but this analysis really sold it for me, well done! I do have one thing to add that you also mentioned, Rowling should have delved this deep into his character like you did, to show this to people who do not think like you and me. I feel like if she really established this sympathy and reasoning behind why Voldemort is the way he is, a lot more people would like him and the series would have an even richer value to it as it would have touched upon the heart of both sides of the war, not just the "light" side.
