He's one of the most evil villains. He does dark things of such magnitude, but not only to others. That is one of the major reasons.

Take for instance Horcruxes. The soul is played with a lot in fiction, and the closest thing to one is a Lich, an arcane undead that stores their soul in an object called a Phylactery. They essentially control their body like a puppet, but that's about it.

Voldemort, though, he went further. He tore his soul into eight pieces, and still maintains one in his body. He's worse than a Lich.

TLDR: other villains will torture and enslave others, but Voldemort does these things to himself too.
