Those types of rankings are more a gauge of the work's popularity. Voldemort is the main villain in one of the most popular series written, so therefore he's going to rank highly. He's also very flamboyant and lurking menacingly in the books.

That said, he's also not a /great/ villain in canon, like you say. There are glaring holes in what he's doing, he doesn't act nearly as smart as he's supposed to be, he's a caricature, etc. That's fine in canon - because that's what the books needed for how they were written.

For fics that want to make it a bit more complex, challenging, or the like, he does have a lot of potential to improve - as TheSerpentPrince369 writes out, he does have a compelling storyline when examined as a whole. Voldemort is also supposed to be a genius - showing more of that would always help.
