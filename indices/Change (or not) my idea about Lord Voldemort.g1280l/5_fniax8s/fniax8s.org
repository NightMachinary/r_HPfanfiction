I think that Voldemort was more of a revolutionary in his early phases. Like leading his Slytherin gang to commit 'cruel pranks' on fellow students. But as he grew more powerful, he became this god-like figure. Think of how he doesn't own any property and probably doesn't have any money... yet he is surrounded by these rich powerful families. He then takes over Magical Britain but he doesn't bother to put himself in a position of power (nor as Minister, Headmaster, whatever) but instead goes on his quest for the Elder Wand and lets the Death Eaters rule Magical Britain as they see fit... which is actually in complete discrepancy between how he rules over the Death Eaters, maintaining strict discipline, and the total chaos that the magical world had become as shown in the Gringotts chapter in DH.

Voldemort, at least in the books, is only proactive when it comes to Harry and Dumbledore because he sees them as threats, but overall he is really a god who doesn't give a shit about the squabbles of the petty mortals whether they are purebloods or mudbloods. He doesn't care about materialistic power as he does not take positions or acquire wealth. But he cares about his magical knowledge and power.

I actually read a pretty nice comparison between Voldemort and Jehova. Both had names that people would fear to speak. At first they were gatekeeped by followers but eventually non-believers started to associate calling their name with punishment as well. Also, Voldemort often talks in third person saying how generous and kind he is if you obey his commands but he will not hesitate in a second to torture or kill you. Also he is immortal.

Overall, I think that by the time we get to see Voldemort, he has this god complex and doesn't care much about flaws in his plans. The only person that actually evades him is Harry and I think in Harry's case, Voldemort always loses his cool.

He might have been a great villain in a First War story or his Hogwarts days story but in the end he gets overcome by the human's greatest weakness (which is not death): pride.
