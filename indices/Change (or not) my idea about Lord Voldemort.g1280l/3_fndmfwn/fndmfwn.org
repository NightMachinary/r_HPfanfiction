On the one hand, he was woefully ineffective getting at one (pre)teen throughout the series. In his defense, that teen was rather bulletproof. He also killed a snake and outwitted a dragon before most of us muggles learned to drive. Part of what made Harry so effective was actually his naïveté; he reacted so unexpectedly in situations, it was impossible to predict. That's not even mentioning the extent to which, the plot protected him. I'm not sure there's any other time in cannon that a portkey took a person back to another place upon touch, though it is frequent in fics.

On the other hand, Vold took over an entire government for a second time within a couple decades without anyone noticing. That's terrifying. He also had teams of people who would appear near you and kidnap you if you said something he didn't like. If Siri teamed up with Big Brother in 1984, you'd still need to develop teleportation to reach that level of inescapability. You want to plan a rebellion, but (a) not everyone believes the government is evil, (b) many individuals being evil might be mind controlled by others, so even if you take them out, the masterminds in the shadows will stop you and keep their power without effort, (c) on top of not knowing who to trust, you can't even risk saying certain words because there is no way to protect yourself from being magically overheard.

Finally, he had a symbol that meant, “your loved ones are dead here. No matter how fast you run to check on them, they're already gone.” It's like the Red John smile in The Mentalist. You see the symbol first and feel the dread of it because you know what it has meant every time before now.

The story is told from a rather oblivious boy who has bonus survival powers on top of the magic. He barely thinks through the consequences of his own actions, let alone the political sphere at large. I think they are written in the fantastical way that allows fiction to be less scary because Good will always prevail over Evil. That said, if you put some of the implications into the context of the current world, where there isn't a single person fated to save it, it becomes much scarier.

In books, the bad guys can be tempered by equally powered good guys. However, in real life, that isn't always the case. Sometimes, the bad people---selfish people, evil people---gain power and use that power to hurt those who can't protect themselves. In the world where Harry always wins, Voldemort is a hapless villain with delusions of grandeur. In the real world, someone of his reach would be a tyrant who mixed the most suppressive parts of military dictatorship with the scariest parts of government control dystopias.
