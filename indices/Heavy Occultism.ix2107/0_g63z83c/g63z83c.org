I don't know about most of that but With Strength of Steel Wings by AngelaStarCat is a story almost completely focused on ritual blood magic, focused mainly on ritually carving runes into Harry's flesh in dedication to different celestial bodies in return for permanent effects. I really enjoyed it when I read it and am planning on rereading it soon. Not sure if this was exactly what you were looking for but I hope it helps. linkffn(9036071)
