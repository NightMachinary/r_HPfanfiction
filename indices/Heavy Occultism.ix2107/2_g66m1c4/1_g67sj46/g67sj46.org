I had no idea that this had a sequel! Also yes with the amount of lemons in this fic it has to worry about them lemon stealing whores. The fic has a lot of cool ideas though - I like the world building, tolerate the gratuitous lemons, and facepalm at the authors religious views, but in the end enjoyed this story
