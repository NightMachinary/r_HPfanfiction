Thank you for reading, and thank you very much for such a detailed review!

1) I'm glad to hear that you like the main character, and the mystery. He's ever present, so it'd be a bit of a problem if he was unlikeable! And yeah, I've tried to make sure his status comes into play at key moments, because it is, after all, the key point from which the story has grown.

2) I've tried to make sure it's cute in that "aww little kids and their crushes" way. There won't be any proper relationships until they're older.

3) Yes, the lack of plot is a big issue, and is mostly a result of me not actually planning it until far too late. It gets more plot-driven later on, and I'm working in a rewrite of the early sections.
