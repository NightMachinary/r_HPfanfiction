Bingeread up until Year 3, Chapter 6.

It's really good! Surprisingly the lack of a plot for year 2 got rid of some of the problems (even though the story seemed kinda aimless and [[/spoiler][the Sirius Black thread went nowhere... yet?]]. But I'm a fan of slice-of-life fics, so I liked just reading about a wizard living life.

Looking forward to Year 3. Super excited, and this is definitely on my reading list.
