So I just binge-read the first year

(1) I really like the main character and the mystery around him. As well as how the fact that he's not a wizard (but ppl think he is) is plot related [[/spoiler][with Lockheart and Riddle trying to use his want]].

(2) I'm not a huge fan of romances with little kids, but this was kinda cute so that's nice.

(3) The only real negative I have is that there is not real story. It's just Matt wandering through Hogwarts, meeting random Slytherins and Gryffindors. The climax of the story basically consisted of [[/spoiler][Matt finding Harry and Ron by chance and them randomly letting him come along]] and there's no connection with his day-to-day life.

I know you addressed this in your OP, but I'm hoping that the 2nd and 3rd years offer a more cohesive story.

(3.5) In line with that, Matt doesn't really have any flaws. Yeah, portraits and ghosts won't interact with him, but in terms of /the plot of the story/, there is nothing holding him back. This can be fixed however, by fixing (3) (which is why I only made this 3.5, not 4).

Great start though, even if it wasn't super perfect! I'd give year 1 a 7/10.
