Not really a particular fanfic, but it is something that has always bothered me a little - Stories where old characters go back in time seeking their one true love when they are still kids. I mean, isn't it kind of grooming when an adult (sometimes even an elderly man/woman) disguise themselves as kids and use the information they collected of other kids to manipulate them into falling in love with them.

I'll be the first to admit that it isn't something that by itself makes me abandon a story (I like the whole time travel trope too much and have become very adept in skipping the â€˜romance'), but it always makes me kind of uncomfortable.
