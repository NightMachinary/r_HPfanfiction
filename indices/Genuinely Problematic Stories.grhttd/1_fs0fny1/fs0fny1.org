Was about to write an angry comment here until I read your second paragraph lol. If you want problematic AND popular fics, I recommend Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches by LeadVonE, which has /reluctantly checks/ [Reviews: 8,619 - Favs: 16,581 - Follows: 19,742] on ffn.net. Safe to say it is one of the most popular recent fanfics, and it features a 12 year old Luna with a BDSM dungeon.

Another problematic fic is Backward With a Purpose by Deadwoodpecker. Reviews: 4,801 - Favs: 7,196 - Follows: 2,728 on ffn.net. It's about Harry, Ron, and Ginny going back in time to make things right. Ron grooms Hermione. Like, actually grooms her into a relationship. I read this a few years back and I remember a particular conversation that stood out to me:

  "I don't care how sad I am," Hermione whispered. "I'm still not sleeping in your room."

  "Not /yet/," Ron said with a hint of a smile.

In chapter 27.

EDIT: could you please keep me updated with your video essay? I would be very happy to watch it, as I fully agree with you that this is a serious issue.
