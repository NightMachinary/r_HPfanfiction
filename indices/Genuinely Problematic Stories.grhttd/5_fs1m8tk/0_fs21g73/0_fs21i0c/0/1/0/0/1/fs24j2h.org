Fanfiction written anywhere in the world can be viewed in outside the United States - you literally quote the word 'transmitted' yourself. And even though that law states the 'visual' portrayal quite specifically, it does also include written and yes, portraying the minor is fictional or not, still counts. From a consumer point of view it is still a child in pornograph content, an act which in itself is illegal, regardless of if there's a /real/ child involved.

The bigger question is why are you so determined to defend literal child pornography? Its really not a good look and the ruthlessness on which you're trying is freaking me out. We can argue about the finer details of which laws are which, but it doesn't change the fact morally its still child porn and you are here defending and are saying "its harmless".

Stop being a nonce.
