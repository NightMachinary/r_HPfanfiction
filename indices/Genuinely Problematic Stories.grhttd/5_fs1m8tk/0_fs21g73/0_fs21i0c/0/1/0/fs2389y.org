1st.) Its a crime for someone to produce, obtain or promote material portraying a minor in pornography in most first world countries, and its regardless of whether that is fictional portrayal or not.18 U.S.C ยง2260. There's a REASON artists of lolita material have to explicitly state the characters portrayed in it are 18. Maybe you think it falls under a different classification because one is written format and one is visual, but they fall under the same clause. This is not a discussion, I am educated on the topic and in telling you that you are wrong.

2nd.) The fact that you're genuinely arguing that child porn is okay, and that it doesn't harm anybody, BIG fucking yikes.
