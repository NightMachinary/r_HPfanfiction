Huh. I've read Darth Marr's stuff, but not /Bonds of Blood/. I didn't really notice heavy sexual themes in what I did read, but it might just because it's been so long that I just can't remember, and I didn't find the fanfics engaging enough to re-read.

For what it's worth, I find the concepts presented in Bonds of Blood far less disturbing than one of the fanfics mentioned in other thread about moments that got users to stop reading a fanfic(namely, one of them mentioned finding a fanfic where a Fem!Harry was running a child prostitution ring).
