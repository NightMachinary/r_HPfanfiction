Bear in mind that any fanfics involving pedophilia cannot be linked here and violate both Reddit's rules and this subreddit's rules specifically.

The only fanfic I can really remember involving that I'm not sure counts as pedophilia in the context of the story itself(whether or not it does outside the context of the story I suppose it does count as pedophilia, but within the story, they're pretty much all teenagers). I don't even remember the /name/ of the fanfic. What I can remember is that it was Harry/Hermione, Harry kept getting sexually assaulted by older female students, and Hermione kept asking him to demonstrate what they asked him to do.
