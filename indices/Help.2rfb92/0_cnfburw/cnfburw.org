I would just recommend going back through LJ Fests. A lot of the new ones are also hosted on AO3 and then you can track through the authors and find their other works. I'd also check on AO3 to see if any of your favorite authors have saved works as favorites. Here's a [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Fionaxyz/bookmarks][link to my AO3 bookmarks]]. They aren't /all/ DM/HP but the majority are, hopefully there are at least one or two new ones and if not it might be a starting point to start digging.
