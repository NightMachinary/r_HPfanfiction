When I'm not sure what Drarry fic to read, I often check this [[https://www.diigo.com/list/applelingrecs?&page_num=0&count=20&tab=1][Massive Drarry Fanfiction Theme List]] to help me find a fic based on what theme or trope I'm in the mood to read. Maybe you'll find something interesting there.

I've just finished [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=3727][Draco's Boy]], which is a Non-Magic AU and I thought it was excellent! I highly recommend it!
