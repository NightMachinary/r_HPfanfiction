It's a very British sometimes-true-stereotype thing. We're often very hesitant to be a bother or to inconvenience others. An American might visit a grandparent and eat heartily from whatever they cook, but an English person would be far more likely to say "Oh, only if you're cooking already, I suppose I'll have some, if that's alright with you." etc.

It's also a thing in older literature, usually with sweets and biscuits like that.

Either that or Cave Johnson already took them and turned them into incendiary grenades and the magical world is now wary as shit over anything even mildly lemony. :)
