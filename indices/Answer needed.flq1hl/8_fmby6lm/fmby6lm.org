My grandparents always had a dish of ribbon candy out. I tried to take one once and they were all stuck together. Okay, so they lived on a lake and it was probably because of humidity, but as a kid all I could think was that it was because they were so old. So, if nobody takes the candies, they just get older, making people less likely to take them. Vicious circle.

But really, my headcanon is that he doses them, not with psychotropics like somebody else mentioned, but with something that lowers a person's mental defenses so he can pry information out of them more easily, and maybe something that makes them more susceptible to suggestion.

Or maybe it's because Snape is paranoid, Minerva doesn't like lemon*, and Harry has never been offered anything good except to have it snatched away from him (I can totally see the Dursleys doing this) so he won't play that game anymore.\\
*Lemon is not exactly everybody's favorite candy flavor.
