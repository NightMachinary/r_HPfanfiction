My crucial feature is explanation of "new" features. Harry is all the sudden a multi animagus that has power out the ass. Show me the process. Tell me how he did it, not just one line explaining away.

My unpopular opinion is I like fics where turmoil and angst or hurt/comfort is wrapped up in three or less chapters. I hate it when a character is kidnapped then he/she isn't rescued within one to two chapters.
