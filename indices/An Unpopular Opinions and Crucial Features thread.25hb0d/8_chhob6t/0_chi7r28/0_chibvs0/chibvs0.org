The first fic I ever read was Hermione/Draco. So long as it is well written, Dramione fics are great. Hermione and Draco are actually quite similar people and are great for each other once they get past the superficial stuff. Hermione/Harry is really good too, but harder to write. The best romance I ever read was Vox Corporis. Hermione/Harry are able to make each other really happy, and always get along wonderfully. My least favourites however are Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione. Ron/Hermione just doesn't make sense to me. As Harry put it in Vox Corporis, the person to love Hermione shouldn't make her cry. Ginny/Harry seems forced to me. There are just so many possible pairings that would better suit each of them.
