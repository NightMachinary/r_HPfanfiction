When you look at their core values, they are. You need to forget the superficial stuff like Draco being racist, that's something that he was raised around and taught to be the correct thing. It's things like they are both quite intelligent, both have an eagerness to prove themselves. They're both loyal to someone special in their lives, Hermione being with the Trio and Draco with his father. They both have a firey side that is usually suppressed, and later on, a certain disregard for the rules (this only applies to Hermione some of the time). The list goes on. Their basic personality traits are similar, it's just the circumstances of their upbringings that drive them apart.
