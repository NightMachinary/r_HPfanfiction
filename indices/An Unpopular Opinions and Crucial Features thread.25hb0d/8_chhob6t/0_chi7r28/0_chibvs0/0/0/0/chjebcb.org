  When you look at their core values, [Hermione and Draco] are [quite similar people]
#+end_quote

Wut.

  You need to forget the superficial stuff like Draco being racist
#+end_quote

Yeah. The stuff that doesn't really matter in one's basic personality or outlook on life, coloring every decision you make around such people on a daily basis.

I bet that turned around quick, once he was spending 9 months out of the year away from direct contact with his racist family, surrounded by positive examples of people of other races.

In fact, with his naturally progressive, moral, and accepting personality -- suppressed by all that racist upbringing, I'm sure -- why, by the end of the first year, I would guess he'd (secretly) become friends with a muggleborn student in his year. That's what happened, right?

Because Hermione was friends with a pureblood by that point, despite knowing about the social prejudice and having to constantly deal with casual, ignorant reactions she faced from that group on a daily basis.

And Sirius Black was actually kicked out of his family because he wouldn't be enough of a racist shit. I'm sure that's what happened to Malfoy, too. Right?

  They both have a firey side that is usually suppressed

When. Ever. Is Draco "suppressed," emotionally? He's been too busy trying to /kill/ people to fuck with Harry, I guess...

#+begin_quote
  it's just the circumstances of their upbringings that drive them apart.
#+end_quote

And that they're in competing social groups, and born into families that the rest of society think should be enemies, and the fact that Draco is eventually actually /forced/ to help directly attack Hermione's teachers and friends. And the bit where Draco's father tried to kill her and those like her at school. Oh, and the part at the end, where both Draco's parents wanted Hermione to be killed for being friends with Harry, and those like her sent to concentration camps.

But I guess you're right. /Genetically speaking/, they aren't /pre-programmed/ to kill each other. Point to you.
