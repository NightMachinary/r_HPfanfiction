Turns out apologism for racism and racist characters in popular media makes me slightly unpleasant. Go figure.

But I am truthfully and non-sarcastically sorry if my post genuinely hurt your internet feelings. That was not my intent. I was shooting for critical and scathing, not insulting.

My own statements weren't meant to be a personal attack, just an attack on those kinds of statements. And maybe that sentiment wasn't what you really meant, but it was what you wrote.

And what you wrote there was stupid and slightly offensive.

As a peace offering of sorts, and because I actually do like Draco's potential /as a character/, I give you my favorite Draco. The smart, self-improving Draco on a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionQuest][Redemption Quest]]:

Sometime, usually after GoF, Draco realizes Harry Potter is going to win the coming war. This is either because he learns something of the true nature of the prophecy (maybe from Snape), or because he becomes aware of Harry's field of impossible luck.

So Draco decides to stop being an obvious racist asshole, and starts to work on a plan to swallow his pride and sneak into Harry's circle of friends. While still being a /secret/ racist asshole, of course.

This is his best plan for surviving the next five years, as fighting against someone literally protected by fate sounds like a terrible idea to someone whose upbringing included learning the darkest secrets of magic. There is a reason Voldemort thinks this prophecy thing is a big deal, after all.

Executing this plot leads Draco to realize that other people, even mud- /muggleborn/, have people they care about, dreams for the future, and human feelings. And that even the Great Harry Potter has some pretty serious problems of his own... that he's not even trying to work through.

Draco confronts Harry about why the hero of the magical world is putting up with all the obvious bullshit in his life.

Then, depending on the type of story, Harry and Draco angrily make out. Like, a lot.

Ron is horrified, but Hermione sees something of herself in Draco's new ambition to help Harry better his situation, and not to be such a goddamn dishrag.
