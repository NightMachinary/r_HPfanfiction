How hard would it be to simply be a random Ravenclaw in either the Marauders' or Twins' school days?

Say you're just trying to complete your NEWTS so you can even have a chance to get a good job after (essentially) finishing high school, but you miss a critical Charms test because you suddenly find you have cat paws instead of hands or something.

All because you were doing last minute studying with some (perfectly normal, non-racist) Slytherins during lunch or something and got caught in the blast radius of some strange "prank".

I mean, really. Who throws cursed cheese?
