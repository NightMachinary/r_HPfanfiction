  Would you like to argue about anticipated experiences instead?

I assume this conversation will be an excruciatingly boring and ultimately pointless experience, and all who disagree with me will defend their dumbass beliefs to their last breath. Is that what you mean?

As for the original stupid brosef opinion: any non-consensual involvement in frightening body modification, exposure to sudden explosions, or drugging with sensory altering substances is clearly immoral, regardless of the final result. You don't assault someone first, then after they're conscious again see if they were okay with having a full contact martial arts sparing session with you.

The only possible exception is still murky. If it is your friend that you're "pranking", and they've previously made it clear that that sort of thing was fine, it is /less/ awful. But still really creepy to everyone who'd have to deal with seeing that sort of thing happen. It is very close to if you came up and punched your friend in a crowd as a greeting -- not okay, even if you both knew it was going to happen. And /very/ not okay around little kids. Which would be the Hogwarts environment.

Pranking someone in private, in your own house, might be different, but is still the kind of thing that should make right thinking people wonder if you are dangerously insane.

Bottom line: involving uninformed strangers in such activities is criminal assault, regardless of intent. No question.

I can't remember the name or details of the fic, as it was otherwise very meh, but I read one once where a prank almost killed someone early in the story, making the Twins realize that sort of thing was actually really dangerous. Though it was for a dumb reason, something having to do with magical drug reactions or something, it still seemed more realistic than everyone being okay with people randomly becoming birds, or the entire Slytherin population turning orange and the magical cops not being called by /someone/.
