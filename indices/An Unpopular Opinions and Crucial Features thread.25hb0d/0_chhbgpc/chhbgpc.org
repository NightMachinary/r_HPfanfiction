I'm not sure how unpopular it really is, but I don't find the Marauders' or the Weasley twins' pranking to be at all funny or endearing. They were bullies.

Crucial feature(s): Good writing, actual plot and character development. I can't stand fics where:

- The author doesn't know what a paragraph is.
- The fic is full of spelling errors or just bad writing in general.
- The plot only exists as an excuse to write sex scenes.
- The fic is nothing but a weird power fantasy with a Gary Stu Harry. I'm looking at you every single fic that focuses more on Harry's exercise regimen than any kind of coherent plot.
- Characters are one dimensional. I often find this with people who inexplicably seem to hate the entire Weasley family (except maybe the twins because LOL PRANKS).
- I also dislike blatant Americanisms (assuming the fic is set in Britain). No, throwing in a "bloody hell" every other page does not make up for your very American word choices.
