Unpopular opinion: I can count on one hand the number of decent Harry/Draco fics. They tend to be the domain of women living out a fantasy, with the dialogue being almost universally cringe worthy. Also, about 9/10 times the sex is never in the slightest realistic. It reads more like what a woman who's never been in the situation would fantasize about, instead of being what /actually/ happens. There are maybe 3 fics that I've read (and I went through a H/D stage for about a year, where I read almost every popular one) that actually engrossed me in the story and made me believe in the pairing.

Note: I'm bisexual myself, this isn't coming from homophobia. They're just almost all terrible

Required reading: The dialogue has to feel natural. I need to be able to imagine someone /actually saying/ the shit that comes out of your characters mouth, otherwise I'm going to close the story.

Also, I have what I call a "cliche limit" in fics I read. You get three cliches per story, maximum. I can stand Harry going to Gringotts and finding out he's the heir to some noble house or another. I can stand Harry buying a super expensive trunk that has a thousand compartments in it. When you hit number three, that's when I stop reading.
