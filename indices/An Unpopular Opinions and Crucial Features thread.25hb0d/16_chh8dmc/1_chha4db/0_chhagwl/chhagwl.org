  Yet another one of those Harry And Draco Are Forced To Be Together By Something Beyond Their Control And Then Stuff Happens Leading To Twoo Wuv stories. Because every HD writer has to write at least one. [Finished]

Literally the only slash "bond fic" that's worth reading.

The other two are by the same author, "Maxine Chan". Both are almost complete fluff/romance, but they're still enjoyable. "Starts With A Spin", and "All The Answers", which you can find on her [[http://maxine-chan.dreamwidth.org/][blog]]. All The Answers is incomplete, and I think the author has abandoned it. Warning: Starts With A Spin is very, very sex heavy.
