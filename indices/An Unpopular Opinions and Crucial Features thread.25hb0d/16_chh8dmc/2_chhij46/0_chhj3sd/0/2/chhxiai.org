I have no idea what moonshadows is because I don't read R/S, but even the name sounds kind of over the top.

The sex scenes almost all make me laugh. It's like, I've had my fair share of sex with men. I know what it feels like. Even with preparation, it will hurt at first. Like no matter what. The level of pain will vary, but it's gonna hurt a bit. In most of these stories, it's just like well...It's in. No pain. No mention of any preparation. Just wam, bam, thank you m'am.
