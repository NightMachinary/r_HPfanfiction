Well, I'm pretty much restricted to R/S, but from what I've read:

1. You have the normal story with romance thrown on top of it. Shoebox, Mercy Pity Peace, etc...

2. You have the stuffs that sounds like it came from a B-rated erotica for women. Casting Moonshadow is a big one. The key characteristic of these stories is the general over-dramaticness of everything. The dialogue does not sound like something a 14/15/16/17 years old would say, the situation are completely ridiculous and over dramatic, and the whole thing sounds like a bad soap. And boy, you know they're female when they start writing IKEA sex scenes -.-..
