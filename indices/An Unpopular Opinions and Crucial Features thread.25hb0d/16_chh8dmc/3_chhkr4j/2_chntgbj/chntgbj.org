Every time I've come here, without exception, someone said they hate slash. I've asked for slash and heterosexual stories with an emphasis on wanting slash a few times before and only received heterosexual stories.

Why shouldn't people ask for specific slash pairings when (if you look at the front page right now) there are almost always solely heterosexual specific pairings requested?

Saying this sub is fixated on slash is almost the opposite of the truth.

With that in mind I leave you with my favorite story with eventual slash, in case you'd like to check it out: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][The Sacrifices Arc. The first book is Saving Connor. Make sure to bookmark as this is 3 times larger than the original series. I haven't finished it because it is so long, i've lost my place before, and also this is the story that first caused me to confront that two members of my family were abusive. I've had to stop and start many times when I became too emotional. The main character is incredibly fallible. The writing gets progressively better. I doubt there will ever be a sex scene. There are very few mistakes. Though if you dislike crying you will want to stop after the first book.]]

I'm on my phone so sorry for any spelling mistakes.
