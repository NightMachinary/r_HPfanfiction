  I was kind of disappointed with this subreddit's apparent fixation with slash (people even asking for specific ships like Harry/Draco, for example). I don't understand why this isn't a place to share well written stories, and instead 50% of the threads are "give me fics that are a glorified excuse to write a sex scene between two out-of-character canon characters".
