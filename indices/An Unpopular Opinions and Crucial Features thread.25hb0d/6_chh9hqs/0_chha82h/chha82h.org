Actually, those opinions on books six and seven aren't unpopular.

I thought book six wasted a lot of time and besides Dumbledore's death and the invasion of Hogwarts, there wasn't a lot going on. Book seven even more so, and the whole way Harry beat Voldemort using mechanics revealed in the same book just felt like a cop out. I dunno, I felt those two were trying too hard to be mature, and it kind of fell flat.

I think it's generally agreed among some circles that books 1-3 were the best, with nice, clear-cut mysteries. I liked book 4 myself, but I really felt the series started to lose focus ~book five.

The same people that hate those also tend to hate Mentor!Snape and canon pairings.
