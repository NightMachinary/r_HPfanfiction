As far as unpopular opinions go, I really dislike the events of books six and seven, with book five getting a partial pass; I hate the canonical pairings and I generally despise Mentor!Snape. As to how unpopular those opinions actually are, who knows.

Crucial feature for a fanfic? I guess it has to include Harry in a romance with someone I like - Hermione, Luna, and Fleur are generally the only candidates for me. HP is so lacking in convincing romance that we can only really look to fanfics for any kind of satisfaction.\\
