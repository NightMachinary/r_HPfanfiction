I, like you, dislike books 6 & 7. I think it is better than any Fan fiction but really very poor otherwise. Harry barely changes throughout the HBP and while I don't mind the Horcruxes storyline, the little magical power increase shows. He seems to be always lucking his way through these duels and things, and it makes me irritated at him.
