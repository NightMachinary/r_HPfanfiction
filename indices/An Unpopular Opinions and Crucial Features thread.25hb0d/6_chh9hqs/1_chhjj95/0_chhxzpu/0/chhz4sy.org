I don't mind them, I just think the series would have been better if Dumbledore had taught Harry more about magic in his 6th year. I find it hard to support a character i can't believe, and I can't believe Harry survives all of those incidents with death eaters on pure dumb luck. When Snape said Harry survived through pure dumb luck, I tried to disprove it and couldn't. Other than that, i thought they were alright, certainly better than any Fan Fiction, but they could have been so much better.
