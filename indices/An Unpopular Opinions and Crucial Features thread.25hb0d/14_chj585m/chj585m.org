*CF:*

One of the most important parts of fanfic (or original fiction if you want to go that route) is the first chapter. So many people underestimate the strength of a good first chapter. There are thousands of fanfics out there and unless it has already culminated mass reviews, it's hard to tell which one is good and which one is crap. The first chapter needs to reel the reader in. It needs the hook which catches the reader. That doesn't mean there has to be a big surprise or an all-action beginning. Rather, it has to have something compelling.

So many first chapters are just background and setting. It introduces the characters, but there's nothing that really grabs the reader and says, "READ ME!" If you want your fic to be read (and let's be honest, everyone wants their stories to be heard), really think about that first chapter. It's crucial.
