Unpopular opinion: I'm not a big fan James and Sirius, for reasons, and will not seek stories out that feature them (this includes any Jily fics).

Crucial feature for fic: The fic MUST have believable characterization and dialogue. Snape, for example, should not go "Oh my God! What are you talking about?" or something like that. If a main character is written OOC, I am not reading that fic, no matter what.
