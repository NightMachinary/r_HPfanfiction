Unpopular opinion: smirking must die. I think people try to treat it as a more flavorful version of smiling. You can smirk cruelly or with private amusement, but that's about it.

Crucial feature: quotation tags with correct capitalization.

#+begin_quote
  "Die, Potter!" He screamed.
#+end_quote

My mind interprets this as:

#+begin_quote
  "Die, Potter!" he said calmly, then started screaming.
#+end_quote
