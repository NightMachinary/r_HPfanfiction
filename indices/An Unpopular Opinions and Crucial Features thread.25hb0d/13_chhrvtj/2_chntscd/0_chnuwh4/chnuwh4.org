I'm not talking about punctuation. I am talking about capitalization. A corrected version of the example I used would be:

#+begin_quote
  "Die, Potter!" he screamed.
#+end_quote

The quoted sentence is embedded in an outer sentence. The quoted sentence ends with a punctuation mark -- exclamation point or question mark as normal, full stop converted to comma. After the quoted sentence, the outer sentence continues without capitalization (unless required as part of a proper name) because "he" is not the first word in the outer sentence.

You seem to think I was suggesting the correction would be:

#+begin_quote
  *"Die, Potter" He screamed.
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
  *"Die, Potter" he screamed.
#+end_quote

Neither of those are correct.
