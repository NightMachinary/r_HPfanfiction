I hate "pranks" as some sort of established part of HP canon world. I don't understand why so many ff authors decide to make it a major focus of the story. Especially since almost all pranks I've read involve new powers or assume ability of students to create magical effects that "professors" are unable to dispel.

I also don't care at all about Marauders, James, Lily because they are all pretty much strangers to me compared to the HP generation of kids.
