I hate independent Harry. There are very few that do it right. Most of them have him reducing Dumbledore to a pile of tears and somehow defeating one of the greatest wizards of all time. All sorts of training regiments where he knows exactly what to do or acquires some sort of Far East trainer are present. Everyone quivers in his wake. His love interest's knees weaken at the sight of him. Somewhere along the line, this trope or set of ideas became very popular and there are very few stories that actually pull it off
