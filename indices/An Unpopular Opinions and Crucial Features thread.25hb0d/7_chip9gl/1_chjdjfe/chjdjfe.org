Done well enough; read as well written, Independent!Harry can be well done; see Taking Control, which i think somehow manages to be a decent and well like fanfic even though it has God knows how many cliches and thing disliked by the entire community, but done badly it is horrible, unrealistic, and so far from what Harry would do it infuriates me
