Unpopular opinion: the movies were awful and where they deviate from the books, I don't consider them canon. Authors who follow the movies instead of the books make me cringe. Crucial feature: believable plot & backstory with decent spelling and grammar. My middle school English teacher turned me into a Spelling&Grammar Nazi. The occasional typo is fine but two or more every paragraph or so will turn me away regardless of what you're writing about.
