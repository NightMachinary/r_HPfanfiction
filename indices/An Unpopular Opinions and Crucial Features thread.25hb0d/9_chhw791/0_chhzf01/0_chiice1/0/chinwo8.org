There's so much wrong with this. History is not a steady progression from backwards to progressive. A lot of the hostility toward homosexuality in western culture stems from Christianity. You know what else Christianity frowns upon? Witchcraft. The Statute of Secrecy was established in 1689 but relations between the magical and muggle communities had been bad for centuries before that point. Trying to examine magical culture through the same lense you would muggle culture just does not make sense. You can't just take for granted that the magical world maintained the moral framework of a culture that tried to burn them at the stake.

That's not to say that homosexuality must /necessarily/ be accepted in the magical world, but if an author's fic is going to feature gay characters then their worldbuilding should be sufficient to address the issue either way.
