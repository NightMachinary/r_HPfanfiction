That's really how history works. There are no glorious savages in the world that are accepting of all races, creeds, and sexualities, no brief shining cultures, or ones that are now and have always been beacons of total grace and tolerance.

Suggesting otherwise would be odd, and smack of thinking some groups of people are just naturally nicer or better at getting along somehow, and that such tendencies are withered in others. Make no mistake, everyone, everywhere is naturally nearly equally horrible, without the betterment of social context and training. Nurture wins that one.

More advanced societies are just that - more advanced. And as all historic societies are at their root about social control, not social library, over time more freedoms usually have to be hacked from an establishment's grasp, including sexual freedoms. Even in ancient Greece, if you weren't going to settle down and get some sons, there was going to be a problem with your family.

Suggesting that a single religion is to blame is also silly -- and this is from the most militant atheist you are ever likely to meet. Plenty of non-christian cultures have BIG issues with the entire LGBT spectrum, both now and in the past. Attempting to automatically glorify a theoretical culture by simply stating that it has poor roots to another, less tolerant one, doesn't logically follow, especially when that insular culture already has demonstrated issues with tolerance.

Therefore, it makes no sense to automatically suggest that 1990s magical Britain is somehow more tolerant than its mundane counterpart, something that many authors assume through lack of imagination or simply laziness. Which was the point that was being made.

*edit - such spelling. Thanks Android.
