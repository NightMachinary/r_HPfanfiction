What is wrong with being a teacher or a mother or dead? You do realize that this book was focused on school children, and not adults, right? We were getting a view of society from people who lived in a Boarding school. However, if you want to play this game, then I can think of someone off the top of my head. Madame Bones. As far as we know she doesn't have any children- the Bones girl at the school was her niece. She was Head of the department of Law Enforcement and had a seat on the Wizengamot.

For that matter bringing up women's rights is redundant. As you admitted "progressive" doesn't mean good. There is no society that is wholly "good" or wholly "bad." Some people will be more equal in societies than others. So a society can treat women like cows but treat the gay community like an everyday occurrence. Such was the case in Greece.

There were many societies that were welcoming of homosexuality and transgenders and third genders in history. Yes or no? Yes, the answer is yes. Therefore your saying "They weren't progressive" isn't a good argument for "they didn't accept homosexuality." Especially since the author herself admitted that Albus was gay, retrospectively.
