  Your idea that if something that wasn't relevant to the books didn't happen then it couldn't possibly happen is one of the worst arguments I have ever heard, to be honest.
#+end_quote

Again, not what I said. Your reading comprehension here is among the worst I've ever encountered. You are missing the point entirely.

This is about world building. The assumption has to be that fictional contexts are logically constructed and extend in such a way from what is explicitly written. Otherwise, it is pointless to even discuss, as the author's vision was merely part of a "just so" story from which no one can infer anything beyond a simple and literal reading.

It matters if certain things are written a certain way. And because certain things were not said, because JKR's magical Britain wasn't written in a certain way, other conclusions can be drawn.

In a world with major themes of intolerance and oppression, to the point of bureaucrats torturing schoolkids and a government putting people in internment camps without major opposition, it is hard to see why an unsupported "sure, that was bad, but they wouldn't do that with this issue" approach would make any sense.

Sure, make a pure AU story anything you want, but that isn't how either JKR's writing or the real world works. This was my main point, that such stories needed more support. That was the reason for the review of JKR's themes and for the wider historic context I was trying to bring in.

Making laws about not oppressing people is a relatively new thing, especially on racial, gender, and sexual orientation issues. But it is something that historically has marched forward, from no laws to more.

That we only see laws against oppressing people having a hard time being passed in government in Harry Potter, and even seeing laws allowing people to be discriminated against, is quite telling for their society, and suggests that they are less far along than Muggle Great Britain.

My argument wasn't about what is not written, but about people reading what was with rose colored glasses while making unfounded assumptions about what was not written. Also, some counters to misapprehensions on how societies work historically.

  And I'm sorry that I expected you to know a bit about history.

Fuck you, too.

  Let's ignore that I mentioned Greece
#+end_quote

Let's not, as that was one of the most inaccurate things you said. You might have argued that you meant modern Greece or some other historic period, but that clearly wasn't what you meant.

#+begin_quote
  People fucked those of the same gender and it was no big deal. You weren't telling me anything I don't already know
#+end_quote

What you "know" isn't what I said or what is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_ancient_Greece][historically known about Ancient Greece]]:

#+begin_quote
  "Greek society did not distinguish sexual desire or behavior by the gender of the participants, but rather by the role that each participant played in the sex act, that of active penetrator or passive penetrated. This active/passive polarization corresponded with dominant and submissive social roles: the active (penetrative) role was associated with masculinity, higher social status, and adulthood, while the passive role was associated with femininity, lower social status, and youth. "
#+end_quote

There were specific social consequences to the roles taken in those types of relationships, widely recognized by Ancient Greek society, in addition to the roles being usually segregated and power imbalanced between socially established older adults and relatively powerless young men or boys.

So it was not "no big deal." Which was /also/ not what I was saying. I have no idea what you were thinking I was saying.

  However your mentioning patriarchy and seeming to want to focus on women and backtracking and saying things are "nonesense" that you yourself admitted to in your earlier posts has shown me that I won't get anywhere talking with you.
#+end_quote

Is this some [[/r/MensRights]] trolling? I can't tell. Assuming you are genuine, there seems to be a reading comprehension issue on your part, not some fundamental and basic disagreement on the nature of reality. Or maybe you are being intentionally ignorant and intolerant. Either is sad.

#+begin_quote
  Enjoy believing you are "correct" for no other reason that that you want to believe you are.
#+end_quote

The mind boggles.

#+begin_quote
  Thank you for taking the time to reply. Let's agree to disagree.
#+end_quote

What empty drek. I wish you'd taken the time to read my reply instead of writing this poorly reasoned and written attack on an imaginary position you hallucinated I had. I'm not sure why you bothered replying in the first place if you didn't want to read what I'd say in response.

At this point I certainly have no hope of actually reaching [[/u/bluetaffy/]], but maybe someone else will find these posts interesting.
