  There are no glorious savages in the world that are acepting of all races, creeds, and sexualities, no brief shining cultures, or ones that are now and have always been beacons of total grace and tolerance.

I never said there were. I have no idea where you're even getting that idea. Your argument seems to assume that societies are either pluralistic and tolerant or insular and intolerant, and that a society that shows intolerance in one area will necessarily be intolerant in other areas, and that a culture that did not follow the same path as post-Enlightenment western muggle culture will share the same prejudices as said culture.

  Suggesting that a single religion is to blame is also silly

Again, you're putting words in my mouth. Christianity is at least the justification for if not the cause of a lot of bigotry in the western world. I never said it was the sole cause. I think it's likely that a major underlying factor is pervasive misogyny that goes back long before Christianity. Christianity fossilized prejudices that existed thousands of years ago, though. Instead of just changing the opinions of individuals, change has to fight against the force of doctrine.

  Therefore, it makes no sense to automatically suggest that 1990s magical Britain is somehow more tolerant than its mundane counterpart

It makes just as little sense to assume the converse, which was my point.

I would even argue that magic fundamentally alters the power imbalance between the sexes which will have an impact on a culture's views on sex and gender.
