Interestingly, you're actually putting words into /my/ mouth here, as I was mostly making wider arguments, not specifically targeting your position. Except on the religion issue, which was a weak point that you just restated differently anyway. But that doesn't matter. This isn't productive.

The essential disagreement on historic social rights seems to stem from two different approaches to what it means for something to be considered socially acceptable in a society.

In my rough thesis, I was working from a strict legalistic point of view. That if something isn't /explicitly/ enshrined as a right, as in our modern system of governance, then it isn't a right members of the society have, regardless of whether or not most people tolerate that certain behavior most of the time. If it is a right, in this view, it is actively protected by society.

You seemed to take the position that if something wasn't widely proscribed and punished, it represented a significant level of freedom in that culture. I didn't originally consider this perfectly valid point of view. Obviously, many cultures have defacto had more or less tolerant views on social issues at various points, and this type of development isn't a straight line from less to more rights in such a sense.

You know what? I'm just going to back off on all my earlier points. I think you're right about the social forces at play historically, though you are clearly overstating the case for a small, insular culture somehow achieving advanced levels of social progress by themselves, "magically" I guess.

Ultimately, to suggest that canon Magical Britain is as likely to be as tolerant a place in general as modern Great Britain clearly overlooks much evidence to the contrary. Specific rights follow the same logic.

Even before blood purists started putting people into internment camps, something that didn't cause widespread outcry and violent revolt from the general populace, many sentient magical beings were not allowed government representation, citizenship, or even basic human rights; classes of people with incurable, but hard to transmit, diseases were treated worse than AIDs victims in the '80s; schoolchildren were regularly threatened with both expulsion from primary education and exile from society as a whole, just for minor social infractions, along with the mandatory amputation of an inborn ability; and non-magical people were regularly and casually mentally violated whenever it was convenient. As for women's rights: name one adult female character in the series who wasn't dead, a drug addict (Winky, via WoG), in jail, a teacher, or a mother at the end of the last book.

In general, not a very tolerant or progressive place at all. The racism and intolerance isn't even subtextual. It is stated by the author as a primary theme of the series, along with death.

So no. It /doesn't/ make as much sense to assume they'd be okay with open same-sex relationships, not when the thematic line was clearly drawn (especially in the last book) between Magical Britain and Nazi Germany, via some of the worst social parts of '80s Great Britain.
