Oh yeah, yeah, definitely. I was actually thinking of putting that in their, but it was getting long.

I definitely see Pureblood nobles having homosexual relations behind closed doors. I don't think it'd be approved of openly, however.

The thing is, there's also a very limited understanding of psychology on the part of wizards. Homosexuality isn't a choice, but I really doubt most magicals would know that at the time. To ensure an heir, I imagine that parents would attempt to curb any such behavior.

Prejudices in the wizarding political and social world stem almost completely from Pureblood notions. Poorer, less influential Pureblood families also tend to emulate more influential ones, and in a small community it would quickly spiral out of control.

For it being a recent idea in history, that's a good point. My issue with it though is that Pureblood ideals are most assuredly not recent history, contrasting to the ideals of Muggleborns. More and more openly gay Muggleborn students would bring to light homosexuality as an identity, and if nothing else it would be seen as bad manners.
