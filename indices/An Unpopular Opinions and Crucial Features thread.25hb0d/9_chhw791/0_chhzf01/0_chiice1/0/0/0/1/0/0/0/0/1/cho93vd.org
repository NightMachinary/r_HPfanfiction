Listen I'm sorry if I responded like a b***, to be completely honest I skimmed what you wrote rather than reading it in depth, because I was on my phone and the formatting kept getting screwed up and I took out my frustration in that post. I edited it awhile ago- but apparently you only saw the first version of it. I stand by what I said, but I shouldn't have said it in such a rude way. So yeah, I'm sorry. ^{^{stupid}} ^{^{conscious.}}
