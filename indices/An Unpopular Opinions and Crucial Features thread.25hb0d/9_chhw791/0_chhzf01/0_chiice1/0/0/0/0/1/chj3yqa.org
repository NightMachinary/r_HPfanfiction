Homosexuality as a distinct identity is a very recent idea in history, though. Before that, there was only homosexual behavior, and as long as an heir was produced, what rich people did behind closed doors was pretty much their business. I could see the pureblood traditions allowing for some of that on the down-low. They probably had various lovers and illegitimate children as well, who may have even been adopted into the line if needed. JK has said that the pureblood families aren't exactly as pure as they claim to be.
