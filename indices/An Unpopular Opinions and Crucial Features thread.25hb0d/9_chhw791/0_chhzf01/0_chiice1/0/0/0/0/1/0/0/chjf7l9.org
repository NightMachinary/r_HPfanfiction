I could see homosexual behavior being seen as a way of letting out sexual frustration without endangering the bloodline in the way that illegitimate children might. That is, they might support two purebloods of the same sex having relations over a pureblood mingling with "impure" blood. I think a lot depends on their views towards women, actually. Misogyny is an essential component of homophobia, and the wizarding community does seem to be at least somewhat male-dominated, though less so than the corresponding Muggle one.

I actually think that the current pureblood ideals are more recent than people would like to believe. The Malfoys, for example, have only been a "pure" family since around the 1600s, and the way they gained power was most likely through connection with Muggle nobility. Modern racism also originated around that time as a result of colonialism. The concept of "whiteness" didn't exist until around 1700, to differentiate settlers from their slaves. Before that nationality was a bigger deal. It's likely that pureblood ideals were around in the feudal era, but not in the same form. Maybe being Anglo-Norman (like the Malfoys) or English was a bigger deal than simply being able to trace back your bloodline, because of feudal allegiances. Muggles may have just been the equivalent of serfs, later replaced by house elves. (This is really interesting to speculate about. :D )
