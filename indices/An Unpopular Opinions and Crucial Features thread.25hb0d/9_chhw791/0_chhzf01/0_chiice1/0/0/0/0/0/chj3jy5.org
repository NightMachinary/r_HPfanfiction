  In general though, we only ever see one or two children to a couple.

I wonder if this is actually the norm, though. In the books the previous generation had fought a civil war and didn't have much time for raising children. Look at the Black family tree, there are a number of families with 3 or more children. Both Molly and Arthur had at least two brothers. There were three children in the Dumbledore family.
