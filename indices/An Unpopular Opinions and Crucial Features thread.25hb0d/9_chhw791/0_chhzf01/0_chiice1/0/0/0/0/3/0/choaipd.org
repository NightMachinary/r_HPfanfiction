Except I did mention the issue of bloodlines as a power and class struggle. I was referring specifically to skin color races as they were in fact there at Hogwarts, and, going off of the books, there was never any discrimination towards them. For power, I was making reference to physical power not being a major factor, due to the presence of magical power as a decider for conflict.
