  What is wrong with being a teacher or a mother or dead? We were getting a view of society from people who lived in a Boarding school.
#+end_quote

Nothing is wrong with characters who are any of those. But /only/ having positive females characters from a society who fall into those categories doesn't make a good case for strong rights for women in the workplace or society in general. What people are going to do after school is a major part of the school experience, and no one lives in a vacuum.

But all the single women secondary characters in the story are teachers or inconsequential. Or eventually married to more important characters. Tales of past achievements of witches long dead and gone in History class or from the WoG after the fact are interesting, but not really part of the main story, which is where it really matters.

Dumbledore is the defeater of Grindelwald, discoverer of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, head of the Wizengamot, etc. He is kindly, a little goofy, and likes lemon sweets. Moody (the real one) is an experienced Auror and a cranky, paranoid old man who put away a number of evil wizards, whose trials we actually see in the story. He hates dark wizards and has worked his whole adult life to fight them.

Nymphadora Tonks (Lupin, whatever) is the best example of a positively presented single female character in the entire series. She's young, fun loving, and has a cool ability. But her primary story isn't about being a badass Auror and member of the Order, or even her special ability, but about who she's into and /his/ struggles; her being married; her having a kid; and her eventually dying off camera. Sigh.

What about McGonagall, Harry's head of house in Gryffindor? WoG says she's actually widowed, but whatever. Close enough. She's... strict? She turns into a cat? Great. How does she /feel/ about that? What are her hobbies? What did she do before becoming a teacher?

What about Sprout? She's... jolly? Does she have interests outside of school? Hopes or dreams? Nope, just being a teacher, I guess. The /second/ most important job in the magical world for a woman, apparently.

What about Harry's mom? What were her hopes and dreams? Doesn't matter. People talk about what she did in school, but not who she was or what she wanted to do after school. She's defined entirely by the males she hung out with at various times and being a mother. The most important job of all, of course.

Excusing the entire thing as a school focused story is all well and good, but some characters get background and support details that extend further than that. Except for the female secondary characters, who are all teachers, housewives, or killed off.

Not good support for an egalitarian society if you can't point to any examples of women characters who aren't defined almost entirely by men. Or that men need excuses for being unmarried, like being ugly, dead, or gay. But more on that later.

Died off camera in '96, no actual positive effect on the story. Being in LE and on the Wizengamot isn't, by itself, a positive thing, though it does show there isn't an unbreakable glass ceiling. Same for Minister for Magic Bagnold, who was said to have been bad at her job, letting celebrations after Voldemort died get out of control. In addition of course to her being well on her way to losing the war with Voldemort before then.

  As you admitted "progressive" doesn't mean good.
#+end_quote

Not what I said.

#+begin_quote
  There is no society that is wholly "good" or wholly "bad." Some people will be more equal in societies than others.
#+end_quote

Only if you accept that people are so shitty in nature that you can only stop them from treating people awfully /some/ of the time, or only in a limited number of situations.

#+begin_quote
  So a society can treat women like cows but treat the gay community like an everyday occurrence. Such was the case in Greece.
#+end_quote

Not...exactly. Certain rights were enshrined, like the rights of the head of households (always male). Woman's rights were very sparse, but gay rights didn't really exist as a thing.

Being gay /itself/ wasn't a thing.

Being the "submissive" in a sex act /was/, and was looked down upon. Which is why though certain behaviors with boys (very young ones, often) were tolerated and even in some ways encouraged, those were not what we'd call today power balanced relationships.

Bottom line, there were not accepted equal and long term relationships between men. Ultimately, accepting certain behaviors wasn't the same as rights for same sex couples, or even the existence of a "gay community" at all.

There are hard and fast measurements for how well a society treats various people. Some societies pass more checks for human rights than others. Ancient Greece fails theirs for same sex relationships. Soft, equivocating statements about some societies not being better than others only continue to support violations of those rights to this day.

Ancient Greece was /not/ tolerant in this way at all, and yet it is still held up as an example of a good and tolerant society by many to this day. Makes you wonder how much worse everyone else must have been at the time.

  There were many societies that were welcoming of homosexuality and transgenders and third genders in history.
#+end_quote

You have overwhelmed me with your list of such. Most of history is a record of people being horrible to those who were different. The vast majority of societies around the world have been intolerant dictatorships and patriarchies. Those that weren't, died off quick, historically speaking, and even while they lasted weren't so much /protecting/ rights as much as not having the strength to stop people from doing what they wanted to do when someone in power took offense at something.

#+begin_quote
  There were many societies that were welcoming of homosexuality and transgenders and third genders in history. Yes or no?
#+end_quote

No.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, the answer is yes. Therefore your saying "They weren't progressive" isn't a good argument for "they didn't accept homosexuality."
#+end_quote

That is nonsense.

#+begin_quote
  Especially since the author herself admitted that Albus was gay, retrospectively.
#+end_quote

He was, in fact, so far out of the closet that it required a WoG statement after the fact to confirm this. It didn't come up in the books at all, and if anything is an excuse for a smart, powerful man not having ever had a wife. You know, the normal gender roles that are reinforced throughout the Harry Potter series?

If people want to look at magical Britain through rose colored glasses, fine. But suggesting it is just as likely that they were progressive on this one isolated issue is absurd.
