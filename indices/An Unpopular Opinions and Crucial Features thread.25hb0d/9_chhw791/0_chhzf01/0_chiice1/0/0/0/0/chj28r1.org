I always considered the idealistic world that JK created ripe for an interesting thought experiment on the consequences of having everyone essentially equal in power or potential for power.

There is clearly little to no racism, sexism, or discrimination based on physical features, and indeed there shouldn't be. While there is still the imbalance of physical power due to sex, simple spells quickly negate it. One could even argue that speed and small stature are an advantage.

What does race matter to a culture that has likely been integrated far longer than Muggle culture, what with instant or near instant travel and communication? What do looks matter when there are tons of cosmetic spells and even a potion to look like anyone you want?

Really the only thing that seemed to matter for discrimination in the books was political power, bloodline, and wealth, with the former a direct consequence of the two latter. Both bloodline and wealth really only have two direct benefits as well: Knowledge and items. I'd think that before the institutionalized learning at Hogwarts, having wealth, items, and knowledge would enable families to build up political clout, as they would be clearly more powerful as a result.

But the one thing that I can't agree on is discrimination in regards to sexuality. I like the way the Firebird Trilogy brings this up. Gay men like Dumbledore in that universe would be reviled because they would have unrestrained power and their seed would be wasted.

Now, obviously in canon there is no power loss in marriage. However, the population of the magical community in Britain is small. 3000 people, approximately. Clearly magic allows for greater standard of living even for the impoverished, leading to sometimes high birth rates, like the Weasleys. In general though, we only ever see one or two children to a couple.

This, combined with what seems to be a tendency towards population culls due to Dark Wizards every so often, leads me to believe that being fruitful would be pretty important. Sure there's Muggleborn influx, so the population isn't stagnant, but for Pureblood lines population basically is.

I could easily see Pureblood prejudice towards homosexuality. A lot of prejudice towards homosexuality tends to arise in small populations. I mean, just look at the Israelites. A lot of the hatred towards homosexuality in Christianity stems from the banning of homosexuality for the Isrealites. No one could ever claim that the Israelites were a very populous people. It would only make sense for the permanent reduction of a family line to stem from homosexuality.

A Pureblood family, with only one or two children per generation, such as the Malfoys, would despise a child being born homosexual. The child would basically be required to be married, or else a whole line of power would end. It is in direct conflict with the families health for a child to turn out this way.

Honestly, I don't like seeing an acceptance to homosexuality in works where the main characters are homosexual, unless the focus is not on the relationship. The only reason for this is that prejudice creates an interesting narrative drama. I don't mean have Harry and Draco as secret lovers getting stoned or something, but Christ at least don't make Malfoy senior accepting of the fact.
