That's a good point, and there is evidence that population has been rising after the war.

Looking at just the Marauders though, Sirius was from the main line, which only had two children. Peter was, as far as we know, an only child. James was an only child. Snape was an only child. Malfoy Senior was an only child.

Not a very large evidence pool, sure, but besides the Weasleys there's little to suggest that Pureblood families are particularly fruitful.

Also, for Pureblood power this seems to apply to male children more. Female Purebloods would take the other family's name, so even if they and have children the line still ends with them.

Still, I believe Rowling said that Britain has the highest proportional population of magicals in the world. Whether she meant before or after the war is debateable, but magicals live for a long time. Assuming ~90 years is the normal lifespan for a magical, that's barely more than 10 lifespans since Britain was even conquered by the Normans.

Long term traditions like discrimination don't pop up over night, and I don't believe that the French and Old English populations would be that large. I could easily see prejudices against homosexuality emerging prior to the establishment of England, and carrying on.
