Your idea that if something that wasn't relevant to the books didn't happen then it couldn't possibly happen is one of the worst arguments I have ever heard, to be honest.

Let's ignore that I mentioned Greece (We never had to say "gay" was a thing. People fucked those of the same gender and it was no big deal. They were homosexuals and it wasn't considered bad to be attracted to their own gender. You weren't telling me anything I don't already know.) off the top of my head.

However I feel like this conversation isn't getting anywhere and that you are ignoring things you yourself admitted to in previous posts. It feels tedious.

Thank you for taking the time to reply. Let's agree to disagree.
