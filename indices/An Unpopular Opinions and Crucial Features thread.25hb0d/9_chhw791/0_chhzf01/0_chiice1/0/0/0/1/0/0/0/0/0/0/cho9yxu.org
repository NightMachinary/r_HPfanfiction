This is just sad. That half-assed misstatement of my position is not semantically equivalent to my actual conclusion in the second quotation, which you could realize if you were comprehending what I wrote.

One is an absolute statement about canon adherence, one I didn't make, and the other is an open-ended statement about how consistently written worlds can have linear conclusions drawn from even their narrow narrative scope.

Using smaller words:

#+begin_quote
  if something that wasn't relevant to the books didn't happen then it couldn't possibly happen
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  other conclusions can be drawn
#+end_quote

do not mean the same thing.

Please stop trying.
