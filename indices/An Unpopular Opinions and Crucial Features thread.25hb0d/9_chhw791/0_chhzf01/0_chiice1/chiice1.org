  ...we don't really have a canon stance on cultural issues like that within the magical world.

You're not going to get /more/ cultural advancement in a small, closed, backward society. Especially if the divergence point was 1689.

  In my opinion what's important is internal consistency and ideally a bit of exploration of why the author's take on the magical world is the way it is.

I'd go further.

Explain in detail how Sir Felric the Fablious attended Beauxbatons, got top marks while establishing a new school dress code, then successfully sexually liberated the French magical world in a violent (sweaty, mostly shirtless...) revolution in 1862. A cultural milestone that eventually lead to a more accepting Magical Britain.

Now /that's/ an AU History of Magic class.

Don't just /say/ it is a certain way, give some actual deep backstory. No need to go overboard, but don't just brush it off.
