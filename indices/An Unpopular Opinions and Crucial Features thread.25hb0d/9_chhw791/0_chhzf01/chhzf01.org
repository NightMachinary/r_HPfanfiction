You might have a point when it comes to muggleborns, but the magical world is /not/ the muggle world (many pureblood appear to be completely out of touch with the muggle world) and we don't really have a canon stance on cultural issues like that within the magical world.

In my opinion what's important is internal consistency and ideally a bit of exploration of why the author's take on the magical world is the way it is.
