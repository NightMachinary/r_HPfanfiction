There are two things that will immediately make me stop reading:

1. Overly sentimental/dramatic characterisations. If you feature teenage boys in the 1970s calling each other sickeningly cute nicknames and crying at the drop of a hat, you'd better have a good reason for it.

2. A-historical interpretations of sexuality. If you're writing in the Marauders' era, and you are writing queer characters, then having them be out is going to require some discussion of how that fits into the world.

Basically I want things to be as realistic as possible from a characterisation point of view. And then have dragons and magic and stuff. But two of the things that I love about Harry Potter is that the characters are not just fantasy tropes and that the magical world is deeply embedded in the Muggle world, so I'd like to see these things dealt with reasonably in a fic.
