I agree wholeheartedly. One of the reasons Harry Potter was/is so popular is the relatability (is that a word?) of the characters, despite the fact that they live in a magical world. They go through the same successes, problems, fun and hard times that we do, only interwoven with magic. It creates a severe longing for us to be part of Harry's clique, walk up and down Diagon Alley and catch a few snitches along the way. Some of the problems with FF are that that can disappear, leaving only a hollow shell of uninteresting characters in an unbelievable (the true meaning) world
