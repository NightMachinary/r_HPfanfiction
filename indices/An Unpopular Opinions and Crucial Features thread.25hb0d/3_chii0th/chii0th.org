*UO:* Canon Sirius Black isn't a hero, and shouldn't be written like one in straight canon compliant fics. Making a bad decision is good tragic backstory, but it doesn't /automatically/ make a character a hero coming out the other side.

Mr. Black is one of the good guys, clearly, but he is not a /hero/. Sirius helps Harry out some, provides a (poor) look at adult wizards, drives some plot elements, and introduces new wizarding environments. But Sirius ultimately isn't a hero, even at the end.

/Especially/ at the end.

That's my unpopular opinion. Not sure I've ever really seen it said before, in fact.

--------------

*CF:* I can stand horrible composition.

I really can.

I can stand bad pacing and dialog, poor spelling, horrible clich√©s, and weird AU self-insert characters.

But I /can't stand/ straight canon retellings.

They make me want to murder Ron with a spork during the first Welcoming Feast. I'll give a new story a chapter, or a few thousand words. No more. If I still see boring internal dialog alongside all actual plot developments turning out /exactly the same way as in canon/ then I'm gone.

*My critical feature* is that I need at least some originality in plotting. No matter what strange new AU characters they throw in, an author also has to do something new.

Change something from canon events. Maybe add new stuff in the gaps. Just don't simply rehash what we already know from the original stories. The shared telepathic insides of the main characters' heads doesn't count as a canon plot gap.

Your AU Malfoy is a bisexual half-Veela, half unicorn, dragon animagus? O...kay, with half-decent writing I'll go along with even that mess for half a novel's worth of nonsense. But the CoS events happen /exactly the same as in canon/? So much so that even after Malfoy marries a female (or not) Harry in a Druidic ritual in the Forbidden Forest, everything still ends just in time to save Ginny /just like/ in the original story?

I won't even review that. You get nothing. You lose. /Good day sir./

"Reads" type fics are also stupid and should die in a fire.
