I like your viewpoint on Sirius; A good man, who still needs to prove himself. He helps Harry, but if you look at his timeline of events - Tries to murder a murderer, goes to Azkaban, Breaks out, Spends a year scaring the sh*t out of everyone in the wizarding world, tries to commit the crime he was punished for, runs around for a year then sits around for a year before helping Harry - its not very spectacular. Interesting, yes, but not spectacular. I think that he is such a well loved character - there is scarcely a bad word said about him in the books by a character that isn't Snape - and so people like to overdramatise his life to the point where he becomes a hero. The phrase "you either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become a villain" is particularly appropriate; We don't see Sirius long enough for him to do any bad things, so people tend to try and canonise him in their books.
