*Unpopular Opinions*

Draco will never be with Hermione. Bigotry runs deep. He spent seven years calling Hermione the wizarding equivalent of "nigger" and meaning it. Draco may eventually grow out of being overtly supremacist, but I really doubt that he'd grow out of it completely, especially in the short time frame most stories tend to cover.

Snape was an immature asshole. So what if Harry's dad was a douche to you. You're at least 30 years old so start acting like it. You know damn well that he was raised in an abusive household and doesn't think of himself as any sort of "golden boy."

The marauders, back in the day, were tremendous jerks and a lot of the time Lupin seems to be the only one from his generation who actually grew up instead of just growing older.

*Crucial Feature*

There need to be believable character interactions and at least an attempt at decent spelling and grammar. Demonstrating that the story is going to be readable is especially important in the first chapter or two. If I feel like I have to stop to convert what the author wrote into comprehensible English I'll probably drop the story.
