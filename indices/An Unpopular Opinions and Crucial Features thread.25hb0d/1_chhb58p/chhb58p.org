*Unpopular opinion:* I hate shipping. Not ships, but shipping.

Shipping is this really big thing in the community, and I honestly hate every single pairing. Actually, I don't hate the pairings. I hate the pairings as plot.

There's been this very strange phenomena that I've seen where a /ton/ romance fics don't really have any plot, but are more, "Let's throw these two characters together and rip off every single other fic." Now, I know a lot of people like fluffy stories, and I do too at times, but even the worst romance novel will have some type of plot. A lot of times these are just rehashes of canon, except with some juvenile concept of love thrown in. The only drama a lot of these fics have are misunderstandings that any reasonable people would talk about.

The thing I hate most about shipping though is that each ship has its own tropes, like little sub-universes. Kwan-Li did a good summary of Hermione/Harry tropes [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/24gg4z/may_book_club/cha77fl][here]] and every conversation about ships leads back to central complaints:

- Luna is always a seer
- Hermione/Harry is always far too overblown
- Ginny has little personality as written
- Daphne in fanon is all cliche, with no substance
- Slash is... well slash. Not everyone's cup of tea
- There are very few other girls, and almost none of them have personality

And I'm honestly sick of it. Shipping is what makes people pass over good fics because of the romance in them. Really, shouldn't /any/ pairing work if the story is well written?

*Semi-unpopular, canon opinion:* I hate Harry.

Now, don't get me wrong, Harry is a decent bloke. He can be a good character. Nothing wrong with him. But christ if he isn't more boring than a vanilla wafer.

I think a lot of it is my complete inability to write Harry. I can see Harry in other's works and think, "Yep, that's him in character," but I can never nail down anything concrete about him.

He gets mad, he'll help people, he appreciates his friends, he's very curious, good at sports. I simply hate that he'll never do any of that without prompting. Harry in the story lacks agency for the vast majority of it.

He feels human in the books. He really does. In good works, he does too. I just can't help but feel that he isn't a particularly unique human. Rowling set out to make him an everyman, and damn did she succeed.

When you look at him closely, there's nothing decisive about him. His flaws are general, things any young reader could relate to. His strengths are idealized. He isn't strong because he's strong, he's strong because he represents the idealized version of what the reader would do.

He had a horrible childhood, but does it show? You can argue that it shows in his antisocial, never-succeed tendencies, but I don't think that's true. We just never see him interacting with others because it isn't plot-relevant. He had a good relationship with most of the people in Gryffindor, he clearly cared for DADA and the DA, he clearly cared and wanted to succeed in Quidditch.

I dunno, I think there's a reason that when most people say they want everyone in character, it usually doesn't apply to Harry.

*Crucial Features:* I'm going to agree with everyone else and say dialogue.

Dialogue has to be decent. I can forgive bad prose, bad description, bad everything if the dialogue and plot are good. Nothing takes me out faster than bad dialogue.
