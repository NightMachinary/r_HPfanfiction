Harry/Cho/Cedric is a poly ship I've seen. There aren't many fics of it however.

An Excessive Amount of Politeness is good but incomplete. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17159819]]

These two are also the same ship however I have not read them so I can't speak of their quality. These are the only non oneshot fics I have found of the pairing.
