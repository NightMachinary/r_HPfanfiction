Oh! Well I'm glad that you found your story. I think you might want to give this fic a chance too. Harry goes to therapy deals with ptsd after the death of Sirius but then gradually gets stronger as a person having a network of people ready to support him. And the way that he becomes more powerful and cool is really satisfying. The trauma and ptsd that he constantly has to battle really balances things out. Hopefully you'll like it! Voldemort becomes a twisted mentor in a way and Harry leads a double life.
