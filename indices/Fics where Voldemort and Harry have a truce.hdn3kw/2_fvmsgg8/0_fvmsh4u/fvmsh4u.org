  Having had more than enough of his life, Harry Potter decided to broker the deal of the ages! What's Britain when compared to his life after all? -- This is a piece of crackfic which is only meant to be humorous and nothing more. If you're looking for good writing, a solid plot line and developed characters...look elsewhere. You've been warned. Read at your own risk! - EJ
