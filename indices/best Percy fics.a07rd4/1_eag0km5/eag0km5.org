Lately I have been loving linkffn(Percy take the wheel by kitty smith). It has such an amazing Percy. Also you said no romance but I'd still recommend linkffn(proving them wrong by griffinsky) which tells the story of what Percy was up to during the war, including meeting Audrey. And lastly, linkffn(Harry Potter without Harry Potter by slytherinim) has an awesome Percy, though he's not the absolute focus of the story. There are a lot of main characters and he is one of them.
