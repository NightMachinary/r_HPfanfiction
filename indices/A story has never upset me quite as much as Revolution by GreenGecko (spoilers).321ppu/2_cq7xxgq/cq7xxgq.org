  I guess as a follow up question, has any story gotten you really far into it, gotten you emotionally invested, and then done something that just made you drop it?

Currently falling out of love with The Arithmancer, as I commented here elsewhere... Hermione seems so overpowered and doesn't act her age anymore. She acts like a prim, nagging 20-something year old. She has an answer to everything and everyone, and the story has her solving or leading almost every situation/plot point. It seems like the other characters put her on a pedestal. It's disheartening, because I loved the concept of this.

If a fic is already complete once I've started it, I'm pretty good at stomaching a fic and just skimming/speed reading on to the end. WIPs, though, I'm more likely to abandon halfway through if the characters just become OOC. I find that authors start out writing ok, but as their story diverges from canon, the characters end up acting really OOC.
