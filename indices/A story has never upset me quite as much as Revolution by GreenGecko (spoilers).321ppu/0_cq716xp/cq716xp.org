  I guess as a follow up question, has any story gotten you really far into it, gotten you emotionally invested, and then done something that just made you drop it?

It didn't make me drop the story because I liked the series as a whole, but some of the decisions made by the protagonist of the /Alexandra Quick/ series almost had me banging my head on the wall in frustration.
