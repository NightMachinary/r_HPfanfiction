I'm not sure about that, I think the real issue is that Alex learns the /wrong/ lessons. Through the books adults keeping her in the dark have pushed her to break rules again and again despite the consequences, because there's just so much dangerous shit going on in AQ. The real make or break it pout I think is going to be the next book. If Alexandra learned absolutely no caution from all the pain and trouble she caused people, I'm done. If she finally had to come to terms with how badly she's messed up so many people's lives, including her own, then I think the arc will be justified.
