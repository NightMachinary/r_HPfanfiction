I kinda understood Harry's reasoning behind /that/ decision. What made me a bit disinterested in the whole story was that Harry even let the impostor run free in his native world in the first place. It's a being from an alternate dimension, all he knows about him is that he (the impostor) could've ended up like his Snape but he didn't, and yet he lets him run things in his very own house.

Everything turns out fine eventually, sure, --- the impostor even kinda helps him --- but that's precisely what I had problems with in that story. The author was making his protagonists act on a string of idiot balls and later was /rewarding/ them for making irrational and stupid decisions.

  has any story gotten you really far into it, gotten you emotionally invested, and then done something that just made you drop it?

Other than the opening story itself, I think I'll also mention /Mastermind Hunting/ and /The Sacrifices Arc/. Both, unfortunately, go very bad at the very end, so you don't even have a choice of meaningfully dropping them by that point.
