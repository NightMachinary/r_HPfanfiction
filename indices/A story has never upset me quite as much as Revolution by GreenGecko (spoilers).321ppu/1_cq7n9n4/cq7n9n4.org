BarbLP wrote one of the best trilogies ever (Psychic Serpent etc.), and then tacked on the absolute worst ending in all of fanfiction, ever. Seriously, you're 1.2 million words in, it's so well written otherwise, and then boom!

I've never re-read it. I probably should eventually - its got some great parts in it, especially for when it was written (between books 4 & 5), but it just pissed me off that much. Thankfully I've never seen another story that ended anything near like it.
