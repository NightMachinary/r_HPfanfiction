Second Year: The trio wonder what Dumbledore does on Holiday and each come up with their ideas of what vacation he would go on.\\
Hermione: He would obviously go to an academic convention. Maybe the International Alchemy Expo in Montereal?\\
Harry: How about the Beach?\\
Hermione: That's a bit ridiculous. Honestly, can you picture Dumbledore in a bathing suit?\\
Ron: Well I am now. I'm going to blame my nightmares on you.

Third Year: A snowball fight in winter on the way to Care of Magical creatures. Ron throws a snowball at Harry and misses and hits Hermione. Hermione gets him back by making a snowball go down his shirt with magic. Harry laughs at them both so they launch snowballs at him. They get to Care of Magical creatures covered in snow and laughing.
