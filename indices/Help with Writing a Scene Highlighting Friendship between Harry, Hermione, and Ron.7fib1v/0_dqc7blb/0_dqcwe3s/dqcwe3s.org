A debate about the nature of magic isn't really what I'm looking for. The homework idea is more along the right lines, but still a bit too serious. I'm trying to get something that's just a goofy seen showing how the trio are good friends, not highlighting the differences between the muggle and magical worlds, etc.

Thanks for your ideas though!
