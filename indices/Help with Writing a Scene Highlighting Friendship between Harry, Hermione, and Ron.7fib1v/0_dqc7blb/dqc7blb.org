A good startinng point could be all of three of them doing homework. Then Hermione finds something weird she doesn't understand and Ron explains how the weird thing is actually a Wizarding custom that is actually a staple of their culture. Cue Hermione explaining why it's actually insane, Harry nodding along but not wanting to offend anyone, Ron getting annoyed that they are not getting it. End the scene with Hermione and Harry warming up a bit to wizarding customs and Ron acknowledging how maybe some things wizards do are just plain strange.

A couple of examples that come to mind that I read in fanfics are: In some story some dude liked to be transfigured into a tree and have people call him Mr. Woody. Some other character uses that as an example to demonstrate to Harry why his shit is not weird at all.

Another (I think it was on OTWTG) was a discussion about the nature of belief and how it differs between wizards and muggles - what with how muggles have basically embraced science and sceptiscism towards supernatural things, while belief is paramount to wizards, since it powers their magic. Blaise uses this to extrapolate on why the whole wizarding community treats Harry as some sort of messianic figure (Harry thinks the whole community is kinda idiotic for doing it) and Blaise points out how the public's belief is centered on Harry, because he makes it easy for them, with all the crazy shit he pulls.
