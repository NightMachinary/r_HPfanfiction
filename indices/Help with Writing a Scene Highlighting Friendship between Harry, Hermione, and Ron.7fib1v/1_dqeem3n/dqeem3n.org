Working together on divination homework can lead to interesting discussions. Long conversations on what ghastly future is coming and making a contest over the funniest stories. I imagine that Ron's homework was always the most entertaining, Hermione always wrote dissertations on why divination was a sham, and Harry just gave dull boring work if Ron didn't encourage him.
