How about harry and hermione are having a conversation about something muggle (maybe how her older sister who is a model or photographer or makeup artist just sent her photos of a fashion shoot she worked on) as harry and ron play chess who's interjecting how weird muggle stuff is and talking about the magic equivalent (mannequins that dance for attention to show off their outfits) while hermione rolls her eyes at ron's interjections.
