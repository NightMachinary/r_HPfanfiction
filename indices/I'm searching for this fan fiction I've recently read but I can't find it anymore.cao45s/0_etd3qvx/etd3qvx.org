it's 1000000000% this fic. not sure why it took me so long to find but i read it very recently, exactly the one you're looking for, harry flies the dragon to show off in the first task and befriends the prince of the merpeople in the second task. draco makes the potter stinks badges for all the houses because harry endorses them & doesn't think he himself is a real champion. linkao3(12006417)
