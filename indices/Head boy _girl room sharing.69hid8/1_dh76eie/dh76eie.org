Hate the private shared rooms for the Head Kids thing. I prefer each house having 2 private dorms away from the others but still connected to the Houses Common rooms.

I would also expect the heads to have a Office that is probably shared between them so they can talk to the other prefects from the other houses and have a room to have office hours for younger students.
