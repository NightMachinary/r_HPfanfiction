I don't know how, but the author pulled off this Winnie the Pooh crossover one shot and it's absolutely charming and calming and wonderful.

linkffn(in which snape befriends an old grey donkey)

This is a fic where the Dursleys abandon young Harry in a park and since he has no knowledge of wizards, decides his magic means he isn't human and must actually be a forest elf. He lives his life as such. It's pretty dang adorable. If you like Harry is a Dragon you'll probably enjoy this one. It's complete and there's also a complete sequel.

linkffn(fantastic elves and where to find them)

This one is a hilariously written light hearted parody. I've actually read it out loud to my kids, they love it.
