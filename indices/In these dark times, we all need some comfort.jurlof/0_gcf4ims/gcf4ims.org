Looking for the same thing, so hoping some others will post too. Sadly, the two you mentioned I have read already. Here are some of mine that I think fit the bill:

You probably know this one already, since it is basically a classic of the fandom. Very light hearted and not focused on any conflicts.

Make A Wish by Rorschach's Blot

I also think this one fits, could maybe call it slice-of-life-ish. Also my favorite fic of the last years.

Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19

For this one I can't say for certain that it will fit, I have just started it, but so far the first chapters are very fluff-y. Also has the "mild smut" tag, so take that as you will. Thought I'd just include it.

Pink & Blue by Hermione_Stranger
