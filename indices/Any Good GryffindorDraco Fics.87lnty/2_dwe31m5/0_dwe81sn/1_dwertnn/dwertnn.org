I loved the Dangerverse! I think the writing quality started out a tad rough but got better with time, to the point where I regularly find myself thinking about one of the major plot points from near the end of the series. It does some things I've never seen done in HP did before or since, and I like that. YMMV if you prefer heavy angst (angst is plentiful but tempered with comedy and healthy familial relationships) or dislike OCs (three main and an infinitely revolving cast of minor), but I really love it.
