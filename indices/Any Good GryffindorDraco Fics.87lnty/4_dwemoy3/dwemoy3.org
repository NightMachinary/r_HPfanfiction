I remember a rather popular one where Draco was sorted wrong in an attempt to please his father (I guess?) but he still picks fights with the trio nearly every chance he gets.

He does still display some Slytherin tendencies, of course, but it's obvious he belongs in Gryffindor. Give me a moment to find it.

Edit: [[https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Philosophers-Stone-Rowling/dp/0747532745][Here]]. It's the first of a series, and it goes through all seven years, though Draco isn't the focus for +some+ most of them.
