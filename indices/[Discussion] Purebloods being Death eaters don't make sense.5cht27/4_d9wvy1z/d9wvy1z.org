To me, the whole Potter story had echoes of Germany in World War II all through it; one guy gets it in his head that certain citizens are better than others, is pretty witty with his words and gathers a following, uses fear tactics to get what he wants, expects certain things of the members of his inner circle.

Hitler was essentially the devil, but I've read a few of his speeches and he was certainly persuading. It was all about the Us vs Them mentality, and when people start getting scared of Them, they become quite easy to manipulate. And those that didn't buy into the fear became traitors to the cause and would be punished accordingly.

I was watching a documentary the other night and one of the head guys at Auschwitz literally couldn't understand that what he'd done was wrong, that's how ingrained the mentality becomes (which is horrifying).

I can see how Voldemort would have played on the fear of what muggles would do to wizards if they knew about them (we've all heard of the Salem Witch Trials) so I imagine he went for the 'we better kill them before they kill us' route (like Magneto in Xmen).
