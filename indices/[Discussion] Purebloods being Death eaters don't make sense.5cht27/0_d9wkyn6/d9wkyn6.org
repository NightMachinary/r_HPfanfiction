  In the history of terrorism, you don't really see groups of privileged people rising up against a group of people who are already oppressed. You see it the other way around, groups of oppressed minorities rising up against a greater power.

Sorry, but I think you're forgetting a few terrorist groups, like the KKK or random hate groups that entrap and torture gay people in Russia & Eastern Europe. The people in these groups are often working class, but often, especially in the case of the KKK, are made up of esteemed members of society in highly privileged positions. There's even an argument that modern-day ISIS terrorists are organised and led by people that grew up in rather privileged lives, with high levels of education and tech-savviness.
