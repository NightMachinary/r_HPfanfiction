Yes, Osama bin Laden's father was quite wealthy. I'm not certain how much of that wealth bin Laden received though, because bin Laden had about 50 other siblings, and I think his mother and birth father also divorced before she remarried. I'm not sure, too, how wealthy his stepfather was.

Anyway, I did mention below my views on religious terrorism, which in short, is that religion is one of the few things that is able to easily transcend social classes, particularly in a country dominated by one religion, and therefore, I consider religious terrorism to be very distinct from other forms of terrorism, especially the ethnic terrorism we see in the Harry Potter world.
