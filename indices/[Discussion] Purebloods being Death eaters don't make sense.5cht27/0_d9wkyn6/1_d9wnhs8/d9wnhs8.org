Well, the KKK were formed around the time the black political movement was gaining power, I believe. In this case, privileged people were lashing out at a threat to their power, at people who were slowly breaking free of their oppression. Although, [[/u/turbinicarpus]] does raise a point that I hadn't really considered before. I'd always assumed that nothing really changed in the Muggleborn political movement, which was a bit silly of me.

I also probably should have been more specific, but to me, religious terrorism is very distinct from other forms of terrorism. Religious terrorism is just so different from ethnic terrorism, ethno-national terrorism or other forms of terrorism, because it's driven by belief in something that is beyond any of us. Because of that, it more easily transcends social class, particularly in an age where social divisions are becoming increasingly blurred, or in a country where a most of the population follow one religion.
