  Well, the KKK were formed around the time the black political movement was gaining power, I believe. In this case, privileged people were lashing out at a threat to their power, at people who were slowly breaking free of their oppression.

The Death Eaters were probably founded in the late 50s or 60s. The first muggleborn MoM was elected in 1962. You can see how they could think their power was being threatened.
