As far as I know, the RAF consisted of a group of middle-class people who were fighting against what they saw as the imperialist establishment. While they could be considered economically privileged, I'd argue that they're still fighting against something greater than they were. They saw themselves as exploited and oppressed by imperialism, and were attacking key political and economical figures in an attempt to undermine it.

Privilege, in my opinion, is relative. You can put it on a global scale and say that most of the American population is privileged, including those that live in relative poverty, while the starving children in Africa are not. It would be true, but if you start comparing homeless people in America to starving African children, the homeless people are more 'privileged' because they have better access to food and clean water, etc. Looking at it that way, one could also argue that the members of the RAF were less privileged than those political and economic figures they attacked.
