  In the history of terrorism, you don't really see groups of privileged people rising up against a group of people who are already oppressed. You see it the other way around, groups of oppressed minorities rising up against a greater power. These people rarely have another alternative, whether that is reality or how they perceive it.

I'd disagree. Revolutionary groups typically have educated middle -class people, at least in positions of leadership.

A real-world model for the Death Eaters is quite possibly the German Red Army Faction - a small group that spent most of the 70's and 80's trying to advance their extreme Maoist-Marxist ideology by setting off bombs, killing police officers and corporate executives, and carrying out bank robberies to finance it. They were almost entirely university-educated and middle-class.

With the Death Eaters, we have the RAF, but led by a nearly unstoppably, nuclear-warhead-in human form.
