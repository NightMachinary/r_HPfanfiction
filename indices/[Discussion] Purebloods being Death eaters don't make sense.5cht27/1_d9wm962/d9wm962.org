In a nutshell, dominant groups often react aggressively, even violently, when they perceive their dominance being threatened or eroded, even if that perception is inaccurate (i.e., created by propaganda) or if those threatening it are merely asking for equality. Rise of the Ku Klux Klan during the Reconstruction after the American Civil War is one very clear example. (There are many others, but they would be either less familiar or more controversial.)

The canon books cover a very short time frame from a very limited perspective, but from Pottermore and other sources, the wizarding society is shown to be moving in the direction of blood-equality among wizards and at least some respect for Muggles. For example, it's implied that activities like muggle-hunting used to be legal (presumably if they didn't endanger the Statute of Secrecy), but support for legalizing it is considered a fringe idea by the time the story starts. Similarly Nobby Leach was the first Muggleborn Minister for Magic, serving in mid 1960s, which coincided with Death Eaters' rise, the actual fighting beginning shortly after.

That a lot of this might have felt like it was being pushed on them by Dumbledore probably further increased the pureblood supremacists' resentment. But, of course, they couldn't publicly challenge the popularity and the authority of the Headmaster of Hogwarts and defeater of Grindelwald; and they certainly couldn't challenge both him and the Ministry in magic, either, so violent means were out, and they were forced to bide their time and content themselves with trying to poison the Muggleborn Minister.

Enter Voldemort, who could match Dumbledore spell for spell. This made violence appear to be a feasible way to accomplish their goal of restoring their supremacy, so they put on masks and began their terrorist campaign.
