To your first point, well, I was just about to write down an answer, before I thought of something that blew holes in my own argument, so that's awkward.

For your second argument, well, the thing is, terrorism isn't necessarily about large-scale attacks. If you go by the Google definition of terrorism, it's: 'the unofficial or unauthorized use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims.'

Nowhere in there does it mention that terrorism needs to be large-scale attacks the likes of which it's been associated with in more recent times. So, really, Voldemort's tactics that are meant to (and do) inspire fear and intimidation for political aims are very much acts of terrorism, even if he refrained from large-scale attacks in the Wizarding world.
