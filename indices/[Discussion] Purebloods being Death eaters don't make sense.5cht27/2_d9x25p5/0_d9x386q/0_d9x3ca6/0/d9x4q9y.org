The targeted assassinations did still have their risks, e.g., Amelia Bones who Voldemort had to defeat himself. A Death Eater would almost certainly have died fighting her. Maybe in a group they could have taken her, but I think she would have at least been able to take down a few before she was killed, too. Their form of terrorism, while not as large-scale and perhaps less risky, still had its risks nonetheless.

Wouldn't it be easier to hire someone? It'd be much safer for them to do so, as long as they take the steps to hide their identity. The job would be done, and they could guarantee their social positions and lives.
