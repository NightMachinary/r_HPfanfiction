That it could still be called terrorism doesn't mean much. Your argument was very much based on the fact that terrorism in the sense of large scale attacks against the general population was counter-productive for socially dominant purebloods. A handful of targeted assassinations, however, while potentially still terrorism, do not have anything like the same effect. There's nothing that doesn't make sense about a political faction eliminating specific figures who stand between them and greater power. It's Coup 101.
