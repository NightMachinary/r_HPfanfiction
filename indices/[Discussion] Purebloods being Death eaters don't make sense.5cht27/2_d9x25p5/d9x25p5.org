You're referring to fanon here, not canon.

Firstly, in canon, there is no evidence that purebloods (and especially pureblood supremacists) have any kind of grip on political power. A Muggleborn was elected Minister for Magic in 1962, people react to the word "mudblood" in much the same way as they react to "nigger" in the Muggle world. All evidence points towards the wizarding world absent Voldemort being about as progressive about blood as the Muggle world is about race.

Secondly, in canon, the Death Eaters do not go around mindlessly attacking wizards. The fanon-favourite of attacks on Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade do not occur. They serve no strategic purpose. The terrorist-style attacks the Death Eaters do perform are performed against /Muggles/, not wizards. When it comes to wizards, the Death Eaters are more about individual assassinations. That's how Mr Weasley described the way they used the Dark Mark - you'd come home to find it over your house. It's also how we heard of the Death Eaters picking off Order members one by one. And after OotP, it's how we hear they're picking off individual members of the Ministry who are troublesome like Amelia Bones.
