  You know, when you said 'making Britain pure again', all I could think of was Trump's slogan of 'make America great again'.

It may have something to do with it being intended reference.

  Because in canon, the portrayal of blood purity is quite different, at least to the extent that these 'pureblood' wizards were not just shunning Muggle/Wizard marriages, but also 'Mudbloods', despite them previously being considered 'gifted'. Their blood superiority seems to have become something more literal, too, rather than just a political statement.

Because muggleborns are connected to muggles and muggles are disgusting and they don't want to have anything to do with them.
