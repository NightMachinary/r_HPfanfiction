You know, when you said 'making Britain pure again', all I could think of was Trump's slogan of 'make America great again'. Honestly, the whole situation you've described does sound eerily similar to me of what's going on in America today with gay rights, black rights marches, etc. And then, a man comes in and promises to fix America.

It is also definitely interesting to see what Pottermore says about blood purity, and how much it's been twisted into what it is in canon. Because in canon, the portrayal of blood purity is quite different, at least to the extent that these 'pureblood' wizards were not just shunning Muggle/Wizard marriages, but also 'Mudbloods', despite them previously being considered 'gifted'. Their blood superiority seems to have become something more literal, too, rather than just a political statement.

But yes, the political situation prior to Voldemort's rise is rather more complex than I'd realised. It's been previously pointed out to me how Nobby Leach was elected MoM, though I was unaware of the rest of these facts here, which do paint an even more convincing picture of why purebloods chose to become Death Eaters, if they felt that their power was being threatened by those they considered 'lesser'.
