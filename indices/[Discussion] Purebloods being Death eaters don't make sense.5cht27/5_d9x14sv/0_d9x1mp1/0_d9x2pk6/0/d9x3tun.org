Yes, a lot of what you're saying about fight scenes is something a lot of fans have problems with, including myself. The HP fight scenes are all just very... uncreative and limited. They fire spells at each other that have a clear purpose and Voldemort's spell repertoire seems to consist of a handful of spells: the three Unforgiveables, whatever he did to make Harry bow in the fourth book, giving Pettigrew his silver hand and his fight with Dumbledore where he showcased some more showy stuff. Maybe a few minor spells like levitation and Summoning charms, I can't remember. But it's all quite sad for a vaunted genius who was top of his class throughout his Hogwarts years.

Either way, the fights are all very straightforward with no one thinking outside the box.

Their 15 years of inactivity doubtless took a toll, too, like you pointed out. Lucius got older, he was 40 around GoF, so past his peak. Bellatrix was 50 (I was so shocked when I found out about this, but she was actually 50 around book 5), and had been in Azkaban for 15 years, which can't exactly have done wonders for her physique.

Still, a lot of their off-screen competence can be attributed to how Rowling has portrayed the Wizarding world, I think. In general, people run and scream (World Cup in GoF) and don't really fight back unless they're Aurors or members of the Order of the Phoenix. Which would be fine in the real world, really, because most civilians wouldn't be carrying around a lethal weapon in their pockets. But in the Wizarding world where a bit of teamwork could have ended a terror campaign a lot quicker, it suggests that the Wizarding society, overall, are very passive in their resistance, and shows where the whole 'wizarding society are sheep' idea in fanfic comes from. I mean, sure, they may have been scared to see Death Eaters reappearing but there were hundreds, if not thousands of them there. So the Death Eaters easily crushing any resistance could also be attributed to the apparent passivity of the general populace. And while a lot of them avoided prison, they were mainly throwing bribes around and pretending that they had just been freed of the Imperius Curse, which isn't exactly something many terrorists in the real world can claim: 'I didn't want to, but they put a spell on me!'

So yeah, they weren't exactly portrayed as the most competent group, which is a bit of a shame. It would have been nice to see a few more intense fight scenes that actually showed them as dangerous people, instead of people who have difficulty handling six teenagers.
