  Why didn't they use some of that super magical artillery to soften up the opposition before charging in? One extra salvo would have shattered the defenders' front line and another would have taken down a large number of the best defensive positions available. Hell,a spot of fiendfyre would have killed most if not all of thse defending the gates,leaving the way clear for the auxiliary units to rampage across the school.

Voldemort wanted Hogwarts as intact as possible. It's probably the only thing in the world he respects, likes or even loves. He stopped the basilisk attacks so Hogwarts wouldn't close. He could very easily have destroyed Hogwarts and broken the resistance, but he didn't think it was worth it.

  though they would still have won if they hadn't stopped to gawk at the Voldie-HP confrontation, which I found equally frustrating.

The rest of the battle didn't matter, only the Voldemort vs. HP duel did. If Voldie won, no one could kill him. If Harry won, the Death Eaters were left without their master. Either way, the rest of the battle would be moot by the time their duel was over.
