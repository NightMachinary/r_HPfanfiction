Yeah, it took me a while to reconcile the idea that the Deaters in the books were the core of a movement that almost overran wizarding Britain under Dumbledore's nose little more than a decade beforehand as well. It helps if you remember that they only take the stage after 15 years of inactivity, their leader just had his psyche wrecked by virtue of being Wraithed and their first venture in the public world was to carry out a dumbass operation that almost saw Lestrange get murdered by a fucking teenager. Seriously, that was the worst planned/thought out intelligence retrieval operation in fiction (non-fiction is a very different story on the other hand).

And the battle of Hogwarts shouldn't have happened at all. The Deaters had the numbers, the high ground and the magical power to blow the wards. Why didn't they use some of that super magical artillery to soften up the opposition before charging in? One extra salvo would have shattered the defenders' front line and another would have taken down a large number of the best defensive positions available. Hell,a spot of fiendfyre would have killed most if not all of thse defending the gates,leaving the way clear for the auxiliary units to rampage across the school. Instead, we get an object lesson as to what happens when a group that specialises in quick skirmishes with a clear numerical advantage over their opponents attempts to fight a pitched battle against an entrenched foe... though they would still have won if they hadn't stopped to gawk at the Voldie-HP confrontation, which I found equally frustrating.

Point being, the Death eaters come off as clumsy because they're not fighting their standard engagements in canon with the notable exception of the book six Hogwarts infiltration. That was more their speed-probably one of their staple approaches to assassination at that. They were fast, smooth and didn't miss a beat apart from the pre facto gloating they indulged in. That kind of thing means skill and experience, which showcases that they can be dangerous badasses when doing something they've prepared for properly.

In every other instance, they're fighting under unfamiliar circumstances and are forced to adapt on the fly, which is a recipe for disaster when you're usually the one that sets the rules of engagement and pace a battle follows.

What's even worse is their off screen competence. They take the ministry and, a few months later, all resistance has been practically crushed with nary a peep of a serious confrontation happening before the battle of Hogwarts. They set up a simple trap using a taboo word that nets them the golden trio. In a pitched battle against a huge number of determined and capable defenders, they come within spitting distance of total victory despite the odds. This doesn't even cover how the majority of them avoided prison after the fall of loldemort in the first place. Compare and contrast any other member of a fallen terrorist group that manages to survive the carnage.

Compared to the scarily effective badasses they are off-screen, their portrayal on-screen is rather sad.
