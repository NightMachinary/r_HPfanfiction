I'm finding myself agreeing to most of what you said here. I've never thought about it from that perspective, but it does make a lot of sense. The Inner Circle would probably be the ones Voldemort spent the most time cultivating, which seems really obvious now that you've pointed it out, but I always subconsciously assumed otherwise, probably because of how they're portrayed in the books, I think. The only real battle between Death Eaters and Harry that we see is in the Department of Mysteries in OotP, and maybe a little bit in the seventh book, and it doesn't exactly paint a good picture of the Death Eaters. I guess I ended up assuming that because they weren't that competent, that Voldemort didn't spend much time on them? And because many of them ended up blending in with others in fight scenes, I just thought all Death Eaters and supporters to be on the same skill level, and my mind generalised that they were probably of the same background, if that makes sense.

The only point I'm disagreeing with you on is Voldemort's reasons for choosing purebloods, which, honestly, is really only a matter of a difference between our headcanons. In my opinion, his reasons could have gone both ways--either he picked them for their resources and his ability to exploit them, or he picked them because he really wanted to move away from the whole being abandoned by his Muggle father and (at the minimum) ostracised in his Muggle orphanage. Or it could have been a combination of both. But I think that at the point where the series starts, he was unstable enough to be unable to discern between the ideology he spouted to the wider world and his Death Eaters, and the fact that he, fifty or sixty years ago, chose them for how easy they were to manipulate. In other words, he may have chosen them fifty years ago for other reasons, but at the end of the books, I think he'd already forgotten the true reason.
