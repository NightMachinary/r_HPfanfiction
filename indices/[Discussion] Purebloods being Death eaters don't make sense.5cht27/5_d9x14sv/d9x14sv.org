Well no, that's not really the case here. The Death Eaters we see the most of in canon are the highest-ranked members of them all. We have Snape, potions master and intelligence asset, Malfoy, the political arm of the movement, Bellatrix, Voldemort's student, fenrir greyback, the dude that specialises in hunting humans and so on and so forth.

Key point here is that these guys aren't frontliners. They're part of the Dark Lord's inner circle-often because they bring something to the table others cannot. They're the group's primary source of money, training, intelligence and so on. Seeing them in the field is pretty much a statement that shit has hit the fan so hard ole Tommy's fielding his best. And every time they go, the group is exposed to a massive amount of risk as losing even one of them could well cripple the whole spiel in a significant and enduring manner.

My headcanon is that the average Death Eater in both wars was actually closer to a snatcher in terms of threat than someone of an inner circle member's calibre-skilled enough to fight a single enemy head on and part of a large enough group that they can easily overwhelm the defences of even the strongest individual fighter.

They would be poor purebloods that don't have enough conventional skills to make it in the wizarding world or enough flexibility to thrive in the muggle world. They're trapped by the world they were born into and resent the fact that mudbloods can easily skip between both sides of what is to them an unbridgeable divide. That resentment can easily fester. Added to the enticements the Dark Lord would give to sweeten the deal as well as the opportunities for knowledge and loot supporting YKW can bring and they would line up to volunteer. For them, they get to satisfy their prejudices one mass grave at a time and improve their social & professional prospects in the process. Two birds with one avada kedavra right there.

Bear in mind that terrorists aren't just composed of fanatics. Their backbone lies with the disaffected and embittered masses that recognise that the payout for helping these guys win would be massive and are desperate enough to try no matter the odds. And with the huge wealth and influence the inner circle commanded, their chances were pretty damn good.

Bear in mind that Voldemort's reasons for chosing purebloods is actually not as clear cut to me than most. In my mind, Voldemort doesn't care about ideology so much as attaining power. He was, after all, an orphaned, muggle-raised halfblood. Every time a death eater extols the virtues of murdering those exposed to muggle taint, they are unwittingly calling for the death of their own leader.

I believe he was faced with a choice between which side to take under his wing and he chose the one that afforded the easiest and most abundant pool of recruits and resources to take advantage of. Once the fight was done, I give it a fifty-fifty chance that he would have turned on the purebloods in order to eliminate any chances of there being a rebellion after he assumed ultimate power over the wizarding world.

Also, he got to turn the offspring of his erstwhile bullies and detractors into either targets or cannon fodder, so that must have been a plus to him.
