  I mentioned in the original post that Lucius was able to walk free, likely due to bribery, which suggests that the Wizengamot also had a fair share of pureblood supporters.

Well, no, it suggests that there are members of the Wizengamot who are willing to accept bribes. That in no way requires them to have any feelings one way or the other on the pureblood supremacy issue.

My point is that you're suggesting that rich pureblood families like the Malfoys are able to influence the government because they're pureblood, whereas I'm suggesting that it's because they're rich. That's the impression the books give too. Quoth Order of the Phoenix:

  'Gold, I expect,' said Mr Weasley angrily. 'Malfoy's been giving generously to all sorts of things for years... gets him in with the right people... then he can ask favours... delay laws he doesn't want passed... oh, he's very well-connected, Lucius Malfoy.'
