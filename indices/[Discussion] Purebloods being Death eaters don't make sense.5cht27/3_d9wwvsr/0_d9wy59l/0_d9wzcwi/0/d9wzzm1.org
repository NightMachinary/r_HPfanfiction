Sorry, should have been more clear about that. My logic is that after such a bloody war, half-bloods and Muggle-borns would be less likely to accept bribes from a suspected Death Eater, because they may have lost family and friends to Death Eaters, or have been targeted themselves. The ones most likely to accept the bribes are purebloods, which does point to a largely pureblood-dominated judicial system.

I will admit that my reasoning is based a lot on assumption, though, and quite a fair bit of generalising. The quote by Mr Weasley also does point to gold being the major form of incentive here. I may be wrong here, but I also don't recall the elder Weasleys talking a lot about pureblood politics or the whole ideology behind pureblood supremacy. In fact, I don't know if he's said 'pureblood' in the entire book, at least not when Harry could hear him. It's possible that the Weasley parents just preferred not to talk about pureblood supremacy in front of children/teenagers.
