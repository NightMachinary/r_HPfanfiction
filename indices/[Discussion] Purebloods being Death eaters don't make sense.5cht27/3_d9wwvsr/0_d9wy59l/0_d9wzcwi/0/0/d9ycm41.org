People are less likely to accept bribes if they have integrity. Anything other than that is based on whether the amount of gold they are getting is enough to stopgap the distaste they feel because of the act itself. And while that does mean Lucius Malfoy would have to spend more in bribes if the people he had to bribe were muggleborns, for as long as those people had no integrity there would still be nothing more than gold that he'd need for it.

And as for the reason the Weasleys don't talk much about it, it has nothing to do with “supremacy” and all to do with their distaste of the way the other purebloods approach blood purity; they are, after all, one of the “Sacred Twenty-Eight”, which to an outsider's eye marks them as enthusiastic supporters of blood purity despite the fact that had they been left alone they wouldn't care about that issue and as it is it was only by chance that they qualified.
