That is quite true. On the whole, it's likely that Lucius could have bribed enough pureblood supremacist supporters and halfbloods/Muggleborns with less integrity to get through. And even if he couldn't, I suppose he could have had an ally blackmail some of the Wizengamot in his stead. If he had blackmail on them, which we don't really know, but I do hope Lucius isn't so stupid as to not use some of his resources to prepare blackmail against the members of the Wizengamot when he was highly involved in illicit activity.

As for the how the Weasleys don't talk about it, I'm afraid I don't quite understand what you're trying to say about it. Just to clarify, I was trying to say that the Weasleys don't talk about pureblood supremacy in front of children not because they secretly support the ideology or anything, but because they dislike the whole thing and would rather not expose their children to it.
