It's true we don't see a lot of notable purebloods in canon. Another one I can think of are the Lestranges, who we do see are quite rich in the last book. I'm sure before they were all incarcerated that they would have been prominent political figures, too (maybe not Bellatrix, she seems a tad too insane for politics).

Basing off what little information I can see from canon, though, I do think that purebloods are in general, very influential. I mentioned in the original post that Lucius was able to walk free, likely due to bribery, which suggests that the Wizengamot also had a fair share of pureblood supporters. And I imagine that predominantly, pureblood supporters are pureblood, as well. So together, that paints a picture of well-off, influential purebloods who control a significant portion of Wizengamot seats, at least enough that they are able to overrule any other members that vote Lucius guilty.
