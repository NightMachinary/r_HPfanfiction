  Purebloods are rich, have the most political influence and while they may not outnumber Muggleborns and half-bloods, they are very clearly the dominant power in the Wizarding World.

You refer to "purebloods" where I believe you mean "Lucius Malfoy". It's a common mistake in the fandom, because the only notable pureblood families in the series we have a lot of information about are the Malfoys, Weasleys, and Blacks.
