We just saw it happen in the US, albeit in a less violent manner. Middle class white people who felt like they were losing their country banded together to support somebody who is known for saying racist, sexist, xenophobic things. The number and magical prowess of purebloods was dwindling so they came together for what was essentially a last stand for their power. You can't underestimate hate and fear as factors to bring people together. It's absolutely believable that a tyrant could bring people together by feeding their fears and turning it into hate.
