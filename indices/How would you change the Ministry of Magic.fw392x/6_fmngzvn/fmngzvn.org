Every year all the workers have their jobs randomly changed. So one year Fudge is the minister, but in the next is a random muggleborn that worked at the mess hall for like two months and Lucius Malfoy is the undersecretary (without the right to quit) while Umbridge has to clean all the bathrooms using her tongue for -insert random magical reason here-.
