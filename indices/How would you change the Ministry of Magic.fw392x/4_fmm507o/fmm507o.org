1. Fire Fudge

2. Investigate everyone that was suspected as a death eater in the last war. If you were 'Under the Imperious,' then you shouldn't have any issues answering some questions under truth potion. If you decline, that's okay, but you can't work here. Also, if you have a dark mark, you're out. Again, if you decline to prove yourself, we will accept your resignation.

3. Revamp security. The fact that a group of 14 and 15 year Olds was able to just walk right in and make their way to the most top secret area of the ministry does not inspire hope.

4. Mental health checks. Why? Waldin McNair, Umbridge, Runcorn, Barty Crouch Sr., Fudge... The list goes on.

5. In war times, oaths that you are not attempting, or associated with groups attempting to, or planning to attempt to overthrow or undermine the ministry or the DMLE.
