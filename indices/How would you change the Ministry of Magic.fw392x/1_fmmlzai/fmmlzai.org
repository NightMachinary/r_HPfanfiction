Consistency!! It makes ZERO sense that the Malfoys got away with no punishment. Although if we're going for reflecting 'real life', I guess it's realistic to have a corrupt government....

Side question, because I'm mulling over a fic set when Hermione is in charge, how is Minister of Magic selected? If there's no canon explanation, what system do you think they have in place?
