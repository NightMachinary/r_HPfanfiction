1. I think that in canon the Minister is elected or nominated by the Wizengamot, which Members are selected by the Minister.
2. In every form of government except democracy, the rulers are those that are believed to be the most fit to rule. In both Monarchy and Aristocracy the ruler or rulers are those that are believed to be best. Both those systems revolve around the idea that quality are better than popularity something that our modern government are terribly lacking. Both systems can also evolve around some form of inheritance ( transmission of knowledge and experience from father to son, oriented education from birth to hold the high position of society). In Democracy, the system is also build on belief, the popular belief of the majority be it wrong.
3. Ruling does not have the same morality as others, often the rulers has to take decisions that are the most immoral one can take because of it.
