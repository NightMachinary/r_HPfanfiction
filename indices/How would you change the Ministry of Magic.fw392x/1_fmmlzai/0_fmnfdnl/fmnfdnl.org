  how is Minister of Magic selected?
#+end_quote

As far as I remember we know three things from canon about this:

- Dumbledore is offered the post (iirc, several times)
- Dumbledore refuses the post
- Fudge is surprised that the Muggle PM thinks he might still be in power after all the calamities described at the start of HBP

I think there's also a line about "not being surprised at why they chose Scrimgeour" but I think it's either Harry or the PM who says/thinks it and neither of them are really well placed to comment on the process.

So... what seems to make the most sense to me with those three facts is that it works on something like a process of "affirmation".

I suggest that we think of elections as a formalised opportunity for an electorate to provide feedback/information about what's going on. In a system with elections it doesn't make much sense to hear that Dumbledore is offered the post unless people repeatedly elect him despite (a) not standing and (b) having a history of refusing the post.

An affirmation system (and I don't know what people usually call this but I'm going with affirmation) there's no formal process. What this means is that people decide a particular individual has the support of everyone else and they go up to that person and say "yo, wanna be minister?" or whatever. If that person turns the post down, they'll go with someone else. Fudge presumably got in because he seemed (a) harmless and (b) obsessed with listening to Dumbledore (i.e. who they really wanted). And the flip side is that as soon as people believe other people have lost faith in a Minister, that Minister is out on their arse. This is because the system is built on beliefs about beliefs and faith that the right person is in charge. (Remember, Arthur writes laws so bureaucrats in the ministry are, as far as we can tell, the Wizarding legislature.)

An affirmation system makes Fudge's actions much more understandable... he has no way of manipulating electoral processes to present his "theory of the case" or to hold snap elections when he's popular to forestall criticism by riding out the electoral cycle. Instead, Fudge is just left with whatever guesses he has about what people think. If you want to maintain power under affirmation, then it's necessary to act in a paranoid fashion... you can only ever guess at what people think and there's no systemic prompt to reveal information.

The only real question is who "they" are. The heads of departments? The wizengamot? Maybe it's even more extreme... you just have to present yourself as representing some sort of group (e.g. the 1973/4 Hufflepuff Quidditch team) and say "we think you're really great, want to be Minister?" And then you say to everyone else, "Hey don't you think X would be Great?" (or vice versa). And if no-one raises any particular objections... voila, a new Minister.

The other possibility is that they use something like the Goblet of Fire and it just chooses the person whom (a) the largest proportion of people would support and (b) has the capacity to work as minister. If that person declines, it spits out another name. Presumably it just spits out names whenever it feels like.

Fudge might be a terrible leader but he managed for years to organise a government in a corrupt society that may not have taxes. He's an amoral or immoral (not sure which) leader rather than an incompetent one is what I'm saying.
