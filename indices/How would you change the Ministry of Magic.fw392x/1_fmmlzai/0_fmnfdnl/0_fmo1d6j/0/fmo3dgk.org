Well, I actually got the impression that Hermione hadn't been Minister for very long in CC (and likewise Harry as the head of the DMLE). For the fic I'm working on myself (which is theoretically compliant with CC), I actually put Delphini's attack at the start of the second school year for which Hermione is Minister. Which means there's 20 school years of Hermione's making a name for herself in the Ministry. 21 and a bit years of post-War reconstruction. And 21 and a bit years for people like Lucius to just naturally lose influence as they become less and less familiar with the people who are important/worth knowing. And, of course, Hermione is a hero... you can trade on that for a very long time.

Whether by election or affirmation I really don't think the minority of blood purists would have enough influence after 20 years to get in the way of Hermione. Or, more accurately, that they wouldn't be ready to openly obstruct her ascendancy.

I do have a kind of... logical argument for having Hermione be a relative newbie in the post. I mean, I really don't understand why Harry would want to become head of the DMLE and it's pretty clear from CC that he's not very suited for the job either. Harry's being head of the DMLE has, to my eyes, a time limit on it, which implies that he hasn't been the head for very long at the start of CC. It would make sense for Harry to take up the role when Hermione becomes Minister... both since she vacates the post and because I think Hermione would encourage Harry to take the role.
