Thank you for that. It makes sense for it to be that haphazard I think!

How would you explain Hermione getting the post? Presumably all the blood-purists weren't locked in Azkaban. There must have been enough people still free who would be unhappy with a muggle born taking the post.

I love it though! TBH, it's one of the only Cursed Child plot points I can fully get on board with!
