Madam Onthespot scribbled a note down on her clipboard. "Would you like it if Miss Parkinson started insinuating that your father was a Death Eater?"

Draco nodded. "We'd get on better if she would, I think. Father has his fellows from the Board of Governors over for dinner all the time, and they always say 'Oh, yes, I agree' and 'Excellent idea, as usual' to whatever he says. It's a bore; frankly, I don't know how he stands it. Mr. Weasley on the other hand..."

"Yes?"

"Well, Father's always going on about the ginger weasels, how he's collected enough votes in the Wizengamot to put Weasley on his toes, how he can't wait to see Mr. Weasley at work in the morning to tell him about it. /That/ sounds much more interesting. Father never acts like that around anyone else but Dumbledore."

Madam Onthespot frowned. "You don't think it's a bit... antagonistic, do you?"

"Of course not," Draco declared confidently. "Mother says the most important part about building strong relationships is to get the other side to respect you."
