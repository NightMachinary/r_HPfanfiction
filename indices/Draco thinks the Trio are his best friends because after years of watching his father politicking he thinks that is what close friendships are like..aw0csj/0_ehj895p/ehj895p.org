+"So how's your relationship with Potter and friends?" asked the forgettable guidance counselor Madam Madeup Onthespot.+

+"I think it's going well. They set my favorite teacher on fire, I send their favourite member of staff to azkaban. I threaten their lives, they kidnap my goons. They take a house-elf I take a hippogriff. It's been great fun."+

+"What about your relationship with Parkinson?"+

+"I dont think its going well, I threaten her family all the time but not once has she implied that my father is a Death Eater."+

Edit: a revision

"Do you know why you were called here Mr Malfoy?" asked the forgettable guidance counselor Madam Madeup Onthespot.

Draco thought for a moment before he replied "It's my relationship with Parkinson isn't it?"

Madam Onthespot shook her head "If you want to talk about that later we can. No, the reason I called you here is your relationship with Misters Potter, Weasley, and Miss Granger."

Draco looked confused "why are we talking about my best friends?"

"Your best friends? Elaborate for me please."

Draco's face broke out in a rare expression for him, not a smirk but a full blown smile. "Oh they truly are my best friends. I have tones of fun with the game we play. I imply their of poor breeding and Granger takes it as a challenge. What do I get in the mail a week later? A ten foot report on how inbred my mums line is. Potter tricks my father into releasing a house-elf? I trick my father into arranging a sham trial for a hippogriff. But the most fun we had was around the chamber of secrets. I imply slytherins monster is coming for them, what do they do? Not only do they kidnap my goons and impersonate them, they track the monster down and kill it just to show my threats were meaningless to them."

Madam Onthespot didn't like what she was hearing. 'I quit my job as a criminal psychologist at the D.M.L.E. to get away from cases like this!' To give her some time to think she redirected the conversation "let's get back to your relationship with MIss Parkinson."

Draco's smile vanished "I dont think its going well, I threaten her family all the time but not once has she implied that my father is a Death Eater."
