In response to both the prompt by [[/u/bonsly24][u/bonsly24]] and the comment from [[/u/midasgoldentouch][u/midasgoldentouch]]:

“Potter, I need a word.”

Harry jerked out of the trance he was in. Writing reports late at night in the DMLE did that to him. He'd zone out of the world around him, only focused on reliving what had happened that day and putting it into words succinctly enough that he wouldn't be forced to rewrite it the next day. He turned around to see the least likely person standing next to his cubicle.

“Malfoy, I didn't know you worked back this late,” he said, adjusting his collar as he lent back in his chair. He checked the clock out of the corner of his eye. Almost a quarter past eleven. He really needed to get home earlier himself.

“I don't but I know that you do and so I thought this would be the best time to chat.”

“Chat? Is there something in particular you wanted to talk about? I'm kind of trying to get my reports done so I can catch a few hours of sleep tonight.”

“Of course, of course,” Draco said. He made his way into the cubicle and sat down on Harry's desk right next to where Harry's chair was leaning. Harry's eyebrows shot up and he adjusted his chair to face Draco. “You see, we just never get any chances to talk anymore like we did in school. I miss it, you know. Hopefully, with what I want to talk about today, we'll get more chances to chat again.”

“I see.” Harry really didn't. “And what is it exactly that you want to talk about?”

“Oh yes,” said Draco. “I'm not sure if you're aware as, as previously stated, we don't talk much anymore, but I'm engaged.”

“Congratulations,” said Harry. He hadn't been aware. “Who's the vict-, the lucky witch?”

“Astoria Greengrass. Not sure if you remember as you only really hung out with me from Slytherin, but her sister was in our year too. You know, the blonde girl who sat with Pansy. Daphne's her name. Astoria was a couple years younger and I don't think you ever really spoke at all.”

Harry nodded slowly, scrambling his brain. “I don't recall Astoria though I know who Daphne is.”

“Of course,” said Draco, looking as though he was trying to reassure Harry. “As I said, you only ever really hung out with me so I don't expect you to remember at all. I'd have been quite offended if you'd forgotten about me though, Potter.”

Harry chuckled along with Draco, keeping a fake smile plastered on his face. Seriously, what was going on?

“Anyway, as I was saying, I'm now engaged to Astoria and the wedding is set for next May. I know it's a fair way in advance but I have no idea of your schedule and wanted to make sure you could make it.”

“Make it to the wedding?”

“Yes.”

“I, well, I see no reason I couldn't. I can't say I was expecting it but I can come.”

“Of course I would want you there. There's nobody else I've had such a good friendship with. I want you there beside me on this most important day.”

“Beside you?”

“Well, that's where the best man normally stands, Potter. Don't play daft.”

“You're having me on, aren't you?” Harry had had quite enough of these mind games that Draco was playing now. He glared at Draco. “Whatever you're playing at, you'd better bloody knock it off.”

“Well, that's some way to acknowledge someone asking you to be their best man,” said Draco. “Seriously though, who was as close as friends as us? I'd say we're as close as Father and Mr Weasley, though I have personally been comparing that friendship with mine and Ron Weasley's friendship so I can feel like I've got a Weasley of my own like Father did. I normally compare us to Father and Dumbledore. Always at each other's throat, ready to punish any tiny error and forcing the other to be a more perfect version of their self. The continual banter and sharing of ideas with good discussions about pros and cons.”

“Sharing of ideas?” The conversation had taken another twist for the crazier and Harry didn't know what to think.

“Yes, an essential part in any healthy friendship. All through school, when I felt like I wanted to get some feedback, I'd bounce my ideas off you three. Like when I wasn't sure whether Hagrid was worth keeping as a gamekeeper or whether to get him fired after the incident with the hippogriff. You guys shot down the idea quickly and pointed out his worth. Though I do wish Granger would learn to use her words rather than her fists.”

“That's what you're calling sharing ideas?”

“Well it's how Father and Dumbledore have always kept each other sharp. Father would push for something to happen and Dumbledore would shut him down. Vice versa when Dumbledore has the idea. Father was always going on about how Dumbledore was the only person he respected, aside from Mr Weasley, of course, and I thought we had a similar relationship. I mean, you were the one to force me to up my game when following those stupid orders from Voldemort. I really had to work hard because of your efforts and I appreciate you making sure I was on top of everything.”

Now Harry was questioning every interaction he'd ever had with the blonde boy. Had Draco been trying to be friends in his own twisted way. No. Surely not. But Draco seemed so convinced that it was the case.

“And this is why you think that I am the best candidate for your best man?” asked Harry finally. “Because I'm the only one who ever challenged you?”

“Exactly, ever since we met at Madam Malkin's, you were there for me. I do appreciate it and that's why I want you as my best man. Though, you don't have to put on this nice act for it all. I know you're being very polite because I've just got engaged but it feels unnatural, you know. You can go back to your normal self, challenging, threatening and insulting me. It's far more normal when you do that and I don't want to lose that friendship. I need to know I can count on you telling me when I'm stupid like I tell you when you're behaving without class. Keep helping each other, you know.”

“Unnatural,” Harry repeated slowly. “Yes, I guess you could call it that. So, you'd rather I pushed your buttons and called you out for being a bigot? Even on your wedding day?”

“Oh, probably not on the wedding day, I think we'd need to call a temporary ceasefire for the day so that nobody around us who can't appreciate true friendship is insulted. I think even Astoria would ask us to switch to our suck up modes for the day, as dreadfully boring as it is. At least she can actually speak bluntly with me like you can, the darling lady. Told me I was a bigoted idiot the day I first spoke to her. Couldn't have asked for a finer woman. It took a while but she finally understands how to appreciate having those people in your life that insist on doing everything different to you to make you really think about what you're doing. You'll get along famously, I'm sure, as she comes up with similar arguments to what you do. Don't call people mudbloods. Stop slaughtering muggles, they have feelings too. All those kind of things. Sometimes they make sense too.”

“Sounds charming,” said Harry. Was it weird or was Malfoy actually making some kind of weird sense? Either way, this was going to be a hell of a story to tell Ron and Hermione. “When do I get to meet her?”

“So you'll do it? You'll be my best man?”

“Well, sounds like I'm the perfect candidate for it, doesn't it? I mean, who else were you going to ask? Goyle?”

“Hahaha! Good one, Potter. Him and all his ‘You're so clever, Draco' and ‘I wish I was as clever as you' comments. Seriously, can you believe he never once insulted me or challenged me in my entire time at Hogwarts? I mean, I pushed him and Crabbe every day but they couldn't be bothered to do the same for me. Almost as bad as Pansy. Cheap friendships, I say. Good for filling out parties but not for drinking whiskey with, you know?”

It was now scary how much sense Draco was making, Harry realised as he nodded along to Draco's chatter. He'd take George's teasing over Percy's dry suck up attitude any day. In a way, that seemed to be what Draco was saying and Harry couldn't help agree.

“Well, suppose I can be polite and treat you differently, in a cheap friend kind of way, for the wedding day,” said Harry, really getting carried away with the role now. “But don't expect me to put up with any blood superiority nonesense!”

“Of course not,” said Draco. “I'll be saying things I don't mean all day, being polite to everybody, but I'll save the good arguments for another time when we can insult each other as much as we please without offending the weak minded populace around us.”

“Good,” said Harry. “Now, I really should finish this report and you've waffled on far too long for this kind of hour. You've got to learn your timing, Draco.”

“Ah, then you've got to learn how to schedule time for friends so they don't need to force their way into your life,” countered Draco. He suddenly beamed at Harry. “See? I missed this!”
