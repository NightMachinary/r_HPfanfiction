I understand what fanfiction is, but I also understand what believable story telling is, and unless you change Draco's, Harry's, and their families past in general in a major way, it just cannot happen in a believable way. If you decide to change their core personalities, you need a bloody reason instead of "just because..." They are both very different people with very different backgrounds, and they also have personalities that just do not click for a relationship. If they were both gay I could understand a one-night stand between them, because their personalities would be geared towards that fine. Have you ever had someone you hate greatly, but could see yourself f****** them because of all that pent up frustration, but you could never start a meaningful relationship with such a person. That's Harry, and Draco. That's why I also hate almost all Drarry pairings, apart from the part where their EXACTLY THE SAME BEFORE HOGWARTS, their just too different for it to work. You get what I mean.
