No. What is it with f****** Drarry. That relationship makes zero sense. Let's say Harry was gay, and let's even say Draco was. They'd still never get together, because Draco puts tradition second to family, and we all know that in both those scenarios Draco would still get a wife. Harry on the other hand would probably rather be with Neville, or the twins, if he was gay that's who I honestly believe he'd have an interest in. So stop it with the f****** Drarry shit, it'd never hapoen even if they were both gay. F****** idiots with no idea how relationships work, especially when we actually know the people even better then we know our real friends, because of their fictional nature.
