“Yes, yes, no need to get all emotional, you blonde ponce,” grinned Harry. He really was going to take this too far, he could already tell.

“Of course, ever the wise one, Potter,” said Draco, getting up from the desk. “Now, how does Saturday at seven P.M. sound good to go over the best man duties and have a catch up? We can meet at the Wobbly Unicorn. Bring Weasley, Granger too, if you feel like they are still good company. I have no idea what they're like these days as I see them less than you and you know what our friendship has fallen into. Are you seeing anyone?”

“Ginny Weasley.”

“Perfect! Another Weasley. We'll have some fine discussions, I'm sure. My Father will be quite jealous with how many quality people I can call my friends. Bring her too and I'll bring Astoria so we can all get to know each other before the wedding.”

“Sounds like a plan. Now get lost,” said Harry. Draco hopped off the desk, shook Harry's hand firmly before string out of the cubicle. He popped back in a moment later, a big grin on his face.

“I'm so glad you agreed, Potter,” he said. “It'll be like old times. Cheerio!”

With that, Draco was gone again, leaving Harry to finish his report. Harry just sat at his desk for several minutes, trying to process Draco's strange behaviour. “I'm going to need to get a pensieve,” he muttered. “No way that they're going to believe it. No freaking way.”
