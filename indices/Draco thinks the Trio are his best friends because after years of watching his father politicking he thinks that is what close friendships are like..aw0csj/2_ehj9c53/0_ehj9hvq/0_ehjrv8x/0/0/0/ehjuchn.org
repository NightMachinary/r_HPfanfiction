It is weird, but then it's an extreme so that's sort of the point. The talent goes in making it seem plausible and/or palatable to the reader, who may well be enjoying a catharsis from their own problems, and taking comfort in the fact that the whump is worse - or possibly horribly relatable, it's a cruel world out there - and that someone /does/ care and it /does/ get better. Or those bored with 'normal' fics might seek out the more extreme emotional stimulation of a whump fic.

It's about being able to empathise with extremes, seeking redemption for the world and/or various characters and having a new range of potential story that more canon-compliant fics can't venture into. They can be gratuitously grim and violent, or mawkishly sweet, or anywhere in between.

They aren't an everyday flavour, that's for sure.
