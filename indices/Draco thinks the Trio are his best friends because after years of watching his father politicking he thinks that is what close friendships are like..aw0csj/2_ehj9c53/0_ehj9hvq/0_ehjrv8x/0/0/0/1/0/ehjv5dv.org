Sorry, no. It's been a while since I was in the mood and I don't bookmark them. Severitus usually isn't slash, but it often is mawkish. You can exclude M/M and various parings from AO3 now and I bet whump is actually a tag, but sorting the wheat from the chaff is an undertaking. Perhaps a request post here?
