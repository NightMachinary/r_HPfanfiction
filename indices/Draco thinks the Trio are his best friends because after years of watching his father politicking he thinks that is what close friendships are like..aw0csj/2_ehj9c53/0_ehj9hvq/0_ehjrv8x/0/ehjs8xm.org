A subgenre of Hurt/Comfort fics where the central character(s) is emotionally or physically tortured beyond canon limits. The ultimate goal is to make them into sad, vulnerable kicked puppies who need to be nursed back into health by another character.

An example is extreme Dursley abuse stories where Harry is beaten to an inch of his life by Uncle Vernon, runs away from home, and seeks comfort in the arms of Ice Prince Draco in a Drarry fic, or Super Snarker Snape in a Severitus mentor fic.
