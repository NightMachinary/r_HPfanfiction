Sure :) but like I said, it's going to be a while. I've only just started working on it, though I've got the premise mapped out in my head. I'm a novelist anyway but always wanted to give fanfics a go. Feels weird writing Potterverse stuff.

It's not got a partnership with Harry in it though. I'll give you the name, which may (or may not) be a clue about what it's about: /Tom Riddle and the Witch Queen/.
