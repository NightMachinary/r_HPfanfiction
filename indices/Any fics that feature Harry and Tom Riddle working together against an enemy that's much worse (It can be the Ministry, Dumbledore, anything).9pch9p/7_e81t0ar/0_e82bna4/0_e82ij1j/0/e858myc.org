Yeah I can understand the time it could potentially take. I'm a writer (not a novelist...yet, though I hope to be someday). I find writing fanfics a lot easier at times because of the established universe, but it's also hard to be original since there are so many good ideas out there already. I'm sure you'll find it much easier considering your experience. :)

And thanks for the title! I can't figure out the clue, though that's probably just me. I'll keep an eye out for it. Happy writing!
