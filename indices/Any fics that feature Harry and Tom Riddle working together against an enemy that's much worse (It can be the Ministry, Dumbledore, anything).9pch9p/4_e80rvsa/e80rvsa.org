I keep suggesting these two series, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719529][Ninja Wizard]] have Harry and Tom working to fully separate the magical and Wizarding world, the first by moving to a new planet, and the second one by moving to another dimension. The separation is because it is getting harder for magical to hide from muggles and Harry wants to avoid a war between the two groups. While there is some bashing, no one is painted as 'evil' it's mostly done because Harry is more independent and so doesn't like being smothered. He eventually works things out with most people by the end of both series. Mischief's Heir has some of the minor characters being slash while Ninja Wizard has slash between main characters.
