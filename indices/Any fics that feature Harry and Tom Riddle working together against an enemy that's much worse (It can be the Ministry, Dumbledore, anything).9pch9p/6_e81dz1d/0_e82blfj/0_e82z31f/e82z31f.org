No problem! Overall it has less of them working together than some of your other recs, but there's definitely a larger enemy. Bungle in the Jungle is the first, and Turn me loose is its Sequel, both by jbern. If you haven't read them, definitely worth it. I think it was the first fanfic I read that really got me hooked.
