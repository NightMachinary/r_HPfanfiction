Yes, yes you are. I have taken a poll of everyone in the world and you are the only one who answered yes to that question. Sorry bud. But on a positive, you are truly a unique individual! :-)

Seriously though, it really doesn't bother me that much. It bothers me more when people use the whole "Mione" / "It's HERMIONE!" thing, with Hermione constantly correcting people (namely Ron). Mostly just because I feel like by fifth year, Hermione has mellowed out a lot and especially with her close friends, she might express annoyance with the shortening early on a time or two, but would grow to accept it and would chastise someone for not knowing her well enough to use the shortened form. I am not a fan of overly anal-retentive Hermione characterization fics though.
