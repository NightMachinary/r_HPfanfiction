Yep, this is one that really annoys me. Authors usually use it as an easy way to shortcut establishing the friendship between Hermione and Harry.

To reinforce this crappy authors will have characters say the name of the person they're talking to constantly.

The only time in canon she's ever referred to as 'mione is when Ron's nearly died from poison and isn't even awake. He can barely speak and mispronounced her name.

At least that's what I think. The mix of unnaturally adding a characters name to every sentence of spoken dialog and trying to show they're close by Harry/whoever giving her a petname gets on my nerves.

You rarely have to add a characters name to dialog to begin with.
