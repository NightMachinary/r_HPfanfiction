Is that a cultural thing or a personal thing? The dislike of nicknames, I mean. I've noticed that it does seem to go along cultural lines sometimes - Americans seem to particularly dislike them, for some reason.

And well, you're right that it wasn't a nickname in canon, but I mean, if the fandom has him use it as a nickname, then it kind of becomes one. If we can make Harry into a time-travelling demigod, we can make a random garbled name into a nickname, no? But if he nicknamed her something that wasn't 'mione', would you be more okay with it?
