When I said I was not a fan of nicknames, I meant in Harry Potter ,I have no special problems with them in real and they are pretty common in my country (France).

I dislike fanon nicknames because, most of the time, I can't just imagine someone using them. I mean, I could totally see someone shorten Ronald into Ron, just like I could see a Mickael become a Mike. But in the case of Hermione? Herm, Mione, Mia, most of them are either way too different from her name to be a nickame (you don't transform a William into a Bob), or just sound plain terrible. The fact that Hermione don't seem to be the kind of character to have a nickname (she seem . . . too serious) don't help the matter.

This distaste also goes for most fanon nickname (except maybe Reg for Regulus?), I'm not a fan of Drake, Har (?!) and Sevy.
