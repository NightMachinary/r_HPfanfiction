I don't think French people use as much nicknames as English people do. At least, I never heard about anyone being called Colin (Nicolas can be shortened into Nico, but it's not always the case, and Henry isn't really shortened, except as a joke or reference.

I don't really think Hermione would either be the type to get a nickname. Ron may become close enough I guess, but it would be more to call her "Honey" or "Dear" rather than any modification of her name.

​

As for some nicknames depending of the context, I think that's the case for all of them. I mean, in most case, /Drakey/ would sound stupid, but if it's used by a girlfriend type character like Pansy (like Lavender with /Won-Won/), it would at least fit the context, and even Ron or Harry may later use it to mock Draco if they ever heard him being called like that.\\
Even /Pup/ could be justified like that, as a one time jock from Sirius to annoy the hell out of Harry.
