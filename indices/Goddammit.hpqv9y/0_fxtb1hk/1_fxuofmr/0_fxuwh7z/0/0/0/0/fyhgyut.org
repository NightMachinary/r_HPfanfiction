Yeah, nicknames are definitely a culturally wide-ranging thing. I remember talking with a Brazilian person about how it's apparently common in their culture for nicknames to be used quite quickly (eg. in the first day of a new class, you might introduce yourself by your nickname and be called that by everyone).

I'm no expert, but I'm pretty certain British Nicknaming is down to our nightmare of a language - when you pilfer words from across the planet, you're going to have to do some linguistic gymnastics to get them all to fit into the same grammars and syntaxes and so on.

And I can see your point vis a vis Hermione. I don't think I agree - I can see a later Hermione to at least acquiesce to Harry or Ron starting a nickname - but I see it. The context thing I definitely agree with though - you put it far better than I did. Also, we definitely need more friendly-joshing Sirius.
