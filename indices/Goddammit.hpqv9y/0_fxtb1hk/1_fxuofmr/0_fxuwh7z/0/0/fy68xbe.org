Ah, okay. Cool. And fair, but you do transform a William into a Bill. And Henry into Harry. And Nicholas into Colin. Or we do in England, at least. English nicknames can be quite... stretched.

I can see your point about Hermione not being the type though. Do you think it might change in the later stages, when she's mellowed out a bit?

And I do agree with you about Drake, Har, and Sevvy - except if Drake is used as a clearly ridiculous nickname by his over-protective helicopter parents or Sevvy is used by Sirius as a bullying nickname. Har is always ridiculous though.
