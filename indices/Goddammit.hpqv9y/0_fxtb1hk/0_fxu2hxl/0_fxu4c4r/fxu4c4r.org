I can understand that. Overuse of anything can get annoying, especially terms of address. Like, nobody refers to other people by name as much as characters in fanfic do.

It does fit though, her having a nickname. The UK is a place where 'hey cunts!' is a joyous exclamation of affection and nicknames are a semi-prevalent thing, so it's culturally fitting to get a nickname and Mione is pretty much the best of the bunch to pick from. You've got Mione, Mia (which is a stretch, at best), Mi, Herms, and Hermy, and I don't know about you, but on that list, I prefer Mione.

I do wonder if it's an American thing, though. Most of the people I've seen complaining about it have seemed to be American. Might I ask if you are?
