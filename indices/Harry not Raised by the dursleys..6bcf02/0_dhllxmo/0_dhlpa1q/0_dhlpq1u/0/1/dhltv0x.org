There's a Harry wasn't raised by Dursley's tag in Ao3 that I was sifting through this weekend if that would interest you? Includes crossovers. I also just got to the most recent update of Hadrian Romanoff And The Beginning linkffn(12095483) a bit ago. There's also another 'raised by Black Widow' one that I liked as well.
