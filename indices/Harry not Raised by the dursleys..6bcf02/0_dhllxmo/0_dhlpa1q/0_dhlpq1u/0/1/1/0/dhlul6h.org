Link to Hardrian Romanoff just showed up. Still trying to remember/find the other one I read last week. I think it's in the Avengers/HP crossover section on ff.net (though pretty recent). In the meantime, here's the archive tag:[[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Harry%20Potter%20was%20Raised%20by%20Other(s)/works]]. Hopefully you'll find a couple things. I'm currently sort of searching for similar, so I'll add a few as I come across them.
