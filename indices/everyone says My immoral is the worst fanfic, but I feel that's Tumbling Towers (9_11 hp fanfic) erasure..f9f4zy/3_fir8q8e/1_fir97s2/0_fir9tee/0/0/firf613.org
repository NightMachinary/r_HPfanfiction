I'd argue it was more alluding than implying. It's also worth remembering that, at the time, precious little was known about Grindelwald, specifically his stance on the issue of blood purity. Even now I'd argue we don't really know anything substantial about him, even with the two Fantastic Beasts movies having him involved to greater or lesser amounts (because it's entirely plausible that anything and everything he told other characters could've been lies to manipulate them).
