bro that comment was 2 months old lmao

Anyways, if you want to take that interpretation, it's your prerogative, but it's an attempt to force magic into a historical tragedy. Some things get lost in translation, or need to be lost because the Nazis don't go full w40k with wizards on their side.

Similar to the witch burnings if you think about it in terms of lacking sensitivity/realism, because it reduces the issues of social stigma/church and gov't finding people to blame/scapegoating/etc leading to a tragedy and many deaths with "no, there were actually legit witches they were hunting down, they were right".

Also, even if it does lessen the severity of portrayed historical tragedies/if you interpret it as implying that they "wouldn't be so bad without wizards", the key point is /wizards/. It's set in a literal fantasy world that clearly isn't adjacent enough to reality for such a thing to be legitimate social commentary, so taking offense at it is asinine.
