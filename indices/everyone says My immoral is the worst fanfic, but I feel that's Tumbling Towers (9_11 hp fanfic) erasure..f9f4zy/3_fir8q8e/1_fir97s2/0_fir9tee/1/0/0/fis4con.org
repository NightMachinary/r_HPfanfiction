Is it an excuse, though? I mean, it would be if someone was trying to explain it away in reality, but since it's fanfiction about a whole wizarding world, it's already not very realistic. Imo, it just seems like an attempt to integrate the events of magical & muggle history in a fairly 'reasonable' way (similar to historical witch burnings targeting actual weak witches/wizards, even though in reality, it was mostly just a horrible exercise in scapegoating and tossing blame, and /tens of thousands/ of people were likely burned to death during it).
