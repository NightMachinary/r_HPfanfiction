How is it particularly awful compared to other works of fiction that use tragedies? It's the Death Eaters doing it, so it's hardly portrayed as something /good/ (quite the opposite, really), and nobody is saying that "magic made them do it" in /real life/.

  excusing actual historical events...is pretty dang awful

But it doesn't really do this. It clearly involves an imaginary magical world that doesn't exist, so the fic is hardly making excuses for the actual event like you say it is. Fiction isn't reality.
