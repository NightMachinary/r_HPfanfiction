They said "using a tragedy for fan fiction" is what makes it bad.

Plus, in the second story I pointed out it may not been "magic made me do it" but instead of "natural events" you have " The Doctor did this horrible thing because it needed to be done" which is not much different, apart from nobody alive today having been alive back then, so the Tragedy has become something we gladly will spin stories about.
