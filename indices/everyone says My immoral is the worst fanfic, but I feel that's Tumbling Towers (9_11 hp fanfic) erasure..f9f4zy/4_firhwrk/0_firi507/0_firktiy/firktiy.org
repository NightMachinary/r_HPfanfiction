But people write stories where a real tragedy was an important element all the time.

The movie "Titanic" tells a love story using a big disaster as the tragic element to make people cry for the lovers. There is a Doctor Who episode where at the end the Doctor has to cause the vulcano outbreak that that leads to Pompei being buried. And so on.

I think the problem with a storry using 9/11 the way you describe is how recent it happened and how strong the impact is still felt more than that a tragedy was used in it.
