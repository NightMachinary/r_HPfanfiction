There's nothing wrong with using a real tragedy for any form of writing. It becomes controversial when you make fun of a tragedy maliciously. For example, mocking 9/11 survivors or their families.

Alluding to the Death Eaters influencing or committing 9/11 is not particularly heinous, though it is perhaps a tad tasteless to some people. I personally don't have an issue with it though.
