I'd say that entirely depends on how you define "worst"

My Immortal had an immature premise (to be generous), with absolutely terrible writing, plot and direction.

Without having read that fic, I'd say that once you consider the implications, it has a morally bankrupt premise. Beyond that, it would depend on how terrible the rest of the writing actually is.
