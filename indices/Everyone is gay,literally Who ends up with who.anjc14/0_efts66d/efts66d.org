Harry/Ron, for a start. We could also play "let's pair up the tremendously nice guys" and ship Neville with Cedric. Not quite sure who Hermione might end up with: there's always Ginny, if we assume she keeps a thing for rash but good-hearted redheads; but if you want to move away from that, Cho or Fleur are our best pics sticking to semimportant characters. Luna would still probably end up with Newt Scamander's granddaughter or something: let's preserve the one example of a major character who /doesn't/ get married to one of their schoolfellows.

Among the adults, I consider it a given that Remus and Sirius would hook up in such a scenario. If "crazed to-the-end sycophant with a talent for Dark Magic" is what he's into, a gay Voldemort might trade Bellatrix for Barty Crouch Jr.; I'll admit to not having many ideas who /Bellatrix/ could develop a crush on. Also, I know the title said "everyone", but for the sake of symmetry it's only fair that Dumbledore would secretly have a /straight/ crush on some horribly evil figure. I dunno. Umbridge.
