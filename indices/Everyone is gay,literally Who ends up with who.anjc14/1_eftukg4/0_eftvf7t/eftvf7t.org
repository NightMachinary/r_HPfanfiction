  Hagrid and Aragog ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
#+end_quote

Ew!

Not because of the cross-species part, to be clear. I'm not judging. But Hagrid /raised/ Aragog; for all intents and purposes Aragog is his /son/, or at the very least a ward/younger sibling. To me Hagrid/Aragog feels no different from Hagrid/Grawp.
