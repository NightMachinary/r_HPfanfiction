Harry... I think Harry would end up with Fred or George, because those two have quite a bit in common with Ginny.

I'm struggling to come up with a good idea for Ron.

I quite like the couple of Hermione and Ginny in fanfic, so I'm going with that. They complement each other really well.

I think Draco would probably end up with Zabini, because Blaise is shallow enough to overlook Draco's terrible character.

Snape would still be forever alone, but instead of Lily he would have a crush on Regulus, and defect from the Death Eaters after Regulus' death in the cave.
