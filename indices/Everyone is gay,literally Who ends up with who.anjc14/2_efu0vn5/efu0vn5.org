I'm gonna throw my hats into the ring and say that either Ron/Harry or Harry/Draco happens, the later maybe due to the whole "foil" thing. However, I don't think it's as likely as Harry/Ron.

Like Achille said, Hermione/Ginny /might/ happen (and I agree), but I could definitely see Hermione going out with a Ravenclaw like Padma Patil. If you wanted to go more fanon you might pair her up with Daphne, as she's currently a fan-favourite and a bit of a blank slate, though that later part could be said of Padma---or anyone else, for that matter.

Luna...idk. I'm not sure about her. I'm tempted to say someone like Hannah Abbott, but I really don't know. Perhaps she and Ginny, should Hermione/Ginny not happen? I think they'd be better off friends, but in this AU dating between them would probably happen.

If he doesn't end up with Harry, Ron might be a good match with either Seamus or Dean, though I think those two would be a good couple in and of themselves. I'm thinking Ron and Seamus, as they both like Quidditch (I think?) and then Dean/Neville could happen. I don't know---literally any of these /could/ happen, though now that I'm thinking about it I doubt they would last long...

To get (even further) away from main characters, I think Vincent/Gregory would be a thing in this, and you can't convince me otherwise. They're too stupid for anyone but each other. Cho and Fluer might be bit cute couple, though I'm not sure how that would happen---regardless, it would probably just be from 1994-95. Maybe Cedric/Victor Krum, also just for the year, though I think a Victor/Neville situation might make for an interesting turn of events... Lavender/Parvati for the win.

Professor McGonagall might do well with one of the other teachers, or if you want to stretch things a little maybe Amelia Bones. Maybe in this verse Minerva and Sybill Trelawney dated for a bit and broke up in a less-than-amicable way. It could add fuel to the fire for McGonagall's intense dislike for Divination.

I know everyone immediately thinks of Wolfstar when it comes to the Marauders, but to mix things up a bit I'm going to go with James/Remus and Peter/Sirius; James ended up with a strong, intelligent woman in canon, which Remus (debatealy) mirrors, and a previous Peter/Sirius would only make the betrayal more brutal. Maybe Remus/Sirius could occur later.

Alice (Longbottom in Canon, though obviously not here) maybe would have gotten along well with Lily, romantically; not that we know either of their characters well... And just for no particular reason...perhaps /Bellatrix/ was the one with a crush on a certain red-headed Gryffindor? The timeline doesn't quite match up (~9 year difference), so they wouldn't have met in school, but still. The idea is there. I think it could've come from some sort of twisted admiration on Bellatrix's end after fighting her and losing? I'm not sure. Just playing with ideas here.

Myrtle crushes on Ginny when the later gets a little older.

Percy/Oliver Wood /could/ happen, as they shared a dorm for seven years and had some basic ideals (ambition, resolve, et cetera.) though I doubt it would work out long-term. Actually, Oliver would more likely end up with someone from the Quidditch Team and therefore end up becoming Oliver /Weasley-Wood,/ or something (Oliver Potter-Wood? Ugh his name does /not/ hyphenate well).

Gilderoy/Gilderoy...the narcissist.

Fred or George Weasley with Lee Jordan. Presumably George.

Assuming he's not gay already, Grindelwald would've definitely gone for Dumbledore, if the other was also still gay.

Dumbledore might've also had a short thing with Slughorn, but just thinking about that makes me shiver so how about we forget /that/ mental image...

I don't know about Tonks, but lets assume she still falls for an older member of the Order of the Phoenix; maybe an unknown, like Hestia Jones. If not, and if we're sticking to known characters, then perhaps Katie Bell? She's friendly and gentle, loves Quidditch and has been through enough trauma to relate to her. But if we want someone closer to her age then Penelope Clearwater appears to be rather similar to Katie.

AND

And I had better stop now before I add anything else. But in my defence, OP /did/ say "everyone"...
