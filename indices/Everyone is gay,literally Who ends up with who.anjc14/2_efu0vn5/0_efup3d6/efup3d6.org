  I think Vincent/Gregory would be a thing in this, and you can't convince me otherwise.

I've read a fic in which Vincent and Gregory were a pair while trying to hide it from everyone. It was very sweet: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12240216/1/][Rogue's Bet]]

  Professor McGonagall might do well with one of the other teachers, or if you want to stretch things a little maybe Amelia Bones

I could definitely get behind a Minerva/Amelia pairing. They seem to have compatible personalities, and they are both some of the strongest adult female witches in the books.

  Actually, Oliver would more likely end up with someone from the Quidditch Team and therefore end up becoming Oliver Weasley-Wood, or something (Oliver Potter-Wood? Ugh his name does not hyphenate well).

I think it would be fun if Oliver Wood falls for someone on an opposing team. I've read a fic with an Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint pairing that worked surprisingly well, but Oliver/Cedric could be cute.
