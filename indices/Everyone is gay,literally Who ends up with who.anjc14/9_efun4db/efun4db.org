Harry/Fred - Fred was a funny, firey quidditch player who can get mean when he needs to. Harry was rebellious enough without being too alike and supportive of Fred's ambition.

Past Harry/Cedric - I can see that being Harry's first relationship.

Ginny/Tonks - Ginny would like the goofy but still badass auror.

Ron/Oliver Wood - They would live and breathe Quidditch together. Ron's love of the Chudley Canons would always hanging over their heads, and people would joke that it would be what ends their relationship.

Hermione/Fleur - Both smart and strong-willed. Contrasting outside appearances. They grow on each other and challenge each other. When they get married, they live in France.

James/Sirius - I know Wolfstar is popular, but I've just never gotten behind it. I see James/Sirius and even James/Remus working out better.

Sirius/Shacklebolt - If James is still dead, I think Shacklebolt's calm and stay demeanor would be good for Sirius. Sirius would also be amused that he's sleeping with the auror that's supposed to be hunting him.

Leta/Tina - Meeting under different circumstances, I can see Tina being intrigued and Leta just liking her.
