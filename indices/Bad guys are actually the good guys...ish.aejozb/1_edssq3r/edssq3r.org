Well, there's linkffn(Twins: A Different Life by Jessiikaa15) It seems abandoned but worth a read if you like the WGWL trope.

Then there was one where Snape was talking to Harry and Hermione in St. Mungo's when Ron found them. Later, it was revealed that Draco, Harry and Hermione were cousins and Hermione was Bellatrix's daughter. I forget. I'll try to search for it and then edit it in later if I find it.
