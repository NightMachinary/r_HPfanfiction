Just one thing: Maybe put the Prologue with the rest of the chapter? Its really just a subjective thing, I don't know if other people feel the same, but I tend to close the tab when the entire chapter fits on my screen. It was a mere spur of the moment thing that I didn't click X, but "next chapter" to see if there is more.
