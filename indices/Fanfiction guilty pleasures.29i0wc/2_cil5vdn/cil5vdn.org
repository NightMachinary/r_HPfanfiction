Would you happen to know any good stories featuring a dark H/Hr? I'm trying to write one and I want to see what a good one looks like as well as avoid stepping on any toes.

To answer your question, I enjoy "Harry gets stupidly powerful out of nowhere" fics. Spending the summer training with a time - Turner doesn't count, I'm talking about Harry sneezes and can suddenly explode the world, silently and wandlessly of course.
