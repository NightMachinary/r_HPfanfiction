I can think of four that I've liked, but none of them have gotten particularly Dark yet, even if they are getting there:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7296047/1/Rule-of-two-dreams-come-true][Rule of Two, Dreams come True]] by Darklooshkin
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8375078/1/Labyrinth][Labyrinth]] by Kroontjespen
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/16/The-random-craziness-file][The Damned]] by Darklooshkin (a one-shot)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8344675/1/The-Foundation-of-Darkness][Foundation of Darkness]] by Hyaci, though I have strong reservations about this one.
