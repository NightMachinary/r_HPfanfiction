Considering my particular preferences, it's very much of a Beggars Can't Be Choosers situation. Vast, vast majority of Dark!HP/HG fics tends to feature Dark Lord Potter and Hermione who spends most of her time hanging off his arm and occasionally needing rescuing. When you throw out those, there isn't much left.
