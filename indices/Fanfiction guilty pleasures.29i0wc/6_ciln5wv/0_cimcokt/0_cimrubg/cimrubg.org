I kind of liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3217498/2/A-Higher-Law][A Higher Law]] (Remus x Hermione, 83k), though I didn't like the characterization of Hermione.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/986751][Hermione Granger and the Intended Vessels]] was interesting, even though I hate Severus/Hermione. I liked one of the major concepts that was used. (300k words)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3924523/1/Innocence][Innocence]] is Hermione x Sirius, 200k words, has some interesting ideas especially about halfway through. However, as usual the author took liberties with Hermione's personality concerning the relationship. More interesting concepts, though, like upper class wizarding society.

I remember reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2707088/1/Necessary-by-the-Order][Necessary by the Order]], 100k words, but I honestly can't remember what I thought of it since it's been a while. I do know that I enjoy the author's works, though (I recently reread Reason for Life and I'm waiting for Perchance to Dream to be finished so I can read that as well)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9222741/1/A-Hidden-Agenda][A Hidden Agenda]] is another Sirius x Hermione, 120k, but I do remember really liking this one, even if the characterization was iffy at some points.

If you can't tell I'm fond of Hermione/Sirius, but I am picky about it. All of the above have scenes ranging from sex to outright smut, however in all of the above she is of age (though in Vessels she is still in her 7th year). All of the above are also complete, and some have epilogues. Most marriage law stories that I've found, period, involve Hermione, because it seems most of them are either "Marry off the war hero!" or "Bring in unrelated blood!" as reasoning behind the law.
