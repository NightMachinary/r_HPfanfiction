When teachers are paired with students while they're actually students (but like in their later school years). I used to read a lot of Snape/Hermione and most of them were post-Hogwarts. I feel creepy about it, but I'm a huge sucker for forbidden romance and shit like that. I tend to overlook quality if it's decent enough. Most of them are mediocre or are purple prose.
