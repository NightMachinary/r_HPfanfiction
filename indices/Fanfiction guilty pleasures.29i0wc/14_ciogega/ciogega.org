super!Harry is horribly written like 80% of the time but I still adore the genre. Mpreg though they are rare outside of drarry. Harrymort with superhandsome!Voldemort. Xanthos Speed chess with everyone manipulating everyone [sadly, these ficts usually have bashing and dumbing down of characters which I hate]. Since I wasn't in the other thread, on the flip side, I am not a fan of bashing ficts [especially those that have the usual weasley/dumbledore/hermoine victims in the dark!Harry ficts] and revenge ficts. I like harry being smart and getting his revenge but not being vengeful over dumbed down characters who just sit aside and watch him in awe as he gary sues it out.
