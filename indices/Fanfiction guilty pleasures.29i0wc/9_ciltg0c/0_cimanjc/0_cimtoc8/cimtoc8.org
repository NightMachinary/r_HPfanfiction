Of course!

One of my worse indulgent sins would be Severus' Rose, by WrittenWord1. Now, I should hate it, given that there's lots of infantilising going on in there, in addition to some overprotective family patriarch stuff that would normally creep me out. Also, it's quite repetitive with its daddy-daughter drama (she does something she's not supposed to do, old Severus gets pissed, she feels bad, he feels bad, she apologizes, he apologizes for getting so angry, they hug and make up - repeat for 90 chapters). I can't help it though, I love it. One of the few fanfics I've ever re-read, actually.

The favorite so far though, would be Harriet Potter, by tinyrose65. Bit of a canon re-hash, but has plenty of stand-alone elements that makes it a worthwhile read. Both can be found on ff.net
