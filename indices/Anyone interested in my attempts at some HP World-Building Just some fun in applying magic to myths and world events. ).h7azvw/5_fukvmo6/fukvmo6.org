That's a really cool idea. Also Jesus changing water into wine soumds very Wizardlike to me. He'd have to be a hell of a necromancer ro reawaken the dead though and idk if this fits his image. Anyways. I really like the idea of sacrifices granting (more) power. Like so many cultures sacrificed animals or humans. Like Aztecs or Celts. I also feel lile people who could foretell the future were held in a higher regard back then. I also like the idea that becoming an animagi comes from the idea of having a spirit animal. Or that it's a practice that comes from Native Americans or so.

What's also interesting are the European witch hunts. I mean Harry learns in his books that it wasn't really a problem for witches if they could do the firefreezing charm but it wasn't just witches who they hunted. Many people back then were accused of being a Werewolf and Witches were often also hanged and tortured till they confessed. I feel like these times should have a lot more worldbuilding behind them since they are the reason that the Wizarding world went into hiding eventually. Werewolves and other magical creatures being hunted for sports. (By muggles and Magical beings)

Maybe a part of the magical community went into hiding a lot earlier than the rest and they were only known as sidh√©. (Fae folk in - i think Ireland) They are said to be living under the hills.
