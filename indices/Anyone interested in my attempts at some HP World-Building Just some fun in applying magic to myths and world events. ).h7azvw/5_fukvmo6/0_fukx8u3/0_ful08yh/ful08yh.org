Oh yes. Though in regard to the seperation of Wizarding and Muggle world I think that not all of the purebloods were supportiv of this. For example the Malfoy family would have lost a lot of potential wealth by having to stop mingling with royal Muggles etc. What is also interesting is the one Aunt Sirius mentions in the books who wanted to legalize Muggle hunting. Now I ask myself if this was a sport that was practiced too by some purebloods
