For sure, I have no doubt that there wouldn't have been total suppprt. In regards to the Malfoys, although we don't have much if any background on them prior to Abraxus Malfoy, it's feasible to say that their traditional stance and pureblood supremacy/anti muggle position isn't a new thing. I'd personally say that they'd rather cut off all contact with those they consider animals and deal with purely pure folk (see what I did there, heh).

Muggle baiting is a crime against Ministry law iirc, so it's not a stretch to say Muggle hunting is a thing. Dumbledore's father was sent to Azkaban for muggle hunting, wasn't he?
