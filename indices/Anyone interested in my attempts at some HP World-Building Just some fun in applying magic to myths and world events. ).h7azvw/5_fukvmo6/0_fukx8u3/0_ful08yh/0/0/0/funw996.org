Ahh okay. I tend to avoid Pottermore and it's articles after catching wind of that one about wizards and how they did their business prior to indoor plumbing. Can you really believe a vain Pureblood would just drop one wherever they stood and then vanished it? Poppycock.

Oh, I'm sure Lucius was always in it for his own gain, and never truly held any loyalty to Voldemort, only wanting the results of what the Dark Lord would bring. But yes, the Malfoys are big opportunists. Perhaps they did have dealings with Muggles... but I'm unsure how likely it would have been that they would vote to remain in contact with the Muggle world.
