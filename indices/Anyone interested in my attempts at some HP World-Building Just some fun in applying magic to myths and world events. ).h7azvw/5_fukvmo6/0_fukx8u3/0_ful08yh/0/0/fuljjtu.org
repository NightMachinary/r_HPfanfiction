Yeah. And even if Muggle hunting was officially illegal I think that those families practicing had enough influnce to have it being an open secret. On Pottermore I think there is an Article about the Malfoy family and their involvement with Muggles prior to the separation. But even if they looked down on Muggles I think they would've used their connection to influental Muggles for their own gain. I mean Malfoys notoriously do what's best for them and even Lucius denied his connections to the dark Lord in order to escape prison.
