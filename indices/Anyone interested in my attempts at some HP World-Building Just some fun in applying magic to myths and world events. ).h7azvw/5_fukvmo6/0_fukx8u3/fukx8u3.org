Jesus multiplying food, water into wine... does sound very wizardlike... perhaps a primitive Draught of Living Death was involved in his 'resurrection'?

Yes, the Aztec lands in particular I think would have a very... charged, feeling. A wizard sufficiently tuned with their magic experiences a heavy, skin-crawling sensation. Whether or not the Aztec priests themselves knew what they were doing by committing so many sacrifices? Debatable. They achieved some feats with their actions, certainly... but there was much-wasted potential. Even so, centuries later, the magic lingers, ready to be unleashed, if only a sufficiently knowledgeable sorcerer uses it.

The Witch Hunts are an interesting one. My thoughts are this: the Statute of Secrecy was engineered by the traditional Purebloods to remove as much contact with Mugglekind as possible - not out of fear. Think about how removed wizards are from Muggles in the 90's. Even in the Founder's time, wizards looked down heavily upon Muggles. In the Middle Ages/Renaissance, wizards would have utterly dominated Muggles, number advantage or no. Obviously this is a different story in the modern eras, but when wizards went into hiding, it was only to cut off contact with those deemed filth by the upper class in wizarding society.

I feel that wizards/muggles hunting werewolves and other magical creatures is something that needs more thought before I put forward anything about it. Interesting concept for sure. Same thing in regards to the Sidhe. I know more about Seidhr (bit of a Norse mythology buff), but I doubt they're at all similar, so more research is needed.
