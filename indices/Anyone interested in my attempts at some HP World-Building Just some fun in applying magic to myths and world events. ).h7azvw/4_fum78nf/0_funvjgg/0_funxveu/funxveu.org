Tolkien got inspired by Finnish mythology so that would be right. (Gandalf has similarities with Väinämöinen, World creation was also sung in our, Elven language is inspired by Finnish, Iluvitar is kind of like our god Ilmarinen etc)

With the singing I would think that it would be kind of like the magic words would be the songs (like there is no reason Finnish people would use latin to say spells, as Finnish is not related to latin at all, more likely we would use the super old spells from our paganism or the ones that where translated in the books)

Kantele could have been kind of like an amplifier to spells, like usually we would sing them, but the instrument was used with the singing to make them stronger etc..

I would think the things about the bear would be more about them being say magical bears, and then people muggles and other wise would think of them as some type of holy or godly things becuase of their magicness..

What would you say about the internation statue of secrecy, in reality it wouldn't make much sense for it to be truly international when it first happened (for example Korea and Japan that came to mind), as when it happened some places where closed to outside world and if you look at their culture, they had like Shamans and what not, much after it should have taken place. And some cultures within Europe propably also where kind of separe from the bigger europeans countries that they wouldn't have taken to it untill more recently, same way as how even though some Finns where turned to Christianity they would still practice their paganism and oral traditions so they would survive long enough orally, to have them written down...

Like this international statue of secrecy was more of a "European thing" at first, than a World wide things.
