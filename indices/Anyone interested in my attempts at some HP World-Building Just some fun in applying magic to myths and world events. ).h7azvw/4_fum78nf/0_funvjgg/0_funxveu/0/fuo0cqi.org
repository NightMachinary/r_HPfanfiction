Ahh, that explains the similarity.

I would say that ultimately, the words/language does not matter. Intent and will is the true factor. The words are a tool to help shape, which a truly accomplished magic wielder would not need, in the end. I think the Kantele being an amplifier is correct, I imagine wands, staffs, staves and other foci to function similarly. A crutch, but if constructed/used correctly, any tool can bring to bear greater might.

Thinking about it, the Statute of Secrecy would have been primarily a western thing to begin with, but I think that as similar events to the witch burnings happened across the world, the other magical nations would follow suit. Things like Salem, the witch trials that happened in the Middle-East (their hatred of magic was/is legendary), perhaps similar events to the Rape of Nanjing, but earlier and not as well known?

But, we agree that it was started in Europe.
