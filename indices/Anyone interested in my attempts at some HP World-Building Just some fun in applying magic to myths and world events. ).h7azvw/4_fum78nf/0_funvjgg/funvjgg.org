Putting some thought into the idea of singing and magic together, I kind of guess it would be similar to how Tolkien describes it in LOTR and The Silmarillion - Arda was sung into existence by the Valar.

In a similar vein, perhaps magic-users who could shape and change their magic and will through song could do so... the question comes in what the effect would be.

Large effect? Shaping rivers, carving valleys, raising mountains?

Smaller, more subtle? Bewitching, similar to a Siren's song? Something similar to how a bard in RPGs buff and give bonuses to their party members? It's very interesting now that I think about it.

A further point I would make is that I don't believe that a magic-user who wields magic in this way would require a wand, or any other foci. A wand is (in my opinion) used to shape and direct magic from a wizard. A magic-user who directs their magic through song would not need a foci to shape and direct their magic, their voice and songcraft does it for them.

Edit: In regards to Finnish magical bears and the unwillingness of the people to use their names... perhaps a Taboo was cast on the name of the magical bear, bringing bad luck and devastation whenever the name was spoken (perhaps one of these bears was summoned or attracted to wherever the name was mentioned), leading to people eventually catching on and never using the actual name. Not unlike the case of Voldemort's taboo on his name and the You-Know-Who euphemism catching on.
