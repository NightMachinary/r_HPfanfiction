This brough to my mind the Finnish Mythology and Väinämöinen, who was kind of like god (or demi-god), who used singing and Kantele (Finnish instrument) to sing spells and do magic that way..

So I like to think that ancient Finnish witches and wizards sing their spells and used Kantele as the "wand" and then later on propably after we become part of Sweden we would have gotten the say wands and so on..

Though in this way other Finnish Gods like Ukko would be a different kind of Wizard, and then would Finnish bears be magical or something, since we though of them as holy and taboo, we didn't call them by their name, and have many many different names for bears because of that, even the main word for it today is one of those synonyms that where used.. So I would like to think that there is some type of Magical bears in Finland and areas close by...
