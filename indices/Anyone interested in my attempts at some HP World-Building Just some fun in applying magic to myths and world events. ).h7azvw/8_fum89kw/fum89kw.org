A bit of head canon that I would like to see more explored is the impact of True Prophecies on the world.

A True Prophecy will always come to pass, though the majority of the time it will only become clear what the prophecy meant after the fact. Beyond that, the more people who believe the prophecy to be true, the more overtly the prophecy can twist events and choices to see itself to completion.

Now think of Harry, who the entire British wizarding community believes to be the vanquisher of Voldemort when he's a year and a half old, and then look at how nearly every book a confrontation occurs between him and Tom.

I think it's an interesting concept anyway
