During my worldbuilding, I've been considering magic alike to music, and song. A True Prophecy would fit into this as an equivalent to predetermined lyrics - events that cannot be changed and will come to pass regardless of the prior notes/happenings. Even someone aware of the music and lyrics cannot change it, regardless of how hard they try. However, someone skilled/wise enough could change the prior events/lyrics to twist the overall meaning/result of the prophecy/song. A step-in editor of the overall melody.

I guess that means you could call the overall songwriter... Fate? Destiny? Who knows. ;)
