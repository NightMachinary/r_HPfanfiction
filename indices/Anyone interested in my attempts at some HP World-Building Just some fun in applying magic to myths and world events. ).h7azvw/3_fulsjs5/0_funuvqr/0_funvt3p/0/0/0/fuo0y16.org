Interesting. I wonder if you could interpret fire as being part of the natural four elements, or fire as in 'fire of one's self/fire from within'. A weaponised form of Haki, I guess.

A blademaster... perhaps a swordsperson using magic internally instead of externally, to bolster speed, strength and perception? Internal magic is something we haven't really seen anything of, so I'm very interested in perpetuating some wider examples of it in the HP universe. This would be a nice place to do so.

I love the Epic of Gilgamesh.. it was never determined whether or not he was a deity or a human, but perhaps Gilgamesh was a sorcerer, and thus the rumours of God or Man abounded... it's really so much fun to look at a myth and slide magic into the equation. And demonology is always interesting... clearly I need to do some in-depth research into Mesopotamian myths and history. :P

EDIT: In regards to the disease sphere of Erra's powers being a tangible miasma, if what I'm imagining is at all similar, it's close to what I was thinking about being an external version of the Dark Arts effects... did you envision this miasma to affect the very environment it's in, or just the people it contacts? Call me curious. :)
