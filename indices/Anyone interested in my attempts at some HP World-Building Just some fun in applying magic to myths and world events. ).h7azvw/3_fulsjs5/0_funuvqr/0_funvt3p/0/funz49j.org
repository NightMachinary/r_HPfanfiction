That sounds really interesting actually. In context of HP magic, I wonder if wrath and disease could be attributed to some sort of aura manipulation?

Perhaps the 'wrath' spectrum causes those who's magic is affected to lose reasoning, cohesion? Similar to a Siren's song? Disease on the other hand... hmmm. The first thing that comes to mind is how the Dark Arts stain a person's soul - the /inside/ of a person themselves. Perhaps this... plague magic? works similarly but affects the exterior of environments. The stain of Dark Arts use, but personified upon the world. Extraordinarily difficult to pull off, but equally as difficult to counteract.

^ That explanation depends, of course, on the assumption that Erra is an 'evil' or 'bad' entity. Otherwise, I'd have to think of a differing explanation for the disease aspect of his powers. The Sibbittu, on the other hand, I have no idea about. What are the four martial influences that are known?
