I'm only using 1 (Erra, god of wrath and disease), but he figures into a really cool myth. It's technically 'neo-Assyrian' mythology; I've had to research my buns off! Even read an academic dissertation on the mythos haha.

In sum, Erra gets bored one day and kickstarts a war between Babylon and its enemies. When the foreigners invade, he strikes down their army to the last man. Anu (the 'overarching' god figure) grants Erra the service of the Sibbittu (The Seven) who are his champions. Each represents a different martial energy, though the record of the myth is incomplete and only 4 are named. The Sibbittu and Erra get caught up in bloodlust and turn on Babylon, at which point Marduk (the protector god of Babylon) flees the city in the face of Erra's rage. Slaughtering friend and foe alike, Erra ascends to the throne of the empire until the other gods eventually talk him down.

It's a pretty badass myth. Wish there was a completed surviving version!
