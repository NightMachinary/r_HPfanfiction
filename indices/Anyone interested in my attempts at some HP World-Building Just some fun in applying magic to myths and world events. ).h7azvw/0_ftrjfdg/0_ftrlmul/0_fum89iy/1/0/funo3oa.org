That's my head canon as well, wouldn't really come up, unless someone from those countries would end up meeting the characters from HP.. Though I also do have it so (example from Europe) Hogwarts, Dumstrang and Beauxbatons are the biggest wizarding schools in Europe, and propably making it so they are most well known and oldest etc, but still having places where it doesn't make sense to go to any of those, to have their own ones..
