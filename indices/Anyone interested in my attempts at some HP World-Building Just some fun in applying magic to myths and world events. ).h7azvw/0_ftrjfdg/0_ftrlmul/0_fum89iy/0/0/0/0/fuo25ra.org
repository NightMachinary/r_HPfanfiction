Actually Defence wouldn't be standart, as it seems to either be DADA or Dark Arts (Dumstrong, written it so much today I don't remember how to write it anymore)..

I think the superior by wealhty would also have to do with your culture and language, as in not all would go to other places, and even then some countries/cultures would never think school in certain country would be superior, because of cultural/historical reasons..

And with all the subjects, I would think that certain countries, even if they tough same subjects they would teach some different things, like in Finland (sorry, it's esiest to give example as I'm form there) we would teach about magical creatures that lived here (IRL our mythology or culture etc), spells would be different in different languages, translations of the spells from the books and some old cultural magic spells we have (why would Finnish use Latin spells, when those two langauges aren't related etc.).

Also herbology would propably be about different plants relevant to the area, and I think same potions could be made with different ingredents, debending on what are native to where you live, like some universal that have to be ordered from outside, but having different potions with different ingredients for same purpose (say skele grow).

Maybe ancient runes are different in places, like those who where Vikings (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Island) would use nordic runes in their ancient runes studies, while Finns wouldn't have the subject, or would use the nordic runes, as we never had rune writing of our own..

I like to think that well once again Finns would use Kantele (Finnis instrument) in spells and singing and maybe have classes for it (this is from our mythology etc), things like this would propably happen in other cultures as well, teach things that are kind of mythology IRL and to witched and wizards would still be in use etc..

One problem with Harry Potter is that it's quite British centric, and even when it has other places it still makes things too British or American and makes it kind of like all Europeans are same, or all Africans are same, even though it should be that all different cultures should have different ways they teach or do magical things etc, or even Fantastic Beast, it emits lots of mythological beings that different countries have, even though I liek to think that all those exists, or are died off.
