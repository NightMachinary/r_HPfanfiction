What I meant there are propably other similiar situations around the world, since it would be odd that during thousands of years only one person has done it, and people have different gods so the way to do them could be different, it all debends on the culture and what gods they have.. It's odder if Odin would be only person to ever done this, the ritual doesn't have to be same, but people do similiar things, even if they never where in contact with one another.. Trying to make it so only Odin did it, wold also be kind of insulting to other old religions and their believes, as those type of things propably would have happened all over the World (not same way but same outcome)
