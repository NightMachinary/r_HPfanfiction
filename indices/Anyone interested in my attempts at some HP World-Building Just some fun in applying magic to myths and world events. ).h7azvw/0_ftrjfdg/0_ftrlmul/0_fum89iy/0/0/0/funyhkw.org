Just to clear it up, by premier I didn't mean in terms of education, but the prestige of the school in question. The best/brightest teachers would want to teach at the more prestigious schools. The nobility/purebloods/elite would want their children to be taught at the most prestigious schools. I envision Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang to mostly teach the wealthy because they can afford to charge/pay higher for it. There'll always be places considered better/superior by the wealthy. I personally agree with the whole culture/context of schools being important and think there are numerous magical schools, and I don't believe that the education of those other schools suffer because they're smaller.

In regards to subjects, I would say that the ICW would govern over a 'standard' set of subjects - Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, Herbology, Defense, History, Runes, and Arithmancy. Otherwise, elective subjects are taught by masters of their fields (Care of Magical Creatures, Alchemy, Rituals & Bloodmagic, Warding to name a few), however, because there's no official system to determine mastery in those magical subjects, it's generally taught by a Master/Apprentice relationship. Any school can hire any master of any subject (obviously in line with a countries laws regarding certain magics), but it's up to the school to ensure quality and safety to those learning those subjects.
