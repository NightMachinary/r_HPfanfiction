So I just want to clarify that everything I'm talking about is my own views and ideas on the extended HP universe. It's all AU and fanon, and my own ignorance on many different cultures and myths will shine through, haha.

In regards to whether or not Defence is standard - in my opinion, it is. Hogwarts teaches Defence Against the 'Dark Arts', but in reality, it's defence against anything you need defending from. The name of the subject likely stems from the Ministry's bias and fear against the Dark Arts. Durmstrang on the other hand... in my view, the Durmstrang Dark Arts class is one of the non-standard ones that require a master/apprentice teaching style to pass on the knowledge effectively. It would also have a Defence class in my opinion - because by ICW standards, every magical school MUST teach the standard subjects.

Agreed, some people would never go to certain schools, even if they were older, etc because of cultural and historical reasons. But a majority would in my opinion.

Your thoughts on different things being taught in different schools is correct, but the /classes/ would be the same. I agree that a Finnish school would focus more on local plants and creatures in their respective Herbology and COMC classes - but the classes would still be Herbology and COMC.

In regards to runes: my version of runes being a magical language means that the fact that they happen to be Norse mean /nothing/. It was just Odin's native language. The runes of Elder Futhark are just one of the only magical languages, and thus schools all over the world learn them, even the ones in places it makes no sense to learn runes as a language. It's not the language that's important, it's the fact that it's a magical written language. Magic doesn't hold in many other written forms of languages, so it's standard to learn the ones that magic does hold in. Does that make sense? Again, just my headcanon.

For sure. I think that wands would be more widespread, but that perhaps the Finnish school/s have speciality classes in the use of a Kantele and how to wield magic through songcraft. I completely agree that specific regions would place heavier emphasis on local 'myths' and traditions, magics, etc.

Well, Harry Potter is based entirely in Britain, so it makes sense to be British-centric. Furthermore, the story takes place from an 11-17-year-olds perspective, so I personally think that it's a case of unreliable narrating. It's our prerogative to expand on the HP world and widen the perspective of magic from just 'British British everywhere'. That's what I'm aiming for at least.
