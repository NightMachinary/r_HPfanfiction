But the problem still is those languages are all related in same language family.. In say China they propably would have invented simliar thing long ago and would be using theirs. Further away you go from the place of origin more likely it is that those people would have invented simliar thing, because untill relatively recently people didn't really travel around the world as they do now. And if there where pockets of isolated populations they also propably would not use them, because they would have their own or because they wouldn't like that something is forced upon them.

There are also lot of runes etc on shamanic rituals in different cultures, and as IRL their purpose is "magical" with HP universe they propably also would be counted as one..

Within Finland there propably would be some difficulties with using those ruins you mentioned, as we have language from different language family, they would still propably be what we use because we where under Swedish rule for hundreds of years. But in Asia, Africa or say any Aborginal people, it's really unlikely.. Same with it's really likely say Ancient Roman Wizard or Egyptian Wizards also had similiar runes invented as they where far away, and they would have been before Vikings in general where around.
