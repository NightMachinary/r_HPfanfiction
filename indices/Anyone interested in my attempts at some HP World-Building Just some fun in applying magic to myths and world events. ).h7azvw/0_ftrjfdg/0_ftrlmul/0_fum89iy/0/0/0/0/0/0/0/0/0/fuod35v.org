Yes, they all had their own languages, magical and otherwise. No, they could not write them down and use them for magical purpose in their written form, because no language in it's written form can hold magic. Only the fact that Odin performed his ritual and powered it through his sacrificial death meant that magic was bound to Elder Futhark - no other language. So unless someone figured out the incredibly difficult ritual he performed, and sacrificially slew themselves (they couldn't sacrifice another life, intent is imperative in ritualistic magic), then it is impossible for another language to be used magically in its written form. There is a reason you can't just write 'fire' in any language and expect it to generate flame when magic is applied. It is not a language that people speak, it's merely a way to channel magic, that just happens to be in the form of Elder Futhark because of Odin's ritual - a ritual that is unknown and has never been replicated.
