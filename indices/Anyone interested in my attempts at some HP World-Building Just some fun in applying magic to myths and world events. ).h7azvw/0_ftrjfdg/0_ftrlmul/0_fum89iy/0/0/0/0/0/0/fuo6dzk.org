I understand that yes, I would be the same, as I would propably just use the canon HP and if I added anything outside use Finland.. I just liked to brainstorm ideas using Finland as example as I'm from there, but it's more of a like to understand how things would work differently in other places.

I think only minority would go to different school, like only people to go to Hogwarts would be British and Irish, only people in Beuxbatons would be French and people in the surrounding countries and for Dumstrang it would be propably those who speak Slavic languages, but there would propably be some other bigger schools that Rowling never mentioned (like there has to be some super old magical school in Italy with it's long history, not having bigger school there seems kind of stupid), since it wouldn't make any sense otherwise (with smaller ones for say Finland and other places).

I don't think personally that the runes should be same in different places, as those people never where in contact with one another in older times, so the runes wouldn't have spread, it makes more sense that all magical people have their own runes or other markings and they teach them (and places that didn't have them the magical folk removed them from muggle knowledge etc), there have to be multiple, it's kind of same as saying that everyone should know English because it's linqua franca, when in fact everyone should only really know their native tongue, like lots of cultures have their own markings or drawings that I might think as fitting to be magical, and they really are, there should be multiple magical runes in use in different places, as there are multiple languages.

Yeah for last bits, of course it's British but sometimes it feels like when Rowling adds things (to outside of Britain) they still feell ike they are outsider adding things to other places that people living there would think wouldn't really fit well in there (or should be different etc), as to person who isn't British they seem really British even when they aren't about Britain..
