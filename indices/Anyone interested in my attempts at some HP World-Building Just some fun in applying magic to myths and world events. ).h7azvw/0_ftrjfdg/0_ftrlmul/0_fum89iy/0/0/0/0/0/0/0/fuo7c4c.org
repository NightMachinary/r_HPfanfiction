It's fairly debatable on how many would go to local schools or bigger ones I think, but in the end you get the same result - some would go to the bigger schools, some would go to the local ones.

No, you're missing my point with the runes. It's not the language that matters. It's the fact that even in written form, it can hold and be used magically, because Odin performed his ritual. It's so widespread because it's very, /very/ rare to write something in any language and be able to use magic with it. You could not write something in English and then have a magical effect with it. Same with French, Italian, Russian, etc. This is why Elder Futhark is so widely used. It can hold magic because of Odin's ritual. There's just not really any other options in using a written language magically.

Yeah, you're right in that everything feels entirely too British, even worldwide. Luckily, we can make our versions of stuff, haha.
