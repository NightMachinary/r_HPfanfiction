Standart could very well be same, as say in Finland we have one of the best educations in the World (according to all kinds of things) but we still are really small, so just because we are small doesn't make our school worse.. I think the premiere would be more about them being bigger and older, but the education would be about same, though schools might teach different subjects relevant to their culture etc, but as person from smaller country where all our schools are equal in educational standart, it's kind of insulting to think that school from smaller places would teach worse.

For the language potion, you need to take in account also culture and historical differences, Korean witches or wizards would not want to study in the Japanese wizarding school that is one of the biggest ones, becaus of the Japanese occupation of Korea, that was really bad for them..

Finnish people wouldn't want to study in say Swedish or Russian, and would prefer Finnish language as for a long time it was not the lanaguage that we could use in official things (like when speaking to officials etc), same with many others countries and places, that for cultural, linqustical and historical reasons wouldn't want to study in other than their own language.
