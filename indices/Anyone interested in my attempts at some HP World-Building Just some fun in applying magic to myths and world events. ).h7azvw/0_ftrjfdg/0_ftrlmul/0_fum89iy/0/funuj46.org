I agree that only having three magical schools in a continent doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I think that perhaps Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang are the /premier/ magical schools. By this logic, there are many other, smaller, less prestigious magical schools that take less students and perhaps don't teach to quite the same standards as their counterparts.

Another interesting possibility I think, would be language potions or charms. My main point for this is Barty Crouch Sr. - I believe it's mentioned in GoF that he knows over 200 languages, give or take. Either he's got some fantastical blood trait that allows him to memorise and regurgitate more languages than physically possible, or there's a magical method of adding a new language to a wizards repertoire. It neatly solves the issue of language barriers at a multi-lingual school, as well as the problem of their being so few schools that we know of.
