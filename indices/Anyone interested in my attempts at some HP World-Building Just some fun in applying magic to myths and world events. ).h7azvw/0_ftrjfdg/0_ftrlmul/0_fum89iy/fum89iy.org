If you wanna flesh out the World of HP, I would say that remember that having one like 3 Wizarding schools in Europe and also so few in other continents wouldn't make sense at all.

Like for example Finnish (as I'm from there) people speak Finnish, which isn't in anyway or shape related to Indo-european languages like English, Swedish or Russian or French, so it wouldn't make any sense for Finnish people to go to school in Dumstrang or Hogwarts or in Beuxbatons (wrongly written some of these), as Finns would not understand anything anyone there would be saying, so there would have to be Wizarding school in Finland, how ever small it is.. And funnily enough Finland has one Boarding School, that all Finns joke about being "Finnish hogwarts"..

So like every country that speaks language that is no the language the school uses (if they don't understnad the other language, say Swedes, Norwegians and Danish propably would have same school as they all understand one another) should have their own Wizarding schools.
