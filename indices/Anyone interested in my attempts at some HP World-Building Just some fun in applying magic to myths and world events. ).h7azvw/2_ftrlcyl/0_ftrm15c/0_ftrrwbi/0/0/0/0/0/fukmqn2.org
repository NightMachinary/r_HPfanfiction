Definitely the healing aspect - Asclepius wielded a serpent staff and was the god of medicine, so it's pretty fair to say he was a parselmagic healer of immense skill. However, I think the main aspect of Parselmagic is that it takes preparation and time. Powerful spells, both offensive and defensive can be invoked, BUT the drawback is that you can't just cast it instantaneously as if it were an ordinary charm. This is why it wouldn't see any use in the heat of battle - all the parselmagic would have been cast beforehand. Similar to bloodmagic.
