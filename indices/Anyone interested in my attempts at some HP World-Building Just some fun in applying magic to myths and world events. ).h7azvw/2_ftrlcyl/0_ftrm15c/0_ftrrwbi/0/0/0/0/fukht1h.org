What would parselmagic be like for you?

I always envisioned more on the side of healing / warding magic, not offensive. For sure a couple of heavy rituals regarding the body. It makes so much sense to me that Voldemort body was â€˜enhanced' through some type of perselmagic ritual. It would also explain why he never used parselmagic on the book, it is not an offensive type of magic
