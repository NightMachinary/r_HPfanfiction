I actually like that about the parselmouth giving a blessing to a normal serpent, granting it intelligence. The stronger the user is, the more power he imbues into the blessing, the longer can the serpent retain its wisdom.

A truly powerful wizard could potentially even create a new breed of magical serpent.
