Perhaps not in canon, but there's no reason it can't be, no? I think that in regards to the ritual, the main theme is the magical language, and the serpent is the secondary factor, hence ruling out the need for a patron/entity to tie any ritualistic factors too. But that's just my view on it.

Edit: I do think the idea of having patrons that lend a small boon, similar to the aedric blessings of the Elder Scrolls series is an interesting concept.
