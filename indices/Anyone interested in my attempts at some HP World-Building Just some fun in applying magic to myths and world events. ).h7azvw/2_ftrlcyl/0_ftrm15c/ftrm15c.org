My thoughts exactly. I can definitely see Salazar employing the same ritual to bind magic to the language of serpents AND give snakes the capacity/intelligence to use aspoken language... it explains neatly the whole 'snakes aren't smart enough to have their own language' outcry we see in fanfiction. The nature of the ritual means that a magic-user has to manipulate their magic to enable the ritual's effect, something only a Parselmouth could do with Parseltongue. So when the ritual's effects are invoked, the snake being spoken to gains the boons of the ritual (obviously doesn't apply to magical breeds of serpent).
