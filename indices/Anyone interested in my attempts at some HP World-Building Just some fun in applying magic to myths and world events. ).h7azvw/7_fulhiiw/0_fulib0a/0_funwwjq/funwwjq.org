Whilst I'm aware of the differences between sorcerors and wizards, I think that in the HP universe they'd not be different in that way. After all, Tonks is born a metamorphagus and isn't classed as a sorcerer because of it (keep in mind this is just my own opinion).

I'd rather say that a sorcerer is classed as a wizard that is so in tune with their own magic that it comes easier and more powerfully than a wizard not in tune. I.e. the more in tune you are, the greater/stronger your magic will be. A wizard enough in tune can direct their own melody, thus performing extraordinary feats (Flamel and his alchemical achievements, Odin and his ritual, etc.) Dumbledore, Grindelwald, Voldemort would also be examples of this.

In regards to the Greek Mythologies, I've already come up with what I believe an interesting twist on how what become known as the Titanomachy and the reign of the 'Gods' came around... but in the end, they were all just sorcerers, powerful, almost beyond belief, but still human. It might be what I post next. ;)
