Continuing your experiment: Lets say the Titans are in fact eldritch Magical beings that embodies forces of nature, the first Magic Users (Olympians) are humans affected or accidentally created by them, and the Titanomachia begun as a fight for survival of the latter, resulting in the Titans being sealed off thus making the world more habitable for men. Atlantis is the first city created by the demi-gods descendants of the Olympians, later destroyed/sealed off because they tried to pull a "Olympiamachia" on the gods and they were not happy about it.
