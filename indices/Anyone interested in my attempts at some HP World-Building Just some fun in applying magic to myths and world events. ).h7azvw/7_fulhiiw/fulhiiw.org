Yeah, I'm totally in, loved your approach to the Allfather and gods in general, they could be More akin to Sorcerers with innate (and quite specific) magic abilities different from Modern Wizards whom must learn their craft (and while not that powerful, have More versatilty) Are you planning to open a site or fanon Wikia? That would be an amazing place to post ideas and work them.
