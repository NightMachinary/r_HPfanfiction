Not a huge fan of pairings in HP fanfiction, but Harry/Cedric is a guilty pleasure. I also don't hate Harmony. I can't fucking stand Voldemort with anyone though even if it's “young Tom Riddle so he's actually hot.” Linkao3(8132578) this fic however manages to take every trope I hate (dark lord Harry, crazy puppet master dumbledore, shipping Voldemort with anyone) and make it something I enjoy reading.
