My favorite pairings are usually outside of the canon element, but I absolutely love the series of stories that begin with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6142629/1/Dudley-s-Memories][*Dudley's Memories*]] linkffn(6142629). It's Harry/Ginny, and the series itself ends up diving deep into untangling a lot of left-over angst from the novels. Highly recommend.
