Well that certainly is an interesting viewpoint. I disagree but I respect your opinion.

1) The only time they would kiss or have sexual intercourse would be in an extreme case of catharsis, which is an release of pent up emotions. However this would be an extreme case and in cannon we can see (The whole series is from Harry's POV) that they clearly do not interact with each other.

2) Harry was stalking Draco bc he knew he was recruited to do a mission, by Voldemort therefore there isnt really an obsession over Draco himself, more of what he is doing. This is fither more evidently explained in the Half Blood Prince scene were Snap and Draco are talking in the closet area thingy and Harry eavsedops. He doesn't care for Draci more so WHAT he is doing.

However I agree that the homophobic members of this community should be banned. I may not be apart of the LGBTQ+ community but you guys dont deserve the hate due to a loud minority. And unfortunately in this subreddit there is a loud minority that are homophobic.

My ideal Drarry fic would be kinda were Draco uses Harry to try and kill Hermione and Ron, and when he succeeds Harry leaves him and becomes a R≈çnin, seeking redemption for the crimes he has committed (Basocally killing Hermione and Ron, he is guilty like in cannon) and this foc would centre around his redemption and finding a place in this world.

Eventually the final battle would be to the death between Harry and Draco and Harry would realise the only way to redeem himself would be to kill Draco so he attempts to love him first, to turn him. But alas it doesn't work and when they fight Harry wins killing Draco.

This fic would ideally end with Harry burning Dracos body and ending up with someone else, preferably Geroge or Fred. Now I would write this but my time is stretched thin soooooo if anyone takes this idea I expect at least a nod in the fic.
