No. But I'm saying being a dickhead and cussing them out aint going to help no one. Mate I'm straight, I got banned for a week by the mods for being "homophobic" cah I said some straight ppl find Lesbians hot. I understand and I truly believe what your saying.

When I first joined the community I avoided slash like a plague but I read one well written one and that's it.

But saying homophobic and sexist things like some people have in this community because a fic isnt centred towards their ideas isnt helpful.

I got a PM from someone calling me a nigger bc I'm black and I want more black focused fics that arent Blaise Zabini. And yh I'm black.

What I'm saying is some people are genuinely close minded fucks and I'm 16. I'm 16 the age were I call people Gay for dumb shit at school which I do of course but online shot is different.

Behind the screen some comments really do affect people and damn does Media blame stupid shit on unlinkable things.

Now I dont know weather you have made any homophobic comments so re reading my previous comment o was unclear on what I meant. Not liking slash Is fine, but making shitty comments is unnecessary and just retarded. Like why?

And I dont read fem fics, I just cant. I'm a Male so reading a fic were a Period is described zones me out and I back the fuck back.

So trustttt i do get ya!

And mans in yr 11 and I got more class the twenty somethings idots. Like no cap I will take your girl and give her this dic-
