Honestly, you can look at Severus Tobias Snape in one of two ways; a blinded view, or a realistic view. If you look at it blindly, he's a hateful, and spiteful man who never got over his childhood. Realistically, he is a sadistic, and psychotic waste of sperm. I say this because he is a death eater, meaning he probably raped, killed, and tortured for fun before he 'switched' sides. Furthermore, if you recall correctly, he asked for Lily. Not an innocent little child, but Lily. Why? Because he 'loved' her. That's hippogryph dung. If he truly loved her, he would respect that at least she was happy with James. Instead, he assumes that since he 'loves' her, only he deserves her. Thus, I wouldn't be surprised if she lived, she would hate every breath she took.
