Favorite ship is Harmony.

I would probably say [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/1/][Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina]]. Of all the fics that I read before I got super into Harmony, it is the one that sticks out in my mind. Regulus in it feels a bit gary-sueish but in a fantastic action hero type of way, the trial for Sirius is done in the most dramatic and fun way, and then there is a bunch of fun time turner shenanigans in it.
