Draco Malfoy ends up dating a Muggle in this series. That sounds terrible, I know, but it works a lot better than you'd think and the story does a pretty decent job of showing how the character could get to a point where that wouldn't be completely absurd and OOC. It's not actually a romance story, though - that's a fairly minor subplot and the character isn't even introduced until later. So if you're looking for something that focuses on that more heavily, you'll probably be disappointed.
