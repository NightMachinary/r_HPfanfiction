Mrs. Weasely's article is well-written, but as a commentary on the current events it is incredibly one-sided.

As much as I approve criticising the so-called Magical League, it was not born out of thin air. The European Cup as an organisation is incredibly corrupt (what else can you expect with Bagman on the job?) and on top of that has been caught skimming profits off the licensing without paying the clubs.

And meanwhile, due to dragon pox pandemic, most top teams are incredibly in-debt due to contractually guaranteed wages. If their profits won't increase, they will have to let go (not sell, since nobody will be able to afford them) most of their best players. And while Mr. Wood may agree to have his pay decked for the love of Quiddich, I don't think many of his teammates will approve.

Something needs to change, and soon --- as much as the Quiddich fans hate to admit it. The European Cup did win this round --- mostly due to the Magical League presentation being completely incompetent --- but I think by the next decade we will see another, better attempt.
