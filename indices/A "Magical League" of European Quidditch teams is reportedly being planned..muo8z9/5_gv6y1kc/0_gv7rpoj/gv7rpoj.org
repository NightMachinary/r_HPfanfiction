It's probably because I have never cared about football, so I'm not really invested into what's happening, but I find this parody a lot less uncomfortable than others.

I really hate it when authors use their character as a mouthpiece for their opinions about a country or worse, religion. But there it's just sport, for a non fan like me, it's not a high stake question so I can just read it and enjoy the parody.
