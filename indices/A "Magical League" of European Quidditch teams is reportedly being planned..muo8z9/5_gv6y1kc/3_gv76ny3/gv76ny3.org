If you've got [your political opinions], flaunt it!

There are some who got very good job with it: “A Vote for Europe” by GryffindorTom linkao3(7285909), or “Harry Potter and the Brexit Conspiracy” by elderfuthark linkffn(13415056).

And completely unrelated, just that I have hit on while searching for this: “not with a bang, but a whimper” by blue artemis linkffn(13864346) ... that's exactly how I feel now: “magic is real? who cares? we just found out [[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56796324][we have been in war with Russia since 2014]] ... there is just nothing to surprise me now.”
