This. I read fanfiction to get away from the present-day news and politics. And the excuse the clubs gave was that football was too affected by the epidemic. The last thing I want to read is fanfiction about the effect Covid has had on sports- fictional or not.

BTW What's the whole point of /another/ league? That's what the Champions League is for. Clubs are already playing 3 games a week and the quality of football decreases when the players can't rest between games.
