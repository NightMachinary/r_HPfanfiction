Nobody has written the "Covid-19 is actually a magical disease which is why Muggles have struggled with it so much" story? I'm surprised.

As for ANOTHER league, I think the thought is that clubs have to qualify for the Champions League through a process. These teams want to bypass qualifying, stop playing in the Champions League, and just play each other in this new league every season and not worry about who is or is not qualifying. Basically they want to make their own Champions League where they automatically qualify. They would still play in their respective home country leagues (Premier, La Liga, etc.). Obviously this has pissed off a lot of people either invested in Champions League or a fan of the current structure.
