Harry took out his badge and an official looking parchment.

'Hello, Minister. I was sent with orders of execution of one Mr. Riddle, pseudonym Lord Voldemort, from the Wizengamot and ICW. Here, there is my permission slip for his termination.'

Minister took the parchment with trembling hands. The signatures were blurred but the seals were unmistakable and real.

'Are you a Ter-terminator? ' Minister stuttered, pale. It was years since the Unspeakables send any one of those back, as far as he knew. He was praying that the man before him will not be send while he was on the tenure.

The young man inclined his head, his eyes piercing. Sweat trickled into Ministers eye.

'Not anymore. As of five minutes ago, I am officially on retirement now.'

At the head of a document was inscribed /The Future Has Not Been Written. There Is No Fate But What We Make For Ourselves/.
