The defence would like to point out that the very act of Mr Riddle casting the killing curse makes it self-defence. Even if these actions were planned out in advance one certainly couldn't blame Mr Potter for his foresight, after all, the deceased was well known for their tendency to... well, murder people.

And concerning these so called life-preservation artefacts, well it is important to note that in order to create each one of these seven artefacts, one of which was Mr P. himself, Mr R. performed (unspeakable and horrendous acts). That is, he did this once for each of the seven artefacts, for a total of seven times.

One might wonder how Mr P. managed to remove the artefact attached to his person? Well, prior to his death Mr R. cast a Killing Curse at Mr P., the intent of which was to kill Mr P., but instead in a twist of karmic fate instead removed the artefact.

This sets a clear precedent for Mr Riddle's attack on Mr P. and shows that it was clearly un-provoked, and entirely his own doing.
