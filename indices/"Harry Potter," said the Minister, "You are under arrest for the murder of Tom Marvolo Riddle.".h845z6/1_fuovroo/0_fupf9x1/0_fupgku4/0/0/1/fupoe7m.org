[after the criminal histories have been read]

Now that this business is concluded, I have to address an earlier statement of my colleague. The defense was arguing that the mere act of casting the killing curse makes it self-defense.

However, my colleague themself also reminded us that this was not the first time the killing curse had been used against him. No, we are aware of three. And that's only what's been made public. Perhaps there have been more? Perhaps Mr. P and his friends, known for using unforgivables, have even practiced them against each other?

Doesn't matter either way. The point is, ladies and gentlemen, the killing curse doesn't KILL Mr. P, now does it? And after the events from 1981, Mr Riddle was surely aware.

Did Mr Potter somehow forget this minor detail, that he had to defend himself?
