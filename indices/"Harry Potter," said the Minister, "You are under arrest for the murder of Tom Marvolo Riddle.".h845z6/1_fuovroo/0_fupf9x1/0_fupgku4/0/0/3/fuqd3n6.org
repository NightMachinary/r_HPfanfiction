Objection! The honourable Mr R. has never been accused of or tried for any of those acts mentioned. No evidence has been brought forth, nor has a jury of his peers judged him guilty. The previous administration has even issued a statement that Mr R. is in fact innocent of any crime ever. These allegations should therefore not factor into any decision made here today.

On the matter of self defence, multiple witnesses have stated that Mr P. has, in the past, been struck by the so-called killing curse and yet lives. Considering the lack of harm this curse has done him, and Mr P.s awareness of this fact, what was he trying to defend against when he did murder Mr. R.?
