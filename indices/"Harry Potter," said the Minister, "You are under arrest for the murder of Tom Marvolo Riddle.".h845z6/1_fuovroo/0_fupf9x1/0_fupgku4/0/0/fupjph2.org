Of course, there are many accusations levelled against both parties, but Mr P. has been acquitted of his underage sorcery charge due to his need to defend himself, as the record will show. He has admitted to the bank robbery and has already made reparations with the goblins. Mr P. has never been charged with these other crimes; aiding and abetting fugitives from justice, participation in necromantic rituals (meta: what's this one?), and the use of unforgiveable curses.

And while the defence only brought up Mr Riddle's history in respect to his homicidal tendencies, especially regarding Mr P., and not his character, we might gladly include a list of the other crimes he has been proven guilty of including, terrorism, arson, burglary, theft, at least 18 counts of murder, over a hundred counts of conspiracy to commit murder, providing refuge to fugitives of justice, breaking prisoners out of Azkaban, multiple counts each of using the unforgivable curses, the use of hundreds of spells classified as dark magic, and the use of multiple necromantic arts.
