Objection! M'learned friend for the defence has, by these accusations against the deceased Mr. Riddle, quite clearly raised the issue of character: if the court will be so good as to recognise that fact, the defendant's extensive criminal record - underage sorcery, aiding and abetting fugitives from justice, criminal damage, participation in necromantic rituals, use of unforgiveable curses, and bank robbery, to name only the more egregious items - can be read to the jury.
