Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

Today we will prove to you that Mr Potter carefully planned and ruthlessly executed the murder of Tom Riddle.

The defense will allege that Mr Potter is the victim here. That it was the deceased who used the killing curse. That the defendant simply stood there, waiting for his death, while the curse... backfired.

Expeliarmus is not a defense against the killing curse, ladies and gentlemen. So why would Mr Potter bother to cast it, when he could have gotten out of the way instead? Maybe the defense will suggest that The Boy Who Live, Triwizard Champion, panicked. No, He did not. He knew exactly what he was doing.

We will prove to you beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Potter knew Tom Riddle's curse would backfire. That he had planned the whole situation. His co-conspirator, Albus Dumbledore, ensured Mr Malfoy was the real owner of the Elder wand. Then Mr Potter systematically destroyed all life-preservation artifacts owned by Mr Riddle. Goaded Mr Riddle into attacking him at the grounds of Hogwards. And they simply enjoyed the curse backfiring.

This is not self-defense, ladies and gentlemen. No plan spanning years could even be considered self-defense. No. It was plain and simple murder.
