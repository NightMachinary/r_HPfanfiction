I am currently working on a fic that will probably include one of the main characters who is LGBTQ+. She will choose to come out to friends/family as the topic of the Yule Ball comes up. That doesn't do you much good now however as it's not anywhere close to ready, and there is an alarmingly high chance that'll never publish it, because, I consider all my writing to be trash.
