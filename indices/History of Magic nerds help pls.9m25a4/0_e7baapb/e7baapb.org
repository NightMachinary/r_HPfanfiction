It doesn't exist. On Pottermore, JKR says that no one knows where magic comes from originally. We know it goes back at least to ancient Egypt though. Well, to be technical we know old Egyptian tombs were cursed according to Ron and it's part of the common experience in Curse Breaking. Could have been added later, but Ron says it was the ancient Egyptian wizards who cursed the tombs I believe.

As for why it's restricted, well, genes or something. I personally hate that, so I ignore it in my story. Otherwise we get the stupid crap lots of crossovers do where the antagonists get Harry's blood and clone him to get a wizard for themselves (ignoring the obvious issue of that Harry having no way to learn to control his magic...). I relegate it to the soul, which does have canon support. Riddle that came out of the diary could use magic, and he didn't have any biological material from his original self.
