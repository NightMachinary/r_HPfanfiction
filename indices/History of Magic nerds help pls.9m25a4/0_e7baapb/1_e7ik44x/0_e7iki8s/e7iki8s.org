We sort of know that's true. Harry wasn't born a Parselmouth but he still received the ability through Voldemorts Horcrux, and we later learn he permanently imbibed the ability even though the soul piece was removed. In my own story, I basically say there's a magical equivalent of DNA that explains these extra abilities (Parseltongue, Metamorphmagi, Seer, etc.). I call them "Extras" because I'm not very clever. :)
