Given the portrayed eccentricity of witches and wizards in canon, I imagine there is a great deal of variation in style of robes ranging from dressing gown to kaftan to houppelande to yukata. Underneath, those raised in the magical world wear a shift and often tights (in addition to pants or lingerie), both unisex clothing options before the Statute of Secrecy.

Given the lack of plastics and thus elastic material, lacing becomes far more common, made more convenient by the presence of self-lacing enchantments. Robes are generally cut from a single large piece of fabric to make enchanting easier. As for footwear, I imagine leather boots and cloth or leather shoes as the favored options. Boots, again, are much more appealing when you have charms to lace them up for you and regulate temperature.

Jewelry would be very commonly worn among wealthy adults as wearable enchanted items which can be fit into many outfits. The Weasley twins prove that this sort of enchantment is not impossible, but I can imagine a situation where the best enchanters want to make as much money as possible from their skills and place their enchantments on extremely expensive jewelry, limiting their availability. Also, in my head canon magical Britain and indeed the rest of the area formerly colonized by the Roman Empire is not well known for that style of enchanting, focusing on wand magic instead. High quality enchanted jewelry might be imported from places like magical Persia and India instead.
