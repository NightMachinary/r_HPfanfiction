Google houppelande. The google image results, especially the line drawing from Wikipedia, are legitimately what I picture most wizarding robes looking like, more or less. Also, while the google results are reasonably plain versions, I've seen some ridiculously fancy stuff done with those clothes and if I were an artist I'd do a Yule Ball scene with everyone in brocaded silk and goldwork and seed pearls because that's totally what would be going on. Also, I can tell you from experience that the first time you dress that way it feels distinctly odd but it quickly becomes very comfortable and it's surprisingly easy to exist and work and do normal things while in that type of garb, and, especially if you've been wearing it for a week or two straight, it feels even weirder going back to mundane clothes than it did trying those in the first place - which makes the wizarding characters' awkwardness with muggle clothes make absolutely perfect sense, in my opinion.
