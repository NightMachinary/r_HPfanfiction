It wasn't so much the resemblance to earlier muggle clothing as it was being a part of a historical re-creation group (the Society for Creative Anachronism) and seeing people wearing this stuff. The first time I saw an outfit in this style, it immediately clicked in my head that it was like the vague image I had of wizarding robes. I'd always imagined that they didn't wear muggle clothes under generic robes like most wizard costumes are because they wouldn't have been so ignorant of muggle clothing if they did, and this gave me a picture of how that would work.
