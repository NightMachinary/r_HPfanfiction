Usually, I assume that the Hogwarts school robes are like the ones in the books. For Auros and Hit-Wizards as well as duellists, I assume they wear robes that look more like trench coats - cut to allow easy movement. For everyone else: A mix of both for most, and whatever they want for the rest.

In "Patron", though, wizards wore much more magical clothes - the more magical, the better. Floating robes that didn't touch the skin, illusionary fire, transfigured smoke, clothes that changed as you wore them, liquid clothes - anything goes. Students wore the standard robes until year 6, at which point they wore whatever they wanted under an open school robe. Spells on robes also helped with defending against curses and were a status symbol.
