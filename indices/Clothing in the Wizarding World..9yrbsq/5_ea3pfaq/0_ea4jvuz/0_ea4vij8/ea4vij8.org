That's when the two societies split. While muggles changed fashions due to changes in lifestyles (more factory work, break throughs in transportation, foriegn influence, new textiles, female empowerment, etc.) nothing much changed in the wizarding world - magic allowed for more equality between sexes, literacy and education rates were aleady high, clothing prices were due to amount of magical effort to produce clothing rather than actual physical material, no major revolutions, etc. Also, due to longer lifespans, wizarding society and tastes don't change as quickly as muggle society making traditional clothing more relevant. Even if they do change, they wouldn't go in the same direction as muggles - I would think that (especially for the first few decades after the statute was implemented) wizards would take pride in being different from muggles.
