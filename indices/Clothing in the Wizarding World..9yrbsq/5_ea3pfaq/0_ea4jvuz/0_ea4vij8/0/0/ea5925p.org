A big part of it is also the book 1 descriptions of what wizards were wearing. But for me, I've visited a few countries and even in ones where sweaters and jeans are a thing, there is still distinct differences in style. Also, Britain held India for years but somehow British style never quite transferred to everyday people. Considering it is a hidden magical society, I really don't see why fashions would be the same. I think it was mostly because the movies had a limited budget for wardrobe that so much of 'muggle' clothing was incorporated. If you see the Pottermore drawings of school uniforms, they're full on robes rather than private school uniforms with opened robes.
