My headcannon is that there's a lot of variation and that the variations carry sociocultural meaning. Most robes are probably very customized/bespoke, given the general economy. Wizards also dress pretty wildly in the muggle world, so it makes sense there'd be a lot of individual variation in style.

I also tend to imagine women's formalwear being somewhat medieval or like the robe a la francaise, but with more robe-like backs & sleeves (and without functional corsets.) My headcannon is that robes are big--like bigger than someone's body underneath, so wearing them open over clothing is both practical and flattering.
