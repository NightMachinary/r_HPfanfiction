Personally, I go with the idea that robes are quite similar to the western styles of dress in the early 1700s since the Statute of Secrecy had only just gone up around then. So lots of long frock and overcoats like banyans and kaftans for the men, and women would have long frock coats over dresses or long fitted tunics.
