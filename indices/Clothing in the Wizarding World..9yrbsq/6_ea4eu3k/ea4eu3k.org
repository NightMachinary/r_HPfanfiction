I use everything! :) In my head canon people really just where whatever they want to, so you could have someone in pure robes next to someone else with muggle clothes, or somebody with the more fantastic beasts pants and suit stuff going on! :) Because yes I don't think muggles invented pants so it should not be all robes, all the time really. They should have magic pants of their own!
