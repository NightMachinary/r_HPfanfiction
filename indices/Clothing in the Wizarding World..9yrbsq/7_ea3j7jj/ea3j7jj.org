Clothing, in my opinion, depends on the situation. Hogwarts and certain jobs certainly dictate a peculiar type of clothes as it is part of tradition, or because in their duty, Aurors or Hitwizards, and or Officials represent the governant body - the Ministry. I think in casual setting robes are not required.
