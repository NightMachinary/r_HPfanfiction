I've never actually posted a fiction, due to an inconsistent schedule. I didn't want to leave people waiting and was happy just to write for myself. In order to avoid the same issue now, I'm aiming to complete at least a first draft of the entire thing before I start posting and was thinking of posting a chapter per week.

My chapters are usually between about 3500 and 5000. Depends on tone and density of text. But I also try to be efficient with my words. Sometimes a chapter will be a touch shorter, because it's the right place to put a chapter break but I've said what I need to say. I don't really like to pad.
