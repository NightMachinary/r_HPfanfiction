I struggle to write more than 1000 words for some chapters others can be longer. I usually update once a week on Fridays afternoon. My longest story is 68 chapters and almost 88,000 words. I have one scene break in a chapter. I usually don't start posting until I have a good amount of chapters.

I don't know a good balance though.
