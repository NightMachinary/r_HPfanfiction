5k word chapters. that's about the average for normal novels. also, I've noticed a pretty sharp decrease in reviews after a 1 week period, or perhaps slightly less than 1 week. Truthfully, if you've got a 300k completed story and it's 5k chapters... that's over a year worth of posting and you're likely going to be sacrificing reader interest for a review count.
