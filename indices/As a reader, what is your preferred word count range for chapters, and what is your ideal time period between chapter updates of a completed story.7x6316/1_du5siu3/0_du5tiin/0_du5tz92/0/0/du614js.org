Unsolicited opinion:

See my other comment in the thread for more detail, but narrative tone dictates how long a chapter should be and by association average reading session. The more you want readers to settle down really pay attention, the longer the chapters should be. If you're writing something lighter, then shorter gets in and out without bogging things down.
