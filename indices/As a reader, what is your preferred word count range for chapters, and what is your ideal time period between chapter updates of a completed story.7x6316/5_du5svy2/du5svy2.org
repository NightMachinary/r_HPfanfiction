When I was actively writing and posting California Dreamin', I tended to post as chapters were ready. I didn't really think to delay or stage anything WRT maximizing views or reviews. I started posting it when I had eleven chapters complete and I did one a day and then after that, as they were completed. The time between updates varied depending on real life (trip to UK, holidays) and how well the writing was going. I completed the 39 chapters in a bit less than a year, so that's a pretty good frequency.

Some of the chapters were 9 and 10k words and I think the shortest was between 4 and 5k words. I don't go for a specific word length per chapter, but rather shoot for an ending that seems natural to the action of the chapter.
