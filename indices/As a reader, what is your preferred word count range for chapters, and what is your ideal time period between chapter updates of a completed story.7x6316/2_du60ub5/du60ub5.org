There's a lot of response here of authors talking about what they do, so here's my opinion from a reader's perspective:

4-8k word chapters, no less than once a week.

The length of the chapter really depends on the story itself. Lighter, faster paced stories tend to benefit from a quicker updates and shorter chapters because the material isn't intended to be read with a high level of scrutiny. These stories trend more toward comedy and fluff, similar to a half-hour television show.

Longer, denser works are the opposite. Usually those stories are intended to have a longer average reading session, likely taking in details and appreciating both imagery and worldbuilding. With a work like this, 4k words may not be enough time to meaningfully advance the plot and give the story a disjointed feel. These are more like hour long television shows.

Longer than once a week for any type of story and readers will start forgetting details and losing track of minor or supporting characters. This is especially a problem if there's not a whole lot to distinguish your Harry from someone else's Harry, or whoever your canon characters of choice might be.

The more AU a story is, and frankly the better a story is, the longer it can go between updates without disjointing readers because the story will be memorable. For a particularly dense, heavily AU, and well-received story I would say the period extends to two weeks as long as the chapters are proportionally beefy and productive.
