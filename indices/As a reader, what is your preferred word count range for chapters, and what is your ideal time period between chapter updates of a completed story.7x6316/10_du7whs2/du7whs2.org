If I'm actually reading something that's in progress, I want 5-10k words, if not more, per chapter, because I'm awful and greedy lol.

If it's complete, I really don't care because I read on my phone, as long as it isn't something silly like 200 words.

As for posting something that's complete- the delay would depend on how long the chapters are, honestly. If they're only a few thousand each, 2 chapters per week is something I've seen plenty of going by author notes on FFN (people posting on a schedule).
