To add a different perspective, I read relatively unusual pairings where good long fics are pretty rare, so if I find one I like I'll stick with it even though the chapters are too short for my taste. I'll read the first chapter of everything for the pairing and maybe bookmark a fifth of them so can't really be picky. I'll also readily leave comments asking for more because good stories are hard to find and comments motivate the author. So I think it's something to take into consideration too ! Not as a reason to slack and update a few hundreds words every month, but just to put things in perspective.
