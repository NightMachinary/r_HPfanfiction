It is a rather nice thought. Giving rights to Dementors. Too bad it doesn't even a sliver chance in hell of passing through voting. And not just because pureblood faction or something equally "bad". Dementors have the ability to feed on Humans. Dementors are predators of humans. And humans are sore losers. If they could somehow kill Dementors they could have hunted down them to the extinction. Humanity is not something inherently "Good" or "Bad". But it is "the survivor". Even in real life, we humanity hunted down our predators to extinction to not worry about them anymore. The reason we are able to have so much comfort of modern life is that we hunted down all of the immediate predators in our environment. If the wizards or humans of the HP world had the ability effect the dementors, they would have been killed to the last one they could find and not stop untill all of them were dead.
