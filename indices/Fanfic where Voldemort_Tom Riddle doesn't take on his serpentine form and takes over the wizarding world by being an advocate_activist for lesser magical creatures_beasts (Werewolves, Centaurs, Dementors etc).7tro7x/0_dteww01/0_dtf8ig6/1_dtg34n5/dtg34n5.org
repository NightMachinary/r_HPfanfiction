I haven't read that fic, but it was started around the time OotP was released. I don't think one can use it as an example of good Dementors that should be given rights. While the Dementors are shown to be horrible already by OotP, it isn't until HBP that we really understand the true evil of Dementors, when horcruxes are revealed and the importance of the soul is underscored. Notably, in the summer of 1996, or between OotP and HBP is when the Dementors change allegiance to Voldemort.
