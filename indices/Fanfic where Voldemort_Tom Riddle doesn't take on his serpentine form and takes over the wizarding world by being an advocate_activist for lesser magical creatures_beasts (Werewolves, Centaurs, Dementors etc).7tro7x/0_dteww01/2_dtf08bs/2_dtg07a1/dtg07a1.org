Yes, but are dragons actively hunting down humans to murder and eat? Dementors actively prey on humans, and condemn them to a fate worse than death. Right now, it is normal for humans to kill animals that are shown to specifically be man-eaters. Dementors ought to be treated just the same, not granted some rights for just being a lesser magical creature.
