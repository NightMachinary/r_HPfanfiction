But yes Dementors ARE sapient because they can communicate with words to the Minister, and they told very specific stories, and they also brought them food and buried the dead outside the prison. :) This was all in canon, so yes I think they have to be an intelligent race like any of the others. They just probably can't control themselves around souls, like an addict I like to think of them as. Maybe they can learn to control that urge to take souls, and be a productive society themselves. :)
