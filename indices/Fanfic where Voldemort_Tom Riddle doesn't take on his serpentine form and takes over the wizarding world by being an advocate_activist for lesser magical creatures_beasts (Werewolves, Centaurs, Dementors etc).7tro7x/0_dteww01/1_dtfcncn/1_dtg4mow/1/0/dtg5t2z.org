  But yes Dementors ARE sapient

Yes, of course. I wasn't debating that. :)

  They just probably can't control themselves around souls, like an addict I like to think of them as. Maybe they can learn to control that urge to take souls, and be a productive society themselves.

It's a nice thought, but unfortunately it's mentioned that they /feed/ on souls. You could say they're similar, in that regard, to a vampire. Except for the fact that vampires could, potentially, feed on donated blood. You're not likely to find someone willing to donate their soul.

To be honest, as abhorrent as it is, other than straight up genocide, I'm not sure that there's a perfect compromise other than allowing dementors to feed on the worst dregs of society.

I think it's absolutely immoral, yes, but we're talking about a fictional, sapient creature, here, and genocide is, also, immoral.
