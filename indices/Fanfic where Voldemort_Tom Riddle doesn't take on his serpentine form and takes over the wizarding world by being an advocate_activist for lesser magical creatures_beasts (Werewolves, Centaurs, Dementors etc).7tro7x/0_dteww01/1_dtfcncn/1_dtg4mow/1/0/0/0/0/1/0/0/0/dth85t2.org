Oh. :) Hmmmm.

Maybe volunteer paid work feeding would be okay, yes. :) If they take precautions and yes they have time to recover or rotate shifts or something. :) It could be like drawing blood or donating organs! You get to be paid a one time fee to go in and have Dementors take happiness instead of blood. :) And since happiness recharges like blood comes back you can keep doing it.
