OH okay phew! :) So okay if they eat EMOTIONS and don't like necessarily NEED the soul afterward, then they could be made to feed off animals instead either way? I mean Sirius said in canon that the Dementors could feel his dog emotions were less complex than a human, but that means they still FELT THEM, which means they still COULD HAVE ate them, but they just PREFER humans? Like eating a delicious pizza vs a bread slice and tomatoes? :) So they could still reach a deal with them to feed off only animals!
