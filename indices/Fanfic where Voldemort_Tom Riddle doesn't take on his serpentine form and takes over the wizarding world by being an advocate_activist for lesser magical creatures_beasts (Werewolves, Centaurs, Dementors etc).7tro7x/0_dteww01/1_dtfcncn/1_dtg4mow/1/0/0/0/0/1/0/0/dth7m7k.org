I don't think they /could/ really feel his emotions in dog form --- one keeps one's human mind as an Animagus, so the emotions weren't /really/ less complex; it's more that the emotions came out "muted" because Dementors are closer to humans than dogs physiologically. So they could feel that there /were/ emotions in there, but couldn't really feed on them (hence why being a dog helped Sirius resist their forceful feeding).

A more secure solution would be that volunteer humans would get /paid/ for standing around letting Dementors take a little bit of happiness from them at a time (of course, provided the Dementors are careful and don't do any permanent damage, with severe legal penalties for the Dementors if they break that "code of conduct").
