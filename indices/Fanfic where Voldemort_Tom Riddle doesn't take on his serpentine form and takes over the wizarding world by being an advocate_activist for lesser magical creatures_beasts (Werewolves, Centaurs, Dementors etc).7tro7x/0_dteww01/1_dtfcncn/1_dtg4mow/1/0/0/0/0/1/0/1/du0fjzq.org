I was thinking along the lines of this: there must be some muggle-and-wizard warding spells for places, that make the people feel so depressed and sad that they just leave immediately. Like Confundus but maybe Depressus? xd

Anyway, get all the prisoners in Azkaban to some other prisons, fill the empty prison with the depression inducing warding spells and it's A Feast For Dementors all year 'round.
