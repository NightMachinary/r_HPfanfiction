:( Ok. Sorry. :( I forgot that the soul also made it so they couldn't go to the mindshattering confirmed freaking afterlife. :( I guess there is no real way to compromise with the Dementors then? :( Just nothing to do? :( OH!!! Wait what about animals? Animals have to have souls right? And humans have slaughterhouses and stuff by the thousands for store meat, so why don't we let the Dementors have them first, so then they would be docile the rest of the time?
