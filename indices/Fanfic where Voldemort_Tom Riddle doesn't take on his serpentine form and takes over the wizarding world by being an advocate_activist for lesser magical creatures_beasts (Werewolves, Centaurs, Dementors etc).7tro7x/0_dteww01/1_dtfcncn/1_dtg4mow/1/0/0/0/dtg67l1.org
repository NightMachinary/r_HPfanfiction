Uuuuhhhhhhh, well, first, let me poke a hole in that. Because it definitely sounds reasonable until you consider what a soul /is/.

We're not talking about just killing someone. We're talking about taking their /soul/ away. We're talking about refusing them the ability to move onto the afterlife.

I certainly don't think you should subject innocent people to that, especially comatose or unborn children.
