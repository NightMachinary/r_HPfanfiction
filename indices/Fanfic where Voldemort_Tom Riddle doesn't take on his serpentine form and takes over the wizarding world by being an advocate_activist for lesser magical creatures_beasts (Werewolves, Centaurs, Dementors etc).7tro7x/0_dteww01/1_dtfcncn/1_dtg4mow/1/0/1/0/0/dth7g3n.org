  the Dementors would have to develop some kind of reasoning to stop them from going all out
#+end_quote

I would say, try to bargain with the brighter specimens, make them see that taking /fresh/ emotions from new people (in limited quantities) is still better than trying to squeeze a few last drops out of clinically depressed prisoner whom they've been feeding on for years.

Then, to make sure no Dementor gets any wise ideas about "going all out", make law strictly apply to Dementors and set a harsh penalty for breaking the "code of conduct" of feeding times. (Imprisonment for going too far and causing mental damage; a death penalty if they try for the Kiss.)

And in the long run, educate the new "generations" of Dementor on ethics.
