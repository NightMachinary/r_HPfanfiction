I agree this is likely the best course of action. You'd have to admit, though, it's highly unlikely that the Ministry of Magic of Harry Potter's time would be willing to do this. In a world where werewolves aren't even normally allowed to go to school or teach, it would be a ridiculous notion to attempt to "educate" Dementors, even in a limited non-magical capacity.
