Sapience, not Sentience. You'll find nearly every animal on Earth has a certain level of Sentience.

Sapience is, more or less, the ability to reason. Sentience is mostly just having a brain that allows you to feel/perceive things around you.

And, of course, these animals have rights. I'm pretty sure it's illegal to arbitrarily abuse most animals. However, you'll not often find someone who knows what they're talking about suggest that we allow them to vote.
