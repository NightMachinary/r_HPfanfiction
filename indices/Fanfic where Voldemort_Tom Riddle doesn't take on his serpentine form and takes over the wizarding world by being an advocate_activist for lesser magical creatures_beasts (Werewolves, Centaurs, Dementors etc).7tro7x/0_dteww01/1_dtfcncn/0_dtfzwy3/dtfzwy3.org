Considering the ultimate sanctity of the soul in the HP universe, Dementors, as creatures (non-beings?) that eat souls, are in such violation of this sanctity that one should not even consider giving them rights. Close to the sanctity of the soul is the sanctity of the mind, which is also violated by Dementors. Everything about Dementors suggest that they are evil and malicious. Giving them sentient rights would be like granting serial killers the right to go free and continue to kill, except that instead of killing, they do the closest equivalent to damning someone to Hell.
