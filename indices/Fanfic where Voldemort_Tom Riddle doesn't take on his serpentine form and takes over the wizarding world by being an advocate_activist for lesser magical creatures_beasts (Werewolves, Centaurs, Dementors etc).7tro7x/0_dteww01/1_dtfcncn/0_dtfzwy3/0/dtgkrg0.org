Dementors have the /ability/ to destroy souls, but they can easily live without ever Kissing anyone, and if educated right ought to /choose/ to do so. Rejecting Dementors because they /have the ability/ to destroy souls would be equivalent to condemning all wizards because they have the /ability/ to cast a torture curse if they so choose.
