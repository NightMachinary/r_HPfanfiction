I think *Resistance* by lorien829, linkffn(2746577), is pretty depressing.

*The World I Leave Behind*, linkffn(5189189), is very depressing, but I still finished it.

*When It Comes Down To*, linkffn(6858689), is horrifically depressing. I gave up after 12 chapters and skipped to the last 5 chapters right away.
