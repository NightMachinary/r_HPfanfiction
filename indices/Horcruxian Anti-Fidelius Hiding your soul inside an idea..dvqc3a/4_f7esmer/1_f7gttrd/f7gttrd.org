There was a short one-shot I saw once where Voldemort gloated to Harry & Hermione; basically, if 7 is a powerful magical number, than 7x7 (49) would be more powerful, and 7^{7} (823,543) would be the most powerful of all, so that's how many horcruxes he made.\\
Harry interrupted his gloating by figuring out that the Dark Mark that each Death Eater had was one of the 823,543 Horcruxes, though.

Not really the same thing, except for dealing with a ridiculous number of horcruxes.
