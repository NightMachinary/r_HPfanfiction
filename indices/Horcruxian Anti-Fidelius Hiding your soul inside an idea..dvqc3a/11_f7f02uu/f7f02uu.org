Harry Potter has also had some very special circumstances influencing him. It could be possible that you can shoehorn him into the concept of sacrifice, considering that his parents sacrificed themselves so that he could live only for him to be subjugated to emotional and - at least a little - physical abuse (which can be thought of as a sacrifice in its own way) until he went to school where he sacrificed himself to save it against Voldemort many many times (most notably dying with the express purpose to save everybody else).

This could serve as a very legitimate way to give the good guys a boost in a fic focused on the future.
