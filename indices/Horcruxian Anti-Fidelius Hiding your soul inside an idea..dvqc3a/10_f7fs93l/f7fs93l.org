  What would be the ideal object to turn into a Horcrux, to ensue it remains intact?

Your examples are still too conspicuous :). Although launching it into space is a good idea.

But what you really want is something so completely ordinary that no one will ever look twice at it. Perhaps a pebble, which is then thrown into the ocean. And then you erase your own memory of where you threw it. Nothing spectacular, nothing with historical significance. Just one pebble among countless billions.
