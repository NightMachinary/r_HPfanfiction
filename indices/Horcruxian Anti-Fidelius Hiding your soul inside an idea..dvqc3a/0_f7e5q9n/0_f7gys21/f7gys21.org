The closest I've seen (spoilers) was VD hiding the knowledge of TMR and VD being the same person into a Fidelius secret. So, for instance, Dumbledore knew Tom Riddle, knew that Tom "left" to go "explore" the magical world, knew that Lord Voldemort returned, etc --- but almost literally for the life of him couldn't put 2 and 2 together and discover that the TMR that left was the same VD that returned later. I think the fidelius was tied to the diary too.
