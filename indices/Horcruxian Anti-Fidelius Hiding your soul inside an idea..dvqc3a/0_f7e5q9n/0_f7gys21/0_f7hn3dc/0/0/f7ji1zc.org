I get that. But that's also what I find confusing. When VD was â€˜killed' first time round surely the first thing to do would be to lambaste him as a pretender. VD already knew Dumbledore knew he was Tom Riddle anyway.

Literally all you'd need to do is copy about a 1000 fliers that say VD is Tom Riddle, a half blood and chuck them around Diagon and hogsmede. Boom, job done.
