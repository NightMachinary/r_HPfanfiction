Almost nobody knew he was TMR. [[https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/54174/why-was-tom-riddles-trophy-at-hogwarts-never-removed][His trophy]] was sitting at Hogwarts with noone batting an eye. Hagrid got imprisoned as a scapegoat for the Myrtle incident and got dragged into it again 50 years later because TMR was still regarded as a model student and the case was never reopened.

Regarding Dumbledore's motivations, I'm not really that sure. Perhaps he thought that sharing VD's entire life story would potentially aggravate VD enough to make VD retaliate in some mass-scale terror act, or that if he publicly disclosed just how much he knew about VD's background, VD could grow suspicious about the obscurity and safety of his souljars.
