I think there's a trope on TvTropes called As Long As There Is Evil, which is about supernatural villains made of darkness or such who can return as long as there's evil in people's hearts.\\
One example given on that page is apparently the spirit Ghost Widow from City of Villains, who's linked to the concept of the Arachnos organisation and will survive as long as there's at least one member left of said group.
