/scratch head/

Not sure I'd read anything with this premise tbh. An ancient corrupting antagonist with a thousand bodies, that doesn't even /need/ to leave the shadow of obscurity to do their work seems a little excessively dark and I get enough of that if I ever open a newspaper or go visit [[/r/news][r/news]] or [[/r/worldnews][r/worldnews]].

Props for creatively presenting it though. I'm just not gonna read any of the prompt responses :p
