The only problem with this is the fact that you would never find a snake in the middle of residential Surrey. There are three types of snake in the UK, and we can immediately rule out the Smooth snake because they are only present on the southern shores. The Adder lives in the countryside, usually on the edge of forests, and doesn't stray very far. The Grass snake lives in fields near water, and its only defence mechanism is playing dead, so it definitely would not move into a residential area where there are lots of animals that can be considered predators.

/So many/ stories fall into this trap, and it's annoying to read.

Anyway, rant over. The idea is actually really cool, and I'd love to read it, if it's done well. It's always interesting to add new villains in, even more evil than Voldemort.
