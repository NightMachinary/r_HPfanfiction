I was talking about prevalence too. England was ground zero of the Industrial Revolution and it shows in its biodiversity. Many species were lost or their ranges decimated. Surrey has been inhabited heavily by humans for centuries. They literally built the second Globe Theatre there.

I'm not saying it's impossible. There are literally leopards prowling the streets of inner-city Mumbai. But it's just a lot more unlikely in Surrey than it would be in, say, Adelaide (speaking from experience seeing a brown snake in my cousin's back yard once).

Only one species of British snake is deadly, the adder. And it's barely deadly to adults. Nobody has died of an adder bite in the UK since 1975.

Thanks for coming on this Magic Schoolbus ride with me!
