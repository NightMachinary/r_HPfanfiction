There's definitely a tension between writing an engaging, magical story and realism. I totally get what the GP is getting at. If you know that there aren't any wild snakes in Surrey, reading a fic about it will kill the enjoyment for you.

For that matter, did you know that snakes don't have eyelids? So the brazillian boa constrictor that winked at Harry is basically impossible and it makes me steamed to this day just thinking about it.
