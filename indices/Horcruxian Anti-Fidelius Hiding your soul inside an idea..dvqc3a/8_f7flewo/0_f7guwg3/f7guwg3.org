Personally, what I'm imagining at the moment is that in order to destroy the serpent Horcrux, the protagonist (presumably Harry) needs to cast the corporealising spell to force the concept of 'snake' to materialise, much like Herpo did, so that the Horcrux is physically present to destroy.\\
But, in order to do that, he'd first need to establish dominance over the concept of serpents (again, like Herpo did), by learning the magicks that make use of snakes, and learning to command and/or destroy the various magical serpents from runespoors to basilisks, whilst at the same time avoiding falling for Herpo's own enchantments.
