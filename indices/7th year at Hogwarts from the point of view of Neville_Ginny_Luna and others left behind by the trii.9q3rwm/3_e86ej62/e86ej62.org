The one I've always heard about is /Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness/ (mentioned by the other poster). The author deleted it years ago, I guess, but you can get a free copy here: [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10207687-dumbledore-s-army-and-the-year-of-darkness]]

I still haven't actually read it.
