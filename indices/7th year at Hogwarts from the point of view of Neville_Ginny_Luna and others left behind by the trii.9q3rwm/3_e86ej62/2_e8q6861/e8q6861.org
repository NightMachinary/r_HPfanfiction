I read it years ago and I thought it was really enjoyable. It's dark compared to canon, but not horribly dark on the fanfic spectrum. It spawned sequels and spinoffs. The author knows how to write a story well , which is the most important thing. If I remember right, he a nut and quite unpopular among â€˜fandom'. But as someone who just wants to read well written characterizations and a plot that moves and is engaging --- I do think this one is worth a read. Maybe even just below the tier of classics. (I have not read the sequels so no idea about those).
