I wrote linkffn(Not From Others)

A few points to consider - although you do see brutality from the Carrows in my fic I am of the opinion that it escalated as Snape struggled to control them and keep up the pretense of being a death eater. The other teachers would also do their best. My fic is not as grim dark as Dumbledores Army and the year of darkness because I just don't think that is realistic and throws up questions like why would anyone send their kids back after Christmas.
