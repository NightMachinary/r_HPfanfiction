Dumbledore is rightfully associated with Death in the Voldemort, Snape, Harry reincarnations of Peverells fan theories. He is neither good nor evil. He does his best to teach his students as much as he can but he will ultimately not care about themselves more than they should. He is not a parent so he has no moral obligation towards anyone, but he gives everyone the tools to succeed to the best ofhis ability.
