I love this one, (Choices)I just finished it actually! It's pretty great how they travel to multiple time periods. Louis Weasley is my favorite character besides Rose. I love a lot of this authors stories in this arc, she's very good at capturing cannon personalities. Storm of Yesterday is one of my favorite Hermione time travel fics, along with One Hundred Sixty Nine. Actually I think I love all Hermione/Class of 1977 fics. Honestly the only one I haven't seen is Hermione/Peter for obvious reasons. Boy Who Lived is also a beautiful fic. I found out about it from this subreddit actually! I loved the aspect of the DoM having to study Harry, and that there were physical consequences to Time Travel. I also loved the idea that there was some inevitability to the actions of time.
