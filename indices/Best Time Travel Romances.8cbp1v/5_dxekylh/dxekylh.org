Oh boy, I'm allll about that time travel nonsense! Having just counted, my collection of stories tagged "Time Travel" has forty five entries, so while that's a bit much for a single post I'm gonna pick a few of my favorites that seem to be a bit lesser known. This doesn't include WIPs so if you're interested in those, let me know and I'll toss a few other links your way.

Ok, so to start, if you're wanting romance and angst Choosing Grey by betagyre is a pretty great TomxHermione time travel - and it's sequal is even better, shifting focus slightly from romance and angst to wizarding politics during the Cold War. linkffn(11722608)

To turn that around, Pygmalion by Colubrina is another TomxHermione that has Tom Riddle traveling forward in time to Our Heroes seventh year. Obviously it's AU as fuck and it also gets pretty dark by the end. linkffn(11248015)

For our final Hermione story (for now), Red Right Hand by Nautical Paramore is a HermionexCygnus Black pairing wherin post war, lost everyone Hermione travels back to adopt Tom Riddle as a baby to try to raise him in an environment suited to not becoming a dark lord. linkffn(12304702)

Moving on from Hermione, because as awesome as she is I know people like other characters too, Time Out Of Place by bananacosmicgirl is one of the first time travel stories I read so it's an oldie but goodie. Drarry, wherin Harry and Draco travel forward in time by a few years and are really fucking confused. linkffn(1143478)

For a some rare pair goodness, Past, Present, and Future by viv-heart is a short, very bittersweet Siriusxyoung!Minerva. It's definitely got that angst in spades. linkffn(12194597)

To cap off this round of suggestions, The Moment It Began by Sindie is a Snily fic where a dying Snape is given the opportunity to return to the scene of his biggest regret. I don't typically ship Snily, but I did enjoy this one. linkffn(3735743)
