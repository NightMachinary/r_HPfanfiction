Once Upon a Thyme is one of my favorite time travel fics. I've read it multiple times even though I don't even normally ship Draco/Hermione. It's not your typical “go back in time but still at Hogwarts” (though I love those too) and the time period and story I always find really interesting. Linkffn(1530065)
