If Harry encountered Quan Chi instead, then there is a good chance. But I'd rather see James Potter become Scorpion. He's sent to the Netherrealm after Voldemort's attack. James is so driven by rage and revenge that he willingly becomes a servant to Quan Chi in order to gain enough power to wage a one-man war on Voldemort.
