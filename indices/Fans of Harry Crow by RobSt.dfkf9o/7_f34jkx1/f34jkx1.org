I mean I haven't read it in a while like a long while. I'd guess people enjoy the super op happy ending/ Harry roflstops everyone part of it. From what I remember goblin culture is decent. Dihard h/hr shippers. The writing is actually good comparatively to the average fanfic which isn't saying much but it is better than the general rabble.

I'll keep my negative points out as that isn't what OP is asking for.
