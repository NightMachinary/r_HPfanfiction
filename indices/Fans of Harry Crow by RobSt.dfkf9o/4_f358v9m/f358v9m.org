Like many ITT, Harry Crow was my first introduction to Robst fanfics. What I loved about it the first time I read it was how unique it seemed to me. Keep in mind it was one of the first handful of fics I read so I didn't know about the tropes and cliches that plague lots of fics in the HP universe.

One positive thing that can be said for Robst, in general, is that every one of his stories begins uniquely. The premise of Harry being raised by goblins is one that has been attempted very few times to my knowledge, and in this story the world building was very well done.

I've tried rereading it twice and couldn't get through it either time. The problem with Harry Crow is that it drags on too long, and the problem with Robst fics in general is that after starting with a wonderfully unique premise, after a few chapters the same old shit starts happening all over again. He also has a few writing techniques that he uses several times per chapter that I don't care for and each time he uses one it makes me cringe. A couple random examples would be: “Harry falling in love with Hermione meant that he would do anything to protect her from harm. He was always going to be the one to treat her right.”
