Not the OP but... perhaps the OP is struggling with it, and wants to hear positive things about the story so they'll stick it out until the end?

I like the concept, but I can't get over the frankly fucked up relationship between Hermione and Harry, and the way Hermione's parents treat said relationship (and are treated by the author). The ickyness of that portion of the story became too much, and therefore I put it down. Other people can ignore it - I couldn't.

That being said, I really liked the one other story of his that I've read (A Different Halloween). Both stories are wish fulfillment with a ship I enjoy, the writing is generally fine and it's a long, completed story. In theory it's something I would like... but the glorification of an unhealthy relationship between twelve year olds? Yeah, nope.
