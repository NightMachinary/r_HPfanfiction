Take about 10% off there, Sensitive Sally. I asked the question because I was reading Dunuelos' Lone Traveler stuff, and in an author's note he mentioned "Harry Crow" being one of his top five favorite fanfics. And despite your assertion of "the Robst hate on this sub," Harry Crow /specifically/ gets a lot of recs, especially from people looking for Harmony work.

Now, personally, Harry Crow is probably my least favourite RobSt fic; I found it clumsy, boring, and chock full of obnoxiously arrogant, braggart 'better than thou' Mary Sue characters. /But/ it has a number of fans, quite devoted ones, and I was curious as to why. And I've gotten some great answers (especially from [[/u/cellequisaittout]] - cheers, mate), and I'm considering giving it a shot (for the third or so time). RobSt is something of a guilty pleasure of mine; some of his fics are crap, some are gold, and most lie somewhere in a pleasant, popcorn read middle ground.
