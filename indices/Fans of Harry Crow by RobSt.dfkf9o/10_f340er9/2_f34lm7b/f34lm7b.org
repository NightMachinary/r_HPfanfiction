  Robst hate

The sub loves Ron (at least in recent times), so anything which paints him in a bad light is seen as evil. Just look at the "the movies were horrible for low-key shipping H/Hr" comments you see every time someone brings them up.

I'll admit that bashing is not the sign of good writing (unless it's crack), but the Robst hate here feels like a circlejerk. Just like the Noodlehammer bashing. It is well known, no need to bring it up again and again.
