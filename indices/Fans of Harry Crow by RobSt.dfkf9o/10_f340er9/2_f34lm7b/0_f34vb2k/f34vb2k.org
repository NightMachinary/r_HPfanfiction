I agree that the hateboner a lot of people have for Rob is kind of worrisome.. He's just a retired school teacher.. I can't recall him ever expressing a single, even vaguely controversial statement.. Whereas Noodlehammer went kinda nuts expressing their opinions on religions of memory serves.. That seems like something well worth warning someone about..
