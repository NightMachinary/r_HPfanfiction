The relationships Robst writes are controversial to put it mildly. Or rather, the age is, especially in Harry Crow. Noodlehammer, well it's a powerwank, and not a good one. But this sub acts as if it's the worst fic you can find, which it definitely isn't. There is so much utterly depraved shit on the sites that IMO Noodlehammer isn't worth getting worked up over. Countless fics are so much worse.
