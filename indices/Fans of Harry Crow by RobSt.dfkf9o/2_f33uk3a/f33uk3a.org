RobSt is a solid writer, and/or has a good beta reader

(Say what you will about his stories, but they don't read like they were written by a dyslexic, somali preteen)

I also enjoy that it's very AU, and not just a slight twist on a story that five dozen other writers has taken a stab at already..
