There's a lot that I dislike about Harry Crow, and yet I've read it several times. Why? I love the worldbuilding of goblin culture, and I appreciate the concept of taking the prophecy and threat of Voldemort's return seriously and preparing Harry from a young age to give him the best chance for survival. I appreciate that the good guys use every tool they know of, including Muggle and goblin technology and weaponry, to their advantage. I appreciate that Frank and Alice were healed. And the descriptions of dueling and battles are really well-done, unique, and exciting. SO many fanfics have tedious fight scenes, or eschew them entirely.
