  A mediocre story, even finished, is far less interesting than a good story, even if it's only a chapter long.

The point, I think, is that a finished story, even a mediocre one, is ahead of more than half the 800000+ stories on FFN, many of which are both mediocre (at best) and unfinished.

Also, it shows dedication on the author's part, which bodes well for their storytelling effort and earns readers' respect.
