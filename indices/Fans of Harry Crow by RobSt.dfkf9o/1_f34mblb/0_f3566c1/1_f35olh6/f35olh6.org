A story needs an ending to be considered good, imho. Starting a story is also far, far easier than finishing it - as proved by the tons of stories that hit the plot point the author had in mind and then fizzle out since the author never thought beyond that "cool scene" they had in mind. You can spin quite the yarn, pile up the mysteries and twists, but a story needs a satisfying resolution to be good.

Interesting ideas or chapters are not enough.
