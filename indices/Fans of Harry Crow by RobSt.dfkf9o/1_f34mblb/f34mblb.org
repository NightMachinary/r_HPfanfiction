Robst finishes his stories, and in a timely manner. He doesn't leave dozens of stories unfinished and/or abandoned while he chases the next plot idea for a few chapters. That puts him ahead of most fanfiction authors who never finish their stories. In addition to that, you know what you're getting when you read his stories - if you like Harmony with a powerful Harry and a lot of Dumbledore and Weasley bashing, especially Ron and Molly, you'll be satisfied. Harry Crow pretty much has all that in spades.

I can't stand the Weasley and Dumbledore bashing any more, nor the way Hermione will basically end up a support character for Harry the hero no matter how the story starts, and I don't like the slut shaming that appeared in Harry Crow. But that's my personal taste.
