... fates gamble is like that... kind of? It's eventually God harry. But I find it's well written, and he goes through a lot to get to it. 5he part I'm talking about is in the second book of it. Tho he really only gets to enjoying his mother's company and his twin sisters (obiously OC's) but he foes have a family. It is a crossover with the Fate universe
