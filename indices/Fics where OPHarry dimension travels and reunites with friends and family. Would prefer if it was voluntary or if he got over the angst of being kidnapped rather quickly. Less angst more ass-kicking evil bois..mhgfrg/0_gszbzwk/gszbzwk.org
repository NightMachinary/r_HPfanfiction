So for a lot of ass-kicking with dimension travelling jumping in at the start of the second of them, I really like the Hero trilogy by joe6991 starting with linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero). For a second OP Harry fic by the same guy - but without dimension travelling of the type you mean - try linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) and its sequel. Personally I prefer the second, as he had grown into the style more by the time it was written
