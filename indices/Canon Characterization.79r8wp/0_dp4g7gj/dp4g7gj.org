There's not really a summary I know of for this (if you find one I'd be interested in it). However, the most common ways the fandom gets it wrong is:

1) Ron being a horrible friend. He isn't. He's jealous sometimes, yes, and can say the wrong thing at the wrong time that causes a fight, but people dial it up to 11 in fics. At the end of the day, Ron deals with a lot of shit for his friends and he only really blows up 1) under supermagical influence ala Horcrux re walking out on 7 (which he immediately regretted), or 2) Appears he's been lied to (book 4, GoF fight).

2) Hermione's love for authority - stemming from everyone remembering "or worse expelled" from book 1 and nothing else. By 3, we see her using her time-turner in a way that breaks the rules McGonagall set for her (academic only) to do the right thing. By 5, she suggests they start an underground student club that looks suspiciously like rebellion, and enforces it with as close to a blood pact as you can get away with in a school under martial law.

3) Manipulative Dumbledore. In a way, I suppose I can see this, but it tends to employ the most cynical view of Dumbledore's actions - a standard we don't use on most other characters. He's wise, well-meaning, but ultimately a falliable human still carrying scars and weights from the last 2 wars he fought. Did he mess up sometimes? Yes, no one denies that. But at the same time, you can't say he messed up (which implies an accident) and say he did it for some nefarious purpose that requires he messed up. It's an inherent contradiction.

4) Harry - He's really a snarky kid at heart. If you re read the books, he's quippy and mouthy and has something clever to say more oft than not. The humor is really lost on fanfiction as it gets sidelined to focus on other aspects of him.

5) Daphne Greengrass - literally a blank slate we know nothing about. Anything you think you know about her is a lie.
