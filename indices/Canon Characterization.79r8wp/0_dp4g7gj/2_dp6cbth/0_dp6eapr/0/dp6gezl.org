  watching Dumbledore
#+end_quote

He's Dumbledore. He should certainly be able to evade Death Eaters to visit Harry if he chose to. He doesn't even need to go personally, send someone he trusts. Polyjuice exists. Also, Dumbledore has The Invisibility Cloak at this time.

If he wanted to check in on Harry, he could.

#+begin_quote
  its unclear whether it would have held while he was in muggle school.
#+end_quote

If we're serious about Harry's safety, then this alone should disqualify the Dursley house hold. That's ~8 hours a day where he's entirely unprotected, vulnerable to being located magically as well.

2)

Hagrid just has no sense. He's also not qualified to answer any questions Harry might have. Dumbledore/McGonagall at least know that the Dursleys were not informative.

Hagrid is a terrible source of information for Harry when he needs to learn so much about the magical world. /Hagrid forgot to tell Harry about platform 9 3/4/. How many other small but important things would he have forgotten? Or not known about at all?

What about someone who can more delicately explain why Harry is so absurdly famous?

#+begin_quote
  who are they likely to pay attention to? A distinguished professor such as McGonagall or some half giant dropout?
#+end_quote

Hagrid is ten feet tall. Him walking down the street is going to be a spectacle no matter what.

The very first thing that happens when Harry gets to the magical world is that Leaky Cauldron mob scene. They were not keeping Harry's arrival a secret.

If you want to keep it a secret, send someone else. It doesn't have to be a professor. Put a hat on Harry's head and send some random but trustworthy wizard, there you go.

#+begin_quote
  Because the alternative is to hand it to Voldemort on a silver platter

  Where else could he have stored it?
#+end_quote

Huh? Does the Fidelius charm not exist anymore? Put some place under that charm, put the stone in that place, put Dumbledore himself as the secret keeper. Sorry Voldemort, better luck never.

Where have the Flamels had it for the past several centuries? I seriously doubt this is the first time it has occurred to Voldemort that having the Stone would be great. Yet, he didn't steal it before.

#+begin_quote
  Let's be fair here, that was on McGonagall, not Dumbledore.
#+end_quote

True.

Seriously though, that sounds like grounds for dismissal to me. Not too sure how Lucius didn't have McGonagall ruined after that stunt.

#+begin_quote
  What was the right call?
#+end_quote

Dumbledore takes Hermione's Time-Turner and does it himself.

#+begin_quote
  The thing is, it was out of his hand. If you recall in the first timeline, Harry and Hermione already went back (i.e. it's a self contained time-loop) to save past Harry from the Dementors.
#+end_quote

If Dumbledore decided to go himself, the things that helped Harry and Hermione the first time (rock hitting the window, Hermione howling, Harry's patronus) would simply have been different things.

#+begin_quote
  I never said Dumbledore didn't have a plan, or a sneaky one. My contention is that Dumbledore's plans (of which he does not tell Harry all of them), is that they are done in good faith and not some super secret plan to off Harry or what have you.
#+end_quote

So Dumbledore has a plan that he's working towards and takes direct action to ensure certain events happen. He doesn't tell anybody about it even if the plan directly involves them, regardless of what they want. That's called manipulation. Good intentions or not, Dumbledore is manipulative.

Given that Dumbledore knows - or at least heavily suspects- that Harry is a horcrux, we can assume that part of his plan involved Harry dying at least temporarily.

#+begin_quote
  Stopped Voldemort from returning for the 10 years Harry was a child
#+end_quote

I don't recall anything suggesting that Dumbledore has done anything at all to delay Voldemort's return. Voldemort has simply been incapable of it.

#+begin_quote
  Figuring out his secret to immortality?
#+end_quote

Sure, that is admittedly incredibly valuable information. But he kept it entirely to himself.

#+begin_quote
  He didn't destroy a single Horcrux, but he was instrumental in discovering their existence and theorizing what items might be Horcruxes and where they might be hidden. He was the research behind Harry's success, doing the grunt work necessary so Harry might have a chance. He had to delve deep into Voldemort's mind, study his personality and figure him out to do this.
#+end_quote

Fair enough, but again, he decides to keep this information to himself.

#+begin_quote
  Combating Death Eater influence in the Ministry when he doesn't have the gold Malfoy does and only has his reputation? Not as easy as you think and it amazes me more the Ministry wasn't an openly Death Eater stronghold by book 1.
#+end_quote

Frankly, it amazes me that the exact opposite isn't true. These people are marked by some powerful magic that nobody understand, placed by Voldemort himself. Even if they truly believed that Lucius & others were forced into serving Voldemort, what the hell does that Dark Mark do? How can you have people in positions of power when they have something like the Dark Mark on them, possibly ready to influence them at any time?

Voldemort is a wizard so feared that people refuse to speak his name a decade after his death. Associating with him is like associating with Satan himself, to the general public. Death Eaters literally carry his mark. Even if everybody truly believed that they were imperius'd, the people would likely still be outcasts.

Not to mention I find that it is impossible to believe that this "Oh, I was imperius'd!" defense hasn't been used before. I suspect it has been used ever since that curse was invented. There must be some ways of verifying, like Veritaserum.

But this is a digression I suppose, this is more about Rowling's writing now than about Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  Death Eater and Voldemort sneaking in - that's more Voldemort's success than Dumbledore's failure.
#+end_quote

I disagree. Pay attention to who you're hiring. When polyjuice exists, certain standards of identification must be met.

I have a hard time believing there's no way of identifying people who are literally possessed by an evil wraith. /Especially/ when this is the same year that Dumbledore is holding the Philosopher's Stone. He should be completely on guard, and a new Professor is a glaringly obvious place to look. Not to mention those so called "defenses" protecting the Stone.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort revives himself yes. Are you saying Dumbledore should have developed spontaneous omniscience to stop him? Put forth a plan or safeguard you think Voldemort couldn't have beaten, and I'll concede this point.
#+end_quote

How about any safeguards at all?

At the end of the first book, Dumbledore admits to Harry that there are other ways that Voldemort could revive himself. Implying that Dumbledore knows about these ways. Now I'm no wizard, but it seems to me that the remains of close kin is likely to be a pretty important ingredient for rituals/potions. It would be easy for Dumbledore to sabotage them.

I just don't see where Dumbledore has done anything great, as would be expected of a Great Wizard.

#+begin_quote
  Like I said, Dumbledore is well-meaning but things out of his control more often than not force his hand. He has too many hats to wear, so to speak, which is his biggest failing.
#+end_quote

This is a massive failing. He needed to give up some of his positions and focus more on stopping the evil wizard, imo.

I'll agree that he's important in the Wizengamot for fighting the Death Eaters' influence. Why does he need to be Headmaster of Hogwarts?
