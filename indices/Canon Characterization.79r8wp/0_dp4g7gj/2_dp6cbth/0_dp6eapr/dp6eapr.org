1) Not all of Voldemort's Death Eaters were captured. Some were even set free by the Ministry because Imperius Defense. It's not a stretch to assume some of them were watching Dumbledore, searching for their master or simply to get revenge on "the brat who did him in." Now, the blood protection of Lily might work within the Dursley household, but its unclear whether it would have held while he was in muggle school.

2) I'm not sure I understand. Are you saying Hagrid is autistic/retarded/socially inept? He's a bit slow and has an extremely skewed sense of what is and isn't dangerous when it comes to magical creatures, but I don't recall seeing anything that might make him dangerous to Harry or incapable of guiding him into the wizarding world. If we accept the premise from (1) that Dumbledore knows some Death Eaters are still out there and still on the lookout, who are they likely to pay attention to? A distinguished professor such as McGonagall or some half giant dropout?

3) Because the alternative is to hand it to Voldemort on a silver platter and start yet another war while Harry was still woefully underclassed and far too young to handle it. If Voldemort had succeeded in being resurrected during PS, he would have won the war. Hogwarts was the safest place in the world, and the seat of Dumbledore's power. Gringotts was broken into if you recall. Where else could he have stored it? The Ministry which as you yourself noted has Death Eater influence? Who could Dumbledore trust not to succumb to the temptation of using the Stone? I'm not saying it wasn't dangerous to the children or that it was an overstep in his role as an educator, but seeing it in the context of his role as the First Line of Defense against Voldemort, it makes sense.

4) Let's be fair here, that was on McGonagall, not Dumbledore. While it reflects poorly on Dumbledore's choices when his subordinates screw up, it's not his direct action that causes that. One could argue, I suppose, that if this was long-standing policy, he is to blame. However, never again do we hear of a student going into the Forbidden Forest for detention, which hints that this was corrected.

5) The thing is, it was out of his hand. If you recall in the first timeline, Harry and Hermione already went back (i.e. it's a self contained time-loop) to save past Harry from the Dementors. Now, we might assign some blame to Dumbledore for this, sure, but had he forbidden them to go Harry would have died anyway. What was the right call?

I never said Dumbledore didn't have a plan, or a sneaky one. My contention is that Dumbledore's plans (of which he does not tell Harry all of them), is that they are done in good faith and not some super secret plan to off Harry or what have you.

What has he done right: Gee, I don't know. Stopped Voldemort from returning for the 10 years Harry was a child? Figuring out his secret to immortality? Combating Death Eater influence in the Ministry when he doesn't have the gold Malfoy does and only has his reputation? Not as easy as you think and it amazes me more the Ministry wasn't an openly Death Eater stronghold by book 1.

Also, Malfoy's influence on Fudge only eclipses Dumbledore's by book 5, if you recall, when the Minister refuses to acknowledge Voldemort's revival and by then Fudge was on his way out.

He didn't destroy a single Horcrux, but he was instrumental in discovering their existence and theorizing what items might be Horcruxes and where they might be hidden. He was the research behind Harry's success, doing the grunt work necessary so Harry might have a chance. He had to delve deep into Voldemort's mind, study his personality and figure him out to do this.

Death Eater and Voldemort sneaking in - that's more Voldemort's success than Dumbledore's failure. The curse on the DADA makes it impossible for Dumbledore to have a person he can trust in the position for long, but at the same time he can't /not/ fill the position. It was a glaring gap in his defense that Voldemort exploited time and again, but with no real way to fix it. Do you suppose he had a plethora of skilled candidates lining up every year when he's had to replace each one at the end of a year for decades on end? Word gets around, and no one wants to suffer.

Voldemort revives himself yes. Are you saying Dumbledore should have developed spontaneous omniscience to stop him? Put forth a plan or safeguard you think Voldemort couldn't have beaten, and I'll concede this point.

Etc, etc.

Like I said, Dumbledore is well-meaning but things out of his control more often than not force his hand. He has too many hats to wear, so to speak, which is his biggest failing.
