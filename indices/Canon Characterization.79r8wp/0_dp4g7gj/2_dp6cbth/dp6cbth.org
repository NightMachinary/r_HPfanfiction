The problem with Dumbledore is that he's sort of presented as this ultimate, hyper competent wizard. Or at least I feel like that's how readers want to view him.

It is very hard to think of him this way when the mistakes he makes seem to be so.. horribly stupid.

Some off the top of my head

- How can you possibly justify not checking directly in on Harry throughout his childhood? Some random lady living across the street is not enough.

- Hagrid can hardly function on his own, what on earth are you doing sending him to introduce Harry Potter to the wizarding world?

- Again, how can you possibly justify keeping the Philosopher's Stone in Hogwarts?

- Detention in the forbidden forest? What the fuck? Hagrid can't even reliably use magic, not to mention that /he split their group up/, leaving two children alone in the forest at night.

- The man literally sent two 13 year old children on a time travelling mission to rescue Sirius Black, fully knowing that a horde of Dementors and a werewolf were involved. What. The. Fuck.

There are many, many more.

Now, assuming that Dumbledore isn't legitimately senile, how could he possibly make "mistakes" like those above?

It's much easier to say that Dumbledore knows what he's doing and that he has some sort of sneaky plan he's working on.

I could be being overly cynical here, but what has Dumbledore really done /right/? At least, since the fall of Voldemort.

Lucius Malfoy has a powerful influence on Fudge.

He hasn't destroyed a single Horcrux.

Voldemort successfully revives himself.

He's had a Death Eater and /Voldemort himself/ sneak into the school for the full year disguised as teachers, without knowing about it.

Etc, etc.
