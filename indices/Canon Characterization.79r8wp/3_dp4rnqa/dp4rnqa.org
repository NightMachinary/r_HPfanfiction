Hermione isn't this amazing character that is perfect and the only one at fault is Ron; that's not true at all.

I've read quite a few stories where Hermione seems to be perfect in every way while Ron is the failure, which while Ron was jealous, and he did often want Hermione to help him with homework and stuff like that, he wasn't as bad as fanfiction often portrays him to be. And Hermione isn't as amazing as she's often portrayed to be in fanfiction either. I see that a lot in fanfiction.

Evil/Manipulative Dumbledore! While Dumbledore did hide things, he clearly cared for Harry and co; he isn't evil, while he might be a bit manipulative he's nowhere like he is often seen as in fanfiction.

Draco isn't a good guy; he looks up to his father and thinks that Muggles/Muggleborns ect extra are beneath him. It isn't until later that he's uncertain of everything. But even then he's not a good guy that loves Muggles/Muggleborns. I like redemption Draco stories as much as the next person but he was a right jerk to people because of his name, his believes and his money.

As others have said we only heard about Daphne once; I hate the Ice princess/Ice Queen persona fanfiction has given her, that's not how I view her at all. The fact that so many fanfiction writers write her that way is disheartening.

Harry isn't an all powerful being; his best class was Defence Against the Dark Arts, but he wasn't all powerful like so many fanfictions tend to write him. And he wasn't that interested in girls either, he was interested in Cho but that was it until Ginny. He wasn't interested in multiple girls or whatever as I sometime see him written as.

Molly and Ginny aren't manipulative, they aren't trying to force Harry to marry Ginny or anything like that like some early fanfictions wrote them as doing.

Severus is sarcastic, rude and can be rather cruel/harsh at times. He's had a rough time but we don't see him act in a friendly manner. He's always cunning or thinking ahead or trying to keep himself and others alive. Some people write him nicer then he was, and while I can understand since he's difficult to write that's not how he was.

Luna: While she did have weird moments she did have good moments as well. She was the one to talk to Harry after Sirius died, she was the one to realize it was him under a polyjuice potion. She had a few creatures that she believed in, not a bunch of crazy sounding creatures; I've read a couple of stories where she had a bunch Or where they made her too crazy.
