A lot of people seem to get angry that Dumbledore wasn't some all knowing guy. A lot of people within the story and as readers see Dumbledore with the same hero worship some have for their parents when they are young. Finding out he's a fallible human like the rest of us almost feels like a betrayal.

But Dumbledore is just a fallible human like the rest of us. He's capable of mistakes and has deep regrets. He keeps up a persona because a lot of people in the wizarding world put all their faith in him (I think there's some arrogance/pride in there too). If people find out he's a lonely old man who doesn't have all the answers, half the wizarding world would have their entire world view shaken.
