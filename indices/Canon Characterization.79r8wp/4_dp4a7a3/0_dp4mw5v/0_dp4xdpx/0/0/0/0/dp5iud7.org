It doesn't take a lot of hindsight, say, to realise - with a year to think about it, that hey, if you are going to die, you should do a little more than leave cryptic hints for the three kids you want to win the war. Or that you shouldn't play stupid games and instead of passing them items after your death, when you can't protect them any more, give them the items beforehand, when no one in the Ministry will stop you, and train and teach them as much as possible to prepare them.
