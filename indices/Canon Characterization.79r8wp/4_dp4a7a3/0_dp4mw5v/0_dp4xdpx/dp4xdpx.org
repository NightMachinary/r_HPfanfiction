So... you honestly think Dumbledore was as useless as he had to be in the books to allow Harry be the hero? That all adults didn't give a damn about Harry when he was ostracised and bullied? That Dumbledore couldn't think of a way to take harry and co aside and simply tell the kids what they needed to know, instead of leaving cryptic hints?
