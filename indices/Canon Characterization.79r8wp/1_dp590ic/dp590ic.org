Harry Potter - Bit Snarky, bit angsty, bit afraid, bit confident. Fan fics basically pick one of the traits and expand on it.

Hermione - Not a teacher's pet as some fics portray(3rd year onwards). But definitely very intelligent.

Ron - Typical teenager with a bit of jealousy issues. But definitely good friend.

Dumbledore - a flawed good man who made a few mistakes while carrying all the burden.

Molly - a doting mother who just wishes the best for her son's/daughter(including honourary ones). But she is a bit of a bossy mother.

Luna - not a seer, not lunatic. Just a bit odd.

Ginny - definitely not a blushing idiot or Boy who lived fanatic 4/5th book onwards.

Snape - Not a good person on surface, but definitely one by heart.

Sirius - A person who lost his life to betrayals and never really recovered, with the exception of his time spent with Harry.
