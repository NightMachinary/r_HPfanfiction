Percy being a douche. He does like rules, I'll give you that, but his falling out with the rest of the family was their fault as much as it was his, he never saw any of the proof that Harry had for any of his claims, and the reason why he went for a job in the ministry was that he hoped it would allow him to help people at some point. In a way that many people do not grasp, he is a quintessential gryffindor.

Also, Ron has quite a dark sense of humour. If anyone of the trio would throw gallows jokes, it's most likely to be him (though Harry could do it too, if pushed a bit).
