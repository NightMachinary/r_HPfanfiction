I like a lot of what's been pointed out, especially smellinawin's post. In terms of convenience, there'd probably be a lot of spells that'd weird us out.

Then again, I think people put too much importance to magical people being inherently different. Humans are humans, no matter what. From my perspective, magical society would logically need to be /more/ advanced than its Muggle counterpart if not for Rowling's need to familiarise the audience with known concepts.
