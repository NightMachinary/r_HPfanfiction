I doubt their would be a magical Britain. Magic users can literally teleport anywhere in the world at a thought.

Why would their be doors for most buildings. or even physical locations for buildings if they can teleport and fold space.

Their clothes would be amazing. Able to change with a thought. Able to think for themselves. Protect from any elements, look like you are wearing flowing lava.

Potions to enhance the user, physically and mentally. Also people would love to "accidentally" make cat girl hybrids like Hermione in book 2.

Transfiguration to literally create anything your mind can come up with. Try imagining what Lunas room could look like if she was allowed full control of matter to decorate with.

They can make brooms fly, why walk anywhere.

Bathrooms? I don't think so. spells to vanish waste while it's still inside you.

Glamours, you can literally look any way you want to with an illusion. Tonks' crazy changing hair should be on the tame side of things.

Hogwarts should be able to be made of anything, like diamond and obsidian rather than plain stone.

Magical animals /pets would be a lot more prevalent rather then oh hey an owl and a cat.

Other magical sentient races would be super alien. There is absolutely no way goblins would be in business suits running a bank.
