It's not /that/ different from canon, but I felt like [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]]'s [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/Victoria-Potter][Victoria Potter]] really put the magic back in the magical world. And it's not drastic differences like elaborate druidic pagan festivals and rituals like you see in some fics. It's little things like a Clue/Cluedo-style game where the clues give you visions and the Restricted Section being so magical that it's a labyrinth you can get lost in. Small details like that used well can really immerse you in world that feels very alien while still being pretty relatable.
