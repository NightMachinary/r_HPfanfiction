In my experience it wasn't that angsty or edgy. At first it can seem like it's over-the-top in how aristocratic Harry and Hermione act, but there's layers to the formality of the wizarding world in this fic. It has some moments where the focus on Hermione is all the angst as she muses on her position as an object, but those are only moments in the larger picture. The worldbuilding is seriously thick, right down to the levels of formality, ancient traditions, magical Jamaica and magical Bulgaria, and rituals calling on old gods. Forget the plot, forget the emotions of the characters, t's a great read just for absorbing all the worldbuilding.

Honestly, I had to drop it a little after chapter 50, "The Year of Discovery". It's sex. Sixth year at Hogwarts is apparently the time to have constant orgies, and it's made out to be a ridiculously well-known tradition in the wizarding world. Harry struggles with constant invitations to threesomes, while Gildroy Lockhart has trouble keeping the sixth-year girls off him. His entire character background is redone and he's semi-competent while being terribly clumsy, actually, which is a great touch.
