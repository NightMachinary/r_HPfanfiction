Angsty? Patron? I suppose you could argue that the process of getting Harry and Hermione together is /slightly/ so but that doesn't really take long to resolve, and it's far more romance than angst.

The big thing I should have mentioned in my previous post is that because magic is so much more obvious, it becomes more about how well you do it. In canon, Harry is amazed that magic is possible at all. In this story, everyone takes it for granted but is always out to impress others with their skill.
