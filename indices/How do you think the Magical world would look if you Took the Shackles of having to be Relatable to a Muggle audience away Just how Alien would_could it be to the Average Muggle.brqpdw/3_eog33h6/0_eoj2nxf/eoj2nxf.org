The one thing that never made sense to me about Patron was that Voldemort and his revolutionaries were still a thing. Given that Purebloods were legally a higher caste than Halfbloods and Muggleborns, had a monopoly on political power and most wealth, actual Muggleborns made up less than 1% of the population and were magically bound to serve prominent Pureblood families there doesn't seem to actually be much of a political grievance for the Death Eaters to be motivated by.

In the canonical series Muggleborns had equal status to Purebloods legally, occupied high positions within the Ministry, had real influence over the culture and composed as much as 10% of the population. For traditionalist Pureblood who's bloodlines were decaying and influence was on the decline it made sense that there was some dissatisfaction to exploit for followers. But changing all those details and the political realities of the series in your world building and expecting the central conflict to stay the same seems lazy and inconsistent.

Patron is a cool story otherwise but the more I think about it the more it bugs me.
