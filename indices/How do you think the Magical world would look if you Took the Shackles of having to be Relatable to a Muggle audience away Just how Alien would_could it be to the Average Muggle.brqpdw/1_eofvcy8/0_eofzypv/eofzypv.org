Can you Imagen Voldemort getting a similar punishment to what Salem got in that show ?

Voldemort being sentenced to spend a 100 years as a talking cat for trying to take over the Magical Britain/The world. Cursed so he cant hurt anything and then Kept by Dumbledore at a Pet as a visible symbol to all Future Hogwarts students.
