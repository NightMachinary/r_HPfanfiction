I like stories where the Wizarding world is made up in a more traditional fantasy manner. When they have different religions, customs, heck I remember a fanfic where they traveled around the world through something akin to Yggdrassil. And its most interesting when they interact with Muggles in such stories, they really feel like a distinct civilization rather than a comic relief who doesnt know about electricity and cant dress properly.

One thing I dont think I ever saw in fanon is Wizard dialects. I assume their form of English might be a bit different, given they split around the 1700s, in such a complete manner.
