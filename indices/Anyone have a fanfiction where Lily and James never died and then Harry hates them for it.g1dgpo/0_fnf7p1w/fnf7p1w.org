I remember the story but I can't figure out which one it is. I'll keep looking. If i remember correctly they followed Dumbledore's advice and pretended to be dead and then come forward once harry is in Hogwarts and are surprised that Harry won't forgive them. Harry quite appropriately blames them for the hell he went through at the Dursleys and wants nothing to do with them.
