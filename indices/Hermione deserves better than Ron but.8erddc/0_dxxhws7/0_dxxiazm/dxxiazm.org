I mean, you can make an argument that Harry and Hermione wouldn't work that well in a romantic relationship, and although personally I disagree with that. But even those people wouldn't argue that Hermione doesn't deserve Harry. After Lily, she is the one who made the biggest and most sacrifices for him. If Hermione doesn't deserve Harry, no one would.
