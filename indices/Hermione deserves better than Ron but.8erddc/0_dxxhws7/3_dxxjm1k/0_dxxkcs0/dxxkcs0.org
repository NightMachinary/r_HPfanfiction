She was the one person who contributed most to Harry's success (after Harry obviously). Not Dumbledore, not Ron, not Daphne, Ginny or Fleur. It was Hermione who set a teacher on fire for her friend, who led Umbridge into a Centaur gang rape, who stayed with him when no one else did. Yes, she might not be the most pleasant person to be around, but there isn't a single instance where someone else stood with Harry when she did not (literally no one cared about Death Eater Malfoy and Black did in fact send the broom).
