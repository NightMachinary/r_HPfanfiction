Yes. Daphne is confirmed as a pureblood witch of a rich family. And that is it. Thats all of the character there is. So the blank slate has a title and subtitle on the character sheet. Doesn't change the fact that she remains blank in everything that makes a character a character.

For all of Hermione's shortcomings and obnoxious traits, she is still the one who always stood by Harry, always looked out for him, always held his banner high, always walked the most challenging, deadliest paths with him. Even the one time she "betrayed" Harry's trust she did it out of concern for him. She was even right about it. It was just that nobody knew Sirius Black wasn't actually out to kill Harry.

If you're the type of person who throws away a friend who has gone above and beyond for you - even followed you into situations of mortal danger, because she sometimes nags you to do your homework, then you probably don't deserve such a friend anyway.
