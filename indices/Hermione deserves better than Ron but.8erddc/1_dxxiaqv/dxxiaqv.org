I have no problems with Ron/Hermione, and what do you mean with not good enough? 'Not good enough' is not a real criterion, isn't it? If it weren't Ron, I can imagine Hermione together with an OC Muggle, or Muggle-born. I can't think of another canon character together with her.

Regarding Harry, I don't think he's compatible with either Fleur, Daphne, or Tonks. Regarding Harry/Hermione, the books make it quite obvious that Harry never was attracted to her romatically. The two of them have been great friends, with ups and downs, but there never were any romantic feelings from both sides.
