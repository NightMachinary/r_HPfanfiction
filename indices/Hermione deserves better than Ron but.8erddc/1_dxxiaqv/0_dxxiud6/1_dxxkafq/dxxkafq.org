It's not that I think it'll change your preconceived opinion, [[http://www.sugarquill.net/index.php?action=goodshiprh&st=keeperofherheart][here]] is a study written in 2004 researching the relationship between Ron and Hermione based on book 1-5. It's even written much better than I could ever have done it, and I fully agree with the study, even if you think it makes me an unsuspecting idiot.

Apparently, you're assuming that Ron's insecurities have nothing to do with the Horcrux he's wearing around his neck.
