The books also made it clear that Ron and Hermione were just one or two steps away from murdering each other. Realistically speaking, after the war Ron acted in PoA and GoF, there would be a deluge tearing down the bridge, not just some water under it. Yes, people change, but Hermione isn't really the forgiving type (just ask Crouch Sr).

Edit: The books, even DH also make it very clear that they are still incompatible, even after Ron grew up some. In the middle of a civil war, his biggest worry was that Harry fucked Hermione, not the Hitler ripoff brutally murdering his entire family. That is definitely not love.
