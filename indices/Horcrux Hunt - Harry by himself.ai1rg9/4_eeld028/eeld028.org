I don't remember if any of these have bashing.

linkffn(Harry Potter & Death's Ultimatum by White Angel of Auralon).

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Mask of Loki by Marcus S. Lazarus). Too many songs and comic book/TV characters for my taste.

I also remember one story in which Harry goes back to Privet Drive after Ron & Hermione leave him, and gets help from Kreacher, but I don't remember the name.
