SO EXCELLENT. The Blurb: Yet another one of those Harry And Draco Are Forced To Be Together By Something Beyond Their Control And Then Stuff Happens Leading To Twoo Wuv stories. Because every HD writer has to write at least one. [Finished]

Seriously, I've reread this one for YEARS. They're forced to be in close proximity and it's SO realistic and lovely and never feels forced at all.
