Absolutely not. First, almost no character isn't OOC in that story. Characterization is generally a weak point of the author, resorting to clich√©s when portraying female and/or non-english characters. Also, the militarism in that story goes well beyond the odd cheesy reference, I'd even go as far as calling it a glorification of child soldiers. And the violence and torture is way over the top.

Here are some seventh year stories that I liked. All of them are from Ginny's point of view, The Changeling is slightly AU with Ginny in Slytherin. linkffn(11419408; 6919395; 8078750)
