I know what you mean, I just finished the first two novels. When reading them, I stayed up way too late and had to drink way too much coffee to get through the day. I couldn't help but wanting to know how each story ended. I only found out after that there are a multitude of sites in contention over the author, making me want to shake my head vigorously in the attempt to rid some of the gut-wrenching scenes out of my head. Obviously that won't work, so I'm off to read some of the other fics listed here to forget what I just read. Maybe even reread Deathly Hallows so I can look more closely at Snape as a character.
