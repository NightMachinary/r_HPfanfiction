The one dynamic I could see happening in 8th year would be a lot of students in Gryffindor/Ravenclaw/Hufflepuff wanting revenge against Slytherin house for the shit they were put through the prior year. As symbols of the victors Hermione and Harry would naturally be thrust into the middle of mediating the conflict If they were Head Boy and Girl this would become an even bigger issue that they would have to deal with.

It could even be integrated into the things you mentioned Hermione and Harry would be dealing with as everyone in the castle will be damaged in some way.
