Unless they get together right away, a very easy source of conflict & drama could come from several girls having their sights set on HP, and HG trying to negotiate her own feelings with fears she is too late to actually get him. I mean, Harry at that point is probably more popular than Dumbledore was after he beat Grindelwald (voldemort was terrorizung them on their own soil, after all), so it would not be unrealistic for him to attract a lot of romantic attention.

Conversely, if you decide to veer away from the relationship drama, there could be a lot of fallout from the Muggleborn Registration stuff Umbridge supervised in Year 7. Muggleborns traumatized/"disappeared", orphaned teens out for revenge, purebloods resentful at giving reparations. HP and HG, given their personal backgrounds (muggle raised/born AND wizarding saviors) would be seen by both sides as their champion, which could make for a lot of uncomfortable decisions about who to support.
