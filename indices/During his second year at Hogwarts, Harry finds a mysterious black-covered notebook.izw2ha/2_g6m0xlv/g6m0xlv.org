Harry thinks for a second, and picks up the notebook. 'Voldemort', he writes.

Of course, nothing happens, as that is both not his real name and Harry didn't picture his face as he did it.

Alternatively, Harry does picture his face (after seeing it in year one), but it's still not his real name, and nothing happens.

Alternate alternative, as it is what he is most known by- and what he chooses to go by- the notebook actually kills Voldemort. Except, wait, no it doesn't. All volde-pieces are still horcruces.

Alternately, an alternative to the alternative, Ginny is killed as she is currently possessed by Voldemort.

Alternate (x4), all the horcruces are destroyed/killed. This includes Harry, who doesn't get to come back because Voldemort didn't use him in the resurrection ritual or kill Harry himself.

Alternafive, all the horcruces are destroyed/killed. Woohoo! The day is saved!

Sixternative, all the horcruces are destroyed/killed. This leaves room for the new villain of our series, _______.

As you can see, going off of this, there's a 1/6 chance (probably less than that, I doubt I thought of all the ways it could go) that this saves the day. 1/6 chance that this leads to a new story, 4/6 chance that it just leads to ruin or nothing. 3/6 if you don't count Ginny dying as ruin.
