Harry looks at the book in his hand. Another diary? But as he turns it over, no name is scrawled on the inside or the cover. He hesitantly opens the book.

/The human whose name is written in this note shall die/

/Huh/ Harry thinks. He picks up his quill, and writes

/Tom Marvolo Riddle/

before flinching, and looking around wildly. It'd felt like someone had poked him in the forehead with a sewing needle really hard, but noone was around. Also, he was still covered in the Cloak.

Seeing nothing, he looks on the lone name in the book, and a lightbulb seems to go off in his head. He snaps the book closed, before running to the library and grabbing the Prophet from 1981, as well as /Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts/. Then, he returns to his room and throws the invisibility cloak over himself once more. Opening up the book again, he looks at the article detailing the Death Eater trials.

/Bellatrix Lestrange/ he writes.

/Rodolphus Lestrange/

/Rabastan Lestrange/

/Barty Crouch Jr./

/Lucius Malfoy/

...

He finishes several hours later. All convicted Death Eaters, as well as those who very obviously bribed themselves out of it, were now written in the note, as well as Voldemort himself and various major Dark Lords of the last centuries.

When he awakes the next day, everyone looks at the Prophet in shock.

/Mass Murder shakes the Wizarding World!/

/Early this morning, various prominent members of our society woke up dead! The Aurors are hot on the case.../

Harry smiles, but deep down he's disturbed. As soon as the meal finishes, he slips around a corner and veils himself in the invisibility cloak. Creeping into the second floor loo, he hisses the silibant tongue of serpents at a sink, then vanishes into the appearing passage.

Once down, he shudders as he beholds the dead Basilisk, which appears as fresh as when he'd killed it, and severs one of its teeth with a reductor charm that snaps it off at the base.

With one smooth motion, he brings it down on the notebook, which immediately bursts into blazing, white flames. They attempt to grab at him - but are repelled by the Cloak. He legs it, hissing at the inner chamber door to close, then quickly clambers up the slide's back wall, which has a crude ladder etched into it.

/"close"/ he hisses, and the sink slides into place, cutting off the acrid smoke coming from below.
