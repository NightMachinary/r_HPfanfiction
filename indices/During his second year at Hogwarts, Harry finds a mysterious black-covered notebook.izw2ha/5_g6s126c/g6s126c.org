Harry's not really sure what to think. He's come across a multitude of little ominous things here and there in Hogwarts - it was part of the charm, really. People always talked about the strange charm of a skull that made a neat tune in the wind that they found in the hall, or how they found a map leading to the fabled Chamber of Secrets.

That last one was gaining lots of traction, really. It was annoying and heartbreaking at the same time, how everyone stared at him in the Hall when somebody said it.

This one didn't seem like those, though. It had to be a really stupid prank, because it was oddly detailed. Pages of rules, talks of /multiple,/ he just didn't really understand. Why would anyone go through the effort? It seemed dumb, and he couldn't even tell if there was anything magical in it.

He even asked Hermione - who he knew had been studying ahead for things like Ancient Runes and that sorta stuff - and she didn't find anything. It wouldn't hurt to try, though, would it? Well, of course it would. Harry didn't want to kill anyone, after all.

But who would he never miss? Well, Voldemort. But Harry didn't know his face, did he? He knew that warped thing on the back of Quirrel's head, but it wasn't a face, not with any recognizable features .. Just a twisted pair of lips and beady, red eyes not even like a snake.

He tried anyway. /'Voldemort'/ was scribbled down.

Then .. you know what? Harry had quite the thought. He knew a man he hated quite a bit, that he'd like to see in a grave. But it wouldn't be any skin off his back if he didn't die.

Harry wasn't allowed to go to the funeral, of course. Not that he wanted to. He was in a foul mood already, the rain pouring outside the Knight Bus, making an even more horrid racket. Heart disease finally claimed him, or so Petunia said, quietly. As if she was afraid. He didn't like the feeling that gave him much.

Of course, Harry didn't think it was because of the Death Note. Even if he kept it in his bag, it seemed ridiculous. Even in a world of magic, who could kill someone just by writing down their name? Not even Voldemort could do that.

He'd very well know. Last year had marked a confrontation with the younger Dark Lord, who went by Tom Riddle. The spirit was almost frustrated with him, with the way Harry was reluctant to speak to him at all. The odd black notebook had almost given him a sense of caution with those sorts of things.

Harry didn't know why it was so important, all of a sudden. But the bus stopped, and he was shot straight out of his thoughts. Quickly, he picked up all of his belongings and got going. He gripped the handle of his trunk, and quickly ran through the rain into the Leaky Cauldron.

But he was eager to know what had happened in the wizarding world since he had been locked away at the Dursley's, remembering harsher times where there wasn't any hope in a dark cupboard. The pub was oddly silent after his entering, as if preparing for something. He wasn't used to it, being Harry Potter.

He picked up the Daily Prophet quickly. The crazed face of Sirius Black greeted him. He read on and on, dread growing. The reason for the death of James and Lily Potter, the newspaper said. The columns went on and on, winding in his head. The death of innocent muggles, Voldemort's very right hand ..

In a dark corner of the Cauldron, Harry scribbled furiously into a notebook, making a name in inky script.

Out in the mild wilderness of Surrey, a black unkempt dog froze in place, and fell limp. It never woke up again, and no one would ever find its body until a few days later, when it stank of rot.
