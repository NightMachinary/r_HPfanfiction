I gently encourage you to stick with shorter stories for now.

I personally am rather methodical with my writing, and it's worked well for me. Either way, try to work on your story before you begin writing it out. Think about such things as logic, pacing, and characters.

Most novice authors' language is wishy-washy. Too many filler words, adverbs, long sentences etc. Try to keep an eye on words like 'that, seemed, appeared, very' and so on. You can usually cut about 90% of those.

Concerning language, try to give different characters different voices (the way they speak and use language levels). Hermione, for example, speaks distinctively different than Ron.

Also, if you're working with a third person narrator, try to keep his voice sharp, crisp. Experiments with the narrating voice are thrilling but, more often than not, failed acts of bravery. Personal narrators, likewise, have many pitfalls.

Other general tips: your story should start out extremely strong. The first chapter needs to be at least the second best you'll ever write or, in case in a shorter story, your first two paragraphs.

The ending should, somehow, reference your beginning. This, for example, is why most fanfiction authors fail with longer stories; it's difficult to keep up coherence with earlier chapters if you haven't planned it out perfectly (which most don't even bother to attempt).

Also, as depressing as it is, stories you've thought of but haven't written down don't count for anything. It's as simple as that. It's better to write down a bad story than to unendingly think out a decent one.

Lastly, as many have already said, virtually all stories (even those of professional authors) are rubbish when first written down. That's why they have other authors, editors, and friends who give opinion and such. Since you're unlikely to go to such lengths when writing fanfiction, it's advisable to get a bit of distance (i.e. don't look at your story for a while: 2-3 days at the very least), before you make your final verdict.
