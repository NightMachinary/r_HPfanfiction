I read your one-shot. It's interesting, better than most. I'll write my opinion on it here.

â€‹

I can't comment that much on the plot (since it was a one-shot), the pacing however was excelent. You didn't rush it (as I've seen a lot of newer writers do).

The narration was good, except for the scene where Harry is explaining how he got "killed" by Voldemort. You reffer to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley as mum and dad even though the story is narrated by a third-person omniscient narrator.

Do not underestimate punctuation. It may not seem all that important, but lack of proper punctuation can tire a reader overtime. You tried, but you could do better.

There are other minor mistakes, but it would be nitpicking to point all of them out. In general, try not to fudge up the grammar/syntax, eat words or confuse similar sounding words (ex: were/where, their/there). Also, I didn't notice it in your story, but the letter " i " is actually capitalized when it's by it self (" I ") even if it's not in the start of a sentence. Minor mistakes like these add up over time and can push readers away regardless of the quality of your plot.
