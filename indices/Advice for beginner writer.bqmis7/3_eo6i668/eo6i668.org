A lot of the advice here is good, especially [[/u/ceplma][u/ceplma]] 's advice regarding writing in general. In terms of writing longer fics, I'd say there's two good strategies for avoiding plot holes: either outline everything out in advance, then release chapters as they are ready -- this is the strategy that I'm using for my Chessmaster series -- or write wherever the story takes you, and wait to post it until it is does -- which is a strategy I'm using for one of my side projects. Both are valid, as is a mix between the two. Do whatever works well for you, and regardless of which writing strategy to use, I would highly recommend keeping one (or more) separate documents for keeping track of your plot points, characters, world building, etc.

Hope this helps! Happy writing :)
