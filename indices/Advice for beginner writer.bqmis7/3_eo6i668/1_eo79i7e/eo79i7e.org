Let me just comment on the first strategy. Yes, I am really bad with outlining (to me story mostly comes as I keep writing, so I truly don't know how exactly it ends until I almost write it down), which is my problem, but I am still wary of that strategy. In the old world of typewriters and paper (or even before that in the world of ink and papers) this was known as serialized writing and whole novels were published like that. Many famous novels by Alexander Dumas were written in this way including The Three Musketeers. In almost all cases, quality of writing suffered greatly by this methodology. Although he was the absolute master of dialogue and storytelling, so The Three Musketeers is a page-turner even after all these years, taken from the larger distance, the book is collection of plot-holes, storylines running nowhere, vacant space obviously caused by search of the new plot-line, etc. (it didn't help he fought about the very style of the novel with his ghostwriter; and let not me start on the utility of characters like Grimaud; and yes, the similarity to JKR is obvious). And of course, it is another piece of evidence that captive story is more important than details.

Michael Crichton is said to declare somewhere “Books aren't written - they're rewritten. Including your own. It is one of the hardest things to accept, especially after the seventh rewrite hasn't quite done it.” (although the origin of the saying [[https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/12/14/rewritten/][is a way more complicated]]). I believe for almost every serialized novel putting it down and rewriting would help (although, apparently Dumas' temperament did not allow him to do very good job of it, he tried with Three Musketeers and the result was not much better).

In summary: I tried to write my novel in this style and I had to give up after the fifth chapter, when it was obvious the thing needs complete rewrite.
