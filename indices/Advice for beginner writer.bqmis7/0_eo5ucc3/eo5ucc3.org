Concerning plotholes ... do you know how many of them are in JKR's novels? Yes, you know. Is she one of the most successful writers of all times? Yes, she is. Case closed.

What really matters is the story. Yes, it should be consistent, but reader will survive even Remus Lupin forgetting it is a full moon night (think about it; how probable it is?), if the story is captivating enough.

When you have an idea, sit down write it down. Let it stew for two weeks (so you mostly forget what it is about), then read it again. Do you like it as it is? Publish it! Do you know how to correct it? Do so! Are you bored? Drop it! Lather, rinse, repeat.

Read [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1877741094][this]]. Morale of the essay is: write, write, write. Don't correct yourself and produce more stories. If you write 52 stories a year, one of them should be readable (that's for professional writers, of course, if it is your hobby you do along The Real Life, numbers are smaller, i.e. you need more years to write that one good story).
