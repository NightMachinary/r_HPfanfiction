I used to be the same way and you get bogged down in minute details. What really helped me was thinking about events in the context of what's important to the story. What moves the story forward or develops the character? Is it important to detail what the character has for breakfast? Maybe not. But, if you use it as an example of illustrating what a picky eater they are in order to flesh out the character, maybe. Having a firm idea of the story you're aiming to tell will help a lot in this respect.

Good luck and have fun!
