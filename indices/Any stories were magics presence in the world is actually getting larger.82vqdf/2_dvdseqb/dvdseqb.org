The the backstory for my fic, most muggleborns have a squib ancestor, but a muggle bloodline can develop magic if exposed to it for long periods of time (as in generations), so in places where there are large numbers of wizards and muggles living together, there will eventually be more muggleborns than muggles or purebloods/halfbloods. And it doesn't have to be wizardkind either. If a family of muggles were to settle in a highly magical location, muggleborns would pop up after a few generations.
