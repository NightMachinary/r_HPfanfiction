Well, this /kind of/ fits. Linkffn (11251745). Linkffn (11761312). Fair warning, this will contain MAJOR spoilers.

[Magic has some very feminine qualities to it, but this has been on the decline for hundreds of years at least. Magic with feminine roots has grown a reputation as black magic for various reasons that are all bullshit. Because of this, magic in general is in decline, the world over. This manifests itself in either dark magic becoming more common, or magic itself becoming less common in general.

Fem!Harry and Hermione (who are in a relationship) are part of a prophecy that they will return the feminine magic to the world, and thus somewhat "save" magic. For example, there are pagan rituals that are regularly performed in the story, usually in the Forbidden Forest, that restore the Forest to its original state. It is no longer dark and decrepid and dangerous, but flowery and sunny, etc.

There is an epilogue chapter which takes place around 2012 (I think), in which it is remarked that Jasmine (Harry) and Hermione are two of the more important people in the world because of what they are doing/have done for the magical communities (though they aren't without opposition).](/spoiler)

The way I'm describing this doesn't really do the story justice, in case you plan on reading it. It sounds a little odd, but it is a really excellent fic. Also, read linkffn(Yule Ball Panic) first before you read The Power of Love (if you do).

EDIT: Why isn't the spoiler tag working?
