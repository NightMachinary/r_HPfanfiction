I recently read a hp/avatar crossover where magic is explained as the lifeforce of the planet, leylines spread out through the planet, and give off ambient magic, muggleborns are only born when they are born and raised over leylines. Wizards and witches (and anything else capable of using magic) produces miniscule amounts of ambient magic thenselves when they are "full" of magic. (Think full cores that overflow)

So lets explore that; ambient magic/magical surroundings =magical babies. Muggleborns leaves the wizarding world because of the bigotry and settles in Britain. Those muggleborns cant use magic infront of their non-magical friends so they dont use up the magic they produce so they constantly "overflow" and put out ambient magic in their surroundings. The more muggleborns that leave britain and live close to each other, the bigger areas have a influx in ambient magic that will result in magical babies for the neighbors. As this keeps happening for multiple generations, with more and more muggleborns not living in wizarding areas, the more muggleborns are born. This would have an escalating effect as there is more and more ambient magic produced and not used up. I can see this also effecting nearby plants and animals resulting in more magical plants and creatures beeing born. Edited for misspellings.
