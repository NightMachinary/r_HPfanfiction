  Also feel free to have a discussion over what might cause an explosion in the population of muggleborns in the comments...

Well, alrighty. By the way, on this subreddit you can edit the text of your flairs. Neat, huh?

You could pick the orange of Discussion and retitle it Request, or take the dark blue you have now and relabel it Discussion, or just type out Request/Discussion in the flair's text field...

--------------

In any case, causes of explosion of the muggleborn population; one possibility I came up with once tied into how there's so many magical races in Harry Potter (centaurs, goblins, merfolk, elves, veela, giants, etc-etc) but only one non-magical one, humans.

The idea was that magic was intrinsically tied to intelligence (so, more psionic than magic); all sapient creatures have the potential for magic, with lesser creatures (flobberworms, horklumps, all the way up to dragons) being supported by the magical 'residue' that sapients give off.

The reason that the vast majority of humans don't have magic in this scenario, is because of a powerful blood curse, cast by the first and only dark wizard to ever conquer the world; the last king of Atlantis, Ubara (I made that up), who used the original dark magic, which stripped magic out of people and rendered them squibs, to bring down his enemies.

As well as destabilising civilization worldwide, returning it to the levels of ancient technology we know of in history, this dark magic persisted in the bloodlines of humans, causing their future generations to be born without magic; muggleborns are those humans who, for whatever reason (dilution, natural immunity, love-power, etc) were born without the curse present in their blood.

So, the cause for a muggleborn population explosion is simple; after several hundred generations of humans, spread across the entire planet, Ubara's Ravager no longer possesses the power to sustain itself; within the next few generations of humans, /all/ born children will become magical.
