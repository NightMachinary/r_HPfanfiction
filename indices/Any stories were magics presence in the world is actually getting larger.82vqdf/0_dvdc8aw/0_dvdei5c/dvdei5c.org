Thanks and I like the idea of something suppressing the muggleborn birth rates although I would probably go for something set up for the ICW and have Voldemort in his take over of wizarding Britain break it.

I the idea that some magical animal generate there own magic and other use the magic give over into the environment is also pretty cool.
