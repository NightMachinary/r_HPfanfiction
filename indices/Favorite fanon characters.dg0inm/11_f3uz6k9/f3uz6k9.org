A.): Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson, Theodore Nott, Vincent Crabbe, Millicent Bulstrode, Gregory Goyle, Charlie Weasley, Fluffy...

B.): Draco/Malfoy family, Snape (Severitus), Lupin (responsible Lupin aka non-lukewarm Remus), Hermione (non-marry-sue), Dumbledore (where he */isn't/* a slimy manipulating arse-hat). ... Draco who isn't eager to follows his parents footsteps and can think for himself. Lucius & Narcissa when they aren't all that interested in following a megalomaniac but still care enough about keeping old family traditions - minus the racist/neo-nazi mentalities - while still loving their son unconditionally. Snape a still bitter arsehole, who has a gradual character growth that leads him to make better decisions and choices. Finally opening up those so-called observant eyes of his to realize that Harry is just as much of James' child as he is */Lily's/*. Even despite Harry looking like his father, Snape acknowledges he has his mother's heart. Remus, Hermione and Dumbledore really says it all... ...

Here are some of my favorite characters who fall in the middle of both perimeters.

C.): Angelina Johnson, Cho Chang, Viktor Krum, Padma Patil...
