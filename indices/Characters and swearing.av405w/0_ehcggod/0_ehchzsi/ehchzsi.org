I always enjoyed Rowling's publisher-induced workarounds (“he called Snape something that made Hermione say ‘Ron!'”). And I do think that through this method, Rowling told us that Ron does swear when Molly isn't around, but Harry/Hermione not so much.

Like you, I mostly use “they swore” unless the writing really calls for a particular well-placed word.
