The Weasley kids swear all the time, and they're creative because all of them together had to have fun just making stuff up.

Harry swears when he's angry. He's not creative, but he's aggressive. Harry swearing at you is actually intimidating.

Hermione rarely swears and she doesn't swear at people. It's just when she's really frustrated and something got done wrong.

Sirius swears like crazy, but it's very theatric. In casual, private conversations with friends, he doesn't swear at all.
