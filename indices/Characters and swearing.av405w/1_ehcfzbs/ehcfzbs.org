I always have difficulty with fics which make the characters swear too much, funnily enough. For the Trio, I agree: i don't really see Hermione swearing. For me, Ron would be the casual swearer, but I've always headcanoned Molly to be severe about it so maybe not so "casual" about it... I don't really see Harry swearing, especially at young age. Maybe growing up, and especially during his book 5 period, when he's angry all the time.

As for the others, I would say maybe Seamus for the swearing. Sirius when he's young, especially if his parents are against it.
