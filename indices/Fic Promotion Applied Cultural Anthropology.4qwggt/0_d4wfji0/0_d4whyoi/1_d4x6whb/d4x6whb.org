There's no shortage of them, but most of them exist to facilitate a 'ship with a Ravenclaw!Harry, and those that have her develop in an interesting way or have any interactions with anyone but Harry are few and far between. (Heck, Robst's /Harry Crow/ has Hermione in Ravenclaw!)

linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation by Robin.Drew) is probably my favorite Ravenclaw!Hermione fic at the moment.
