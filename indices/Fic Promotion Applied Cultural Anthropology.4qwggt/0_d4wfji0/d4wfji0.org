I don't know what it is about this fic, but something about it just doesn't sit well with me. Maybe how it portrays Harry, Ron and Gryffindor in general. Or perhaps Snape who just seems off to me. I definitely don't like the route he went with Tom Riddle, but that's the kinda thing I have no problem overlooking. And third year, to me at least, is definitely of lower quality than first and second.

I do have to say that I love the approach being taken with Occlumency. That's definitely a big plus in my mind.

But don't let my opinion stop someone from reading this! It might just be a YMMV kinda thing going on. And it is leagues better than the only other Slytherin!Hermione fic I can think of (Green Girl).

As a sidenote: We see plenty of Gryffindor!Hermione, Ravenclaw!Hermione and a few Slytherin!Hermione. What about Hufflepuff!Hermione? Is that a thing?
