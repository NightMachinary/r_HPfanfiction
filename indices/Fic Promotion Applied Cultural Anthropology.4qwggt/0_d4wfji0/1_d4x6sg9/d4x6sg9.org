linkffn(Mudblood Mistress by JoseHood) series has a Slytherin!Hermione. It's not as good (IMO) as ACA, but it's much better than /Green Girl/.

linkffn(Brilliant Majic by LJ Summers) is another, and it's also quite a bit better than /Green Girl/, but I still get the sense that the author doesn't really want think about the non-romance aspects of the fic, and spends as little time thinking them through as possible, focusing instead on just banging out drama. For example, it doesn't look like the author can keep characters' relative skill levels straight, and often muddles the social dynamics that would result from Hermione matriculating a full year before Harry and Draco.

In general, it's very easy to find fics that have Hermione in Slytherin, but next to impossible to find fics that have a Slytherin Hermione, if you know what I mean. Most of the ones that have her sorted there use it mainly as a vehicle for a Dramione 'ship and tend to cop-out: Hermione suddenly discovers pureblood ancestry, Draco is inexplicably friendly and protective, Stations of Canon are followed even if they make no sense whatsoever, etc..
