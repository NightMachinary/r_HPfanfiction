In linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon), which is a Firefly/Serenity cross, they leave Earth on colony ships like the rest of the population.

In linkffn(The End of the World by AWMPerry), they die like everyone else.

In another story that isn't an end of the world catastrophe, the Wizarding World (except for Harry) moves into a hidden dimension to isolate themselves from muggles.
