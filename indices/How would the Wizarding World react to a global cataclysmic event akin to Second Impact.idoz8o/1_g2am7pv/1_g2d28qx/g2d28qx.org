Small problem with doing things on a large scale: That's the one thing that muggles excel at while the wizarding world utterly fails.

They've got a tiny population, an even tinier subpopulation of highly skilled wizards required for such feats, and pretty much everything they do has to be done manually by people. Scaling up a small scale weather charm to work globally would pretty much require everyone casting it 24/7, the globe is huge.

Meanwhile if muggles had a weather altering machine that worked on a small scale, doing it on a larger scale would be pretty easy, just build a factory where millions of weather machines roll off the assembly line, with most of the work done by robots.
