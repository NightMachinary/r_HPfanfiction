These two are not complete yet but they are my favorites of what you described linkffn(The Odds Were Never in my favour by Antony444) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) both in their own way turn Harry Potter up to 11 although TSM's Prince of Slytherin is by some measure more constrained than Antony's Odds is.
