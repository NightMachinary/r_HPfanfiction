Your update rate will probably scare off most readers. Four chapters in four years is a bit of a red flag. Do you have more written and an outline prepared?

The continuous flashbacks are a little tedious. I find it jarring and it's also strange how they are mixed up (9 years previously, then 7, then 10, and 7 again). Arabella seems Mary Sue-ish. Advanced Potions at 12, capable of wandless healing, causes explosions when emotional, powerful family, likely beautiful, cute nickname, and capable of snaring "the pick of the litter." If you intend to make her overpowered, then you've succeeded! If not, maybe tone her down a bit.

It's definitely not bad and I'd read more. I think you need to reassess where you're going with it because you and your ideas have probably changed in the years since you've written it.
