Hmm, the closest I can get to this would be linkffn(Magic of the Kaleidoscope, Wizard of the Kaleidoscope) they're both Sharingan!Harry fics though and pretty dark, but it's all I have to rec.

One of them has pretty heavy Fate/ elements while the other has heavy Dresden Files elements though, so be warned.
