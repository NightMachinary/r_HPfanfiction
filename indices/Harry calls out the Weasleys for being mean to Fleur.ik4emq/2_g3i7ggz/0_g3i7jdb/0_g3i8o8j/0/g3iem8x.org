I feel like part of the issue between Fleur and Ginny is that Fleur's only experience with a younger sibling is one who is still very much a child as opposed to Ginny, who is 15 and obviously doesn't want to be treated like she's 9. Fleur is trying to treat Ginny like she would treat her younger sister, not realizing that that won't work. I do wonder how Ginny and Fleur's initial relationship would be if Gabrielle was closer to Ginny's age.
