What about Hermione? She's just as mean to Fleur as the other two women, if more so behind her back:

  “It's her,” said Ginny, plonking herself down on Harry's bed. “She's driving me mad.”

  “What's she done now?” asked Hermione sympathetically.

  “It's the way she talks to me --- you'd think I was about three!”

  “I know,” said Hermione, dropping her voice. “She's so full of herself.”

  “Don't you get used to her if she's staying in the same house?” Harry asked.

  “Well, you do,” said Ron, “but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly, like then . . .”

  “It's pathetic,” said Hermione furiously, striding away from Ron as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded once she had reached the wall.

If you guys want to shit on Molly and Ginny for being mean to Fleur, please include Hermione too. This fandom is suffering from enough double standards.

In defense of all three women, and Harry, they *didn't know Fleur's true character* at this point! Unlike us readers, they couldn't possibly know what transpired after the Battle of Astronomy Tower. Fleur, on the other hand, behaved like an arrogant dizzy airhead until then, who put down Hogwarts to the others's chagrins, who treated Ginny and Hermione like little children, and who kept calling Harry "Leetle Boy" or "Silly Boy". Harry himself was fuming about being called that way and took great satisfaction seeing Ginny mocking her.

Why should only Molly and Ginny be called out at all?
