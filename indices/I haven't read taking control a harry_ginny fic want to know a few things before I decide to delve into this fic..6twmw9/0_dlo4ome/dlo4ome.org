My impression is that it was a good story when it was written, but for those of us who have read many fanfics, some of its tropes do get old. One thing I strongly dislike is that overused portkey abduction scheme.

This series is finished. Although its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4924075/1/Free-Life][Free Life]] is abandoned, GHL finished the rest as [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129801][Prevailing Counterpoint]] on SIYE.
