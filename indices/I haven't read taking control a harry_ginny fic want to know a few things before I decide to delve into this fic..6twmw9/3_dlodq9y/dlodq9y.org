From what I remember my issue with the fic, along with similar redo fics, was that making Harry so awesome just made the story boring and without any conflict. I get the desire to give Harry more autonomy and be more proactive. But there was simply no real growth for the character and everything seemed too easy, from thwarting his enemies to one-upping Dumbledore to getting with Ginny. The whole thing just bored me.
