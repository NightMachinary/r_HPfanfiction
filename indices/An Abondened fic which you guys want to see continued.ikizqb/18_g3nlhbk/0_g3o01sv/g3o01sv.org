She is one of those authors that seem to have a lot of very good ideas and is a pretty decent writer but not great at telling a complete story. I don't think she has ever finished a story, don't get me wrong I love a lot of her stuff and what is there is absolutely enjoyable to read I just don't have any faith in her actually completing anything, same as cywscross actually.
