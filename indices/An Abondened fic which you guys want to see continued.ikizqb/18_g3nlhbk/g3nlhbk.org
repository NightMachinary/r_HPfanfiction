It only has one chapter, and I'm not even sure we can call it "abandonned" (though it's already been a while since March 2019), but linkffn( *Powerful Magical Artifact* ) by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4404355/kathryn518][kathryn518]].\\
As far as I'm concerned, the 1st chapter is just perfect and I'm really interested to see in what direction the story will go, also there is a "good" Ron, which is always a plus in my book.
