The poisoned apple... over 800,000 words, relatively close to being finished, and she just... stopped writing. Said she was going back to edit but I dont think she did that either ðŸ˜• Worst was it was listed as complete but it was just moved from ffn to ao3 to finish, she wrote 2-3 more chapters, then nothing. I just want to know how she wants it to end! It was finally going somewhere!
