I just loved the idea of Aberforth calling for his brother after he finishes cursing, and while he waits, manages to rouse Harry, and get a few details as to /why/ he's in his current state.

Albus trying to take Harry back to the Dursleys without listening to Harry's story and Aberforth objects physically. With a fist. To the face.
