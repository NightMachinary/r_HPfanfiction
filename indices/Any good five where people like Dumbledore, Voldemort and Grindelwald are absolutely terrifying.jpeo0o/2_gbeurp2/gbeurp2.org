Linkffn(The Mind Arts), linkffn(The one He Feared), linkffn(Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament), linkffn(Phoenix Insurgent) and maybe linkffn(The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries) all have elements of it, though in the Arcanist Voldemort is a very minor character at the moment and I am not sure if it will ever change, the bar is just a bit too high at this point for him to be a greater threat.
