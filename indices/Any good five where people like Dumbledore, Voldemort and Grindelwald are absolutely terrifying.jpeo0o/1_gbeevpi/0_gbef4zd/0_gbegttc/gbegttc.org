The fic itself is very lengthy, close to three million words and 126 chapters now and still in progress. It took me a few weeks to read and the events I listed won't happen until much later, like after chapter 50.

EDIT: Correction, the first event I listed occurred at chapter 61, and Voldemort is more vile than what I described. In the chapter he forces the kid he possessed to drink unicorn blood to stop the physical deteriorating his possession is causing on him. I think he also broke the kid's mind so that he wouldn't resist.
