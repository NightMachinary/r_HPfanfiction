linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan)

The story is Ron-centric but uses multiple POV's, including Voldemort and Dumbledore. Voldemort possesses children to escape the pain of his ethereal existence and do his dirty work, and at one point duels Dumbledore, where he causes an international catastrophe in order to escape. Later he possesses someone at St. Mungos and to cover up his tracks he kills everyone in the hospital and burns it down. People tried to fight back, even two Aurors, but they were no match for him.

In this fic canon events are accelerated and with greater stakes so Dumbledore is forced to get serious and go on the offensive. He leads the Order of the Phoenix on a strike against Voldemort and his forces at Malfoy Manor and goes straight after Voldemort, who he overpowers and would've killed had Voldemort not been saved last second. He also participates in a raid in Knockturn Alley that has been overrun by vampires which was inadvertently due to the international catastrophe he helped cause. He's a force of nature during the raid and single-handedly decimates the last of the vampires before they could overrun the Aurors.

The fic doesn't heavily focus on them but it is descriptive.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that in this fic it's Dumbledore and the House Heads that go down to the Chamber of Secrets to rescue Ginny and destroy the basilisk, only instead of just confronting the basilisk they also have to fight Ginny whose fully possessed by Tom Riddle and is extremely dangerous.
