You know, given how wizard genetics work (Once you're in, you're in, with rare exceptions.), aggressive exogamy could have wizards displacing Muggles demographically over a few centuries.

There's a plot bunny I have of Voldemort deciding to pursue /a different kind of immortality/: a decade later, Hogwarts is deluged with a hundred handsome, dark-haired Muggleborns, who tend to be highly intelligent but also often possess psychopathic traits. Next year, two hundred, and the year after that, and so on. (It doesn't even have to be unethical. Handsome, highly intelligent, good at hiding his psychopathy, and able to pass on magical powers, Tom Riddle could be a pretty popular sperm donor.)
