I think a lot of people start out writing fanfiction as a reaction to stories they've read that just weren't /quite/ right. I know I certainly did. My first thing, which admittedly never really went very far, was a pretty vanilla time-travel story that was meant to 'fix' all the problems I kept seeing in other mediocre time-travel stories.

I posted it on DLP and the response was... almost non-existent. I took the hint and it was a while before I made another attempt. My next attempt also wasn't especially interesting but it was, at least, an unusual combination. That got a bit more interest.
