That's basically why I started writing- the 'I can do better than /that/' challenge. It's not about being the best writer; it's about writing something that others enjoy and then improving as you get the encouragement.

The first time I posted a chapter I was giddy to see the read count go up. When I got a review (a positive one, thankfully), well, it was like a taste of fine chocolate. Or heroin.
