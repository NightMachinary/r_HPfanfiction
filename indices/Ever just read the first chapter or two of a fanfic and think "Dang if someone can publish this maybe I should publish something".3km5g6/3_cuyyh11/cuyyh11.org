As others said here too: I often think "I can do better than that" and then write my own fic.

But also remember this: those people who write shitty stories and publish them still have the guts to actually publish their work. It could also be that they're delusional and have an image of fame and fortune in their heads, but there are a lot of very inexperienced writers out there who, despite probably feeling unsatisfied about their fic, still publish it.

I won't congratulate them on fantastic writing, but I will commend them for publishing it.
