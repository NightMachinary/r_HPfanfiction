This was me for like 8 years. I mulled around a story idea for so long, and eventually I just started it in January. Thankfully I've gotten good reviews, and only one bad review( I called Tonks 'Mrs. Tonks' once whoops). That said, as I approach the 60k mark, I can tell me writing is drastically improved over my earlier writing and I want to go back and redo the first few chapters.
