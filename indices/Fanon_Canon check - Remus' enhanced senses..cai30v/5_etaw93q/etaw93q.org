It's fanon, and I suspect it came from people wanting the Werewolves in the Harry Potter books/movies to be more like those seen in other media.

As an aside, I don't know if it was intentional or not, but I always had the impression that the way Lycanthropy, and those afflicted with it, is portrayed in canon to be an allegory for the AIDS scare in the 80's.
