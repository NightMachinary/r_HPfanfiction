Complete fanon, but that shouldn't stop you from using it for a story.

Funny aside- the movies actually go the other way, where Scabior is tuned in to smells more than Greyback himself while they are hunting for muggleborns in the forest.

That said, I could see where a werewolf who embraces his wolfish traits can consciously bring up one or another aspect. Heightened senses might explain the appreciation for blood in their meat, but Remus wasn't one to embrace the wolf inside, nor to discuss details of his condition.
