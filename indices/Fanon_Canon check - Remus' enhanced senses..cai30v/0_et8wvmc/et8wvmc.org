Yeah it's fanon. As are scars on his face.

The only thing I can think of that slightly alludes to it is in HBP when they're talking about Bill and Remus says he won't be a full werewolf but "he may have some selfish characteristics" from now on, and it's mentioned that he then goes on to like very rare steak. The fact that Remus suggests this might mean there are some attributes he has connected to his werewolf side even when not transformed, but it never mentions what they are or suggests it's anything like super strength or heightened smell or anything like that.
