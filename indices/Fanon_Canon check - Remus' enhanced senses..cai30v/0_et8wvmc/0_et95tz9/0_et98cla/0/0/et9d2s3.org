I don't know that I would add any to be honest. I think I might slip in references to a fondness for rare meat as established in canon, and maybe as the full moon approached and he felt ill he might be able to hear or smell slightly better (but not so noticeable that it's overpowered, and only while he's too ill to be any use) but in general I think it makes more sense to avoid it and keep it as a monthly transformation.
