I want to scream every time his facial scars are mentioned in a fic. It's a mystery to me why authors are so determined to add them. Of course, it doesn't help that I find it hard to accept movie details in fics and most fics that give Remus wolfish traits seem to miss the point. Out of curiosity, what wolfish characteristics would you consider using in a fic?
