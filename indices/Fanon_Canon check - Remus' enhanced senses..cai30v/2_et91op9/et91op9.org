It's fanon and may I add that I hate this idea. Like another user said, it's only mentioned that Bill, who was bitten by Greyback, now likes his stakes a little rarer. I really do wonder what Remus meant by 'some wolfish characteristics'. In her piece on werewolves, Rowling mentions that a few days before and after a full moon, a person with this condition might feel ill, so it seems like it's an illness with no benefits whatsoever.
