Remus just seems to get tired around the full moons. Greyback was able to do something to make himself more wolfish when it wasn't the full moon, even able to partially infect Bill even though the moon wasn't full. I don't think werewolves can normally do that without a lot of intentional magical changes. However canon doesn't actually say if it's a magical or psychological thing that gives Greyback more wolf when he should be human. Bill took on some wolfish qualities like preferring steak more raw, but it never really says anything about enhanced abilities. It's logical to presume a full werewolf would have more wolfishness than Bill, but the books don't really give any definite answers.
