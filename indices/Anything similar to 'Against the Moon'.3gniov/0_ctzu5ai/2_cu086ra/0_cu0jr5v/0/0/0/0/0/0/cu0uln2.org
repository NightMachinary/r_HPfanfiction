Okay, if you promise you're not fighting. I think it was the good and evil bit that rubbed me the wrong way. Although I do think Snape is not a "good" character per say, I really wanted to believe his turn toward Voldemort. He's a relatively new interest of mine. I started work on a story myself, and I read Snape Chronicles back in April-ish to see what was already out there. I only got to chapter 19 or 20, and then I got busy and wasn't interested enough to finish.

The emotion bit makes sense. I think I picked it up looking for something like Against the Moon as well, and it's not like that.
