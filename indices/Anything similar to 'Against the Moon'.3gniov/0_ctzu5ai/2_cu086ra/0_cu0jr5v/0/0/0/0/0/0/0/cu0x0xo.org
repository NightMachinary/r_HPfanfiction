Well if you want an angsty take on Snape, then I can't in good faith recommend this fic to you, especially considering its length. I haven't read Against the Moon but there are very good angst!Snape fics out there!

What the Snape Chronicles is on the other hand is a very frank, plain and unapologetic take on his life. It coincides pretty well with how I see him - as someone with a troubled past who nevertheless made terrible choices that he more than paid for in full - which is likely why I get a little defensive of it, haha. I think the problem with it is that it neither justifies nor condemns him, and most people look for one or the other in a Snape fic. But in that regard it's quite true to life: most times our actions are unjustifiable, but they don't brand us as anything other than human beings. Personally I found his eventual initiation completely believable, maybe because I've known people who've done much the same thing and I've long since come to terms with the fact that /believable/ doesn't equal /right/ or even /sympathetic/.

Plus I don't think there really is a "good" or "evil" in TSC's world. The only character I'd label as evil in that fic is Voldemort, and that's largely because the author deliberately kept him a shadowy, mysterious figure. In fact, the Death Eaters tend to get more and better characterization than the other secondary characters. You get the clear sense that they're just people at the end of the day, albeit people prone to violence and prejudice in one form or the other. And future defection aside, Snape /was/ one of them of his own accord, and likely was friends with quite a few; the fic doesn't try to cover that up at all. So you're not going to find air-tight excuses in The Snape Chronicles, or even be able to put yourself in his shoes. You'll probably disagree with a lot of the things said and the choices made. I'm willing to bet you won't even like it - I definitely didn't the first time around.

But it's a story worth reading, and its post-Hogwarts chapters are a fascinating take on the sort of man that could so deeply loathe a child while giving up everything for him; that could treat his students with clear disdain one moment and genuine concern the next. The hero the wizarding world deserved, but not the one they needed right then. So they hated him, because he could take it. Because he wasn't a hero. He was a snarky guardian. A watchful spy. A Dark...

...wait, wrong fandom ಠ_ಠ
