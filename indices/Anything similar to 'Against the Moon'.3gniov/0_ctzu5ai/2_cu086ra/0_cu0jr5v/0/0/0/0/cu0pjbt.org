  What particularly large role did she play in his life?

Well, he begged Dumbledore to protect her and managed to get the darkest villain in the world to offer her a chance for life. Then, after she refused to step aside, he devotes his entire existence to protecting her son. Wtf? Did we read the same book? I'd say she was very important to him.

Look, don't ask for my opinion just to satisfy some urge to fight on the Internet. I liked the idea...heck, I recommended it to someone. I just didn't think it was interesting enough to continue reading at the moment. Doesn't mean I won't pick it up again...but honestly if you'd rather me like it, be a little bit more convincing. I WAS looking for canon with the missing years filled in. That didn't have enough information for me.
