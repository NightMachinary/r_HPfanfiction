I'm not fighting with you, just genuinely curious.

  Well, he begged Dumbledore to protect her and managed to get the darkest villain in the world to offer her a chance for life. Then, after she refused to step aside, he devotes his entire existence to protecting her son.

Yes, but /prior/ to him coming out and doing all that, how extraordinary was their relationship? In all the scenes we have of them as children, what's the insurmountable role she played that would justify his reaction? That's why I mentioned their birthday rituals and so on in the fic, because it actually gives much more justification for him to up and risk his life beyond "well they started talking to each other before Hogwarts". Like their mental connection, for one; in this fic it's clear right off the bat that unlike everyone else (even his mother) he can't hide anything from her and he idolizes her for it.

And I'd say you weren't looking for /information/, but rather /emotion/ (or to be precise, a specific sort of emotion). Which is personal taste and there's nothing wrong with that, but Snape's defining emotions were never the softer, angsty kind.

EDIT: Also, where did you leave off in the fic? It just struck me that I might be speaking with hindsight bias.
