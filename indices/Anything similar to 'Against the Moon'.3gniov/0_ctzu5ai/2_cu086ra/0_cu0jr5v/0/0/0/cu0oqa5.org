He didn't seem angry? I remember him flat-out attacking Dumbledore. And he'd been off the rocket science track for a long time his grandmother died.

  Felt like the grandmother thing was a bit of a cop-out to make him evil.

Ah, I see. You were still reading the characters as "good" and "evil".

  And yeah, Lily dropped him...but I wanted her to play a bigger role in his life. Up until the point I read, she just seemed like a friend...not someone he would risk his life to attempt to save.

But...that's exactly what happened in canon. She was barely more than a friend and then she dropped him. What particularly large role did she play in his life? The fic even tries to expand on their relationship, giving them shared moon-watching hobbies and birthday rituals and making her the only person he couldn't Occlude against.

It isn't supposed to be an AU with everything fixed, or an angst trip, or even a "let's revel in the darkness" thing. It's just canon with the missing years filled in. Plenty of people don't like that, I know, and that's a perfectly valid preference!
