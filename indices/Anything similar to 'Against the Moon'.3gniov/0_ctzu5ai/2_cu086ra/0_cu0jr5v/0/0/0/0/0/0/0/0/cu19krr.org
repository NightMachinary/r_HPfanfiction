Against the Moon is basically 105 chapters of little Remus tugging at your heartstrings. It's the story of him becoming friends with James, Sirius, and Peter. I recommended TSC because they have a similar premise (e.g. "This is the story of ____."). Other than that, AtM is more emotional and focused on detail (105 chapters over the span of 2 years)...and from my limited experience and your words, it seems as though TSC is more an explanation of events. Does that sound correct?

Perhaps I need to approach the story with that mindset. I knew going into TSC that I wasn't going to like his choices in the war, but I did want to feel sorry for him. Guess I can put that into my own story, and stop looking for it. Got to admit, though, I'm looking forward to some Death Eater characterization. The HP books are a little lacking in that regard.

The "good" vs "evil" comes from too much Marauder fanfiction, I suppose. It's all join the good side, fight for what you believe in, die before you're 22 in that side of the fandom...a la Les Mis.

So it sounds like I need to put it back on the reading list and try again when I'm in the mood for something edgier.
