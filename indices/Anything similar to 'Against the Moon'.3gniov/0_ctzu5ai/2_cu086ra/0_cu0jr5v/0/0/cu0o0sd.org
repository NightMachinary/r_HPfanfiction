No, I can't say that I've had a family member lynched before. I'm sure that would be horrible...but he didn't even seem angry. Just sort of, "Welp, guess I'm doing this now." And when I say he was doing well, I meant he was going on this particular track. I mean, he liked the lunar landings and he was considering rocket science. You can still be a smart and create a bunch of spells...but still want to do rocket science. And he dropped all of it without so much as a second thought when that happened. Not so much as a second thought, pain or anguish. Felt like the grandmother thing was a bit of a cop-out to make him evil. And yeah, Lily dropped him...but I wanted her to play a bigger role in his life. Up until the point I read, she just seemed like a friend...not someone he would risk his life to attempt to save.

Don't get me wrong, I wanted to like the story. I thought it started out amazing, and then it fizzled down to the point where I got bored with it. In the books, we were led to hate this character with a passion until all this strife and anguish came forward. I guess I just wanted more strife and anguish. You /did/ ask for my opinion. I still thought it was written well.
