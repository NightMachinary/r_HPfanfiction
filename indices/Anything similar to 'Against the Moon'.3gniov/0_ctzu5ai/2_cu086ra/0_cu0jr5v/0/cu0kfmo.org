They'd been recruiting him for a loooong long time, and he hadn't been opposed to them since way back in maybe third or fourth year. By the end of fifth he was almost completely taken by them (especially the whole scene at the lake with James), never mind all the tutoring and spellcrafting he'd /already/ been doing. I'm not entirely sure how you read his Hogwarts years and saw a normal kid who was just doing well trying to get by; he spent the latter half of school almost /thriving/ on the Slytherins' attention.

Beyond that, you must have never had your last family member lynched before. That's the kind of thing that drives entire peoples to war, much less one 16/17 year old kid. Humans are composed of a lot more rage and a lot less pain and angst than we like to deceive ourselves into thinking.

Also at what point does he drop Lily like a hot potato? Before or after she drops /him/ like a hot potato?
