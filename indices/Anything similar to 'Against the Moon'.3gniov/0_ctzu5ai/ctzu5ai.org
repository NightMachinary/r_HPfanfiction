This is a difficult one, because so many have been abandoned. I've heard that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3503913/1/][You Want to Make a Memory]] is good, but I haven't read it for myself yet. It's on the list. Same with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8236381/1/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-the-Stag-and-the-Doe][The Rise and Fall of the Stag and the Doe]], though I did try to start that. It wasn't immediately captivating, but a lot of people like it, so I may try again.

Ones that are not completed: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=256874][In My Time of Dying]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3325624/1/The-Age-of-Inertia][The Age of Inertia]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times][The Life and Times]]. All are very good, and they stayed with me long after I gave up hope of them ever being updated.

I think one of the issues is that Marauder stories are often synonymous with Lily and James romance stories...and while I do enjoy that, I also like the humor and playfulness of "Against the Moon" just as much.

If you want the other side, a lot of people like the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][The Snape Chronicles]]. I thought it was very good until it wasn't. Kind of disappointing for me, but you might still like it.

Also, can I do a shameless plug of my own? It's hardly worth any effort because I literally just posted it yesterday, but I've been working on this story about Lily Evans for a long time. It's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11440239/1/Flowers-in-Winter][Flowers in Winter]]. I can't make any promises so early in the game, but the "plan" is to get through the war.
