[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/][*/A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3824385/Rannaro][/Rannaro/]]

  She was a girl of exceptional talent and a kind heart, but she had been born between two worlds...neither of which she truly belonged. She was Lily Evans, and she had lived as she had died; fighting for the things in life that should have been rightfully hers to claim.
