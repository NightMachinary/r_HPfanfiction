The main character should be from a different world born into a wizarding child's body. Because of the Dickens reference, I'm thinking edgy 35 year old associate English professor who hated Harry Potter because they believed it wasn't "real literature" and hated students. Your character seems kinda grumpy, so it fits. They identify the most with Snape.

I feel like if you haven't decided a gender for your character, you don't need one. Make them a genderqueer literature professor from 2020 reborn into the 80's wizarding world. Would be super unique. They should also have a preppy gender neutral name like Blair.
