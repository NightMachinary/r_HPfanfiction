If you don't mind X-overs I LOVE "Itachi is that a baby". By far my favorite Crack fic of all time and any fandom. other than that I would recommend "It's always the quit ones" or something. it's not exactly humor... more of Existential Horror type of thing with you awkwardly smiling in the corner in order to cope. but it's so out there that I definitely consider it Crack.

P.S. I don't have the fics opened so just Google them.
