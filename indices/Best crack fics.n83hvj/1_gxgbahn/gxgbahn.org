*Silly Silly Book Series* is basically just a literal, bashing of the books in a really dumb way. It's good fun to read because it just highlights all the stupid crap, I read it when I need a laugh. (I've link GoF because that's what I'm reading but they do all the books) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1010575/chapters/2005697#workskin]])

*Luna and the DLs Diary* is Luna Lovegood gets the Diary in CoS and it's just very funny to watch Tom Riddle get pissed and then confused by Luna. It's sweet and silly. Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12407442/1/Luna-Lovegood-and-the-Dark-Lord-s-Diary]])

This is a Tomarry story (it's the only Tomarry story I've read because I don't like this pairing but it made me laugh enough to stick with it) but they keep getting reincarnated and basically just fuck shit up. It's good craic. Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11907443/1/Full-Circle]])
