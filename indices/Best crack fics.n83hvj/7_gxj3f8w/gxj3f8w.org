No links due to Rule 8:

/The Crack'd Mirror/ on ffn. Voldemort attempts to summon AU versions of himself for aid. Due to a minor boo boo the first attempt replaces Harry with the Harry that was Emperor Gellert's protege/archenemy. It's also the only story I'm aware of where Millie joins a harem.

/Lucky Harry/ by Pyrgas on ffa. Harry's shattered arm heals with the cracks forming a runic array.

/All it Takes is One Girl/ on AO3. Harry accidentally marries Narcissa. Which triggers a bunch of stuff and really annoys the girl he was already engaged to.
