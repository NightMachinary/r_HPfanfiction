Linkffn(The Black Prince) My favourite GoT/HP fanfic so far. I'm not a big fan of the whole making Harry a son of Robert or a Stark, and yet the writing style hooked me right in.

I'm afraid many of the fics I really like are either discontinued or they are not quite where I want them to be in terms of writing quality. I generally weigh both writing quality and plot highly, but with a good enough plot I can overlook certain things in the writing.

Ember_Rising recommended Steelbadger's LotR/HP crossover, and I have to agree on that. He really knows his lore in terms of the Lord of the Rings.
