Because HPMOR isn't really publishable. The way it's written, whilst very compelling, wouldn't work published.

For instance, there's no real structure (especially for the first 15ish chapters), it moves too slowly, is too long (and would be difficult to break up because of the way it's written), and focuses too much on non-story aspects that are fine when you're using e-ink, which costs almost nothing, but would need extensive cutting when each page adds to the cost/intimidation factor of people picking it up.

If it could be published, it might well succeed - but that would be because it has already built an audience which could then market it. To get it to "publishable" would require endless cuts. (I've steered away from quality because that's an argument I'd rather not get into.)

Comparing that to AQ, Unatoned, What Lies Beneath, or Forging the Sword, which could be published with minimal edits if not for the pesky existence of Rowlings work, and the difference is immense.
