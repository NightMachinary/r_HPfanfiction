There's also a HPMOR subreddit at [[/r/hpmor]] and a subreddit for general rationalist fanfiction (including hpmor and related metafanfics) at [[/r/rational]]

I've not read it yet, but the consensus seems to be that linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Sealed Intelligence) is a very good follow-up story, although it's by a different author.
