I agree that pureblood pretense could use an editor (every fic could, including the others mentioned in this thread), "too many words" is a very, very common failing in the fantasy world. Personally, I don't find murkybluematter's overabundance of words any worse than a number of published fantasy authors like Robert Jordan, Tad Williams, Steven Erickson or Terry Goodkind. As with any opinion, YMMV.
