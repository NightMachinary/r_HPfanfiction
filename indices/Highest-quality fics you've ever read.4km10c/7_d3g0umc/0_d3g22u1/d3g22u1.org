Yes! The Pureblood Pretense has me hooked. The first one (pureblood pretense) has around 250k words, but the 2nd and 3rd of the series has over 300k words. Now...don't let that intimidate you...I was so in love with the series that I think I finished all 3 books in 2-3 days. The story is well thought out and the character well developed.
