linkffn(Thresholds by Stanrick) and linkffn(Favorite Things by Stanrick) both seem well written to me. They're clever H/Hr slow-burn romances.

linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger) and linkffn(The Power He Knows Not by Steelbadger) are two Harry Potter/Lord of the Rings crossovers that are very well written. The author has a very strong grasp of Tolkien's style and world. Shadow is WIP but Power is complete.

linkffn(The Original Naked Quidditch Match) gets points for its unique format and cleverly set-up humor.

linkffn(Stages of Hope) is a tearjerker that has some excellent parts which flow almost like poetry.
