Another one, i feel is *Arabella's Very Secret Diary,* which i find could have been sold as a companion short story to CoS. Exploring CoS! from Ginny's perspectives through her diary entries and conversations with Tom Riddle, it is a horror story about the gradual loss of one's will and one that still holds up 15 years later. The only quibble, of course is that it predicted Ginny's full name as Virginia and not Ginerva. This is one fic that will make you even more furious at Tom Riddle and does show a little of his charisma that many fics don't quite explore.
