linkffn(Case 129; End of the Line by shewhoguards; Number Games by jbern) are all (relatively) short but very well-written. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649528/nonjon][nonjon's]] stories are also all very good, but with a lot of humour. To start with I'd recommend linkffn(A Black Comedy; Dimension Hopping for Beginners)
