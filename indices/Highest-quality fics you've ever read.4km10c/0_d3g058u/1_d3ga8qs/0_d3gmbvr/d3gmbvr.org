Sesc:

linkffn(Sister, Mine by SeriousScribble)

linkffn(Unatoned by SeriousScribble) an excellent detective type novel by Sesc

linkffn(A Beautiful World by SeriousScribble) and linkffn(Black and White by SeriousScribble) are two very well written shorts about some side characters during the HP series.

I don't really know anything about Phantom Limb.

linkffn(Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow)

linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh)

linkffn(An Interview with Justin Finch-Fletchley) and linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks) are both favorites of mine that most people like regardless of ship/genre.

And last, but not least, linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided by Inverarity)
