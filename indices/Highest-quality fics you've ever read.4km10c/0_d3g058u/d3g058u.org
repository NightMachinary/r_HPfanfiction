Sesc's stuff is publishable-quality writing, especially for the genre he's writing in. There are bits of Sister, Mine that are easily publishable quality.

Phantom Limb has large swaths of publishable quality writing, though the pace/plot has some issues.

Forging the Sword comes pretty close, as does A Long Journey Home. Purely on a writing level, if you compare it to actual published stuff it wouldn't... stand out, necessarily, but it's easily in the ballpark.

An Interview with Justin Finch-Fletchley comes very, very close, especially with the little canon-esque touches and the parsimony of detail.

The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks, especially some of the later sections.

Obviously Inverarity's other HP thing Hogwarts Houses Divided would be up there.
