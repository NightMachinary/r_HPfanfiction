I read a ton of HP fanfiction on fanfiction.net and very rarely favourite them. This is my most recent favourite. I thought the writing was great and I really loved the way the author kept it canon for the most part and followed the book, but changed things enough to take it the direction they wanted to. Even events that the author had changed the general idea of them still happened just in a different way. It was so cool! I was very excited to find this one, I recommend it
