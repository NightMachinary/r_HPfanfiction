Because of the nature of the fic (less of a story and more of a tapestry), even if it was abandoned, it could still be considered complete. There's a lot of room to grow, but the end of the chapter "In Vino Veritas" (as well as the end of the last chapter) are satisfying enough that they could be ends in and of themselves.

Also, it's amazing. Well worth discussing.
