A Better Man is somewhat interesting. But it has a common problem. Its main idea is the change in Vernon's character, but that is poorly explained and glossed over. Then it becomes a year 1 cannon rehash with a more confident Harry. Rinse and repeat of every Year 1 but with a bland/garrystu/selfinsert Harry. It doesnt make a big change to plot. It doesnt focus on where it should: Vernon. The first few chapters are very cool with Vernon and Sirius and Remus, but it falls apart before that becomes a full story.
