I don't have an actual opinion on the story, this is purely a response to your critique.

I think the real problem becomes if they focused on Vernon as a major player (main character whatever) through out then how does that incorporate in the Wizarding world?

Muggles, as the books go, don't/can't/won't live/be a part of the other world except for parents/guardians/love interests (and even then their role is minimal).

While it is fan fiction, thus subject to the whims of the author, it would still need to establish that link and justify its inclusion. Which is an undertaking that can be (has been) poorly done and unsatisfying. Given the 'ok-ness' of this story, it would have (to me) been such.

Otherwise to get the Vernon 'thing' going it would have to focus on Harry's childhood, which can become tedious. Or focus on their interactions during the non-Hogwarts time, which is limited and/or inconsequential (unless Vernon developed a 'thing' we know not to become a divisive power in the coming war).

I think the concept is interesting, and can serve as the jump off point of a canon rehash, but the inclusion of Vernon as the focal force behind the plot would/could fall flat. And I feel that would have made a worse story.
