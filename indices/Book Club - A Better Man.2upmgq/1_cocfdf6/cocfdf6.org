A somewhat pernickety criticism, but I found the overuse of things like 'Gred and Forge' a bit irksome as well as the fact that the fic was obviously written by someone not British (American/Canadian) who was trying to use British language. I liked the fic overall but I thought some bits were pretty cheesy and the writing quality wasn't overwhelming, to be honest.

Edit: Also, Ragnok, the dignified goblin, using 'innit'. Just not right.
