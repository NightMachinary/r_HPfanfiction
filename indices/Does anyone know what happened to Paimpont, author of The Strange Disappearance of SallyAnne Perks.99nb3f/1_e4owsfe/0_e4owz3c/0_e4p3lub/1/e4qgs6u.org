I'll probably get downvoted but I really didn't think it was that great. It's engaging and will keep you reading but I've never felt so indifferent about a story after finishing. I've been disappointed in a lot of stories, disliked a lot, and underwhelmed by a fair amount. But this is one of the few that I've just been completely indifferent about. I've read it twice and almost nothing from this story has stuck with me.
