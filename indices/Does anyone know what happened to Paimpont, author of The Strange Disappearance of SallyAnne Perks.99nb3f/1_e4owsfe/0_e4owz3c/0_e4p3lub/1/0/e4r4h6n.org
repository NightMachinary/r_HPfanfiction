Sally-Anne has one of these mysteries that readers really like, especially since it has no relation to Voldemort at all and has sort of an emotional ending with the original elements from the books. Rarely do you stumble upon such fics and everytime there's a request for these kinds of stories, next to nothing comes up, unfortunately. There's also the fact that it uses a very minor and overlooked character, well, two, and still manages to make you interested in them, despite both being practically OC's.
