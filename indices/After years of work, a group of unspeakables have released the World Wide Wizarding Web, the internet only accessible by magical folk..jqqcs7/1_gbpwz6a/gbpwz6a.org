I always sort of imagined that the wizard internet would be an actual different dimension to which you could summon yourself with your wand. Here would be some sort of Oracle that could respond to any of your questions but it would also learn information from wizards all over the world visiting it. Some would contribute freely, others for fun, others would teach the oracle information but ask the Oracle to also advertise their business and others would simply ask the Oracle to charge others looking for the information they have provided. It would also deliver your messages to other people across the globe. When you leave a message for someone, their wand notifies them.

Edit: Alternatively, for any question, you'd have to pay it back with a new information be it in the form of speech, written or a memory like those that go into the Pensieve.
