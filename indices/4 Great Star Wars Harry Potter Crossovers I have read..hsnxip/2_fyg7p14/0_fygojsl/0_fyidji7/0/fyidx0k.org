Ok, yeah sorry about that, but the way you write it made me think that Ron and Hermione divorce. Also with the timeline of events you put in. But yeah. Still a great story. I also hope you get to introduce Lando or the other Star wars characters other then rebels. Good luck on the next chapter and I can't wait to read it.
