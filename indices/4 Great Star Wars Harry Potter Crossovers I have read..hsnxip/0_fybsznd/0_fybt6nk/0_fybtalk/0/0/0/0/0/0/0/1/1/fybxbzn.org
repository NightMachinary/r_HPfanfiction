I also want to ask, what is the fanfic you are writing about. Mine was originally a Harry potter came into our universe and people knew about him. But then I expanded it more to a Indiana jones style where it is a race to find the fountain of youth. Also, since magic doesn't exist in our world, characters from the Harry Potter series get the magic drain out of them. I am on either part 5 or pt. 6 and I been wondering how should I write it out. The idea for this chapter was that Donny, the main protagonist, stops by his father to receive some help in the location of the fountain of youth and donny will train the family in hand to hand combat and firing a gun.
