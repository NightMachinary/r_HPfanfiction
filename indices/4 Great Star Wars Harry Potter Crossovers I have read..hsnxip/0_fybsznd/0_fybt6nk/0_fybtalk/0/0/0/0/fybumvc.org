Here's the best part about ao3. You go to the fandom tag, so in our case HP, and open the filter box. You check IJ or SW in the filter. You sort by most kudos, the equivalent of upvotes. The fics you're looking for are listed in descending reception. You can also filter complete works, updating works, content warning tags, misc tags, ship tags, character tags- you name it. This also works for excluding tags. Bam, the fics you find are basically as close to your taste as currently exist.
