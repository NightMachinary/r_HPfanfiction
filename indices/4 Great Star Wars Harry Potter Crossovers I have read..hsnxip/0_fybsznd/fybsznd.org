May I recommend Of Clones and Wizards? linkao3(61209361)

(Hope that works, never used the bot before.)

Harry from first year gets yeeted into the the Clone Wars. It's super new but the character dynamics are great, Harry isn't OP, it updates daily, and we all get to make fun of the Jedi for being basically shit. (Seriously, this one updates scarily fast. No beta reader, either, and the writing is still solid.)
