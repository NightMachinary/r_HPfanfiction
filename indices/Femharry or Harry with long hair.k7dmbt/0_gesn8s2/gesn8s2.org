That would be an interesting direction to take the 'going into hiding' thing. Instead of all of them going, the Potters stay in public, but they put Harry in a highly defended tower somewhere, where the kid can grow up safe and hidden from everyone. They get a little paranoid, and after the 'Incident' James isn't allowed scissors anymore, so Harry's hair just gets longer and longer. Unfortunately, living things continuously resting up against something as heavily enchanted as the tower is tends to have some... side-effects.

Harry now talks to animals, and regularly has mood-swings (as in, Harry starts to sing swing, whenever the mood strikes them - including all the big band sounds). The hair is also slightly... alive and sometimes hisses advice when Harry needs it.

I don't think I've seen a 'Tangled' AU version of HP before. :D
