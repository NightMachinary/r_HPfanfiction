The issue is that he's closer to the three aforementioned as adults than they are as teens in most of those fics. I like to think Voldemort only became a serious threat to Dumbledore around the time he returned to apply for DADA. Grindelwald was always a threat, simply because no one aside from Dumbledore really had the capabilities to stop him.

My favorite read of canon is that Dumbledore is slowing down. He has the elder wand, but without it, he probably wouldn't be able to duel Voldemort like he does. I feel even Dumbledore would have eventually succumbed to Voldemort before Harry disembodied him.
