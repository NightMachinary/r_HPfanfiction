Here is my take on time travel to 1930s:

1. I see nothing wrong in killing baby wizard Hitler and the real Adolf Hitler.

2. Practically though, I agree with you that turning Tom Riddle should yield a better outcome.

3. But, in almost every such time travels, Hermione (Harry, Ginny, Luna) ends up raising or shagging Tom. I'd like to see something different, something that has them killing off baby wizard Hitler right from the start, but later dealing with some nasty butterfly effects.
