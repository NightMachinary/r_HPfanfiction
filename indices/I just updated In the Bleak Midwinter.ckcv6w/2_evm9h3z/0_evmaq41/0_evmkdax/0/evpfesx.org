similar thing with hitler, hitler was a major negative on the german military force constantly fighting with his generals and making stupid choices that hindered them

but the underlying hatred and bitterness would still be in that country and it would still boil away.

or maybe without hitler world war 2 is delayed by a decade and is far far more devastating as a result
