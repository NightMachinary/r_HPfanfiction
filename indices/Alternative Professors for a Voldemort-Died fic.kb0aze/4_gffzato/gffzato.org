I went through some lists of minor Harry Potter characters, and these fit the criteria of 'not dead, and not on the dark side'

*Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank* - A substitute Care of Magical Creatures teacher in book four and five. Competent and well liked. I could imagine her as a general substitute teacher who gets promoted.

*Dirk Cresswell* - Muggle-born, member of the Slug Club during his time as Hogwarts student. He was Head of the Goblin Liason Office until Albert Runcorn exposed his falsification of his family tree and caused him to be sent to Azkaban. However, he escaped, but eventually was killed by Snatchers along with Ted Tonks and Gornuk the goblin.

*Sturgis Podmore* - Member of the original Order of the Phoenix. Worked in the ministry and guarded the prophecy room in book five, until he was arrested for attempting to break in, most likely under the Imperius curse cast by Lucius Malfoy.

*Emmeline Vance* - Member of the original Order of the Phoenix. Helps Harry escape the Dursleys in book five. Killed in 1996 by Death Eaters.

*Deadalus Diggle* - Member of the original Order of the Phoenix. Helps Harry escape the Dursleys in book five. In the Deathly Hallows he helped take the Dursleys to a protected area. The Death Eaters later burned his house in a raid, but Diggle was unharmed.

All very minor Characters with only a little characterization, but enough to build an interesting OC on and still make them recognizable. If I read up a bit more I can pobably help with their canon portrayal.
