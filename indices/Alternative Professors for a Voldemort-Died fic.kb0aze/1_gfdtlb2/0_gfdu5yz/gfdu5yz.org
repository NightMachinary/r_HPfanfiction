I can work with OC-With-Familiar-Names.

Thing is, all three people you mentioned canonically died before Voldemort fell (and in a manner entirely unrelated to whether Voldie had Horcruxes or not).\\
I don't want to diverge from that too much to be honest, if people survive it'd be purely as a knock-on effect of things I already mentioned (Voldemort not having Horcruxes, Snape specifically warning James&Lily).

The Order itself is a good shout, though, and it does remind me of a candidate - the Longbottoms were tortured into insanity in canon because Voldemort's body was never found and the Death Eaters thought Frank and Alice would know something in that regard.\\
With no Horcruxes, Voldemort would have left a dead body behind, thus the Longbottoms wouldn't be tortured (or, at least, not for information they didn't have). Either one could be a candidate for DADA Professor.
