I was talking about just having her as the Potions Professor just to contrast against Snape. Not Manipulative Potions Molly, lol. For eg. -

Snape teaches potions as a chemistry class, Molly teaches it like a cooking class.

Snape prohibits 'no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations' in his class, Molly actively teaches some spells to complement the potions.

While Snape's potions are top of the line (eg. Wolfsbane) but his teaching skills are trash, Molly's potion brewing skill is comparatively low (she can't make Wolfsbane, for eg.) but her teaching skill is way better.

Snape is loved by the Slytherins and hated by everyone else, on the other hand Molly is hated by the Slytherins and loved by everyone else, etc.
