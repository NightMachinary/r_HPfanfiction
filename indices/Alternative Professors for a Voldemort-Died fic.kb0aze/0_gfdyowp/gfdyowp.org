Slughorn might continue as the Potions Professor (he taught it right until the moment Snape was hired).

Remus Lupin qualifies as a DADA professor. There won't be any bitter jerks whose idea of revenge includes getting him fired, so that's a plus, too.

Idk why, but Professor Tofty (the kind O.W.L examiner) seems like a good candidate. As he was qualified enough in all (common) fields of magic to be allowed to examine the students, he would be skilled enough to teach them Defense, too. Judging by his reaction to Umbridge and her attack on Mcgonagall, he won't be a spy for the Ministry. The extent of his loyalty to Dumbledore is unknown, but it shouldn't matter that much.

Is there a link? I would love to read something like that.
