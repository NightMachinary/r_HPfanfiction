I've spent a lot of time trawling the Internet for Slytherin!Hermione fic. My conclusion is that there is a crap-tonne of decently written Dramione fic in which Hermione is sorted into Slytherin, and the only downside for the vast majority of those is that the whole fic takes place in a Bizzarro-Potterverse in which Slytherins don't have any real blood-prejudice, and Gryffindors are the ones throwing "mudblood" around. I think /Green Girl/ is the most popular one. (And yes, Weasleys usually get bashed, along with Dumbledore.)

Complaining aside, there are some Slytherin!Hermione fics that do avoid that pitfall:

- linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) is still /the/ Slytherin!Hermione fic, but I've gotten some indication that the author is getting out of fanfiction altogether, so it will probably never be finished.
- linkffn(New Blood by artemisgirl): Ron isn't portrayed in the best possible light, but at one point I feel that he even comes off as a sympathetic victim of Slytherin bullying. Updates rapidly. A bit sueish.
- linkao3(Brilliant, but Scary by Free Range Snallygaster (RemedialAction)): VoldemortsUnknowingDaughter!Slytherin!Hermione+Slytherin!Harry that does as well.
- linkffn(Labyrinth by Kroontjespen): Slytherin!Hermione+Slytherin!Harry; probably abandoned.

Surprisingly, there is a dearth of Ravenclaw!Hermione fic in which she isn't treated like crap.

- linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation by Robin.Drew): the best one I know: it's what HPMOR /should/ have been. Updates very slowly.
