Exactly, a repeat of canon stations would be utterly ridiculous.

On the other hand, if Lestranges and Barty Jr didn't get caught for torturing people, they might have found Voldemort much earlier! Furthermore, if Barty Jr was not outed, his dad would most likely become the Minister of Magic. Now the situation becomes very interesting:

- Voldemort returned earlier with three Lestranges at his side
- Barty Crouch would be a more effective Minister, but Barty Jr remained a dangerous deep spy at his side
- Potters and Sirius Black could seriously impede Malfoy's corruption of the Ministry
- Voldemort returning early would mean the entire PS plot was redundant
- Voldemort taking back his Diary from Malfoy for his lack of faith would mean no CoS plot, at least not in 2nd year

See, someone could write a very interesting story without any mindless canon rehashes.
