harry would be different by nature of not being raised by the dursleys so thats a difference there, unless his parents get tortured like the longbottoms were in canon, and if they weren't sirius wouldn't go to azkaban, pettigrew would probably be caught, thus 3rd and 4th year wouldn't happen unless you made something new for the tri-wiz on, cause no pettigrew = no free barty/captured moody = no resurrection
