I know it doesn't help you find it, but how can Harry have both his parents, but nothing 'crazy' changes from the actual books?

By design, you're asking for an exact retelling of the books, but want Harry's parents around? That would mean they were acting like the Dursleys? You also forget that Sirius wouldn't be in prison, which would mean Sirius/Remus would be in Harry's life alongside his parents.

Just stopping at that, the whole idea falls apart.
