Snape pleas with Voldemort to spare Lilly, Voldemort agrees, unknowingly entering into a sort of pseduo-magical-contract. When Voldemort betrays that contract by killing Lilly, Voldemort is cursed in a way when things directly concern Harry Potter. It would be neat if Snape had intentionally set this sort of thing up, like a "at best James and Harry die and Lilly comes to me for comfort, at worst, Harry lives and Voldemort is cursed" kind of thing.

I also like [[/u/starfox5]] 's take in linkffn(12592097), where Lilly uses blood magic, with herself as the sacrifice, to protect Harry.
