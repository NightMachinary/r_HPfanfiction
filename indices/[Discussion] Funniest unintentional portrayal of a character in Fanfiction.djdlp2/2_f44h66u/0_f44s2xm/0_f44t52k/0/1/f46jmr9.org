It's definitely dumb, but I think it's one thing to hand-wave the idea that no other mom has ever cared enough to jump in front of their kid. It's another thing to say a baby -- which at that point has pretty much no idea what the hell is going on -- could do it. If all it takes is a meat shield, a dark wizard could replicate it pretty easily.
