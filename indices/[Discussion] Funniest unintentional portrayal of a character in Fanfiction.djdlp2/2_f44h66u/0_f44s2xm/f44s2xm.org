Speaking of deaths, in The Archeologist, a fic that occasionally gets recommended here, Harry's twin sister Rose acts in Lily's stead: Voldemort tells her to stand aside (at Pettigrew's request, who was her godfather), but she doesn't and willingly gives her life for her brother. Adult Harry who reincarnates into that world muses about it and feels humbled by her sacrifice.

She was *one year old* at the time. It's entirely too ridiculous to be taken seriously.
