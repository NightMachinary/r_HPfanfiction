Not exactly a character, but more character death. I was reading a post-war fic written before DH, It went into the "Hermione lost her parents" trope. That in itself that is not uncommon, if you want to write a fic without her having parental guidance. Common ways this usually happen are Death Eaters killing them, Hermione's spells being irreversible, or even just the occasional random occurrences (Heart attack, car crash, etc). This fic fell in the latter category, them suffering an accident, and compared to how it normally is it was unintentionally hilarious.

They both died in a FLIPPING SKIING ACCIDENT. Not Death Eaters or memory charms gone wrong but instead THEY MANAGED TO KILL THEMSELVES ON VACATION. Not how the author intended it to be taken, but in comparison to how they usually are lost is just plain funny.
