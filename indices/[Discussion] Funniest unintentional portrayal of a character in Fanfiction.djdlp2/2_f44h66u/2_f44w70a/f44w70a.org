That's actually a good idea though I think. It's like when a veteran dies while on leave. It's obviously devastating for their loved ones, but there's also a bitter irony. They survived multiple potential deaths, only to die on holiday to a freak accident. It's certainly something hard the loved ones have to deal with and process - harder even than dying in a war.
