I had to drop quite a lot of the fics in the angst genre because I couldn't stop myself from laughing. There's a line that, if crossed, makes a tragedy hilarious if it becomes overly exaggerated and stops being believable. So I'm just sitting there thinking /"Oh, Vernon ate Hedwig? What's next, did they use Harry's picture album as toilet paper? Maybe Dudley cuckolded him? Come on, pull the other one"/ at what the author intended to be an emotional moment.
