  /"Oh, Vernon ate Hedwig? What's next, did they use Harry's picture album as toilet paper? Maybe Dudley cuckolded him? Come on, pull the other one"/ at what the author intended to be an emotional moment.

I needed that laugh. You're right though. Maybe they'll use his broom as mulch for the garden too.

It gets ridiculous. Of course, if I read a fic where Vernon ate Hedwig, I'd probably bookmark it for being hilarious.
