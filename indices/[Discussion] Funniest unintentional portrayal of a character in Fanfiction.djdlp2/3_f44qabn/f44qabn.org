Earlier this year I read part of a HG/TMR fic set in an AU where Harry and Tom's generations attend Hogwarts at the same time.

I get the impression that the author meant it to be a steamy romance, but the further the plot went into the relationship between Tom and Hermione the more it started to look like a comic tragedy about a reasonably intelligent young woman undergoing the horrific transformation into a brainless nymphomaniac.
