Bad romance writing focused on sex apeal is common in many pairings. I confess I don't see the point in singling out one particular pairing for it.

The fic I mentioned stands out to me because Hermione's personality changed dramatically over the course of the fic. She actually started out with a personality nearly identical to cannon with surprisingly well written explorations of both her faults and strengths, but the longer the fic went on the more she changed until it looked like sex was the only thing on her mind.
