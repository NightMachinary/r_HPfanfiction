It's important to remember that most students who aren't in Harry's core friend group don't know anything about his adventures except wild rumors and blown out of proportion speculation. If they're in gryffindor they might know a bit more, but that doesn't stop them from trusting in the news or disbelieving that someone their age could do X thing.

Actually, it would be interesting to see if a story could be done with a S.I marshaling Harry's fanclub to be a mini militia built around the idea of protecting Harry and keeping him happy. The S.I would have to keep their knowledge of the future to themselves and work situations as they come, while keeping the fan club out of Harry's business for the most part , because Harry is wary and distrustful of the general public and off put by his fans.
