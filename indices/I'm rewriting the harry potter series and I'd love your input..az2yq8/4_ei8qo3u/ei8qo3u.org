Following canon is so overdone, I've very little interest in another canon rehash.

SI/OC-insert is fine, if done well. Make sure your character has actual flaws and realistic relationships, not just magically insinuating herself into all the right places. Have the timeline shift around her.

Once your character starts changing things, the events will not play out the same. Think about the possible ripples, whether up-front or in the background. (I personally would take it even farther into AU-land and mix things up from the start, but that's a different discussion.) If you want to show classes, don't just repeat ones we've seen. For instance, if you want to do a potions class, look up one of the other potions on the wiki (or just make up your own) and have them do that, with accompanying unique character interactions.

Make her life difficult. Force her to struggle. Stories where someone just comes in and solves all the problems without any negative repercussions or obstacles is boring to read. It may be fun to write as a power fantasy, but conflict drives stories far better than wish-fulfillment. Give her personal stakes in the goings-on; give her a reason to really care about what's happening so her failures have weight.

I don't personally care about relationships one way or another, but if you do add them DO NOT put any romance in too soon. 11-12 yr olds dating and having adult feelings for each other is extremely off-putting.

Best of luck! I hope my advice/personal thoughts gives you something to consider. I'm currently writing my own version of the whole story as well. It's not an easy route, but I love reading long stories/series fics and believe it'll be worth the time and effort in the end. :)
