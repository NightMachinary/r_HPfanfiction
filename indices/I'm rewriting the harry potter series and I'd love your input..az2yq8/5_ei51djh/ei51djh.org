Your comment made me laugh !! Thats actually a really good point thank you.

My o/c character was gonna be a girl, who is mediocre at most subjects, but as for the whole adventure thing - whilst i wasnt planning to have her go along with them, it's basically similar to what you said. So I will need to do some changing. I already know how to change the plot of book 3 through to 7 it's just the first two lol.

Thank you for your help ðŸ¤—
