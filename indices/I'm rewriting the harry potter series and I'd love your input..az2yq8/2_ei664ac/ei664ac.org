I'd say to not make her friends with Harry, or not at the same year as him. (A bit of amnesia could be very nice, so she isn't omnipotent).

Someone that has their own agenda could actually be interesting. (Like, trying to get home?) Maybe prevent her from changing anything, because it will ruin the universe somehow (like give her blinding headaches because she is not really supposed to be there).

She and Hermione could be besties (so Hermione wouldn't be in the bathroom and wouldn't befriend the boys).

Honestly, it's been done tons of times - it would require a lot of work for it to be unique. Sorry :(
