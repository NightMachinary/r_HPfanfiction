  could you tell me what you mean by the whole premise

"OC girl/boy (sometimes from America, sometimes a time traveler, sometimes literally the author themselves) somehow finds themselves in Hogwarts, befriending Harry and going on the canon adventures with them"

  and not follow the series

Yeah something original would be nice. Or find an interesting branching off point where the introduction of your new character derails canon events. Don't make me sit through the same Troll in the bathroom encounter, but now there's also Susan McCarthy from America, wielding her special wand inherited from her grandfather with a thunderbird core, saving the day with a well placed tickling charm (PS: She's also incredibly good looking and fun, everyone is just in awe!).
