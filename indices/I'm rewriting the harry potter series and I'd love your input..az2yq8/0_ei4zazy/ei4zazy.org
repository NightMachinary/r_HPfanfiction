  But ultimately i want to create a fanfiction series you will want to read.

Self Insert / OC stories like this, especially if they rehash canon, hold very little to zero interest to me (and many other potential readers). If you want your story to have any chance to garner popularity you'd have to change the main premise.

If you don't want to do that I'd suggest to change your goals and write for your own personal enjoyment instead of your audience (not that there isn't a niche audience for this kind of fic).

Whatever you decide to do I wish you good luck on your writing journey.
