Mentioned in almost all post-War stories:

- certainly Harry in linkao3(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian) had one, not sure which one previous Northumbrian stories mention it.
- [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Harry Potter and the Summer After the War by Mrs_Granger]] mentions it as well
