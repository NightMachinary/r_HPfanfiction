There are actually quite a lot of Ravenclaw Harry fics as far as I remember. Most of them are with Harry having a different background (not the Dursley's).

I havenÂ´t really read a lot of them myself, but a quick search brought me this list: [[http://painless-j.net/blog/2007/11/15/themed-list-sorting-aus-by-character/]]

Note: it is not entirely up to date, but there are a lot of stories there.
