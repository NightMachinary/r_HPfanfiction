I've always felt that the best way to keep conflict is to cross over at age 14. Harry at the end of GoF would be best. He knows enough magic to be useful--shield, some hexes and curses, some transfiguration, some useful charms--but he can't do the stuff that's world-breaking (apparition, legilimency, imperius).

Ensemble casts just feel messy to me. Inelegant, arbitrary, convenient. They also reduce the interest of a crossover, which is the discovery of and adjustment to a new world, and in particular interactions between characters from the different worlds. What's the point of putting these characters in ASOIAF if you're replacing all the interesting ASOIAF characters with them? It feels borderline insulting to the ASOIAfverse to mutilate their universe so much my transposing so much HP into it. I always feel like crossovers should be written with respect for both fandoms involved.

Also, they tend to be written in such a way as to have the characters just going around making 4th-wall-breaking observations of their new world, winking at the audience, enjoying "witty banter" that's just not funny, breaking the tone of the world, breaking realism, and being just annoying in general.
