Easiest way to nerf magic without actually altering the magic system (which upsets many people) is not to give them wands and make them have to use their magical knowledge to figure out new ways of casting magic. Make it so their knowledge and experience of magic is still applicable (HP wizards seem to have innate magic, not environmental magic, so it would still follow the same rules), but they have to develop new tools to use it.
