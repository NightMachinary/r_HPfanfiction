Have you considered simply having an ISOT event, rather than character reincarnations? Have Hogwarts suddenly appear somewhere in Westeros (bonus points for it replacing Harrenhal). Watch the players of the Game of Thrones scramble to deal with the disturbances the appearance of Wizards have caused, while nobles all try to marry off their sons and daughters to these powerful new sorcerer. After all, the Valyrian Freehold was ruled by families who held sorcerous powers, so the canny nobles would seek to obtain this power at all costs, especially once they realize just how much power these "wizards" wield, compared to other practitioners of magic.

For inspiration on something like this, I would recommend reading 1632, by Eric Flint. The plot is that an American town from 2000 is sent into the middle of Germany during the Thirty Years War, and then we follow various characters as history is changed.

The best part of something like this is that you can easily have PoV characters from both universes - and I simply do not feel that a fanfic truly has ASOIAF in it unless we see some of the characters we know and love.
