Interesting, however in this case Tommen would be super OP because he has access to the best players in the game. All he has to do is imperious the key players and all the sudden game is over. In ASOIAF its the political players that matter. The one that acts first and have access to the players will be really over powered with no literal means to stop them. In this case, any one that starts from Kings Landing will be OP by default.
