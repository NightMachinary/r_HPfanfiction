The characters would probably start with very limited magical power because technically magic in ASOIAF was weak when the story started.\\
I didnt see Myrcella as an important figure because Daphne was not important nor magically powerful in HR world. Why would she be equal or as important in this world?\\
If people were able to break the spell through will power, than there must be consequences for Tom. Would be too easy for Tom to find this out the hard way and gets killed right away which defeats the purpose of having him in that world.
