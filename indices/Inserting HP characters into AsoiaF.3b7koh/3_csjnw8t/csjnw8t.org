Interesting Idea. Best cross over that I have read with ASOIAF is The Prince that was Promised or The Black Prince now.\\
What is the goal of the story though. What kind of arcs do you want the characters to go through and grow as a result? Example might be Harry and Hermione learning valuable lessons that this world is not theirs. If you are just in this world you will get wrecked. You must learn how to balance justice and power in order to be an effective leader and achieve the goals you want. ASOIAF is a much harsher world compare to HP and I hope your story can reflect that.
