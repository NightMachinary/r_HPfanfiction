I agree this is an amazing story that just sucks to be left unfinished, let's hope that one day changes haha. Anyhow I'm not really sure there is anything as similar as you want to this story as I don't know what part of it interests you the most besides interesting magic.. but I liked this one very much and ran across it searching for something to replace "What you leave behind". linkffn(7469856) Heads up though, this story is also unfinished :/
