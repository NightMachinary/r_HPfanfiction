Read manipulative/evil!Dumbledore much?

I'll try to answer some of your points:

1) Dursleys: firstly they are his only living relatives. By all laws and custom they really are the only legal and reasonable guardians for Harry. Even if there were other choices Dumbledore chooses healthy and alive Harry over potentially dead and blinded by fame Harry. Secondly how was he to know that Dursleys would not provide the best care for Harry? He is not a seer, nor is it his job to oversee Harry's life every moment. Despite all the verbal abuse by Dursleys Harry grew up reasonably healthy, strong minded and did not show any overt signs of abuse or neglect. Ministry? You are joking right? Ministry that is full of self -serving politicians, Voldermorts lackeys, ... Harry would have ended up with Malfoys in no time and then met an "accident" very very quickly. Leaving him with say Weasleys could have easily ended up with all of them dead or tortured to insanity. Anywhere Harry was placed would be a huge risk not only to Harry, but his carers as well.

2) Snape is a bad teacher with a grudge, but despite all that his students performed reasonably well. Even Harry. I think Dumbledore believes a bad teacher is a good lesson for life. Not all people need to be sugar tounged and bend over backwards. Despite all his flaws Snape was competent man and protected Harry in his own way. Besides Snape had to act in certain ways to make sure all the death eater kiddies would tell their parents what a great evil guy he is!

3) You accuse Dumbledore of orchestrating every hardship and fight for Harry? Get off your high horse. Dumbledore is only one guy (clever and powerful I grant you), but he hardly is capable to control and predict everything. I doubt he planned Lucius to unleash Basilisk or for Harry to sneak after the stone. Harry is to blame for lot of his own mischief. If he just went to professors / adults rather than charge in hot headed into situations ...

4) Train Harry? This one makes me laugh every timeI see in Indie/Powerful Harry stories. First and foremost Harry is an average guy - not exceedingly bring nor overly powerful. His attitude to studies is same as any other average teenage boy. He does well enough, but never brilliantly (except dada I suppose). Voldemort had life time of experience and a genius mind to boot over Harry. There is no one book Harry can learn and suddenly outclass grown wizards. Ultimately it is Harry who is to blame for his lacklustre academic performance than anyone else.

5) Even Dumbledore is stumped by Harry being placed into the tournament. He doesn't suspect fake Moody and the cup forms unbreakable magical contract so Harry has to compete. Of course we can guess at what the penalty might be. Loss of magic? Death?

6) Dumbledore set Harry on a path that he hopes might end with Harry winning (which it did). He knew Voldemort will go after Harry no matter what. Harry's life was in danger as long as he was alive. Harry could have chosen to run and hide, but he didn't. Dumbledore hardly forced him into anything. Like the line in the book - Harry chooses to go and fight head held high rather than cover and hide.

7) I very very very much doubt Dumbledore wanted to die. By his own admission he too was interested in conquering death. But when he knew his time was limited he chose to go out in a way that best aided fight against Voldemort.

Ultimately Dumbledore is flawed, is wrong at times, does make mistakes, is bit machiavellian, is outsmarted at times. Having said that he truly does try to give Harry as normal childhood as he possibly can given the circumstances. And then plans a way for Harry to ultimately win and live his life free of Voldemort.
