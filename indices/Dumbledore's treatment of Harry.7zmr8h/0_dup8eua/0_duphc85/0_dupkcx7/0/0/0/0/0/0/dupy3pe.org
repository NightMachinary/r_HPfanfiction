Eh. People are too eager to cry "Dumbledore knew the Dursleys would abuse Harry and he still left him with them cause he's an evil evil man" and point to that bit of conversation as proof. Personally, I think we're seeing a similar situation to Petunia's rant about how Lily was always turning teacups into rats: Perhaps based on the truth, but by no means the whole truth.

I think Dumbledore was hoping for the best. After all, Petunia had been polite in that letter to him, and even if Lily and her sister were estranged, there was a hope that Petunia, upon finding her nephew on her doorstep, would take pity on the child, take him in and raise him as her own.

On a related note, people also say that McGonagall tells Dumbledore that the Dursleys will mistreat Harry, but she doesn't. She just objects to the Dursleys because they're Muggles and the great Harry Potter should not live with Muggles, because mere Muggles won't understand. And she gets kind of peevish about a one-year-old throwing a temper tantrum... you know, like one-year-olds DO.

I don't blame Dumbledore for dismissing those arguments, but at the same time I can see how they might have, in retrospect, caused him to blame himself for not listening to McGonagall, and as such say "I knew Harry would suffer in that house." And as such, when Harry is raging, and Dumbledore prefers him to rage at HIM instead of Snape or the Dursleys, he uses this and says that he "knew." Which from a certain point of view is true.

I'm not saying my interpretation is the canon facts... just saying that things have to be seen in context and it's never a good idea to just jump to the worst conclusion immediately. That way lies knee-jerk character bashing and far too many terrible fanfics that fall over themselves trying to scream the loudest about how their least favourite characters suck.
