  "Dumbledore knew the Dursleys would abuse Harry and he still left him with them cause he's an evil evil man"

That's not what I'm saying. I'm not jumping to the worst conclusion, but there isn't any good conclusion to jump to from Dumbledore's own words. It's silly to just throw away his words as half-truths --- no, less than half-truths. He knew Harry would have a shit time at the Dursleys.

  I think Dumbledore was hoping for the best.

If I was to throw a kid into a snake pit, but hope for the best, that wouldn't make me any better of a person.

  After all, Petunia had been polite in that letter to him, and even if Lily and her sister were estranged, there was a hope that Petunia, upon finding her nephew on her doorstep, would take pity on the child, take him in and raise him as her own.

That was a decade before he gave Harry up to them. Again, hope isn't enough. He should have checked on Harry, at the very least.
