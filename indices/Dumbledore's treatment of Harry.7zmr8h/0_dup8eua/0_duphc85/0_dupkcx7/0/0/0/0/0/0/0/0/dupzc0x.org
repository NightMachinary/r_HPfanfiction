  If I was to throw a kid into a snake pit, but hope for the best, that wouldn't make me any better of a person.

You're talking like Dumbledore took it for granted that the Dursleys were monsters. There was no reason for him to assume this, other than that they were Muggles. Your "snake pit" parallel is flawed at best.

  That was a decade before he gave Harry up to them. Again, hope isn't enough. He should have checked on Harry, at the very least.

Not saying he acted without fault, I'm just saying it's a stretch to say that he knew the Dursleys would be abusive.
