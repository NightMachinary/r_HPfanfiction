I read exactly what you wrote. It's just that the quote /does/ dismiss everything you wrote. Do I need to give you the definitions of the words "Condemn" "Dark" and "Difficult"? Surely not. It's not an exaggeration to say Dumbledore knew Harry would have a shit life. You don't use those words positively.

If anyone is dismissing anything here, it's you. You're just throwing away Dumbledore's words as if they're nothing because it's convenient to your argument. Just because he's secretive and deceptive doesn't mean literally everything he says is false.

What reason would Dumbledore have to lie about that? The "He wanted to place blame on himself for Harry to rage at him" excuse is weak. Harry had enough to blame Dumbledore on. There was no need for Dumbledore to make something up to get Harry to blame him. Hell, Harry isn't even raging when Dumbledore admits this.

I'm not saying Dumbledore's evil. He had a choice. And though he knew Harry would suffer at the Dursleys, he thought Harry wouldn't be safe otherwise. I personally think that's a load of shit, but whatever.
