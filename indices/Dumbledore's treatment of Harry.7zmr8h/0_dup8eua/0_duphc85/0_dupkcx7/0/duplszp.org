How is that not exactly what I'm saying? He knew Harry would have ten dark and difficult years. No one describes an alright life like that. You wouldn't describe Teddy's life as dark and difficult because his parents died. That's absurd.

Dumbledore knew Harry would suffer at the Dursleys. The specifics like living in a cupboard, maybe not, but he knew he'd suffer. It's hardly up to interpretation.
