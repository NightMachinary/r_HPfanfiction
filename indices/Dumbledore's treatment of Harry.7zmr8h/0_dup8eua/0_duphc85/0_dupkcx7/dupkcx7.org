He doesn't, really. He just says "I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years." This can be taken in a number of ways, of course, but it's not an "I knew your aunt and uncle would lock you in a cupboard and neglect/abuse you for ten years." He could just as easily have been talking about Harry growing up without his parents or away from the magical world.

If there's anything we know about Dumbledore, it's that he'll happily take any insult or accusation onto himself, but he doesn't like it when anyone else is badmouthed. Note that during that conversation, when Harry is raging at Dumbledore, Dumbledore's reaction is to tell him "you're not angry enough at me, you don't know all the terrible things I've done, so let me make sure that you blame me for everything that's even remotely my fault." Also note that Harry several times tries to focus his anger over on Snape and the Dursleys, but Dumbledore keeps telling him "no, no, don't be angry at THEM, be angry at ME, focus all your anger on ME."

While Dumbledore was not the sort to tell an outright lie, he was no stranger to tell the truth from "a certain point of view." And I don't think it's out of his character to exaggerate how he "knew" Harry wasn't going to be happy, just to make sure Harry is angry at HIM and nobody else.
