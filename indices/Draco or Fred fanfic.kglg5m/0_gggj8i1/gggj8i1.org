I love reading about ocs. I usually also like new takes on Canon. Yet if its too repetitive I would probably drop it. Same goes for a love triangle if its too tropey.

The reason I will probably not read it, is you posting it on wattpat. Wattpat has a pretty bad reputation for horendous writing. And sadly I myself have yet to find a single fic there with good writing- which is why I stopped using the website. I occasional check it out if something on there gets recommended on reddit and storys there usually have interesting premises but the executen is simply not enjoable for me. I have the feeling that this sentiment is shared with a lot of older Readers, so if you wanna reach out to those maybe dont post on wattpat.

Also, you should have linked it here, if you wanted us to read it. Most ppl (me included) are WAY to busy to start searching it on our own.
