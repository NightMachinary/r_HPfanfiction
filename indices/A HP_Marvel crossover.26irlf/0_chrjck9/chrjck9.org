Have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] by Morta's Priest? Its a Harry Potter/Avengers cross-over where Harry gets transported into the marvel cinematic universe. I would highly suggest reading it, it is one of the best and highest quality fics I have ever read.

Here's the description:

#+begin_quote
  The world is breaking; war and technology are pushing on the edge of the unbelievable, and S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately attempts to keep the peace. The soldier and the scientist are not the only lights that push back against the darkness, however; magic will encompass the world again as the last wizard makes himself known.
