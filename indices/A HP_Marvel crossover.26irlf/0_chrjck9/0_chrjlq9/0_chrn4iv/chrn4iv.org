Here's another one I found last night [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6093972/2/Thinking-in-Little-Green-Boxes][Thinking in Little Green Boxes]]. I haven't read much of it but it's a Deadpool/Harry Potter crossover. If I find any others (especially x-men!) I will let you know. If you can remember the name of that fic I would love to read it.
