I honestly haven't. Will check it out. Although if you ever find other Marvel cross overs, albeit leaning to the x-men (Scott was right!) let me know? I've also read a fic where Potter was the master of the Hollows and was Bffs with he movie version of Tony Stark as well as Potter having a Pheonix animagus form. He also wasn't aging as well as a mechanic. Forgot the title of that fic though.
