I think a female werewolves would be very likely to miscarriage on the full moon when her body shifts into wolf form.

but if the baby comes to term by surviving 7-8 full moons well I haven't thought about it because the odd of the baby making it to term are astronomical

I definitely think female werewolves have it worse Then male ones, especially if they are turned as children like Lupin was.
