I have no idea where this information +leaked+ came from, but I'll vouch for the veracity of this claim on behalf of [[/r/Slytherin][r/Slytherin]].

--------------

Jokes aside, I think it's one of those things that Pottermore stated to show that, despite on how Slytherin is presented on the books (either because it's Harry's POV or because Rowling needed a "villain" inside the school), it's as good as a house as any of the others.

But I do agree that most of the fanfiction seem to use that very, very poorly. I do accept suggestions of some that might prove me wrong, though!
