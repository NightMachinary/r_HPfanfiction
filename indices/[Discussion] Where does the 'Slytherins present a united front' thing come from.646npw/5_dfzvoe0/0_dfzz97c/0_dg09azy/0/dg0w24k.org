Because the pool is always in public. They might or might not have gone “what the fjord, X” when in the common room, but if the person is resistant to learning and a genuine arsehole and from a privileged family (Draco much?), there simply isn't anything they can do. The pools can be cleaned but only after the person shitting in the pool stops doing it, and if they can't be forced to do that then /they/, not the rest of the slytherins, are still the problem.
