No, suppose Slytherin X is genuinely an asshole. In order to present a unified front, Slytherin Y must, at minimum, not call X out on his behavior, and thus /seems/ like an asshole by proxy. People then start treating Y like an asshole because of X, and you can see where this is going. Basically, someone shit in the pool and ruined it for everyone.
