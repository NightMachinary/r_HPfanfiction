  just a contrived means to force Slytherin into the outwardly-villainous role they occupied in the books, in order to explain away the apparent uniform nastiness of its members presented in canon?

You've got the right of it in my opinion. It's there to explain why we never see "redeeming" character trait from any Slytherin student. Instead of them getting together and saying, "in public we're going to be decent human beings" they chose instead to be assholes.
