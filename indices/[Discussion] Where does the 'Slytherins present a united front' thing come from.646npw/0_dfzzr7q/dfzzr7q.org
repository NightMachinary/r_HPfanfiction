I don't know if it started there, but Pottermore supports the idea. Here's a quote from the original Pottermore message to new Slytherins:

"For instance, we Slytherins look after our own -- which is more than you can say for Ravenclaw. Apart from being the biggest bunch of swots you ever met, Ravenclaws are famous for clambering over each other to get good marks, whereas we Slytherins are brothers. The corridors of Hogwarts can throw up surprises for the unwary, and you'll be glad you've got the Serpents on your side as you move around the school. As far as we're concerned, once you've become a snake, you're one of ours -- one of the elite."
