I'm a Slytherin on Pottermore, and while I'm drawing this from memory, Slytherin is described as a "brotherhood". Combined with what the sorting hat says in the books about friendships, it definitely gives a certain vibe. (I literally just woke up, so the words I'm looking for are not quite here yet...) I've always viewed it as a group of people who, even if they didn't like each other, they felt obligated to cover each other's backs, if only because they were all apart of the same "brotherhood", and such a group watches out for their own. Now, combine that with the general hostilities at Hogwarts... does that kind of make sense?

EDIT: [[/u/OversizedBucket][u/OversizedBucket]] grabbed the quote from Pottermore and it pretty much sums up exactly what I was fumbling to say.
