The problem with the "It's a brotherhood" approach is that such groups tend to lead to homogenised internal attitudes as well. Not many manage to cover each other's back all the time when "out in the field" yet keep detesting each other once they're in private. Facing a common enemy generally unites people, which is why that ploy is so often tried in politics.

Of course, people jockeying for positions does happen as well, especially when ambitious people work together, so Slytherin might have that kind of stuff as well.
