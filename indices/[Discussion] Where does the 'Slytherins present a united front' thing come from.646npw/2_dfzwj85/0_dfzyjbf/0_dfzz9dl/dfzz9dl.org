That's exactly it, I think. (Second paragraph) They are all ambitious and jockeying for better positions, and it's likely they have a certain mindset from their parents if most of the Slytherins are coming from pure blood backgrounds.

That being said, for me, I can understand the mindset to a certain extent. Growing up, my sister and I were absolutely horrible to one another, and we would constantly throw each other under the bus. BUT, if any outside person said anything about one of us, we'd fight for them to the bitter end. (And then rib them about it later.)

I know not everyone is going to agree on this, and these are just my insights from Pottermore, the books, and just the impression I seem to get.
