Well the Sorting Hat says ""Or perhaps in Slytherin, You'll make your real friends," so there is evidence that there is some degree of loyalty and companionship within the house. Also the wikia page lists Fraternity as one of the Slytherin House traits so that could be where they get it from too. In Canon, we do see some examples of Slytherins being loyal only to people within their circle like the Malfoys with each other or even Snape helping Narcissa out. Those examples suggest that there is some unity in the house for them to look out for each other even years after school. I personally take it as a headcanon that they stick together, at least outwardly.
