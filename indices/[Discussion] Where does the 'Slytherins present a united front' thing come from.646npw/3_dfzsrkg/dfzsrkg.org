Fanon does this because in general, all three houses, except Ravenclaw sometimes, hates their guts. It's a survival method in a hostile environment for them, given that they are first year students with little to no dueling ability. It's an easy way of writing that Harry's housemates won't hurt or humiliate him publicly, so he won't have to worry about them impeding in whatever plans he has.

It takes canon and blows up the animosity by quite a large factor.
