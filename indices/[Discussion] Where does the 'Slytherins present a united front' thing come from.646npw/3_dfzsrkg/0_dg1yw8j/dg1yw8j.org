Hm...while Harry is an imperfect lense that lets us peer into that world (and biased, too) that animosity isn't blown out of proportion that much IMHO (remember the other houses didn't protest when the House Cup was stolen from Slytherin by Dumbledore (who gave out points for what is basically rule breaking and should have points TAKEN - give them a reward for "Specials Services to the School" (which is a reward for a PERSON, not for a whole house, but don't give them points!)...hell, I don't know, but I seem to remember (it's been over a decade since I've read the original books!) that they were glad! So there's some truth there with that animosity!)
