Slytherin always seemed a lot like an entire house being a fraternity - And not the College Movie type. I'm talking stuff like the Germania, Cruxia, Rugia, Libertia,... Breeding grounds for nepotism and elitism, combined with a healthy dose of ideology and doctrine.

I always imagined them like that. Absolute and indestructible loyalty to the elite group they were told and trained to believe they are.
