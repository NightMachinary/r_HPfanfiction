I believe it is used as a mechanism to give non-Malfoy Slytherins an excuse for apparently liking/tolerating him in the books. If you want Harry befriending Slytherins, you presumably want those Slytherins to be likeable, so you need to give them some reason to excuse their association with Malfoy. The idea that they all detest him but pretend to like him in public due to Slytherin rules is convenient.
