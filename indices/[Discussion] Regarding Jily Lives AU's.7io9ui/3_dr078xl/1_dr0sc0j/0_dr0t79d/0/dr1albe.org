If you consider how Dumbledore talked about toms death, along with how Voldemort acted himself after his death he obviously has re-spawns. This is true but the time it would take to re-spawn without help would be much slower then we saw in cannon which took 14 years for him to come back. I assume that having multiple horcuxes would exponentially add onto the time it would take to re-spawn. This would explain why Voldemort fled to a safe place no one really knew, if he thought as a wraith I only have to wait a month or something he wouldn't bother getting help. This is my head cannon at least, and it helps explain away some of the idiotic actions of the villain and cements Dumbledore reasoning for not recognizing why Voldemort used horcruxes until the second book as if it had a statement stating how it'll help the maker regain a mortal form if its destroyed and it obviously didn't for Tom well its why its my head cannon.
