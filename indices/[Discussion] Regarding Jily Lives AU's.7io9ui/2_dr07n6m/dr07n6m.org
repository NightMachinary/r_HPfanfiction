If it's your story, you can just say that Voldemort never made horcruxes. There are plenty of good stories without them.

Alternatively, Voldemort's soul is anchored but his body isn't. If your James can win a duel there's no reason his body can't be destroyed the same as it was in canon.

There's not really a single answer to this question because your story should answer it.
