Or what if he had taken Ginny to the Ball? Here's a twist. What if he had done both? And what else in the story might have changed as a result?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9891912/1/The-Power-of-Quidditch][The Power of Quidditch]]: The outrage over having the Quidditch season cancelled was muted too quickly in canon.
