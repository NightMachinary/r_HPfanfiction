Most of the WBWL fics I have read were written well after OotP was published. All these have a tendency to bash Dumbledore, James and Lily, and either have Slytherin!Harry mentored by Father!Snape or Ravenclaw!Harry trained by Founders/Merlin/God who is amazing at Quidditch, gets 20 O.W.L.S. at O's, saves the school repeatedly and still gets ignored by everybody, other than a few close allies/minions.

Most of these are written in a manner which shows righteous teenage rebellion against abusive, neglectful parents. Feels like they're written by 12 year olds who didn't get hugged enough as a kid.

Some have James/Lily mindfucked by GreaterGood!Dumbles, which is, quite frankly, hilariously dumb. Harry has the potential to surpass Merlin, so I'll obliviate his parents and send him to his abusive Aunt so she can kill him before he becomes better than me. Harry comes to Hogwarts smacks everyone on their arse, kills Dumbledore and Voldemort with the same spell, restores his parents memories and lives happily ever after. One of the few ways of writing Alive!Potters while bashing Dumbledore.

A fair few have a decent James/Lily who raise both kids well, but an over-interfering Dumbles who is obsessed with figuring out the real kid of the prophecy. Sigh.

Most of these stories feature arsehole!Sirius and Remus, or supportive!Sirius and Remus driven away by the Potters, or both of the men dead.

Honestly, the amount of plot holes, extremely OOC behaviour, PowerfulIndependentLord-y!Harry solo-ing his way through everyone makes these stories quite shit.

This trope is not limited to HP either. PJatO has a fair few new Zeus/Poseidon!kid showing up, stealing everybody and driving Percy away. Just another example of RL people taking out their frustration on flawed canon characters by glorifying/god-moding their favourite hero.

Phew!
