Really, this is the basis of a lot of stories, not just WBWL stories. Most of the evil Dumbledore stories (which some but not all WBWL stories are) use this idea of “main character gets his justified revenge on wrongdoers”.

I think WBWL started because it gives the author built-in reasons for why Harry is mistreated. Harry is passed over for his brother (usually by accident, sometimes on purpose) and the wrongdoing is neglect or mistreatment (often the Dursley's).
