That's an interesting observation, and not one I'd really have thought of. I think I tend to think of the secrecy aspect of Monte Cristo to be important there - where no one knows who the Comte is. But I can see how it could have been an inspiration!

Too bad most WBWL fics don't manage to have anywhere near the justification for it happening as the Comte did, though.
