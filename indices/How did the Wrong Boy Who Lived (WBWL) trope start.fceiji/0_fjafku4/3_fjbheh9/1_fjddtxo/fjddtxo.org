It's funny - thinking about taking the story from the Comte de Monte Cristo and applying it to Harry (with the required changes to make it fit in universe) makes me think of it being super edgy, like the description of the fic you give - and yet the original is amazing.

Maybe it's because Azkaban Harry fics seem to have him as still a child or without making as much sense, or that I'm just more lenient to old french novels that have their copious meandering thoughts/asides.
