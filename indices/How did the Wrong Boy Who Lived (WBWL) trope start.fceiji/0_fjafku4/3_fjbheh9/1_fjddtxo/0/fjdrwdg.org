Probably a bit of both. :)

It's also likely because it works better in a historical, swashbuckler-esque cultural context. Back then, it was noble and fitting and acting upon one's responsibilities and all that. Nowadays, the idea of a betrayed man returning to revenge himself on those who wronged him is just a bit petulant. And I've never read a fic with that model that puts the effort in to make the modern cultural context fit.
