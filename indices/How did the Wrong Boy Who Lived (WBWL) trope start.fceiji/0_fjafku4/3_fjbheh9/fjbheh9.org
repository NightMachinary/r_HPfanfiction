There is actually one where a character named Dantes (clearly based on the Count of Monte Cristo) is a thing ( Harry takes the Dantes name as a symbolic thing ) and Harry turns Ginny into a dog (I think for trying to seduce him or something?), and there's a whole period of something happening in a courtroom I completely forget. It was a very cranky!Harry fic.
