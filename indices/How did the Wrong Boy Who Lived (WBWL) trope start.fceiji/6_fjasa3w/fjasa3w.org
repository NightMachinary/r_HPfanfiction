Perhaps someone wanted Harry to be more Slytherin in his vision of magic (there is no dark and light only power and intent) and that is not something that some think is possible if Harry is the BWL and so Gryffindor Golden Boy. I personally hate it. The Dursley's guaranteed for me that : Dark or Gray Slytherin Harry that is independent by their abuse just like Tom.
