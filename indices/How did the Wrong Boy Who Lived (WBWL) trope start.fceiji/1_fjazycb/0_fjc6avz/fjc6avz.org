I agree with you that it is the most influential WBWL fic and most likely responsible for many other stories in a similar vein.

But from what I remember I think it was published even earlier than 2005, bc I first read the earliest chapters of Saving Connor in 2002/2003 right before OOTP came out. Around that same time [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] deleted quite a few HP stories for having mature content and a lot authors took their stories down in protest. IIRC the author of Saving Connor also decided to rewrite the first few chapters of Saving Connor, which is how we get a publishing date of 2005.
