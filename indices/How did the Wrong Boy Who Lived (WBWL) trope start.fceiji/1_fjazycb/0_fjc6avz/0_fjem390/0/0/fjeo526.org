There was definitely speculation since the first book but definitely since book three, though I don't recall the fandom deeply exploring it until later. (This is like decades ago, though, so my memory is a bit rusty.)

I just did some digging and it looks like chapter 9 of Saving Connor may have been legit posted in/around Sept 2005 (based off of the author's LJ - [[https://lightningwave.livejournal.com/2005/09/24/][first entry]]). Nothing concrete, but the author was posting about the outline and progress at that time and responding to chapter 9 reviews. Fanlore is also saying 2005.

I also don't think it was 2002 cuz I vividly remember what apartment I was reading it in when it was first getting published, so that would have been anytime between May 2003 - August 2006. ðŸ¤£
