linkffn(Voldemort's Last Spell by Louis IX) has baby Harry sent 120,000 years into the past.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Alchemist's Apprentice by kmfrank) has Harry going back a hundred or so years, but IIRC the story isn't to the point of whether he returns or has to live through the intervening time.

linkffn(The Artificer by Olorin the Maiar) is a Marvel cross that has a Harry who had to live through a few thousand years to get back to the present.

esama had a story titled Unsealed, which had Harry go into the past and kill Dumbledore before he met Tom at the orphanage. Harry had then spent decades in Azkaban. It wasn't quite 100 years, and the story is gone, now, anyway, but I liked it.
