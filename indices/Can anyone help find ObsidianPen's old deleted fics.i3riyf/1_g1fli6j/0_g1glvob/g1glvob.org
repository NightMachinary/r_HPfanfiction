I've read all of her locked Ao3 fics.

DLP says all of the ones I listed have different summaries from the ones on Ao3, so she definitely didn't just rename them.

I just read her Tumblr posts and she says she might take up Enticingly, Divine, and Incendiary again after she's done with some of her other projects, so there's hope I guess.
