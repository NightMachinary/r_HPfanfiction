Roundabout Destiny is a Hermione centric fic that I really enjoyed with no Malfoy.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8311387/1/]]

Hermione's destiny is altered by the Powers that Be. She is cast back to the Marauder's Era where she is Hermione Potter, the pureblood fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year.

4 O'clock in the Morning is also Hermione centric with Malfoy but not a pairing of the two. Worth the read though:

Post-DH by about eight months. Hermione gives her unexpected visitor some bad news.
