  The changing of appearance

Interesting... To me, it felt like a natural consequence of her having more tools at her disposal in particular and being more proactive about getting the things she wants in general. The story gave her a power-up, and she's making [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility][Mundane Utility]] of it. In canon, she needs single-use Potions and a lot of time to manage her hair, whreas in the fic, she can invent a spell to do it, so why wouldn't she? And, if she wants her teeth fixed, why not just get it done, rather than do nothing about until there is an extrinsic opportunity (Draco's hexing her), then lie to a medical professional about their original size (which is what she did in canon)? Where's the integrity in that?

  Also, the ridiculous Quidditch bookie stuff and the thing with Rebecca Gamp too. She's too Mary Sueish by this point.

Yeah, these are all fair points. Add to that her being the one to free Dobby rather than Harry. I still like the fic very much, but that bit was cringeworthy.
