I don't know... It's just far, far too much of a departure from canon for my taste. Also, I feel this Hermione is becoming too "generically pretty", in both appearance and character, and the characteristics that made me love the canon Hermione have all slowly leached out - her love of the library, her righteous indignation at things she doesn't think are ethical, her exasperation with Harry and Ron, her desire to follow the rules (and to break them when it means helping her friends), her humility (although some might see her as arrogant, I see her as simply brilliant and badly needing an outlet to express that brilliance), et cetera.

Overall, the term Mary Sue just describes her perfectly at this point. I long for a more nuanced portrayal that's not just the author masturbating.
