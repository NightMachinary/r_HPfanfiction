The changing of appearance (the hair, the teeth, the clothes, etc.) seems very, very self-aggrandising, and I just don't see anywhere in canon where Hermione cares anything for her appearance (before 4th year and the Yule Ball, that is). Mostly it just seems very contrary to the strong sense of personal integrity that Hermione has in canon - it just really, really turned me off around the 55th chapter or so.

EDIT: Also, the ridiculous Quidditch bookie stuff and the thing with Rebecca Gamp too. She's too Mary Sueish by this point.
