I don't remember any fics where Hermione is Girl-Who-Lived that made an impression on me, though my view is that Hermione has always had a "self-made" ethos about her that would clash with her being chosen by a prophecy, as opposed to he choosing to get involved. For the rest of the criteria, here are my recommendations. (As a warning, most of them are in progress, and some of them update very slowly.)

*/Favorites:/*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/][/Reign of the Serpent/ by AlphaEph19]]: AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

*My comments:* In Salazar's Britain, Muggleborns are taken from their families at the first sign of magic and placed into assimilation facilities, before being sent to war with barely any training (boys) and sent to do menial jobs and bear children (girls), with only the most promising of them getting to go to Hogwarts. Needless to day, Hermione is one of them, and she comes with some high and rather destructive ambitions... A Dramione 'ship is highly unlikely but not impossible; if it does occur, it will /not/ be the standard Dramione 'ship.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/][/Applied Cultural Anthropology, or/ by jacobk]]: ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

*My comments:* /Not/ an HG/SS fic. Hermione is sorted into Slytherin, where she has to fight for every ounce of respect she gets. She /does not/ get along with Draco, and not in any way that suggests potential for future relationship.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9950232/1/][/Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation/ by Robin.Drew]]: In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr

*My comments:* Loosely inspired by HPMOR and /Worm/, but without the over-the-top-ness of the former. Hermione /does/ appear to have a destiny of some sort, though we do not know what yet.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/][/The Arithmancer/ by White Squirrel]]: Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort.

*My comments:* Starts out very canon-rehashy, but eventually diverges significantly. The Trio is still there, but the dynamic is very different, and Hermione has a lot more interaction with other characters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7781192/1/][/Harry Potter Without Harry Potter/ by Nim-the-Lesser]]: "Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)"

*My comments:* Hermione gets pulled out of Hogwarts after the Troll Incident, but manages to trick her way into Durmstrang, where she manages to thrive nonetheless. However, it's not solely about her, with the others at Hogwarts (primarily Ron and Percy) having their own adventures, maintaining correspondence with her.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6948912/1/][/Reconnaissance/ by Albernheit]]: Or how to find one's way in a new world when secrets contain more secrets and trust is a questionable habit. AU, begins at the end of CoS

*My comments:* Hermione talks to Hogwarts. Kind of surreal.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9045882/1/][/A Pound of Flesh/ by Thomas M Riddle]] and sequel: AU: In her sixth year, Hermione engineers a way to reawaken Tom Riddle's diary. But forbidden magic has its risks, and she finds herself locked in a deadly battle of wits with the most dangerous teenaged Dark Wizard of all time. A game where the only way to win may be to prove the Sorting Hat's decision to put her in Gryffindor wrong. TW: Torture (some sexualized)

*My comments:* This one is relatively short, and has the advantage of being complete. Also, /not/ Tomione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/][/Harry Potter and the Witch Queen/ by TimeLoopedPowerGamer]]: After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

*My comments:* Told mostly from the point of view of shell-shocked veteran Harry (in his younger body), as he tries to guide a powerful!genius!Hermione to prevent her from going Dark this time through, while actually defeating Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8127137/1/][/Palimpsest/ by Larry Huss]]: Hermione gets some of the answers early. She has trouble understanding what all the questions are.

*My comments:* Hermione gets a telegram from her future self. The downside is that a big part of her actions are to facilitate Harry doing great things, though she manages plenty of her own.

*/Also worth a look:/*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9821720/1/][/The Stark Effect/ by NexusNebulous]] :In which the girl who might have been Hermione Granger is raised as Tony Stark's daughter, and the world is that much closer to imploding spontaneously. One know-it-all Stark was enough, thank you. *Includes other Marvel characters, i.e. XMen, Spiderman, etc.

*My comments:* Not quite sure what to think of this one, but the world needs more MadScientist!Hermiones.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10462402/1/][/The Snake Pit/ by cupcake0118]]: After she is expelled from her London prep school for setting a science lab on fire, Hermione Granger is visited by Professor McGonagall, deputy headmistress of Hogwarts. Finally feeling as though she has found her place in life, Hermione travels to Hogwarts. But when she gets there, she is sorted into a house which despises the very blood which courses through her veins.

*My comments:* A promising beginning of another Slytherin Hermione fic.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7296047/1/][/Rule of two, dreams come true/ by Darklooshkin]]: Whitetigerwolfs Dark Lady challenge. Hermione watches Star Wars at age six and tries to connect with the force. Now watch how a game of pretend turns into a journey to the dark side filled with -friendship and love? Yes, Harry's responsible somehow...

*My comments:* [[/u/Darklooshkin]] is an acquired taste, and the fic might be abandoned.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8614738/1/][/Darkest Witch of Her Age/ by darkrose0510]]: Hermione was known as the brightest witch of her age, but time and circumstances would soon change that. Who will survive a brilliant mind's descent into darkness? A dark Hermione fic'.

*My comments:* A bit emo, but she creates plenty of problems, that's for sure. Possibly abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10627176/1/][/Hermione Granger and the Tesseract of Merlin/ by Writingathing]]: (HPMOR spoilers.) HePMORmione Granger wakes up in hell and decides to leave. Somewhere in the mists of Scottish purgatory she meets an unusual society of witches and wizards, each with their own dark secrets and unusual powers, united by only one thing: their mutual desire to pulverize evil. They are the Society to Pulverize Evil Witches and Wizards. And Hermione wants in.

*My comments:* A cracky fanfic with many /Worm/ references (though not a crossover).

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8375078/1/][/Labyrinth/ by Kroontjespen]]: The mind of a prodigy is a scary thing. Hermione Granger's however is downright terrifying. AU. Slytherin!Hermione, Slytherin!Harry

*My comments:* A more Riddle-like, but recognizable, Hermione comes to Hogwarts, with Harry in tow.
