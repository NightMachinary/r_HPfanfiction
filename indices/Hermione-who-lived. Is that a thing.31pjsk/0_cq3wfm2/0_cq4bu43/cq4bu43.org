An acquired taste, am I? Well, you're right about that.

As for it being abandoned, well no. But there are some major problems in it I need to adress soon...

That being said, this is the second time in as many days that my fanfics have been noted as having strong Hermiones as characters. And I confess that, whilst I find myself flattered, I was also quite puzzled about it.

I mean, I am neither the best nor the most prolific of writers out there, though I do try my best.

And surely, there's more than a few fics where Hermione kicks an abundant amount of ass, done by authors who overshadow me at every turn?

Well, seems not. What the hell? Well alright then, since I'm already being cited for it, might as well make something concrete out of it.

You wish for a Hermione that kicks ass? You wish for a Hermione that solves problems more, ah, proactively?

You wish for Hermione Jean Granger, bushy, nerdy, outcast bookworm with an axe to grind, to become the hero, the protagonist, The One, the Saviour, prophecies and prejudices be damned?

Fine, I'll do it.

Maybe that'll remind people of that old axiom about wishes.
