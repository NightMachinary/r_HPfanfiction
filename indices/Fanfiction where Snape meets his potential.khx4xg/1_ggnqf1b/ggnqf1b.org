I don't like Snape but will agree he's a badass wizard-at Hogwarts probably the best after Dumbledore. The scene where Harry and him face off in HBP is great. He could have wiped the floor with Harry:

/“DON'T---” screamed Snape, and his face was suddenly demented, inhuman, as though he was in as much pain as the yelp- ing, howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them --- “CALL ME COWARD!”/

/And he slashed at the air: Harry felt a white-hot, whiplike some- thing hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground. Spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body,/
