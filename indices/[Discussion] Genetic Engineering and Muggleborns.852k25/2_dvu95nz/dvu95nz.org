You know, sometimes I wonder if in real life, all of the information grubbing and 'we need backdoors' and 'collect EVERYTHING' by various governments is an attempt to either catch proof of magic existing, or a method by wizards to monitor the muggle world and catch breaches in the Statute of Secrecy before they explode.

I also wonder; what /is/ up with muggleborns? If magic breeds true, genetically speaking (squibs as the exception rather than the norm), where do muggleborns come from? How do they have fully functioning 'human' magic, as opposed to 'goblin' magic or 'flobberworm' magic? I mean, random mutation in the genome is one thing, but muggleborns having magic is like someone being born with bioluminescent skin; it's an extreme, sudden difference in their physiology that shouldn't have any explanation in their genes.

...Oh, wait, it could just be a particular combination of recessive genes that makes it happen. But then if you take that explanation then you miss out on all the plot opportunities like 'muggleborns are actually changelings' or 'midichlorians exist'.

In any case, I think this particular subject (can magic be measured via genetic analysis) comes up in fanfics here and there, usually involving muggle/wizard wars; I read a bleak fic once where genetic scans were used by drones to identify magical humans and assassinate them in the middle of crowds, once, but I've also seen one or two where magic is by definition supernatural and impossible to analyse.

Myself, considering that Snape calls his potions class a subtle science and exact art, I would assume magic can be measured, quantified, and analysed. It fulfils the most basic criteria for testing, after all, and that's that it's reproducible (wave a wand a certain way, say a word, get the same effect).
