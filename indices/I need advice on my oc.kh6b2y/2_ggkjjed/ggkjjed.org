The main problem OCs face is that they end up too much like the author - in this case, you. You obviously idolize Hermione, Ginny and Luna, and this influence is leaking into your OC. You can see plenty of Self-Inserts disguised as OCs in a lot of fanfic, especially in this fandom. If you want to make the OCs stand out, then what you need is to differentiate your OC from /you/.

I think the most important thing to determine for an OC are their goals and fears. The OC is going to have a different history to you, the author - the neighborhood they grew up in, family dynamics, income bracket, school life, romantic life, hobbies and interests, all of it. So how has their experiences growing up affected their goals (things they're moving /towards/) and their fears (things they're moving /away from/)? Once you can figure these out, you can better predict how the OC would act in a situation.

My OC for a different fandom, Margaret, was abused as a child. As a result, her biggest fear is confrontation, especially when she knows she can't win. Therefore, she has strong perfectionist tendencies, she's highly likely to withdraw into herself, dislikes displays of emotion and dislikes crowds. Her primary goal, on the other hand, is to prove herself to be stronger than her tormentors; this in turn exacerbates her perfectionist and control-freak tendencies, leading to self-hatred and low self-esteem whenever things go less than perfectly.

Margaret is a fairly depressing example, I know, but she's my most developed OC and I thought it might be helpful to see what I meant.
