I like a lot of what you have so far, but it seems to me you have more of a bundle of character traits than a homogeneous union.

For example, maybe ditch the fiery character trait to lean into the dreamy one or vice versa. Or at least try to combine them wherever possible (ie. maybe she loves flying only on magical creatures and explores her more fiery side by breaking curfew to spend more time with them and to embrace her more imaginative side)
