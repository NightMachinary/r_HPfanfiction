#+begin_quote
  Seasons 1, 2 and 3 of RWBY, told through the eyes of Russel Thrush and his team. Friendship, drama, (hopefully) some humour to build up some characters with a lot of potential who, at the moment in the show, are fairly 2D. CRDL-centric, but with plenty of interaction with the other teams. Russel/Yang ultimately.
