Sorry to toot my own horn, but you might like some of my missing moments series. Most of them, but not all, focus on Harry at least in some way, and some are completely Harry centric. They're all stand alone canon compliant one shots during Harry's Hogwarts years and mostly focus on character exploration. Ones specifically from Harry's pov are later, starting around sixth year.
