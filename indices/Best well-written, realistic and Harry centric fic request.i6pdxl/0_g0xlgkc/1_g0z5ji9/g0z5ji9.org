This is so funny, but you are the one fanfic writer that I love! I was even going to mention it in my post like â€˜Does anyone know fic that is as well written and realistic as the one-shot fics by FloreatCastellum?' but then I though I should just keep it general. I re-read your work all the time and love it! I wish I could find more fic like that, it ticks all the boxes for me.

PS - your one shot with Ginny imitating Snape to Harry and Remus has made me laugh aloud in the most inconvenient places just thinking about it lmao
