  In other words if you're scared it's alright to use any level of violence.

If you're afraid for your life and somebody is pointing a mind-controlling lethal weapon at you, then absolutely. Self-defense is a thing I believe in. Shoot him dead.

  It's exactly what I said about favoritism.

I'm not sure what fanfics you've been reading where Harry accosts strangers and it's considered acceptable. Because it's not. I'd expect a stranger to react to Harry the same way if he did so.

  It's a very easy answer. Grabbing a stranger's arm without consent is definitely rude or even offensive gesture. No exceptions.

Yes that's part of my point, but even so that doesn't mean it's unacceptable in certain situations. For example, it's a bouncer's job to do things like that. It's uncommon, but I've also seen people reach out and lightly grab/squeeze a mostly-stranger's arm in the middle of a friendly conversation.

I'm not talking about just strangers though. Grabbing a friend or family member's arm is often totally fine. Kids certainly do that all the time.

  If you start grabbing girls on streets you can easily find yourself in prison.

That's.. pretty much my point? What are you saying here?

It's rather unlikely that you'd go to jail for grabbing a girl's arm then letting it go. But if you held on as she told you to stop, and others had to intervene? Yeah, you get penalized.

*Edit:* Shoot him dead was a bit flippant. It would be better to say put up a shield, and be ready to shoot him. Or just teleport away, if that's an option.
