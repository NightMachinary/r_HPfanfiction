  At the same time you created a situation when nothing has happened yet, but a wand from just a hand transformed into: a mind-controlling lethal weapon

Huh? It's been one entire time...

  This is favoritism when your heroes can read a situation as they want to justify their violent actions.
#+end_quote

Any given citizen can and should do the same thing. Somebody who hasn't been identified as law enforcement and who you don't know accosts you with a wand? Prepare for violence. No matter who it is.

I don't see any favoritism.

  What about 2 girls? 10? 100? And they can't say no, because they don't know about the offense?

  The problem with the “hand” analogue is that to make a grab it requires both physical proximity and very explicit gesture.

  A wand requires none of them and at the same time it's more dangerous than a hand can ever be.

What are you trying to argue here? That pointing a wand at someone should land you in Azkaban?
