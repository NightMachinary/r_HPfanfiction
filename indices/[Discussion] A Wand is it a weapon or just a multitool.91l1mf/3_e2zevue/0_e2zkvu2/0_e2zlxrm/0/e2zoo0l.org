  I'm not sure what fanfics you've been reading where Harry accosts strangers and it's considered acceptable.

At thr same time you created a situation when nothing has happened yet, but a wand from just a hand transformed into:

  a mind-controlling lethal weapon

This is favoritism when your heroes can read a situation as they want to justify their violent actions.

  It's rather unlikely that you'd go to jail for grabbing a girl's arm then letting it go

What about 2 girls? 10? 100? And they can't say no, because they don't know about the offense?

The problem with the “hand” analogue is that to make a grab it requires both physical proximity and very explicit gesture.

A wand requires none of them and at the same time it's more dangerous than a hand can ever be.
