  Is it a weapon that should be used by children under strong supervision
#+end_quote

A wand is basically a physical representation of a wizard's magic, it seems. Strictly supervising a child's use of it would be a bit like leashing them. Maybe necessary for some cases, but the older they get, the more insulting and humiliating it is.

  Or is it just a multitool and no one bothers when someone points a want towards them?
#+end_quote

Seeing as it's the weapon of choice of both militaries and terrorists, it's certainly more than just a multi-tool. Just like many things in the real world, it's dependent on familiarity and trust. If a mother points her wand at her kid, no big deal, she's just going to wipe stray bit of bbq sauce off their chin or cast a warming charm, something like that. If a stranger in a dangerous place points a wand at someone, they'd best treat it as if the next words out of the stranger's mouth are going to be "bombarda".

Think of it this way: is it okay for someone to grab your arm? It's not a yes or no answer, it depends on the situation and the person in question.
