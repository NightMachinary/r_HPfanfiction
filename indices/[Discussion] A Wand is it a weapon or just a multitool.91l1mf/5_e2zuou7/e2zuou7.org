We learn that the very first spell used in Charms class may be deadly if used right. Its a tool, but a mighty one. And even a carpenters hammer can crush your skull. Or in different words: Not all tools are weapons, but all weapons are tools. Now the wand is probably the most amazing multitool in existence, as it can manipulate the fabric of reality in a multitude of ways. A lot of these ways include possibilities of inflicting harm.

I do think that, in general, pointing a wand at someone is at least rude, and depending on context may be interpreted as possible threat, or benevolent action (healing,...). But doing so without clear intent communicated is something a wizard or witch should not do if they want to be socially acceptable. I personally would be rather nervous if a stranger points his multitool at me which may or may spew magic napalm at me, or repair my shoes... who knows?
