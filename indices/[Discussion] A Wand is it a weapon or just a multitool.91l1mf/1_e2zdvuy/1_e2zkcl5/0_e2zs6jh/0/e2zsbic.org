I see the analogue, but also I see a problem with it. For a knife to became a weapon it requires both physical proximity and explicit action.

With a wand you can cast a curse from significant distance and with just several worlds.

I wonder how would you distinguish between someone using his wand as a tool from him preparing to curse you?
