Hmm, let's say that the swiss army knife has a gun attachment as one of the fold outs. If you see someone load the gun, it is time to go lethal.

In universe 99% of witches and wizards cant point cast anything, they use wand movements and words, i.e. load their guns.

IN real life people are allowed to carry guns and even bring them out with other people around without everyone thinking it's a lethal attack. However if you are arguing with someone in anger, and then one of you pulls our your gun/knife...it's go time. Even if they were never going to shoot you, it is a threatening gesture. Hogwarts is much much to lenient on students attacking one another with deadly weapons.

One of your other examples is everyone is ok with Harry,Fred and George pranking people. I am firmly on the opinion that pranking people is definitely wrong, and should Draco/Slytherins feel threatened would be in their right to attack back. It's just a prank bro is not an excuse.
