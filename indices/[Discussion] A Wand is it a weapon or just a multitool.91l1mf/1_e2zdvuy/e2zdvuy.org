if someone raises a hand to you, do you flinch because you are anticipating a slap? Or do you bring your hand up for a high five? Do you grasp the hand for a handshake? Do you bat the hand away because you don't like people in your personal space? Are they just gesturing? Depends on the situation and person.

Why can't it be both a multitool and a weapon. Like a knife. Great in the kitchen. Great in a fight
