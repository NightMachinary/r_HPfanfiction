The three biggest limitations of a wand are Stability, range and durability. It is very difficult to accurately aim something from the wrist, therefore the effective range is very limited, especially since there is no sight attached. And wands are fragile, something you do not want on a battlefield. Magic in HP does not have a limited range per se, so the easiest way to get an advantage would be a way to get accurate, ranged magic.

The easiest solution would be rig the frame of a submachine gun or something of similar dimensions to give you a place for your other hand and at least iron sights. A full staff would be more useful in battle, but also rather bulky.
