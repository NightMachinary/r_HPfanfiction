Something more suitable for ranged combat, like a wand that can be aimed (put it on something akin to a rifle stock to make aiming easier). Staffs are supposedly a thing in the HP world. It would be rather unwieldy, but certainly better suited for combat, especially defensive one like the battle of Hogwarts.

And wands are rather easy to break (thin, long stick), so maybe make them more sturdy or fit them with a protective cover.
