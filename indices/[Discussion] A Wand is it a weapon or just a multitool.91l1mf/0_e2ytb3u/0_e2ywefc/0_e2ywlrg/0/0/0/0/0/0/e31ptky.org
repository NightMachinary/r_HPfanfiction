I didn't ignore any of your comment, it was a short comment so I responded to the meat of it (that spells applied to wands might prevent magic use). The first suggestion (that highly magical things can't have magic easily applied to them) was clearly inapplicable since magic is used on wands in canon, simple magic at that.

Wands can be repaired (repair services for wands are mentioned in canon). The Elder Wand instant was special because of how damaged Harry's phoenix core wand was (the feather was just barely still joined). And the explanation you now have conflicts with the earlier one. Summoning and Disarming are magic obviously, but they didn't make it impossible for the wands to use magic.

If anything, the likely explanation is the the Unbreakable Charm can only be used to stop certain kinds of damage, such as shattering. Like, Hermione cast the charm on the glass container she caught Beetle-Rita within.
