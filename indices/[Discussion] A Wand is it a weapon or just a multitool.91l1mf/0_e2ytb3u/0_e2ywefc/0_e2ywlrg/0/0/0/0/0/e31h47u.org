First you have to understand that any explanation we give is just going to be covering for Rowling's poorly thought out magic system. I can give explanations, you can give workarounds, but that doesn't change that wizards in the story don't do it. We can either say there's a good reason, or say they're horrendously stupid.

Disarming charms and summoning charms are like a physical force applied to the wand, not changing the properties of wand itself. We haven't seen anybody transfigure a wand, for example.

Mending a wand was only done with the Elder Wand so it's not safe to say that it's something that anyone can do at anytime.

You seem to have ignored two thirds of my comment.
