  pointing a wand at someone is a rather large faux paus in the Wizarding World

Agree. I think it's the most right way to do it.

  Strong supervision I think cheapens that which is magic; as something whimsical to be explored rather than something with rigid rules and guidelines.

To be fair canon magic has very strict rules and guidelines and the main purpose of Hogwarts (or any other magical school) is to teach them.

If magic is wild and chaotic, it wouldn't be possible to research it, classify it and create disciplines around it (charms, transfiguration, arithmancy, etc.)
