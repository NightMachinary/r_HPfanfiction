It is my personal headcanon that pointing a wand at someone is a rather large faux paus in the Wizarding World

As to a wand being a weapon? I would say it is a tool. The vast majority of the time a wizard uses a wand they aren't trying to kill someone but rather perform a harmless piece of magic. A tool can be misused and become a weapon, but it remains at its core a tool. Strong supervision I think cheapens that which is magic; as something whimsical to be explored rather than something with rigid rules and guidelines.
