It's easy to think Wizards are ignorant of a lot of muggle weaponry and warfare because the purebloods we know of don't display a lot of familiarity with the muggle world or inclination to learn about it, if not outright disdain for it. Voldemort most assuredly knows about WW2 and the Blitz, having lived in both worlds at the time, but I imagine for a lot of people at the time had an "out of sight, out of mind" mentality.

People in general just don't care about wars on distant shores, wars they can't see or feel the effects of, and magic is very good at getting people to ignore things, I think. It's entirely possible that the magic that shields Diagon Alley from muggle sight and access protects it from muggle attacks as well, and if that were the case, why would they care about muggles killing each other?

I don't fly one way or another personally. A well written story can make anything work. But I also wouldn't be surprised if a Lucius Malfoy wouldn't know what an AK-47 was either.
