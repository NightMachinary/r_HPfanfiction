I do believe that wizards (at least older ones) have some basic understanding of bombs and muskets, but don't you think that during the reign of Voldemort, there would have been some censorship. As opposed to Grindelwald, who just believed in wizard-superiority and did think that Muggles were capable (foreseeing WW1) and really thought they were a threat, Voldemort believed that they were insignificant and had no power. Because of this, even if he knew of the power they possessed, he most likely encouraged Wizarding Society to think of them that way too; as less powerful and insignificant. During the First Wizarding War and Voldemort's reigns, Wizard Superiority Complexes were enhanced, and so no one really suspected the power of Muggles. Also, even though Tom Riddle grew up there, I highly doubt Voldemort would want to interact with Muggles. Also, the people in the stories who are portrayed as being ignorant about Muggles were likely not taught about them. Obviously, at some point in time, even the Weasley's were Supremicists, hence the whole "My entire family's pure..." and "Mum's cousin is an accountant, but we don't really talk about him" thing. Even if they weren't hell bent on the eradication of Muggles, he topic is still stigmatised in the Wizarding World.
