Assuming you mean harnessed electricity, you're completely wrong. Bombs have been getting used for literally a thousand years. There are records of China using them as far back as the 11th century. So it's pretty silly to think wizards don't know what they are, especially considering bombs have literally flattened cities that they have lived in.

There are plenty of examples showing wizards aren't "that ignorant" about the muggle world.

- Draco Malfoy knows about helicopters at eleven years old.

- Hagrid and Arthur Weasley know about guns, which have been around for centuries, so it's likely the average wizard at least has some idea of what they are.

- There is a steady influx of Muggle-borns coming into the wizarding world, who would spread their knowledge.

- The majority of the population is Half-blood and Muggle-born, which means most wizards have a connection to the Muggle world.

- Bombs have existed for a thousand years, and the World Wars leveled cities. Wizards would have noticed this.

- Kingsley Shacklebolt, a Pure-blood, works for several months under the Prime Minister blends in so well with Muggles that no one notices a thing, including the Prime Minister who knows about magic.

- The Ministry of Magic has a whole department dedicated to dealing with the Muggle world (Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee). The visitor entrance is also a phone booth.

- Their use of muggle vehicles (cars, trains, buses, etc)
