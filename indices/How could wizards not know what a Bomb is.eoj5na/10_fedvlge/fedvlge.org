It wasn't "the second world war" to them though, and it didn't end with two Nuclear strikes, and it probably had nothing to do with Japan. That was the muggle side of the war. What makes you think wizards cared about what was happening on the muggle side? We also don't know how impacted they were by the london blitz, or the war in general.
