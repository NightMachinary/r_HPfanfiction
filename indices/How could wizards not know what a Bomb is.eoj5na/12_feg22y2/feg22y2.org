I'm usually ok with "They don't know what an atomic bomb is". They are not demonstrated often, you learn about it in a decent history class, usually well above the age that the worlds split off in. It is entirely reasonable for wizards not to know about atomics (or disbelieve them).

​

Bombs in general? not so much. Wizards would know about explosions (as they can be magically caused). Hell, they use muggle explosions to hide magical incidents.

​

The one that really gets me? Fannon wizards always have no clue about the man on the moon. Rockets are not so rare that you would never observe one, and several times in very recent history a good chunk of the worlds attention has been toward space endeavors. It is a whole lot more likely to come up in conversation than atomics and be depicted in culture.
