It's just mugglewanking by bad authors.

Voldemort was living in London during the Luftwaffe bombing, there's no chance he doesn't know what a bomb is. He also would know what atomic weapons are, and what they do.

I don't mind the use of bombs or whatever in fanfic. But the surprise factor of the bomb can only work once on Voldemort - he should respond with the same tactics in far greater intensity IMO. Kind of like how he does in this fic. linkffn(The many Deaths of Harry Potter).

That fic does have Voldemort do it, but it sort of forgets that towards the end, which is a shame. Still a good fic though.
