You forgot it's called a fanfiction for a reason. They just for fun. Never meant nor need to make sense.

Is evil manipulative Dumbledore ff make some sense? No they don't. They just make what is canon and what's non-canon. Even if such thing was contradicted by the author since day 1. They don't give a flying fuuuuck. It fan fiction. Ya they dumb, but most fanfiction are pretty fucking dumb, and the rest are still dumb in some way.
