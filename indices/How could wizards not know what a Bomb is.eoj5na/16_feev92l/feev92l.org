I read one fic where Quirrell brought a shotgun to class (wasn't possessed) and started waving it around and every half-blood and muggle born kid just screamed and the pure-bloods were wondering why

Then Quirrell shot all the purebloods one by one and himself (apparently had mental issues)

Sadly I don't remember the name
