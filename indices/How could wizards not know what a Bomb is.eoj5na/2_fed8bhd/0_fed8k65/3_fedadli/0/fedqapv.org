Arthur is the Head of the " Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office", which is (from what we see in OotP) a tiny office with 2 members.\\
It's not that great of the job, not the lowest of the ladder, but not far from it. As for Arthur competency, I don't see any raison to put it into doubt. His job consist into :

- Identify enchanted Muggle artifact
- Confiscate it if it's considered illegal
- Potentially arrest/ give a fine to the culprit (or maybe he doesn't even do this part and it's the police, canon not really clear on that point).
- Obliviate any Muggle in accord with the Treaty of Secrecy (once again, maybe another office does this)

At no point during his job does Arthur need to know "how" muggle things work. He only have to know if the item is enchanted (which seem a skill more likely to be learnt in Charm than in Muggle Study). He doesn't even need to be able to mingle with Muggles, since anyone he interacts with is either "in the known" (like a Muggleborn parent), or will have no memory of it.

Also, he is not "the" expert of all things muggle, if you want one, you better look for a Muggle Studies teacher, or the one who wrote the books they use.

And finally, before CoS and Harry, the closest link between Arthur and Dumbledore was the fact that his 2 brothers in law were in the Order (he and Molly were not),pretty weak reason to do a favor. So I can think of a lot of reasons about why Arthur got this job other than /Dumbledore pulled some strings/.

- Not a lot of people wanted this job (since it's not that great), and from the one wanting it, Arthur truly was the best (the ministry prefering someone good at charm rather than someone knowing everything about muggles)
- The Muggleborn who were in this office were killed during the last war, and he got promoted by virtue of being alive.
