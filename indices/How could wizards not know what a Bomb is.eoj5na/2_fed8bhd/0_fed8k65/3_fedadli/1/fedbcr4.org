That not quite right. He's the Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts. Based on the title all he needs to know is what a 'Muggle Artifact' is and have it confiscated if necessary. It's a literal impossibility for one man to know the whole and breath of an entire world, let alone one he doesn't actually live in, and even more so with a family as large as his to support. I don't think there's a person alive who can.

It's possible Dumbledore did pull some strings for him, we don't know. It's possible the man's a tour de force on the clock and we just haven't seen it because Harry hasn't seen it. Any speculation on the subject is just that, as it's not in the books or confirmed via Pottermore or JK herself. I will say though that if Albus did do such a thing I doubt Arthur knew about it.
