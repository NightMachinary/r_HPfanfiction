His job is basically to confiscate and de-enchant enchanted muggle objects that fall into Muggles' hands. He doesn't really need it to know much about the muggle world to do that, though it would probably help. But if some Muggles got a doll that tried to murder them or something, they will be Obliviated anyway, so it doesn't really matter if Arthur messes up talking to them.

Arthur is the well-meaning racist as opposed to Voldemort sympathizers, who thinks about himself as progressive while talking down to Muggles and never making any effort to actually learn about them.
