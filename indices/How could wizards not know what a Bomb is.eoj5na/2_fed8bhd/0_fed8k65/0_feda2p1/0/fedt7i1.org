I think Arthur was shunted to that department because that's where the losers/idiots go where they can be kept away from subtler and more important work. Best to keep people like him fixing magical pranks among muggles.

The wizards who are actually competent among muggles would be found, I think, in the departments of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, (mainly in the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, Obliviators, and the Muggle Worthy Excuse Committee), International Magical Cooperation and some among the Aurors.
