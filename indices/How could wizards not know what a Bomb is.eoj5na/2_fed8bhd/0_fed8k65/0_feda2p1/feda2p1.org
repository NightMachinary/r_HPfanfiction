There's a very real possibility that Arthur Weasley was the only person really interested in the job, or at the very least was the least likely to abuse it in malicious ways. I certainly can't recall anyone else in the books interested in 'Muggle stuff' to the degree Arthur is. Could be any number of things really. The books take place from Harry's perspective, and there's a great many things he's ignorant of, as they just don't fall into his orbit of interests.

And Arthur is fairly talented in his niche of interests. He did enchant a car to fly, turn invisible, and gain a degree of semi sentience after all, even as ignorant of the whole as he may have been. To compare the man to Fudge, who hides his head in the sand and actively sabotages any potential allies, especially one as potent as Albus Dumbledore, is a bit unfair.
