I definitely think you're onto something. It would have helped us if we knew more about the Muggle Studies program, and whether Arthur had ever taken the course.

My personal headcanon is that Arthur took Muggle Studies before their books addressed electricity (or never took it at all) and therefore has never heard someone pronounce the word. He definitely has enough talents that it can't be handwaved away as him being an idiot.
