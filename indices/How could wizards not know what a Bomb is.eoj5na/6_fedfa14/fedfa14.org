It seems the phrase "Know your enemy" would come into play here. Would the average Wizard know anything about muggle weapons? No, they probably have no reason to. Would Voldemort? Almost definitely so. He would want to know what it is he is up against. A lot of people use Arthur Weasley as an example of how little Wizards know about muggles. But I feel like the reason Arthur's knowledge is lacking is because he is sort of like a Weeb. He romanticizes and idealizes all the positive traits pertaining to the culture of his obsession while refusing to acknowledge any of the negative ones. Voldemort and his Death Eaters have no such attitude.
