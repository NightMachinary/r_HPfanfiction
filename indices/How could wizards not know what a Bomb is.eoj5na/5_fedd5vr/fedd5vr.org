I mean, I entirely agree with you on that, or at the very least that the Wizards in important spots would have to keep up with that sort of thing. If there's a Wizard who maintains the protective magics on Diagon Alley, for example, they'd have to know that bombs were a thing and how to cast the magic that protected against them. There are arguments against that, though.

For everyone else for whom the information isn't immediately relevant, I can kind of understand why they might not go beyond 'bombs are the boomy things, right?'. If you don't use that information, why would you bother learning it? Bombs haven't fallen on England in forty years, so it's not an active need to protect against them. Hell, it could just be that some paper-pusher in the Ministry thought "It's been forty years since those dastardly Muggles did the bomb thing, surely we can cut the budget for those bomb protections and spend it on something important like Quidditch". And if you doubt that might happen, would a government that supposedly (not sure if this is fanon or canon) cut their police forces drastically over the ten peace years since Voldemort 'died' bother spending money on protections that hadn't been needed for three or four times as long?

If the information isn't useful or used somehow, it'd be left in a book somewhere for later reference and forgotten about across the decades since 1945. Especially if you're one of those people that are convinced that the Muggles are merely animals, you're not going to bother learning about it. The young magicals who can barely be bothered to learn magic certainly wouldn't.

Take Occlumency, for example. Wizards know that there are people around who can literally read their minds. Every thought, feeling, memory, etc, can all be seen by these people. Yet, it's not a mandatory class and we're only told of two or three (IIRC) people in the series that know about it. If it's safe 99% of the time, Wizards don't seem to really put in the effort to prepare for that 1% chance of FUBAR. There are other examples of that "Eh. It'll be aight." mindset around the series, but it is a pretty British mindset of not really giving too much of a fuck. We're a very tired, laissez-faire people.

Secondly, sure the older Wizards would at least know that bombs exist and have experience of being around them, but knowing that a thing is a thing doesn't necessarily mean you know anything about a thing. For instance, I'm a twenty-something Western kid with easy access to google, libraries, and a dozen ways of acquiring information on 'Muggle society' that Wizards wouldn't necessarily have without some moderate effort - I know what a bomb is and I have a vague (emphasis on vague) conception of how it works, but I couldn't for the life of me tell you how to protect against one or even how to put one together.

I agree it's more than likely utter Mugglewank bollocks, but there are some possible explanations for it. A good fic can make anything work and all that. :)
