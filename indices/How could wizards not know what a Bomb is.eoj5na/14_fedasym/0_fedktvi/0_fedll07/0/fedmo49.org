Bombs have been around for literally for hundreds of years. There's recorded use of them dating back to the 11th century, if not earlier. And the word itself comes from the Latin /bombus/, which in turn comes from the Greek /βόμβος/ (proununced /bombos/).

The idea that wizards wouldn't know the word bomb or what they are is utterly ridiculous. Most wizards are half-bloods, there's a steady influx of muggle-borns, and bombs have been around for about a thousand years.

If even the children of pure-blood supremacists know about helicopters, something far more complicated and recent than Bomba, then it's safe to say the general wizarding populace knows about bombs.
