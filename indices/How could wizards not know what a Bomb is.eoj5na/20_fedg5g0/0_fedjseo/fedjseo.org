September 7, 1940 - May 11, 1941

Basically all of his third year. And you know that he didn't go back to the orphanage for holidays. He hated that place.

Edit: honestly having Tom grow up around this time adds a lot of complication to /Harry Potter/.

I mean, civilian evacuations began in September 1939 so its a bit conspicuous to have so many kids running around King's Cross on Hogwarts travel days.
