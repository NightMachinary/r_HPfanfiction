and regardless of when exactly voldemort grew up, he certainly would have know what a bomb and a gun was, he's basically a muggleborn. And given his obsession with staying alive, it stands to reason he would have looked for a way to survive getting shot or blown up. A lot of my favorite fics have a voldemort whose muggle hatred is born out of a deep deep fear from the second world war that the muggles were going to destroy the world and kill everyone. Which well given MAD during the cold war and the way us Muggles treat the environment, may not be completely irrational. Wizard kind probably would be better off without muggles and our unmanageable population growth and WMD's.
