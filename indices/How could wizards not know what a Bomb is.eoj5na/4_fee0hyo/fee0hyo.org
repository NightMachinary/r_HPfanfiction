If you do any historical research on explosives and firearms and then correlate the timelines with the Statute of Secrecy, it becomes obvious that wizards aren't ignorant of them due to segregation from muggles. Bombs and guns pre-existed the Statute and were not only very effective but were also commonplace. This means that wizards of the time wouldn't have seen them as a "muggle thing" anymore than they saw wheels, shoes, hats, or swords as exclusively muggle things. My thought is that they really didn't start distinguishing muggle innovations as distinct from their own until the industrial revolution, or possibly even the second industrial revolution.

Their contempt for firearms and bombs then is likely due to the fact that they see them as obsolete. Magic is fully capable of conjuring bullets and accelerating them, and without any issues of running out of ammo. It is also fully capable of conjuring an explosion without any need of lugging around heavy and dangerous equipment.

In fact, it's likely that wizards possessed spells that were upgrades of greek fire and slings thousands of years ago. And then developed defenses against them. Which is why they don't use them anymore --- they already figured out basic defenses against them that are so effective that they moved on to other means of attack.

I mean, logically, if wizards were vulnerable to bullets, they wouldn't be getting machine guns /instead/ of their wands. I always roll my eyes when I see people say that they should carry a gun in their off hand. Why? Their wand /is/ a gun. But they don't use it to expel projectiles because evidently that's an inferior strategy.

My theory is that wizards just have enchantments on them that vanish anything that flies at them faster than 50 m/s, among others. That covers everything from arrows up. There's magical workarounds of course, but muggle attacks would be simply ignored. Same with bombs. Maybe wizards are immune to non-magical fire (flame-freezing charms always annoyed me as a particularly silly defense against burning at the stake anyway).

I've gone into this direction of exploration in a great deal more detail [[http://brilliantshard.wordpress.com][in my own AU]], but that's some of the pertinent thoughts to this discussion anyway.
