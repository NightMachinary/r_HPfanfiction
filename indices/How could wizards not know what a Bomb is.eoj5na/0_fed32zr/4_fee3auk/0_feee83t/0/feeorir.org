I agree re: ministry bigotry.

At the world cup its suggested that during Hogwarts years, young people are more in touch with muggle fashion and essentially implied that even half-bloods or perhaps even muggleborns fall out of contact as they age. (I suppose they've got no qualifications for the muggle world, not everyone could accurately make fake documents, references, etc and - let's face it - the ministry is extremely unlikely to have a 'helping muggleborn returnees' department.)

I think the film versions of the uniforms caused this to be lost to most people (fics tend to bias towards the film uniforms and people outside fandom aren't that invested). In particular, the books give nothing to suggest that trousers are part of the uniform - it's not on Harry's list and the robes can't be open fronted because when Snape is turns upside down his pants (UK) are seen by all.
