  The most exposition we get to that is through Arthur Weasley, who seems to be as close to a Muggle expert/enthusiast as we see in the magical world - and he appears super clueless to the realities of modern muggle life and capabilities.

Anybody who spent even a few months in the muggle world or in contact with a muggle would know more than Arthur, and we know half-bloods are prevalent and likely increasingly common. Any muggleborn will obviously blow his knowledge out of the water. His position as a muggle expert in the Ministry isn't evidence that wizards as a rule know nothing about muggles, it's evidence that the Ministry is astoundingly bigoted and he got his job because he's a pureblood.
