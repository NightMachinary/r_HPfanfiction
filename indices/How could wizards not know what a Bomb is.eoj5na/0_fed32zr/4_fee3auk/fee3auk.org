It's because of how absolutely clueless wizards seem to be about the muggle world. The most exposition we get to that is through Arthur Weasley, who seems to be as close to a Muggle expert/enthusiast as we see in the magical world - and he appears super clueless to the realities of modern muggle life and capabilities.

Then, logically, it seems to make sense that Wizarding society (if we're taking their canon attitude into consideration) split off from the muggle one a few centuries back - the Statute of Secrecy providing a convenient point there. It's a fairly easy take to make that the Muggle capabilities since then have gone somewhat unrecognized - the most advanced muggle-like technologies we see them accepting since then seem to be trains and cars.

So with a magical world that doesn't know much about a muggle one, weapons seem like they could be a blind spot. Where one falls on the magic vs technology scale of power will depend on the reader and their mind - anywhere from 'magic is far stronger without any changes' to 'magic is worse in an upfront fight'. I personally fall under the idea that magic could be adapted to match/fight well against guns/weaponry, but that it would require a fairly sizable change in tactics - and, of course, that wizards tend to focus on fighting other wizards/magic.

For Voldemort specifically, the case is that he's a wizard supremacist - along with the other purebloods. Imagining that he'd overlook 'weak muggle technology' as inferior to magic seems quite fitting with his canon portrayal - though you're right that a smarter/more competent version of him would not be so.
