  It's because of how absolutely clueless wizards seem to be about the muggle world.

I'm not sure why people like to generalize wizards as though they're some hivemind, especially based on, what, just the Weasleys and maybe one or two other ignorant wizards? There are plenty of examples showing wizards aren't "absolutely clueless" about the muggle world.

- Draco Malfoy knows about helicopters at eleven years old.

- Hagrid and Arthur Weasley know about guns, which have been around for centuries, so it's likely the average wizard at least has some idea of what they are.

- There is a steady influx of Muggle-borns coming into the wizarding world, who would spread their knowledge.

- The majority of the population is Half-blood and Muggle-born, which means most wizards have a connection to the Muggle world.

- Bombs have existed for a thousand years, and the World Wars leveled cities. Wizards would have noticed this.

- Kingsley Shacklebolt, a Pure-blood, works for several months under the Prime Minister blends in so well with Muggles that no one notices a thing, including the Prime Minister who knows about magic.

- The Ministry of Magic has a whole department dedicated to dealing with the Muggle world (Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee). The visitor entrance is also a phone booth.

- Their use of muggle vehicles (cars, trains, buses, etc)
