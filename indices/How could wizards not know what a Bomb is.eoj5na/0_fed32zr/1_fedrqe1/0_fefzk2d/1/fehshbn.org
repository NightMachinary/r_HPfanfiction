It is when you live in England. I'm twenty-three years old and I've seen a single gun in my entire life (wielded by a police officer in a big train station after an attack on Westminster) and I was genuinely surprised at how different they looked from video games. The vast majority of us will have never seen a bomb or gun outside of an action movie, unless we were around for the Troubles.
