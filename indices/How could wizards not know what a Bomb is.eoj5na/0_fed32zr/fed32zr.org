I find it's usually all part of the larger muggle wank that people seem to like. And there is certainly some validity to certain muggle things being superior (phones are objectively better than owl post, the same way they're better than pigeon post), or more creative (I mean the internet is pretty impressive). But I personally don't get it, I'm not reading Harry Potter fanfiction to read about people shooting each other, I'm reading about it for the magic and the characters. If I want to read about the miracles of tech, I'll read sci-fi.

I do wonder how much of it is because guns can be a large part of life for some people, but seeing as I live in a largely gun free country (and the UK is also largely gun free), I just don't see a whole lot of point.

Voldemort would absolutely know about muggle weaponry for the very reasons you mention. I think it's actually a rather interesting part of his character that isn't explored. He lived through a muggle war. He saw muggles inventing new ways to kill each other. He was sent back to the orphanage without being able to legally perform magic to protect himself if his home was attacked. It's not really that hard to see how it feeds into his mentally of muggles being something to despise. A lot of hate is born of fear, and he had plenty to fear from muggles in his life.
