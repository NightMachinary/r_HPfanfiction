Some of them may know they exist, but they either believe that their protections/shields/wards/whatever are good enough (which we don't really know), or they are dismissive of them ("no muggle invention can kill a pureblood")

The fact that bombings are never mentioned by anti-muggles in the books sort of implies that they don't believe it to be that big of a deal for them, or they don't care what the muggles do to each other. Or it may have been that the bombs never hit a wizarding area.

(as for cities, I always got the feeling that other than the Blacks, most purebloods lived somewhat isolated from the rest)

Japanese wizards probably have a different view of them, but then again, we really don't know.
