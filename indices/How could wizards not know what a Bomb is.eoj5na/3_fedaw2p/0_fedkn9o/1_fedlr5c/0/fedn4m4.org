That's a different argument than your first comment, though. Originally you said the "average magical" wouldn't know about them. The average pure-blood supremacist isn't your average magical.

Draco Malfoy knows about helicopters, so I'd go with your argument that most pure-bloods know what these things are, they just don't really care for them.
