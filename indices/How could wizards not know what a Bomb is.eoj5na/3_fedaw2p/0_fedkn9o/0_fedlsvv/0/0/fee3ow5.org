Enough people in canon that they need to describe it in the newspaper like that. Arthur Weasley is a muggle enthusiast - of all those raised in the magical world that we know about, for all his eccentricity, I'd point to him as likeliest to know about specific muggle technology.

The better counterpoint would have been to point out that Hagrid seemed to understand what Vernon's shotgun was in the first book.
