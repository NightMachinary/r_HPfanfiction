I don't think we can generalize. Wizards in the Middle-East would be aware of rather recent muggle weapons, while wizards in Britain, for example, would be aware of WW2 weapons. But then there's the Muggle-borns and Half-Bloods who would be aware of the most recent in general.

So it'd really be a case by case thing.
