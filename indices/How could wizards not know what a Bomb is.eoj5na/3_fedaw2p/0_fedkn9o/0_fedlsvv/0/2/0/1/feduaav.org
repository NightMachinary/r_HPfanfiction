Considering not everyone in Britain has access to guns and helicopters fly over all the time, I'd say it's morel likely he knows what a helicopter is vs a gun. The Malfoys are unlikely to be around muggles often at all and likely avoid going into muggle areas but a helicopter would be noticeable, especially considering it's not concealed from view at all and is in fact noisy.
