Strongly agree with Who Dares Wins by OlegGunnarsson (already linked).

Others where the Potters turn out not to be as dead as previously thought:

- The Substitute by BajaB linkffn(4641394)
- The Fall of the House of Potter by Bobmin356 linkffn(7508571)
- Travel Secrets series by E4mj (time travel, third story unfinished). First story linkffn(9622538)
- Too Late by Lucillia linkffn(5785108)
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of a Linear Circle series]] by flamethrower. This one doesn't quite fit your criteria because Harry IS happy to learn his parents are still alive. Time-travel, slash, extremely long series that's still in progress. First story linkao3(11284494)

And one token "HARRY is not as dead as they thought" story: Albus Dumbledore's Big Mistake by shineyma (Dumbledore bashing) linkao3(26177908)
