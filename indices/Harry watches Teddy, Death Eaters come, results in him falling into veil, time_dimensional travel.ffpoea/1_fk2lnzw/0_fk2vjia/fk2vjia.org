Unfortunately, thats not it. (Though thanks for the recommendation!) The one I am thinking of started with Harry watching Teddy, them being silly over football/soccer/whatever on the TV (for some reason I want to think Harry was teaching Teddy to be a propper sports fans, with loud cheering and hats and other sports paraphernalia...) when Death Eaters barged in, kidnapped Teddy (or both of them) before Harry falls into the veil.
