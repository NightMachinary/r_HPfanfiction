They're not long nor go super elaborately into magic systems but [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/390301][astolat's]] works have some really creative things like a Voice Box (can take someone's voice and keep it in there rendering them mute) and a scarily sentient Grimmauld Place that's out to get you. In particular I'd recommend Timeshare, Reparatio, House Proud, Unseen and Slithering.
