For me this has the most beautiful depiction of magic: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]])

The magic I am talking about doesn't really start until 4th year and it is abandoned, but honestly it's so long I've never even finished 6th year. Do not mean it is boring but I have a hard time committing to a story for a month, as I am a very slow reader.
