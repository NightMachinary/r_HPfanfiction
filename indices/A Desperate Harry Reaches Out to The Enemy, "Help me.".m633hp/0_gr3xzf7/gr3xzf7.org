"Hello, Harry." It was a little incongruous to see Voldemort leaning against the Little Whinging playground's Merry-Go-Round; his skin pale and waxen; red eyes glinting with an emotion Harry didn't want to examine. Behind, the Death Eaters spread out into an arc, muttering to each other in confusion.

Harry nodded back politely; forcing himself to control the instinctive flinch of revulsion at his new ally's inhuman appearance.

"We've 'spoken' mind-to-mind and you sought my aid to free yourself from Dumbledore, correct?"

Another nod. The Death Eaters exchanged amazed glances.

"My program is simple: slaughter the Mudbloods and rule a Magical Britain cleansed of the Muggle excrescence, forever. The new world will be one of of discipline and order, everyone with a place and that place below me. I'm curious, where exactly do you see someone who values their autonomy fitting in?"

Harry was starting to get a bad feeling. He drew his wand; Voldemort mirroring his action.

"What special skills will you bring, that I might overlook the threat of the prophecy, the injuries you've already done me? No, Harry Potter. Your only role in my plans is to-"

Desperately, Harry flourished his wand. "Expelliarmus."

Voldemort tried no counter spell; he let the magic hit him, staggering back a pace, his wand flying out of his hand.

Harry briefly felt a thrill of triumph but then, as the yew wand reached apogee, his enemy reached out and it reversed course, gliding back into Voldemort's grip.

"Ah, there we have your special ability. A devastating weapon... against a Second Year." The Death Eaters tittered. "Now let me try."

The return spell was non-verbal but Harry felt his phoenix and holly wand twist in his hand, the wood suddenly slick then it shot away into the darkness.

"You promised not to attack me," Harry said.

"I did. We exchanged oaths in fact... then you struck me with a spell first. Lucky for you the old saw about oath-breakers losing their magic isn't true."

"That's not fair."

Voldemort stalked closer. "No, it isn't. For a long time I thought us similar. Both half-bloods, both orphans," he chuckled darkly, "both orphaned by me, both Muggle-raised. I entered the Magical world as the lowest of the low, ignorant of my Magical heritage, a Mudblood in Slytherin House but I rose, studied, fought, learnt everything I could and, " Voldemort spread his arms theatrically, "triumphed."

"You, on the other hand, were famous and surrounded by loyal friends. But both I and my servants have been your teachers; you coast, slide by on the minimum... yet between luck and Gryffindor bullheadedness you've disrupted my plans again and again. Is it fair that my enemy should be so pathetic? Well no more." The yew wand was now pointing at Harry, a white finger of death. "Avada Kedavra."

Sometime later Harry woke up in the now empty playground. He'd been to a spectral Kings Cross, seen the effects of the Dark Arts on Voldemort's soul and endured a long tirade from a furious Lily Potter. Everyone had told him of his mother's kindness but wow, she could really tear someone apart when she got angry. Still he was alive and cleansed of Voldemort's taint. The Light side might be imperfect but he would give them a second chance.
