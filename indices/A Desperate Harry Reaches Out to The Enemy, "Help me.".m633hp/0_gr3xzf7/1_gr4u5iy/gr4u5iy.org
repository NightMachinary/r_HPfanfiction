So basically Voldemort despises Harry because he's a lazy underachiever with most studies, that's understandable.

Wonder if he was a prodigy like Voldemort.

People complain about fics where they do this, but at least some of them change the background around so that Voldemort is more like Palpatine than just Wizard Hitler.
