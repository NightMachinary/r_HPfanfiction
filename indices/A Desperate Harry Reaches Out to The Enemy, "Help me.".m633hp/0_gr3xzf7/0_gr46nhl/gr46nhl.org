Great scene! It is always kind of annoying when Dumbledore's side is made out to be the lowest of the low and Voldemort's perfect when Voldemort is the one committing acts of genocide and trying to impose a totalitarian rule. Even if Dumbledore and the order are not perfect Voldemort definitely isn't either.
