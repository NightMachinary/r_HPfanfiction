Could be an interesting take on a WBWL from the perspective of the twin who is believed as the BWL (regardless if he is right or not about Dumbledore's alleged plan). We always see the other twin resenting being in his brother's shadow and going dark, sometimes even allying with Voldemort, would be a nice change of pace to have the supposed BWL twin grow resentful of his role in defeating Voldemort and cannon's yearly adventures while the other twin is just chilling around with friends or otherwise not involving himself too much on the war one way or another.
