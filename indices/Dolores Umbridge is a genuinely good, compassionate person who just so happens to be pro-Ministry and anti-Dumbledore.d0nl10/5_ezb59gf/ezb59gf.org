The conflict of the 5th book becomes Umbridge trying to convince Harry to see a mind healer and Dumbledore blocking it. Of course, since she's Umbridge, once Voldemort comes back she starts campaigning for outright fascism.

Honestly, I'm surprised there are like no Good!Umbridge in Indy!Harry and Evil!Dumbledore stories.
