I'm happy for him.

That has nothing to with Umbridge being one of the most well known and deeply despised heat-sink's in fiction. There's no where to go with a character like that. She has no redeeming qualities to grab onto, no facet of her character you can empathize with. She's a loathsome bitch whom nobody particular cares that she was (probably) raped by horse cock all evening as her book 5 comeuppance. Her character is too established and everybody wants to see her bested. That's â€˜staying antagonist' written all over it in glowing fluorescent ink.
