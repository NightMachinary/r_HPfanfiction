I believe it would be good idea to explore umbridge as a person. She would initially indeed be a good person who did things out of loyalty to ministry but events of first war breaks her and atmosphere in Minstery leds her to becoming who she is There aren't any fics that explore politics of ministry or rise of Dolores Umbridge
