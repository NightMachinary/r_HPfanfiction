They came pretty close to being evil in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005). [[/spoiler][If they had murdered Neville out of paranoia in chapter 30, their fall would have been complete]].

But they brutally tortured and murdered [[/spoiler][that traitor Neville Longbottom]] in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3548714/1/Screams-Part-One][Screams Part One]], linkffn(3548714). Can't really blame them in this fic though

I would say they are evil in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942)
