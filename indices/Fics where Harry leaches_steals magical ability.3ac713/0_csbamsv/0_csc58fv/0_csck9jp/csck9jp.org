Harry/Hermione eventually. There is some Dumbledore bashing, and it does deserve the Angst category, but it all works well together somehow. The characters don't feel whiny or anything, but there is drama going on. I am not going to tell you the special magical premise behind this story, but I will say it is unique somewhat.
