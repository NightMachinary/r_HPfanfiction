In a 700,000K+ word-long story, these are all the things that I can criticise as definitely bad:

1) There are some parts where the author forces the characters to act in a certain way to stir the plot/subplot in the desired direction. This also includes canon repetitions and artificial hinderings of the plot.

1.1. one with the main character finding Tom's diary, trying to experiment with it, giving up and then losing it again;

1.2.

#+begin_quote
  But there was something about slipping from the castle on his own two feet, something about traveling in a normal way. *He couldn't simply teleport wherever he wanted to go. Or perhaps he could, but shouldn't.*
#+end_quote

1.3.

#+begin_quote
  ”Master Regulus never returned.” Returned form where? Harry waited for the elf to say more, but he remained stubbornly silent. *Harry considered pushing it, then decided to take his own advice and let the elf keep his silence on the matter.* Instead, he cleared his throat and pointed around.
#+end_quote

1.4.

#+begin_quote
  Harry could take the information from his mind. [..] And Harry would be a monster. [..] He couldn't do it.
#+end_quote

1.5.

#+begin_quote
  in one part, the tournament officials know that one of the contendents is missing but still won't postpone it even if being late will make him\her a squib\kill them for breaking the binding contract.
#+end_quote

1.6. etc.

2) The author involves some past or current real-life political figures in the story, among which are M. Zedong also V. Putin. I guess this may have had looked cute as an abstraction if you were dis-attached from the historical\current Chinese\Russian political happenings, but if you /do/ know how things were\are developing there, it feels like author trying to make Hitler into a cute secondary character, which leaves a general bad aftertaste.

3) There are two things with this world's magical system that seemed annoying to me:

3.1.

#+begin_quote
  Light was justice to the phoenix, was everything good and pure and right, sometimes soft and sometimes harsh. Everyone was graced with their own light in different measures, had their own task to either shine brighter or fade away into the dark. [..] *Causing misery to a few to spare many was not the Light's way, was not good or right*
#+end_quote

3.2.

#+begin_quote
  A person's soul was what made them unique; different. A soul was one's brain, their mind, and yet the two were not always overlaid. A dementor could eat a person's soul. But their brain would still be in place; the person would still eat and drink if prompted, still breath, still live. But what made them human, what made them think, was gone. *A soul was what made humans different from animals; a soul was what gave sentience.*
#+end_quote

4) There's also the general phoenix animagus form cliche.

Now, from the good things,

1) the story has rather original general plotline and magical system (including original scenery and character designs);

2) the writing itself isn't too bad, though there are some mistakes and typos that the author hasn't fixed yet;

3) there are several occasions on which Fawkes makes Harry drop the Idiot Ball (although, unfortunately, there are even more on which the characters' actions /are/ dictated by the Ball);

4) Although the narrator describes Dumbledore as a manipulative person who has lost the “righteous” path (-), from the reader's perspective he and his decisions may receive a positive judgement. He's not also an idiotic character that's dangerous only because he's overpowered (like in the Sacrifices).

5) there is a nice tutoring sequence with N. Flamel and accordingly a well-designed N. Flamel.

6) the story has a more or less stable updates schedule.
