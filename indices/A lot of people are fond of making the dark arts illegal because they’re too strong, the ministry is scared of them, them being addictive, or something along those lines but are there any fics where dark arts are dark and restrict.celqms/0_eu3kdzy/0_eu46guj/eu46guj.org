Isn't it canon that all magics which only intent is to inconvenience someone are technically dark magic (from jinxes to curses), but the really dark ones are just those curses that either don't have a counter-curse or have ones that are either barely known or difficult to cast in a timely manner? Like the sectumsempra scene in 6th book, Harry almost cleaved Malfoy in half with a single slash of a wand and a word, while Snape took some time of careful wand-waving and reciting incantations over and over to reverse the effects.
