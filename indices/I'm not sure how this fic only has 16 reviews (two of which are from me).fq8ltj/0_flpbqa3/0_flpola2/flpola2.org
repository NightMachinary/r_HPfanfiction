It does really depress me when the good stories go unnoticed in favor of those illogical ones. I'm open to OC's for sure, simply because I've read so many good ones now. But I tend to prefer the tried and true characters. For instance, I could never get into that Alexandra Quick series (and I really wanted to). I think it just depends on how well the author actually GIVES the OC character. Like if they can make me care about that OC, I will.
