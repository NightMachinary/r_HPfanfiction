Unfortunately, some stories just go unnoticed by the fandom. And what's really unfortunate is that sometimes, really good stories go unnoticed by the fandom. Meanwhile, shitty stories (badly written, characters that act illogically, trope-filled, etc.) are the ones that have the most favorites, follows, reviews, and recommendations. Also, I've noticed that smutty romances are among the most popular. Yet, just because a story is popular doesn't mean it's good. For me, I'm just not interested in Tom Riddle all that much. Also, you said the main character is an OC which is a major negative in my book. I typically don't like OCs, and have yet to come across an OC in FanFiction that I've liked. But, that's just my own preference on the matter.
