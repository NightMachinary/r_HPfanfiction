I've seen people do like fic reviews and stuff on here, and I've seen other places do things like fic spotlights before, though not necessarily I'm reddit. As long as it's not against the sub rules I don't see why someone couldn't start their own fic spotlight campaign. It's a good way to bring people's attention to less popular fics and authors that deserve attention too.
