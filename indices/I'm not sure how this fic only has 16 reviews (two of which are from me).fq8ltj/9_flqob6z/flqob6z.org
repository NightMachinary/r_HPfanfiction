For me, personally, I just don't really gravitate towards fics with OC's as the main character, and also I don't really read Tom Riddle centric stories unless they revolve around both him and his relationship with Harry (be it the usual or different). To be fair I have read OC stories, but usually only under very specific circumstances, and this story doesn't hit those for me. It's also unfortunate that if you see an OC story where they're the main and it also focuses around the bad guy, a lot of people are gonna automatically think it's a story where the author is trying to find a way to redeem the bad guy through the power of love and that's just an annoying trope overall, though I understand this fic isn't like that. Plus, the HP fandom is probably one of the most saturated fandoms when it comes to fics.

Plenty of good fics are gonna slide under the radar with hardly any recognition, and even worse ones end up with legions of followers, some who only read and agree that fic is good because so many others think so like a hive mind. It's always gonna be a toss-up in a fandom as large as this one if a fic that is worth it will get the recognition it deserves. I know I've read plenty of fics that deserved more attention than they've gotten, which is why I try not to make decisions on what fics I'll read based on reader count/reviews/kudos/favorites/ etc. especially since fic elitists annoy me.

Maybe you could do fic spotlight posts like some other people do to promote other fics like this one and try to get them more recognition? It couldn't hurt.
