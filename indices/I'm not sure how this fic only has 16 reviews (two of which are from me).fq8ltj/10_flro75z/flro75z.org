Thanks for the recommendation, it looks well written after a quick glance. I think a lot of people only read fics with their favorite ships and Mary Sues made them avoid OCs altogether so that might explains the fewer reviews. I'm guilty in this too, which is super hypocritical from me since I'm planning to write a fic featuring only OCs.
