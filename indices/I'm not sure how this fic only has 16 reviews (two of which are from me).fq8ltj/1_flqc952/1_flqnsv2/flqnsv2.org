I think 2 is the main reason. Though not necessarily because people despise them but because people often search fics by pairing so OC-centric fics don't show up. (Especially on ffn)

Also a lot of OCs are self inserts and/or Mary Sues.

That said, I'll definitely check it out at some point! I like fics about Tom Riddle pre-insanity and with such a glowing review I'm willing to try the OC
