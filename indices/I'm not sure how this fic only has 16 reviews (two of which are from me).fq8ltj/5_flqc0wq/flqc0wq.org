"*I'm not sure how this fic only has 16 reviews"*

Because there are hundreds of thousands of stories? and no editors promoting them or professional critics reviewing them or famous writers recommending them?

That is the problem with self publishing, specially when you cannot legally cash in on it.

Thanks for the recommendation, I love a good, sane Voldi fic. The smarter and more cynical the better.
