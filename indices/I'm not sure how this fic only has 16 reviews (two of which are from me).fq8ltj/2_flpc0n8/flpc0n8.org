That's actually one of my favorite fics, though I found it [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9559742/][on Ao3]] rather than FFN. I also enjoyed the author's other longform fic set in the same time period: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11707455/chapters/26365128][The Outliers]]

I think one reason that "Recipe for Disaster" hasn't gained much attention is that the majority of readers are wary of OC fics. Many assume that the female OC will turn out to be a 'Mary Sue' or self insert for self-indulgent romantic plotlines.

However, what I love about this fic is that it's not a stereotypical 'OC turns bad-boy good through the power of love' story, or 'OC gains Darke Powers and impresses everyone who beholds her' fic. Instead, it's a believable progression of how prejudice and bitterness can ruin a person's life as well as lives of the people around them. In fact, I think this fic would probably appeal to many of the people who enjoyed [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19381933/chapters/46118053][Black Ink, Red Rose]] (which has gotten popular on this sub recently). Both fics explore similar dark themes without whitewashing the racist extremism of the Death Eater movement.
