That's understandable.

I suppose my tastes may tend towards the opposite: I enjoy reading stories that evoke strong emotions, even if those emotions are on the negative side of the spectrum. I also prefer that the universe in the fic be like reality in that bad things can and do happen to good people. As the saying goes, "the sun shines also on the wicked."

I will say that unrelenting downer stories tend to irk me, not because they are depressing, but because there's no rising and falling action to balance the plot. An engaging story needs good moments and bad moments to provide perspective and thus make each climax (positive or negative) more emotionally intense. So, for example, I enjoyed the early parts of "Black Ink, Red Rose" because Ginny lived through some dark moments but she still had hope and times of happiness with friends to sustain her in-between. However, past the midpoint the story metaphorically fell off a cliff, after which Ginny no longer had any positive moments at all. The fic became less and less engaging for me with each chapter that passed in which Ginny's experiences unrelentingly trended downward.

To me, "Recipe for Disaster" doesn't fall into the 'unrelenting downer' category, but everyone has different tastes; mileage may vary.
