  While descriptive, this tells me very little about what kind of story I'm heading into - what is it that drives the plot. I want to know the starting point, sure, but also the direction it will take from there. "Downhill" doesn't really count unless it's a comedy. It doesn't even mention the MC is an OC, not Tom.

I think some of that is the fault of FFN's tagging system and character limmit in descriptions. The description and tags on Ao3 do a better job showing what the fic is about.

As for the MC not being Tom, that's not really true. The fic has chapters that follow each of their perspectives, so they are both equally prominent as main characters.
