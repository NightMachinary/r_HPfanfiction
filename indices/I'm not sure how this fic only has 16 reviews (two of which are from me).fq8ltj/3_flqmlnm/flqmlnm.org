I don't know if I ever came across it (I do browse [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] for stories with 100k+ words occasionally), but if I did I most likely skipped right past. Here's why:

1. I don't like the summary. Dumbledore dies, and Tom Riddle became the DADA teacher. While descriptive, this tells me very little about what kind of story I'm heading into - what is it that drives the plot. I want to know the starting point, sure, but also the direction it will take from there. "Downhill" doesn't really count unless it's a comedy. It doesn't even mention the MC is an OC, not Tom.
2. I dislike anti-hero or villain leads (if that's not the case for Recipe for Disaster, that ties right back into the point about the summary).
