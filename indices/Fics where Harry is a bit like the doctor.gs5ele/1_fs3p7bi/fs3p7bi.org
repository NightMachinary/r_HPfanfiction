"So basically Professor, I had some issues procuring something to let me survive underwater for an hour. I DID think about the Bubblehead Charm, but how Fleur ended up nearly drowning from a few Grindylow popping it I obviously had the right idea."

"And your right idea was-"

"Not finished Professor." Harry all but snapped at his Head of House as he flicked a silent Drying Charm at the fluffy towel in hand and then attacked his hair with said towel again, his mile a minute diatribe beginning anew,

"So then I was introduced to Gillyweed. A far more palatable option to explore than partial Transfiguration, which I'd of course considered next," He winked at McGonagall who spluttered and tried to get a word in edgeways. Tried, "But that came with it's own issues. First, it's expensive and second, not native to the country. Even if I could snatch some, there were also doubts it would last an hour. And the only feasible place to get some would be via raiding Snape's stores, and I'm not doing THAT again."

"Mr Potter!"

"Professor! I don't interrupt you." Hand on hip and pouting, Harry had the gall (as all baffled onlookers and his target mentally concurred) to glare up at her with a pointing finger. The whole pose and pout melting back into an insufferable gleeful grin once again, "Besides, I'm nearly done. Behold my master stroke!"

His wand snapped out to some point in the South, and barely a second later, on the far bank of Lake a green light burst into life. Several metres away, on either side of the initial jade light, others burst into life also. More and more bloomed into being until the entire waterfront was encircled in a ring of green,

"Like em?" He didn't wait for an answer, "Brilliant thing, Runes. You know what else, well... actually who else. Weasley's! Particularly that Bill. Tall, easy on the eyes, pity Padfoot says I'm too young for him. But NOT a pity that he's a Cursebreaker. Left a bunch of his notes where anyone could find them, so obvs I snuck a peak and committed it to memory. Eww, do I say obvs now? I though Laveder was cute when she said it, but now I've tried it... anyway! The scheme's a fairly modern one, used to amplify the magic of a castor, I think it's for brute forcing your way past traps..."

"Mr Potter." McGonagall fought to keep as much of her infuriated exasperation from her voice as possible, coming across as massively strained as her most troublesome Gryffindor to date (hilarious considering who his father was) rambled to himself about god knows what, "I honestly do not care how you managed it-"

"But it's brilliant! And it didn't even take me that long. Just had to spend a few days writing out the scheme on a piece of paper, so much better than parchment you know, then an afternoon putting them out in the right places around the lake. Buried them under the mud so they wouldn't be disturbed." Smug, he was smug in the face of the Gryffindor Head of House rapidly losing her patience, "With that many around I could have fired a hex that would have killed us all, but one Wingardium Leviosa later and I didn't even need to swim!"

"PUT THE LAKE BACK WHERE IT WAS, MR POTTER, OR SO HELP ME!" And Albus Dumbledore himself, alongside a trio of the braver Hogwarts Professors, had to drag the incensed Scotswoman away from the giggling Harry as he encouraged Colin and Dennis Creevey to take another picture of the Black Lake.

The Black Lake that had, with a single swish and flick of Harry Potter's wand, been left suspenced roughly 20 feet above those who had intended to watch the Second Task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament.

In which Harry Potter had won by default, rescuing all four hostages whilst leaving his competitors flailing in the floating lake.
