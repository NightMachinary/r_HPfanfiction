Ooh I've got a few, not all of them are Harry acting like the Doctor, but are all really good.

Visited by a Doctor, linkffn(4922483) The Doctor's various incarnations visit him throughout his life, starting with the 1st Doctor setting Ian and Barbara up as his teachers. Harry doesn't become exactly like the Doctor but his role in his life does shape who Harry grows up to be. Warning, this is a very long fic, and while the start does focus on Harry meeting the various Doctors, it does eventually become more about Harry and the effect the Doctor has had on his life. It also contains the only version of redeemed Draco that I like.

This next one also isn't Harry acting like the Doctor, but is to this day one of the best fanfics I have ever read. That Which Holds the Image, linkffn(7156582) and I'll just give the Authors summary to sell you on it. "Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel". The only warning I will give about this is it has an equally good sequel linkffn(9180168) that hasn't been updated in almost two years.

This one is probably one of my favourites, but isn't focused on Harry. Hermione's Song, linkffn(7102418) It was first written after A Good Man goes to War but before Let's Kill Hitler, and as you probably tell from the title, goes with the idea that Hermione is actually a major character from the Doctor Who universe. However like That Which Holds the Image, it also has an unfinished sequel, linkffn(7572453).

And this final one is again not focused on Harry, but is still really good. This one goes with the fact that Mark Williams played Rory's dad in Doctor Who to establish that Charlie Weasley is actually a squib living in the Muggle world as Rory. Why Charlie Weasley Isn't in the Movies, linkffn(8978887).

A bit different from what you were asking for, But I couldn't resist sharing these.
