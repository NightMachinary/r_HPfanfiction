"A dragon, Hermione, is the deadliest, most powerful, most ferocious beast Mother Magic has seen fit to 'bless' us with and in a few days time there's going to be one staring me down over a clutch of eggs.

Assuming it doesn't smite me from above with it's claws or tail, and assuming I'm not just burnt to a crisp on sight, do something incredibly clever to it that I haven't actually thought of yet."
