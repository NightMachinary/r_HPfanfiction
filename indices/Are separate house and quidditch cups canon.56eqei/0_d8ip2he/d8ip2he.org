They're seperate, as evidenced by Gryffindor winning the House Cup but /not/ the Quidditch Cup in PS and CoS. They are completely seperate; the House Cup points are for academic achievements/failures and good/bad behaviour. The Quidditch Cup points are tallied depending on game scores in matches. This is why Gryffindor had to wait until they were 50 points ahead in their match against Slytherin in POA before Harry could catch the snitch; if they weren't, they wouldn't have got the 200 point margin needed to get the cup even if they'd still won the match.

Also, just as a note, there are 6 matches a year:

- Gryffindor-Slytherin
- Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff
- Gryffindor-Ravenclaw
- Slytherin-Hufflepuff
- Gryffindor-Hufflepuff
- Slytherin-Ravenclaw

We just never see anything about the non-Gryffindor matches.
