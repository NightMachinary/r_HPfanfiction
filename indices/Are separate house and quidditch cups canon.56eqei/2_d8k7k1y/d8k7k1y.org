The QC is separate from the House Cup, first year RavenClaw wins the Quidditch Cuo (we can assume this from the knowledge Gryffindor beat both Hufflepuff and Slytherin on page but they lost when Harry was in Madam Pomfree's care post Qurrelmort. But we know for sure that Gryffindor wins the House Cup that year.

Now I believe, I'm not sure, but I think the points of the game are also added as house points, eg: Gryffindor beats Hufflepuff 340-110, Gryffindor gets 340 house points as well, Hufflepuff 110 additional house points
