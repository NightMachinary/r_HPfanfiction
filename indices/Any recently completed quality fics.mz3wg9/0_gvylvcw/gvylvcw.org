A Place Apart, and The Second String were both completed within the last couple weeks.

Of A Linear Circle's most recent instalment, Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay and The End is the Beginning are all one chapter away from completion (you could argue that Dragon is finished now, as we're only missing the epilogue).
