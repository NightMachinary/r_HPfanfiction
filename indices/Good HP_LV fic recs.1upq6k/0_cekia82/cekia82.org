Here's a list of some of the one's I have saved. Hopefully I have this formatted correctly.

  Being the Master of Death was a curse, plain and simple. That had been death's intention when he 'gifted' his trinkets to the brothers three. The sound of shedding skin crackled loudly in his ear as he got up to look over his new body, he was a girl this time, maybe eight or nine years old. Time travel fic Tom RiddleX Harry potter

I really enjoy that one, although updates are few and far between. I think its worth it though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7985679/1/To-the-Waters-and-the-Wild][To the Waters and the Wild]] by Paimpont

#+begin_quote
  While flying back from Godric's Hollow, Hagrid accidentally drops baby Harry over a wild forest. Harry is raised by rebel fairies until his Hogwarts letter arrives. The Dark Lord is in for a surprise... HP/LV romance. SLASH.

Updates every few months.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8366987/1/The-Game][The Game]] by Rendered Reversed >!MAJOR NON-MAGIC AU! VolDeMort, an infamously vicious PvPer. Scarred, a ridiculously lucky warrior. HBPrince, their unfortunate priest. Together, they're the smallest of the top 10 teams on CoS Online, and probably the most dysfunctional as well... Eventual TMR/HP SLASH, pairings inside.

This one is really au and some of the characters are OOC which is a given without magic and Harry's parents living.

I use to absolutely adore this one but I didn't like the ending much less the sequel.

This fic is probably my favorite and its complete.
