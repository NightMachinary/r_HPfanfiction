In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6888519/1/][Sole Survivor]] a plague wipes out the muggle population of Great Britain when Harry is only ten years old. Harry is left to fend for himself and eventually learns that he is being hunted by several factions. Unfortunately it's just a oneshot, though I wish that the author had made it into a complete story.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10390769/1/][Desiccated]] (a oneshot crossover with the Dishonored universe) Harry reveals that the world was broken by a cataclysm set off in a war between wizardkind and the technologically advanced muggle population.

If you read far enough into [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10313612/][The Traveler]] you'll eventually see clues that the seemingly fairy-tale inspired alternate universe is actually a post-apocalyptic world. The backstory seems to be that the "gentry" and other fantastical beings were originally techno-magical constructs that gained sentience and banded together to wipe out their creators.
