[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Grindelwald breaks out to avenge Dumbledore. He and Harry join forces and chaos soon follow. Hermione is very enthusiastic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): You probably won't like it because this fic bashes almost everyone in Wizarding Britain into oblivion, including Hermione. But it also has some really juice scenes and cool moments.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12740667/1/The-Mind-Arts][The Mind Arts]], linkffn(12740667): This fic has some good ideas, but is on the verge of being abandoned. A/N in the last chapter is not promising.
