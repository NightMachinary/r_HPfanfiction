*Double Back* linkao3(19267840) HEAVY AU\\
Auror Harry goes to investigate something and wakes up again. It's 1991. Putters around for a week before he realizes he can change things. Then he proceeds right to Privet Drive and punches Vernon in the face. Also, punching people in the face is a trend.

He does tell Harry (mini-me) who he really is. Ends up throwing on some makup over the scar and some colored contacts and passes himself off as James. Things do change a lot. In the two months "James" had Harry, it ends up with Harry going into Hufflepuff.

The fic is still ongoing, but it looks like it is setting up a Potters vs Voldemort vs Dumbledore. There's some bashing, but it's not hardcore. Besides Dumbledore's setup (there's no real backstory so far yet), Harry was told to save himself the trouble with Ron, and that was it. It didn't spend 20 chapters calling him an idiot or anything. In fact, it looks like Ron might be revisted and a talk to happen so Ron can change for the better.
