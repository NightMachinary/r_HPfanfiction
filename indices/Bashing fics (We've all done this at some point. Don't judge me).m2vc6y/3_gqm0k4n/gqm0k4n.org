Can't say I've read many well written bashing fics, obviously. There's one weird one that might be interesting, perhaps? Linkffn(Strange Reflections) has a weird premise (an AU Harry + his family appears in the WW post-Voldemort's defeat), and they're definitely bashed in it, caring only about money/fame and being giant pricks. IIRC there is a sister that doesn't get bashed in the process, though.

Other warnings for it are some PTSD aspects, that it's Harmony, some amounts of Ron/Ginny bashing, and the like. I don't know if I'd call it /good/ on the whole (the Ron/Ginny bashing in particular was... eh), but I did find it enjoyable enough to read through the whole thing, and it's an interesting concept. Worth a try, I think!
