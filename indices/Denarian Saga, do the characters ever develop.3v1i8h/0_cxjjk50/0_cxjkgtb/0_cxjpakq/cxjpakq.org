I can't really remember all that much. I read the Denarian Trilogy before I read the Dresden Files, so I remember really enjoying the world.

It's probably my favourite fic (mainly because of the plot and battles, as I said), though I can definitely see how it might not appeal to some. I'm going to say that if you aren't enjoying it by this point, you probably aren't going to at all.
