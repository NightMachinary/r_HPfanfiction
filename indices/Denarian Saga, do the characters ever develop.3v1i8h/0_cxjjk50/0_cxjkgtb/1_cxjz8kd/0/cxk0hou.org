Do they explain the systems as from the source series or do they just make stuff up? I ask because water, mostly running water, is incredibly disruptive to Dresdenverse magic. Even just in a lake the only reason Dresden was able to use magic is he was drawing it up from the earth he was standing on (He was about waist deep). I know this Harry is a powerhouse, but to not even mention it during the second task makes me think that the author plays a little fast and loose with the rules.
