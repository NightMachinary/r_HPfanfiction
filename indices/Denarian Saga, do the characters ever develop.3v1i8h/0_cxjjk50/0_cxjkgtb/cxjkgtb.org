Hmmmm, as someone who almost only cares about characters the concept of not caring about them never really occurred to me. Does the world develop as the story goes? It seems lackluster at the moment, but that could be because I am very familiar with Harry Potter and Dresden Files so nothing is blowing me away positively yet.
