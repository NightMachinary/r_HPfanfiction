Blood Status is more of a social construct than a strict taxonomic nomenclature. The defining characteristic of being a Pureblood in the books/movies seems to basically be if you care about being a Pureblood or not.

So, yeah. You can be fully magical-heritage and be a Pureblood just fine, but if you marry a couple muggles along the way and cross 'em off the family tree before anyone notices, you seem to be able to keep up appearances.
