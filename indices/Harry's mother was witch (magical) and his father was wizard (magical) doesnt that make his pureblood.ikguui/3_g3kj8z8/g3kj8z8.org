Definition of pureblood is complete mess, and never properly visited by JKR. It ranges from what you said (child of two magicals is a pureblood) to basically the definition of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred][Thoroughbred]], which means that ALL your ancestors must be magicals until some shared commonly agreed stopgap and ANY Muggle in your genealogy disqualifies you. There is just no good answer without JKR involvement.
