The difference between a Half Blood and a Pureblood is not very clear and Rowling never clearly stated the rules (in the books at least). But one thing we know for sure is that Harry is a Half Blood, which means that having 2 magical parents is not enough to make someone a Pureblood.

Between the interviews and Pottermore, Rowling explained a bit more the concept, and from what I remember, there are 2 sets of rule depending of who is judging you :

- For most people, a witch of a wizard need to have at least 3 generations of magical ancestor before being considered a "PureBlood". In we take the Potters as an example, Harry is a Half Blood, the children he got with Ginny are also Half Blood, but if one of his children marry a Pureblood (or a Half Blood in the same situation), then his grandchildren would be considered Pure Blood.
- For the worst Blood Purist, like the Malfoy, some is considered a Half Blood "As long as he can trace back his lineage to a Muggle". Of course, this rule sound stupid since some family could keep the record of a Muggle Ancestor from 500 years ago while some others could "forget" about their grandfather, but this is the kind of hypocrisy that goes well with Blood Purism.
