It's about Grandparents.

To be Pure-Blooded then you must have 4 magical grandparents and 2 Magical Parents.

If Dumbledore is Half-Blooded(I never really looked into his blood status) then that means one of his parents must have been a Half-Blood or Muggle-Born which would make one(or more) of his grandparents, Muggle.

Or maybe one of his grandparents was a Squib because I think the 4 magical grandparents and the 2 magical parents must have magical ability not just be of magic blood(so no squibs)
