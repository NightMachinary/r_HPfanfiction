Asking for Roses by Dogstar101 Hannah/Neville great romance with original plot. Complete. 5th year. Hannah helps Neville discover who he is and step out of the shadow of his gran.

You'll be the Death of Me by dominikki64 Best romance in HP fandom. Neville/OC. Currently Updating. Neville with DM's sister, Romeo and Juliet sort of feel, they can't be together but paints a superb picture of the Death Eaters POV. Best romance fic in fandom

Seven Years Bad Luck by Feelin Glayish Post DH 7th Year fic. Neville/Pansy. Very well written Pansy. Character arc of Neville is great, shows depth beyond what Canon gives. Worth a read. Complete.

Delight in Whatever Remains by greenschist. One shot, Neville/Hannah. Struggles of relationship and inability to have children. Gives good glimpse of characters. Would recommend.

Three Days by Lady Altair. Hannah/Neville. This is the author of Cauterize. One shot.
