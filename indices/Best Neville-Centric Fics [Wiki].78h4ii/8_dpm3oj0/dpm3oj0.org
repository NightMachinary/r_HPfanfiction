I'm really surprised no one has linked to Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness? I only opened this thread to find new ones but have to recommend it seeing as no one else did yet... I only have the ao3 link and am honestly not on this sub enough to even know how ff.netbot works, but here it is: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/753521/chapters/1407407]]

Oh, and as for a few lines describing it: a very well rounded account of the seventh year of Hogwarts. It tells what Neville, Seamus, Hannah, Ernie, Ginny, Luna, etc etc are doing while the Golden Trio are out and about finding horcruxes.
