It's The Art of Self-Fashioning (I won't link it here since it's not Neville-centric, but it's easy to find on ffn.net). I love the plot, I love the role characters like Minerva and Regulus plays in it, but above all else I love that despite being the BWL Neville doesn't feel OOC. Harry is completely different, of course, and it's really dark and heartbreaking, but it also gives me hope sometimes. And I find it really well-written.
