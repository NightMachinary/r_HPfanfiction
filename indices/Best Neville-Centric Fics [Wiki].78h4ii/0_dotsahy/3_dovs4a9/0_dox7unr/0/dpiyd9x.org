I feel like it's because Neville keeps a lot of it bottled up, the fic is being written from his perspective mostly instead of from Harry's. So you get his internal feelings, and if you look closely he's not verbally or psychically acting on those feelings very often. I think it's pretty accurate personally. Teenagers are pretty angsty haha.
