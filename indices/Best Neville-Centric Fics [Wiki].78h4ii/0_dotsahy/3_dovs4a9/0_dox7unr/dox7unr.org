Honestly through your post I started reading... can I ask why? It feels a bit OOC to me at this point. I'm on chapter 5, and it feels like Harry or Neville are flaring their tempers up every five seconds. And while maybe some of it is IC for Harry, Neville never shows these traits. Even towards his parents he's weirdly protective? And Harry moping about his dead parents is really bizarre.
