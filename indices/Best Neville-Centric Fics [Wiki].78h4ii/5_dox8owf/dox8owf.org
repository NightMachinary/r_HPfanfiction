The Landscape of the Heart - linkffn(7383815) - Hermione/Neville. The story is Hermione picking herself up after Ron's death. Understated emotion that still comes across powerfully. More Hermione-centric than Neville, though.

The Deserving One - linkffn(11255466) - Eighth year Neville fic. Liked the herbology stuff, and Neville coming to terms with his Slytherin former bullies. linkffn(11255466)

Learning Curves - linkao3(9137). Ron and Neville coming to terms with their sexuality. Ron/Neville.

Not A Gentleman So Much As A Gentle Man - linkao3(565572) - Another awkward first time fic. I loved Ginny's attitude in this. Neville/Ginny.

Caught on Fire - linkffn(12215200) - Neville/Ginny romance in Carrows ruled Hogwarts.

[[http://hp-rarities.livejournal.com/54096.html][Herbology: A Love Story]] - Another Neville/Ginny. Lovely writing, with some really well drawn imagery. It draws on Ginny's and Neville's shared experiences to paint a wonderful relationship.
