Can't use the Fanfictionbot, since the FF.Net version is gone... but I have the Fictionhunt link here: [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/4838629/1]]

"Not Quite A Maia" by Naebody's Aunty. It's a crossover with The Lord Of The Rings, where Neville, fresh from the Battle of Hogwarts, is summoned to Middle-Earth to take Gandalf's place after Gandalf fell in Moria. Molly Weasley also comes along for the ride -- and Neville's Gran ends up in Middle-Earth by chance and becomes a real nuisance to the Orcs.

It's a pretty goofy story, but in places surprisingly deep, and it explores the differences between the two very different magic systems of HP and LOTR: HP magic is quicker, flashier and easier, and so the HP-wizards who just use magic willy-nilly come across as impossibly strong and powerful to the LOTR characters. LOTR magic is slower and takes longer to strike, but when it does strike the HP wizards can't compete at all.

No pairings, and the fic does appear to be abandoned after 53 chapters... but that's still 53 very good chapters, and a Neville who gets to be the hero for once.
