Two authors who have a shit-ton of Neville stories (with all sorts of pairings) are [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Bryonia_Alba/pseuds/Bryonia_Alba][Bryonia_Alba]] and [[https://lionille.livejournal.com/99967.html][lionille]]. Anyone who likes Neville should enjoy them, especially if you don't mind shorter works.
