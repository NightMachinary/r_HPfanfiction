I know, I've read quite a few of their fics. But the grandstanding and over-exaggerated Harry/Hermione moments are really not my cup of tea.

And Dumbledore bashing is something I really hate. Not because of my love for the character, but for the sheer stupidity behind the reasons for Harry/Hermione/any other self-righteous arse hating Dumbledore.
