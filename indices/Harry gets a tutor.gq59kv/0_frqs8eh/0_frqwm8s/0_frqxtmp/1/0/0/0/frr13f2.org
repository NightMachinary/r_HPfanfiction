I think the only Dumbledore bashing I really really hated was when he was a colossal ****ing idiot in the fic, trying to be a manipulative chessmaster, to the point where he nearly died repeatedly because he kept skirting the edge of an Unbreakable Vow he made not to attempt to manipulate Harry in any way. If it only happened once in the story, fine, but it /just kept happening/.
