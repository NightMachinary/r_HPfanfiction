I have one and it`s a crossover with Marvel. Harry basically summons Loki to help his escape the Dursleys and from that it escalates to the children in Hogwarts figuring out how to travel in space and eventually move the entire wizard population off planet since the earth was so polluted and technology was making it harder to keep their society hidden. I don't remember the name though....
