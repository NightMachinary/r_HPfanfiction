There's plenty of light-heartedness and focus on actually learning magic in linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay). Most of the canon challenges were brushed aside pretty easily, but what's left is seven years at a magical school full of magical beings learning magic, which is still good fun.

No ship for Harry, but even more friends than canon. Even the Dursleys have mellowed, partly due to the lack of anything (like rogue house elves and inflated aunts) disrupting their normality. Incomplete but very actively updating; if you check the SpaceBattles forum thread, there's a new segment every day or two. They get aggregated into FFN chapters periodically.
