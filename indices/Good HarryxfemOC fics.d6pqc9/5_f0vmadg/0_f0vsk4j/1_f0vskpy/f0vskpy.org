  Harry never thought that he wouldn't even know the name of the person he trusted most. After the War, McGonagall forced students involved to anonymously contact each other weekly. At first, Harry thought it was a cheesy attempt to show the Light and the Dark aren't that different from each other. Now, he feels like he can't be without her, even though they never met. HPxOC
