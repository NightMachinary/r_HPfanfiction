Eh. The start isn't the best thing ever, but if you get to the middle/end, then it really becomes so much better. Not the best fic ever, but certainly entertaining, amusing, and, at times, even touching. Do keep in mind that the fic is pretty old - the author deleted their fics at some point and re-uploaded them later, so there are quite a few tropes.
