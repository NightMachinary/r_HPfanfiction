linkffn(Forging the Sword) had an interesting mechanism: the contract was binding on the Ministries of Magic of the participating countries, where each Ministry committed to forcing the champion(s) chosen by the Goblet from their country to participate. So, when Harry's name came out of the Goblet, his choice was either to participate or to flee to a country that was not involved in the tournament.
