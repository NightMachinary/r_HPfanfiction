[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11642540/1/The-Lawyers-Against-the-Cup][The Lawyers Against the Cup]] has Harry refusing to participate and the fallout from it. It's also a pretty good story. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6311075/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Fourth-School][Harry Potter and the Fourth School]] is a short oneshot of Harry refusing (and the second chapter of Harry then using the cup in a logical conclusion). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961358/1/A-Refusal-to-Compete][A Refusal to Compete]] is tiny but complete.

I haven't read it, but this seems the main plot point of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8682644/1/Harry-Potter-Reborn][Harry Potter Reborn]], which also isn't finished. As [[/u/ScrotumPower][u/ScrotumPower]] recommended [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8831374/1/The-Power-of-the-Press][The Power of the Press]] has Harry refusing to complete, but it seems to be the jumping off point rather then the main plot of the story. I didn't get very far into [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9124279/1/A-Not-So-Story-The-Fourth-Champion][A Not So Story - The Fourth Champion]] which is a (to me) not very funny crack fic, but then I hate slapstick and toilet humour so... From memory, I think he /does/ end up competing in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3793741/1/Harry-Potter-Unchampion][Harry Potter: Unchampion]], but there's a whole bunch of stuff about him fighting against it. In the last few chapters of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3804253/12/House-of-Potter][House of Potter]] there is a thing about refusing. Same about half way through in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2959739/26/A-Sirius-Matter][A Sirius Matter]].

There are a couple of fics where Harry tries to get disqualified as unfit to participate, but I don't think that is what you are after? I mean [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/260680][The Family Way]] and [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600097277&chapter=1][A Marriage of Convenience]] come to mind, but I'm sure there are others out there that aren't Harry/Serverus slash.
