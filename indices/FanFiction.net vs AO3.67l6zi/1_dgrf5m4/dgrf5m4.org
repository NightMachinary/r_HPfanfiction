Ao3 has good points and drawbacks.

*Pros for Readers*

The tagging system allows for in-depth searches (if you know what you're doing) for readers. It's a bit harder to exclude tags, but it can be done. It's also friendlier towards Mature- and Explicit-rated fics. You can also separate stories in a way that FFN can't -- gen, f/f, f/m, m/m, etc.

Demographics there seem to skew older, so the comment sections are usually decent instead of hot flaming garbage. Some fandoms are actually bigger there than they are on FFN.

*Cons for Readers*

The tagging system is easily abused and I still don't know how to filter out crossovers. They also desperately need a way to list main pairings and genres in order to help trim the tagging fat.

Searching and filtering requires more than a few peeks at the instructions or FAQs.

*Pros for Writers*

Again, that tagging system. It's easy for people to find a very specific type of story, provided the author doesn't tag every little thing that's in the fic. You can also use [[http://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/1370][CSS]], if you so choose, to prettify your fics.

*Cons for Writers*

Takes a little know-how to do some of the fancier stuff on the site. The reader base is also smaller, generally.
