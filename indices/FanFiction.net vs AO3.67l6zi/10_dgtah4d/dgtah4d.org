It's actually very interesting how ffnet and ao3 have a different mentality, so to speak. In the same fandom you get completely different types of fiction in terms of plot and writing style.

I think that, in HP fandom at least, ffnet is more known for novel style works, while ao3 is more for easy reading. (There are exceptions, of course). It is also easier to stumble upon a really bad story on ffnet then on ao3. And there are more kinky and controversial works on ao3;)
