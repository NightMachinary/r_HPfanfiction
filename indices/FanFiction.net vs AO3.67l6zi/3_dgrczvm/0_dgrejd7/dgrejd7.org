If you're on (a relatively new version of) Firefox, you can pop Ao3 into [[https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages][Reader View]]. I use it with FFN too since the sepia mode is easier on the eyes.

The only issue with it is that you have to click out of Reader to go to a new chapter on FFN (but Ao3 typically allows you to read a whole fic instead of just chapter by chapter, so that's not an issue there).
