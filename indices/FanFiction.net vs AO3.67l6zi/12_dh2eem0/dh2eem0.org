In terms of pure content

FFN: Long, drawn out, 100k+ sagas of romance, drama, and action. Fics are on average fairly tame, possibly as an aftereffect of the great Explicit purge. Het is usually more common, depending on the fandom. Significantly more fics available.

AO3: Fics fall on the shorter side, one shots or <60k works being more popular. Tone of short fics is usually either humor or smut, possibly both. Longer fics have a greater variance of tone. In terms of explicitness, you wouldn't be surprised to see the top kudosed fic be filled with painstakingly detailed descriptions of each and every push and shove and pull in the act of sex. Slash and femslash is usually more common, possibly because of the aforementioned explicitness. Less fics available, but because of having separate rating systems for keeping a fic and liking one (bookmarking and kudosing, respectively, it's easier to find better written fics at the top (if sorting by kudos) instead of just classics and the stuff people want to keep for later.
