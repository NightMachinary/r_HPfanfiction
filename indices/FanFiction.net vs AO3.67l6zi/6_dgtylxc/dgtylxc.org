I prefer AO3 for two reasons, one, I find it really hard to search for/find new stories on FFN and two because I love that on AO3 you have the option of viewing either chapters or the entire work- this is especially handy when I know I'm going someplace with crappy phone service, I can open an entire story, turn off my wifi and read, while with FFN I'd have to turn the wifi/3G back on to get to each new chapter.

To be fair though, I don't use a specific app for either, (up until a week ago my phone was only 8G worth of storage so I had like no apps at all) I just upgraded though so I'm interested to see if the reading experience is different through the app.
