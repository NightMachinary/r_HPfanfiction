While I generally prefer AO3 for several reasons, when it comes to HP fic, FFN is pretty much my main hunting ground (unless I'm searching for slash/femslash). FFN simply has a larger (and older) selection of HP fics.

I crosspost to both AO3 and FFN unless my fic features adult content. Whether or not I get more traffic from FFN or AO3 depends on 1) the fandom and 2) the pairings, if any. Some fics do better on AO3, others on FFN. It really depends. So really, your best bet would be to make your fics as accessible to as many readers as possible by posting to both sites (unless you find it too bothersome, in which case I'd just choose whichever site is less of a hassle to use. For me, that's AO3.)
