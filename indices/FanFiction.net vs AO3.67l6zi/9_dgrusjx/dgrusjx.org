I really like ao3 in terms of layout and functionality, but I can never find anything I want to read there and my fics never see much traffic. It must be great if you're into AU or non-canon pairings, but for us vanilla, canon compliant people it can be a little disappointing.

I hate so much of fanfic.net - I hate the doc manager, I hate the layout, I hate the guest review feature. But it just seems to be the go to and where everything is happening. I miss the glory days of mugglenet fanfic but it's so riddled with spam accounts it's unusable now.
