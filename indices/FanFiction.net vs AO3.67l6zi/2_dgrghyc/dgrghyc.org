I primarily use AO3, but not for Harry Potter fic. I really only look at AO3 for HP fic if I have a particular pairing in mind.

AO3 has a lot of benefits: better interface with some customization. There's also a good amount of support for downloading fic, as well as a robust tag system. Sorting by kudos/bookmarks gives better quality fic on AO3 than the equivalent on FFnet (which tends to be long, shorter chapter stuff.) Not to say this doesn't happen on AO3-- it does-- the influence is just dampened. I also like the interaction system better than ffnet, though wish they had PMs. I use it for most other fandoms, especially if I'm writing for a particular pairing.

However, the tag system in specific is not without faults, and those faults seem to converge for Harry Potter stuff. People over-use tags, which means they'll tag a fic with every background character ever, which means it's hard to find character-centric fics. This also applies to pairings, and the series in general gets massed in with a lot of crossovers. It's hard to catch readers on AO3, especially if you're writing for background characters and not a pairing.

When it comes to finding fic, well... I tend to use either ffnet for a specific character, or old LiveJournal rec lists for general fic. (Though there's a lot of drama with LJ servers recently, so I'll have to back up my recs...) You're also looking at a lot older content on ffnet/LiveJournal/SugarQuill than on AO3-- which isn't bad, but it's more likely to contradict canon.

I will say I think AO3 slash/femslash fic tends to be much less... prototypical "slash don't like don't read" as ffnet, and I say this as someone who writes/reads it.

As for your situation-- doesn't hurt to post it on FFN, especially if it's Harry Potter! I haven't written much HP (a short one shot is it) but there wasn't a lot of overlap of readership on what I did cross-post. Doesn't hurt to increase your readership.
