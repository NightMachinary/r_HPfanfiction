For HP fanfiction, I think that AO3 is a better venue for more "out there" stories, and out there in this context includes slash or dark themes. In my opinion, the top ranked FFN HP fics are pretty mainstream in terms of cultural issues (certainly heteronormative).

I've also had better luck just picking "random" stories on AO3 in comparison with FFN. My absolute #1 criteria is quality of writing, and though there are truly excellent writers on both sites, in my experience the writing trends better on AO3. I feel like authors on AO3 are more likely to use a beta than on FFN, so that saves a lot of time in weeding out dreadful grammar, spelling, plotting, etc. When I first started reading fanfiction I mostly used FFN; now I read AO3 stories almost exclusively.
