Funny asshole Harry seconded. I feel like even writers who try to write canon Harry don't get this aspect across quite enough. When he was in first year, though, he was very naive and unconfident in the beginning. That makes me love him even more. He only grew into his funny stuff once he had strong social support, aside from his brave jabs at the Dursleys.

Smartypants Harry is annoying because I just remember him slacking off with Ron. If Harry is studious, he needs a compelling reason. Womanizer Harry will make me close a fic. I just find it tiresome for some reason. I guess I just don't read much het.
