I really like the "don't really care Harry Potter" characterisation that you see in thief!Harry stories or the fic 'now you see me'.

Although I would really like to see a happy-go-lucky and larger than life Harry Potter. For example: Harry has just discovered the wizarding world and he now has a place to get away from his relatives. Nothing can get his spirits down and he is absolutely ecstatic about learning magic. A Harry that actually embraces the wizarding world, but not in the way that he finds out that he is heir to everything but rather a more fun Harry that explores magic.
