I like when his personality is an exaggerated form of what it was in the books. I've always felt he was lacking in terms of characterization, especially compared to most other characters that had a lot of depth. So I like him being made a larger than life character or in other words, a hyperbole of himself. I like when people acknowledge Harry's flaws, his emotional volatility, his bad decision making, his single-mindedness, his messiah complex.

Something I absolutely hate is when people dehumanize him for wish fulfillment. I like real characters with real flaws, and omnipotent, omniscient Harry is anathema. Also dark, torture-porn Harry is about as far from canon as you can get.
