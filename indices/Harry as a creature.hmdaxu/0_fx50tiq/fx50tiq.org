First are you talking about being a magical creature from the get go (eg it's in his blood) or being able to transform (animagi) into a magical creature?

Assuming you want magical creature bloodline, The most common "magical creature" that I see in Fics is for Harry to be part incubus (male succubus/demon). And this runs the gamot from a past ancestor having kids with a demon, to Lily being the Hell Queen on a visit, to Lily sleeping with a demon, to Lily making a deal with a demon to protect Harry and the demon "changes" harry so he survives.

One story had Harry have Sirens in his background and he becomes a winged Siren. In another story harry is descended from a different winged magical creature. Both stories have these creatures being very protective of those they consider mates/family and that's fits well with Harry's canon personality and desires (eg saving people thing and desperately wants a family). And a flying creature just makes sense for how good canon Harry is on a broom. I mean come on challenging a top air predator (dragon) in the air?

So as much fun as an Incubus story can be I prefer these other two "flying creatures". Great flyers and very protective of their mates/family which matches Harry's canon traits/personality.

The stories are Harry Potter and the Siren's Song by hermyd
