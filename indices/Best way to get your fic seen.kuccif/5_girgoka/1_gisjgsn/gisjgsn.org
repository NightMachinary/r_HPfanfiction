Thanks for the advice! I'm at around 40,000 words now and trying to update 2x/week. I know what you mean, as a reader I hate when a fic I love gets abandoned or it goes so long I've forgotten it by the time an update rolls around.

To answer your question- it's not so much that I need a million views, I just want to have readers engage. At the end of the day you write because you enjoy it, but it is incredibly motivating to know that people want to read what you're writing and are enjoying it.

Good point about the romance- I guess that's something I have to consider. I like the more mentor/guardian type fics, which I think has its own base, but I'll have to consider if there's a way to bring romance in some other way. Thanks for taking the time to write this out!
