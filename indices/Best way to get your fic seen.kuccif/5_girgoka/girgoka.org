I don't know but is seeking large numbers realy the point? I realise that sounds dumb but the truth of fanfiction is it doesn't realy lead anywhere, so big numbers don't realy give much.

But i do realise that getting alot of feedback is nice so here is what i think.

1. If you are on ffn try getting your word count above one of the search catagories like 70 000. I usaly search by 100 000 words.
2. shiping or tropes. every one has their favorit, pick one and do some self advertising on their forums pretty sure som one else said you can advertise on this sub so try that.
3. Be concistent(the classic youtube advice LuL). my brain can only hold so many stories at once so i don't tend to follow things that don't update regularly and im willing to bet many others agree. No one wants an abandoned fic.

That's atleast what i think, i specialy agree with chlorinecrownt on the romance part. Most readers go for romance.
