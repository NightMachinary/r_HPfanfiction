The best thing I did to up my reader count was join discord servers for my ships where self promotion was encouraged.

Sorry I don't have a Severitus server to recommend, but I'm a sev multishipper so dm me if you want invites for SSHG, SSHP, SSRL, or SSSB.

Edit: Other things I've done include (1) post at AO3 -- there are cult readers who follow certain tags and Severitus is probably one of them, and (2) participate in challenge/fest events -- those are promoted by the organizers for extra readership.
