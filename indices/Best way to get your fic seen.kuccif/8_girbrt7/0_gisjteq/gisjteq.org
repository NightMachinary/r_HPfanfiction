I'm not sure what you mean by writing to be successful. I write because I enjoy it- but when you put a lot of yourself into it, it is nice to know that there are people reading and enjoying it. I've enjoyed other people's writing a lot- it's helped me through a lot of difficult things. I feel bad now for all of the times that I read an amazing fic, or a brilliant chapter and I didn't write a review or give feedback. As a writer, now that means a lot to me.

But I agree with you in principle!
