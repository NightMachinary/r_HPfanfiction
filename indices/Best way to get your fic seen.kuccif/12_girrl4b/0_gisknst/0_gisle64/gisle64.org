awesome! Good luck! I do find that I get more comments on AO3, and you can also maximise that by writing in your authors notes headcanons and stuff that will get them to interact with you. Like you can ask questions about what they liked, some writers will even ask questions about stuff not in the story

I always have a note on my stories that I don't want concrit, because I just am not here for that; but if they say what they liked, for me it's more helpful (and more likely to make me want to write more) so I find that defining how you would like readers to interact with you can be helpful---esp because a lot of readers don't always really know what to say, but if you're like ‘did you like this thing?' They will be like ‘actually yes'

and I'll reiterate that on AO3 your tags are really important. Go around and look at the tags on fics that are similar to yours, so you know you're using the correct tags that will bring the right reader to you. If you just bung whatever on there it won't be useful to you or your readers
