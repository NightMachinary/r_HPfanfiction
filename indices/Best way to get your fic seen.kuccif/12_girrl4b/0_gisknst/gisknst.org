GREAT, thanks so much for your thoughts and advice. I definitely am going to cross post on AO3. For me it isn't at all about the stats- I want that interaction with the readers. I write for myself and it's been a great mental exercise for me, but it means a lot more when I get feedback from other people and know that they are enjoying what I write and are engaged. It is also really fun to hear their ideas and feedback, and sometimes it even changes the direction the fic will take.

Thanks for taking the time to share your advice!
