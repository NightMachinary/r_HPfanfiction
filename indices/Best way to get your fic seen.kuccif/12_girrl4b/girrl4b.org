biggest things for me is crossposting to both ao3 and ffnet, because lots of people only really use one, and then the other is using tagging on ao3, and to update chapter by chapter instead of all at once.

at the end of the day how many people read it after that seem to be whether it's a popular trope or pairing or not

I used to promo on my tumble but it didn't really make any difference to readers I don't think

Those numbers are actually really pretty good, pretty sure they're better than my fics get.

At the end of the day the connection you can have to your readers is special, but I try to look out for like, two reviews or comments that let me know that someone really gets what I'm trying to do, or saw that one detail that others didn't seem to notice, and that makes me really happy. I really do write for me but it's so nice when the world is hard and awful and life is getting you down to have people liking something you've put out there. But getting lost in the stats just isn't good for anyone's mental health <3 fan fic is supposed to be fun after all!
