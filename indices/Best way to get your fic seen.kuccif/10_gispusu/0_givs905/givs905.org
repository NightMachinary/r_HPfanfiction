Yep! Just started cross posting there, I love that site. Although I'm not getting as much engagement there as in years past, but I made the mistake of posting all of the chapters I had at once. It's a great place.

I also joined their discord- their mods are pretty helpful.

Do you know any other discord channels for non-slash Snape groups? I've never really messed around with Discord but it seems like there's a lot happening there. I just don't know how to find it!
