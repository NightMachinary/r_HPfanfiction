I wasn't sure how that worked- I don't see a lot of self-advertising and I didn't want to piss anyone off, lol. But here's a link. It's definitely its own niche (Snape+Harry mentor fic), so I know it's not for everyone, but there are some great fics in the genre and it seems to have a pretty big readership (Potions and Snitches is one of the biggest C3 groups on FFN).

Thanks for the advice- I guess I shouldn't be shy about posting it in appropriate places.
