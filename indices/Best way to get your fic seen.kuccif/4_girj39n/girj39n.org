Unfortunately, there's no real 'secret to success'. There's a million fics across a million different places (slight hyperbole, but it is the internet) and as far as I can see, there's no real pattern between 'em. Harry Crow, despite the hatred demonstrated in forum posts, is incredibly widely viewed/read, for example. The internet is weird, and even the big youtubers struggle to stay relevant quite often. And I know this isn't all that helpful, but really try to remember that safe space and that enjoyment of incredible worlds in stories - the only difference is, you're the one providing those things now. Chasing the stats is difficult and even those big youtubers who get paid baffling sums for their work struggle, so doing it for free can be tough. But you asked how people get more readers and I'll try give an answer because otherwise this post is just not relevant to what you're asking and that ain't dope, yo.

Well, you're asking about getting more people reading your work, so the first thing to look at is how they do so. There's generally three stages of 'access' for readers - the place you write/edit, the place you post, the place you advertise.

Talk about what you're writing and how you're changing it while you do it, in short. There's a bunch of different places to do it - discussion posts here are great if you wanna thrash out plot or settings ideas, and a lot of writers swear by various discords (some they set up themselves to cover their work, letting readers join as they encounter their works wherever its been posted, others are actual pre-existing writing-support discords - I don't know any you could access personally, but if you do a little searching, you'll probably find something you can work with) and social media communities and forums (eg. The Dark Lord Potter forum) where they can post their WIPs and get feedback and update as they go from both readers and fellow writers.

There's no specific 'best place to post' - each site has it's strengths and weaknesses and you'll get different things from each one. I'm told that generally, the pattern is more comments and reviews on Ao3 and more viewers on FFNet, with a few variants in other spots as well (eg. Self-promo posts here, tumblr/livejournal blogs, specialist fandom/pairing sites like SIYE, general fic sites like SpaceBattles or Questionable Questing, etc).

Generally, good posting habits also help. Good titles and good summaries can draw people in, tagging properly (enough to filter in/out, but not enough to turn people off - eg. tag the main pairings and character types, but not those people who were mentioned that one time in chapter 3), and posting to a regular schedule that you let people know about. What the schedule is doesn't really matter though - If you can only post every second saturday, so be it, but always do your best to post then. That regularity is probably one of the most recurring tips I've seen/heard whenever people talk about getting wider interest and attention from the public.

Side Note: Ao3 is time-delayed, so you either have to enter the sign-up queue and wait, or get an invitation from an existing user (I can send you a link, if you'd like).

And then, where you advertise. Sometimes that's you doing it, other times that's your readers themselves sharing. Keeping an eye out here and on other fandom subs is pretty good - request threads come up all the time, and if one is relevant to your fic, you can totally post a link! If you wanna go direct, there's self-promotion posts (if you do this, please make the title something about your fic - it'll get you more 'clicks', definitely) as well.

Finally, sometimes, it just takes time. A lot of the fics that we recommend regularly or that come up a lot have been around for A WHILE and they've built up the awareness over that decade or whatever they've been around. So, y'know. Make friends, write comments and reviews on other people's stuff, connect. It's a nice place to just discuss fics and be part of a community. And if you connect with others and help them out, they might connect back and help you. Hell, maybe you'll befriend a fellow writer and co-author something together, or they'll become your Beta and help you improve your writing, or convert you to another pairing/trope writing idea entirely.
