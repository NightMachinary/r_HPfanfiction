My first bit of advice is totally subjective, so take it with a grain of salt: FFnet is dying. The folks in charge have clearly been putting all of their effort into Fiction Press. They are unresponsive to every issue. I've been trying to keep tabs on people's attempted interactions with their twitter account because they've been ignoring reports of my fic getting repeatedly plagiarized on their site, and they are ignoring absolutely everyone. People are leaving. It might not be "in droves" levels yet, but I've been through enough fandom exoduses to know what I'm seeing. Unless that changes (either by new staff or by a sale of the site to another company), FFnet is on its way out.

I would try Ao3. Again, this is subjective, but their layout is cleaner, it's easier to find fics you're looking for using their tags, and it's not overloaded with ads. Once users figure out that they can filter certain tags out and even hide tags completely while searching, I've rarely heard of someone going back to FFnet or WP or the like.

If you do wind up on Ao3, use tags wisely. Tag it with truly relevant characters/pairings/additional tags, and avoid tagging it with something that only appears for five seconds. Don't use tags as author's notes. (Use author's notes for author's notes, haha.) Many many many readers heavily rely on tags to search for fics that hit their buttons, so it's important to use them well.

Finally, for the bit of advice that I DON'T think is subjective: the summary is key. It needs to be more of a blurb than a paragraph because attention spans these days are thin. It needs to be intriguing, unique, and it needs to be grammatically correct.

I have a Tumblr and have used it to communicate about my fic, but I'm pretty sure the majority of attention comes from Ao3 itself.

I'm sorry to hear about all you've gone through lately. Fic writing is definitely cathartic.
