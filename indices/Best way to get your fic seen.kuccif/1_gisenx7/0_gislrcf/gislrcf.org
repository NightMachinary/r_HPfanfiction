This is wonderful advice, thanks so much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful response. I'm definitely getting the idea that I should cross post this, so I will do that now. I had no idea FFN was dying.

I enjoy reading on AO3 but felt a little intimidated by the platform since I see a lot more erotic fiction there (which is great, it's just not something I know how to write). The tags are intimidating but I think I can figure it out, the guidelines you give are great.

I appreciate your reply! THANK YOU !
