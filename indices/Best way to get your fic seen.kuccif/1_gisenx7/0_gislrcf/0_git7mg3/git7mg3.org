Oh, yes, there are increasing problems with FFN. I've had issues logging in while using TOR (because sometimes I want IP privacy). Also, they've apparently been having issues with DDOS attacks lately, which they chose to solve with Cloudflare, which is causing problems with FanFicFare (which I and many others use to download stories all the time). One of the commenters on that message board pointed out that there are others with major concerns over FFN's precarious position: [[https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=4080268&postcount=5156]]

On your fic, I would offer this constructive criticism: you've got a lot of telling instead of showing. For example, chapter two starts with Snape as the POV character. Instead of telling us it's almost midnight and he's not asleep, show us what he's doing. Is he grading? Is he working on a potion? What's keeping him up? Instead of telling us he's annoyed, show his reaction to the messenger (is it a school house elf?) Does he scowl? Flatten his mouth? Snap at the messenger? Burn the parchment?

Generally, it helps to cut out all of the "He knew..." and "He realized..." and just say what the character knows. We're in his head, so it's more immediate that way. The telling covers more story-chronology in a shorter space, but showing gives it more power.

YMMV, of course, but just a suggestion, meant in gentle kindness.
