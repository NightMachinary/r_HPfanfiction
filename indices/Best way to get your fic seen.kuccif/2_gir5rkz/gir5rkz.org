If you have a romantic angle, find the shipping community for that ship and post there. Make sure it's tagged.

When I just search on ffn or ao3, I tend to search by my favorite ship.

If you don't, advertise here as a gen fic, we're generally pretty hungry for those tbh. The main [[/r/harrypotter]] sub has "fanfic fridays", find that thread and post there next Friday, a lot of people see those threads. [[/r/fanfiction]] has regular "advertise here" threads, too.

My most common sources of new fics are either here or on my favorite ship's discord.
