Success in fanfiction tends to be pretty random, and there's only so much you can do. There's no big secret to it, and a lot of mega successful fics were just at the right place, right time. A BNF might have recommended it somewhere and sent all their followers to it, but that's really just luck on the author's part. Bear in mind that a lot of the fics with thousands of favorites and comments have been around for years. Yours has been around for a week.

There are a few things you can do to increase visibility, though, even if it won't magically shoot your fic into stardom.

I'd suggest crossposting on AO3 to reach a wider audience, and make sure to tag properly so that your target audience will find it (happy to provide more detail in that area if you want).

Also, the timing of your updates can make a big difference. If you post chapters too frequently (like more than once or twice a week) it limits your opportunity to build an audience. If you post regularly, say, once a week, you're posting frequently enough that you won't be forgotten and people won't lose interest, but you're giving people enough time to find your story and keep up with updates. Even if you write really quickly, wait it out a bit and let your fic marinate (for lack of a better word).

Can I have the link to your fic? Severitus/Sevitus is one of my favorite HP genre and I've written one myself. Would love to check your fic out.
