Regarding the time, I assume people have more time to read in the evenings, but it's a bit difficult because you're likely to have readers from multiple time zones. Even if you're just looking at the USA, there are different time zones within the country. I myself live in a time zone where most English-speaking readers don't, so I just post at the time of day that works for me.

Regarding the day, I'd say weekends are your best bet, because that's when people tend to have more time to read. Honestly, I don't know how much of a difference it makes though. It does look like you've been posting very frequently, so I'd recommend slowing it down just a little bit, and post chapters one at a time, no more than once/twice a week.

About AO3 tags: the first thing is parings/relationships. Since you said you're writing a Snape & Harry mentorship fic, you'll want to include the Harry Potter & Severus Snape tag (not to be confused with the Harry Potter/Severus Snape tag, which is slash). If there are any other significant relationships, platonic or otherwise, you'll want to include those as well. Separately from relationships, you should tag all the significant characters in your fic as well.

Then comes the additional tags, which is the hardest part to do. You want to give your readers a general idea of what your story is about, but you don't want to overtag, because that tends to put a lot of readers off, and it's just unnecessary. Based on what I know about your fic, some good tags would be Mentor Severus Snape, Apprenticeship, Hogwarts Second Year, and anything else that characterizes your story. Additionally, you'll want to include content warnings if your fic includes anything that might put readers off (abuse, graphic violence, etc).

I personally tend to err on the side of tagging too little, which could get in the way of visibility, because many people search for fics by tag, so the more tags you have, the more likely people are to find your fic, but if you have a wall of tags, people often tend to ignore it.

It may help to look at fics on AO3 that share similar themes to your story so you can get ideas for tags.

If your interested, my Harry & Snape fic is called [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=3048][To Trust]] (I wrote it a long time ago) and I'm currently working on a [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28613241/chapters/70129140][rewrite]] on AO3.
