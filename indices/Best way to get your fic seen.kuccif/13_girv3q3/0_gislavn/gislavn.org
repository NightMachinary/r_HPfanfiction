Thanks so much for this great advice- I'm definitely going to cross post I think. The timing of updates was something I was wondering about. Right now I wanted to post a big chunk so that I can get this story moving forward, but I agree with what you mean. DO you think the day/time you post matters?

This was fantastic advice. Definitely would love to read yours as well!

Also, I'd love to hear your thoughts on tagging- people on AO3 tag A LOT and I find it a bit intimidating, lol. Thanks for this great advice!
