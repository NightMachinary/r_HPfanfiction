[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12340905][Death's Gambit]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/MagdaTheMagpie/pseuds/MagdaTheMagpie][MagdaTheMagpie]] has Hermione be essentially kidnapped by Death to do his bidding. It is a crossover with the Avengers and has no Tony Stark in it. (It's sequel does though, but it's still a pretty minor role.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9558284][Hiding Alone in the Shadows]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/SeeEmRunning/pseuds/SeeEmRunning][SeeEmRunning]] has Hermione get abducted by a terrorist group. Snape goes looking for her. No romance. It's part of a larger AU though, so you might need to read the previous stories to understand how they got there.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/800094][Inquiry and Retrieval]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/arioso_dolente/pseuds/arioso_dolente][arioso_dolente]] is also a crossover, but you don't need to know anything about the crossover to follow the story. Hermione gets abducted by a sort of dragon. It happens midway through the story though and is only a minor plot point.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29484642][Tempus Anima]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/notahotlibrarian/pseuds/notahotlibrarian][notahotlibrarian]] has Hermione get abducted by an alternate dimension Cassiopeia Black supposedly because she is one of her kid's soulmate. The focus is on the abduction and nothing romantic happens at all. Short one-shot.
