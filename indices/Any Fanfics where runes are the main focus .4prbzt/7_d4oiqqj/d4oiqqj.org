Very AU Harry, just a warning.

This one is rubbing me the wrong way, because Harry is super unhinged in it and kind of murder-y. But... a large part of it deals with wandless magic and runes. If you can get past the horror, maybe you'll like it? It's not poorly written or anything. My personal tastes just don't match up with this story very well.
