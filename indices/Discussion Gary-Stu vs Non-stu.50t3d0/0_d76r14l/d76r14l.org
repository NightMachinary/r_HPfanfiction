I want to read a good story with an interesting and carefully thought plot which has believable and likeable characters. Well written is a plus... but I'm usually ok with average written skills.

If you tick all these boxes I probably won't mind Mary Sues/Gary-Stu characters. Unless they are too annoying and irritating - but then, I guess they wouldn't fit the true Mary/Gary stereotype, right?

However, my advice is stop to worry too much about what people might want to read. Write what you would like to read and write instead and I'm sure you will find some people that have similar tastes along the way.
