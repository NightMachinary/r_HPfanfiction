Both are crap, so there's no point in asking which of those is worse.

Because both of those are characters who face no challenges and who remain static throughout the story, which makes them just as shitty regardless of the so-called “stage of development” they start on.

Have the character challenged by something, best if it's at least partially his own shortcomings (or what he thinks to be ones), and have the character develop /some amount/ in /some way/, any way, and you'll probably end up with something readable; don't do it instead and you'll end up with puke pudding.
