I loved [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/shoebox-pdf-chapters/][The Shoebox Project]]. It's pretty dated and started many of the cliches but it's a classic. Sirius/Remus. James/Lily.

linkffn(Come Once Again and Love Me by laventadorn) Snape and Lily Marauders era time-travel. Eventual Snape/Lily.

linkffn(The Apprentice by Deborah Peters) Snape Marauders era time-travel. Probably abandoned.

linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles by Rannaro) covers the Marauder years. You might disagree with some characterizations but it got the time-period right.
