  This is a collection of one-shots written for ten reviewers of my story, "They Didn't Know We Were Seeds", to celebrate it reaching one thousand reviews. Currently: Severus reflects after he returns from his and Lily's original timeline. Previously: A typical day with the Marauders in "They Didn't Know We Were Seeds".
