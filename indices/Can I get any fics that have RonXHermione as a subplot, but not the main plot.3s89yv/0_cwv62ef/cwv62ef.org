[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived by Diane Castle]] is a non-magical AU where "Harworts" is an exclusive boarding school for training spies, handlers, interrogators, hackers, and other operatives for Britains tumultuous Intelligence Community. Old families, like the "Wellesleys" and the "Malenfants", send their children there; but some common children get an invitation if they do something sufficiently interesting and/or vicious at a sufficiently young age. (Hermione gets in for solving the murder of her friend, then gaslighting the murderer into suicide, and almost getting away with it; Colin Creevy gets in for taking some pictures that he shouldn't have and certainly shouldn't have been able to...) Magic is replaced with skill and science, and, occasionally, with James Bond style superscience.

Pairings are basically canon, with relationship between Hermione and Ron developing gradually over time over the course of their adventures.
