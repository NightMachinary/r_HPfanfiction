Yeah, that particular option, move to the moon, occurs every once in a while. But when it does, it generally happens as a much delayed response to something muggles did, which is sort of what I'm angling at here. Wizards are always portrayed as being very passive, and to a certain extent that might be true given their society seems to move at a much slower pace than muggle, but there still should be some things that wizards are doing on their own, for their own reasons. I remember xerosis (faintly, its been a while) and the move to the moon was done as part of the Blood War. I would love to see a fic where, maybe that was like a big part of Third Year or something, Harry learning that he joined the wizarding world at an interesting time because the Magical world has been realizing its going to be harder and harder to hide from muggles on earth and they have plans in motion to just, move everything that have been in the works for years and are now coming to fruition. They want an entirely magical planet, and they're going to get one, and while muggles are a factor in consideration, this is a big innovation that wizards are doing on their own for the most part.
