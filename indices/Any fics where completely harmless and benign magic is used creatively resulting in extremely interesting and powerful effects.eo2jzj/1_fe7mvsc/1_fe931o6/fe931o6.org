I was going to make a prompt about this. One of the first spells taught to students is a Dark spell of the tallest order.

Add in a sprinkle of Harry the Hufflepuff, and I can see the teacher introduce a new spell. Harry opens his mouth and the scene changes to smoke, fire, screams of pain, and Hermione yelling at Harry.
