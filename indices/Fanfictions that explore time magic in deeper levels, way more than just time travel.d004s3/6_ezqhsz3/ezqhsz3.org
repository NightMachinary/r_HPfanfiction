I know a fanfic called Too many Travellers but I didn't find it that good.

If you are craving that kind of story then watch the not fanfic Steins;Gate. It is the best time travel story that I have ever seen (And I have seen /many)/ and has everything you have asked for, executed perfectly. The consequences of time travel only come at episode 13 though, but once you reach that point it is worth it (The previous episodes are for world building and that does not mean it is boring there).
