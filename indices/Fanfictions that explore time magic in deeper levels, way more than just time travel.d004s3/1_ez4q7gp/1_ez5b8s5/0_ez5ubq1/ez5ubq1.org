Harry's wish causes Regulus to survive, which introduces the Black Phantom to the first Voldemort war, which causes Regulus and Lord Black to free Sirius shortly before Harry's original wish, which causes Sirius to turn back a month where he becomes Lord Black and frees his younger self with his brother, then he turns back again and prepares evidence against the Dursleys which allows him to adopt Harry the day after the wish.
