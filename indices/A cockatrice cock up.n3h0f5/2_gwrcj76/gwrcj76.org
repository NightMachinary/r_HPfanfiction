I believe in mythology that's correct. Weasels eat basiliks and are immune to its poison. But mythology also depicts basiliks as small snakes which makes them even deadlier because you could just stare at a patch of grass and die. However it would be cool if you had a Chuck Norris joke: the basilisk bit Ron/Ginny and after hours of agonizing pain, the basilisk died.
