This reminds me of the plot line in Teen Wolf where the idea of silver killing werewolves was a mistranslation arising from the fact that the Argent family are werewolf hunters. Are you saying that something similar happens in HP where the Weasley family are actually historic cockatrice hunters/naturally deadly to cockatrices and the idea that /weasels/ kill a cockatrice is a mistranslation?
