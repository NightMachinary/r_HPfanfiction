The cockatrice's nails clacked against the flagstones as it prowled the corridor just ahead. Ron halted in his tracks and glanced back at Harry and Hermione.

"This is a bad idea," he said, swallowing.

"We've been over this, mate," Harry said. "Just go hunt it down, and we'll still make it on time to dinner."

"Hunt it down /how/?" A hysterical note entered Ron's voice. "It's five times my size and has deadly poison!"

Harry rolled his eyes. "What do I know? You're the Weasley."

"It will come to you, I'm sure," Hermione said. "All the books agree that hunting cockatrices is in your blood."

Ron just shook his head and backtracked, pale-faced. The horrible clacking drew ever closer. Exchanging a nod, Harry and Hermione shoved him out into the open.
