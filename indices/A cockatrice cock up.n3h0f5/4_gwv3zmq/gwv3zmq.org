The one I remember (but I don't remember which fic) had an anecdote about the world's only successful cockatrice breeding. It fought it's way free from the egg, murdered its parent, and then promptly committed accidental suicide when the rooster half'fs cry turned out to be fatal to the basilisk half. I damn near killed myself laughing at that.
