Ooh, dimension travel; one of my favourite trope. Some of these doesn't meet all your criteria but here we go:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558][face death in the hope]]. It's time travel rather than dimension travel, but I think this is the most emotional one. I liked how Harry tried to be reliable during the first war, but he also brought a big baggage. His PTSD here is off the chart .
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks]]. Hermione is sent to another dimension during the final battles, and Harry tried to followed her trail. It's bittersweet, and the moment Harry met Hermione felt so satisfying. It has a Hermione-centered sequel on Porkey-Archive.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12918499/1/Through-The-Looking-Glass][Through The Looking Glass]]. Depressed!Harry is sent to another universe after the final battle, met Lily and a different Hermione there and tried to heal.
- I seconded [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2705927/1/Imprisoned-Realm][Imprisoned Realm]]. If you want to cry like a baby, this is the fanfiction for you.

​

These aren't emotional, but still a good Dimension Travel fanfiction.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13912332/chapters/32017587][sleeper]]. The characterization here is perfect. We see Harry that simply cannot let Tom runs free on Hogwarts, even if it's on another universe and he barely knew anyone there. Harry isn't OP, he's what I thought canon!Harry will become after a few years of Auror training.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/1/0800-Rent-A-Hero][0800 Rent A Hero]]. The Order summons Harry to another universe, but he didn't want to help them since the Order basically kidnapped him. A really good take on divination, but I don't think there's anything else going on.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7534131/1/Stunning-Shifts][Stunning Shifts]]. Harry and five of his friends is sent to another universe by Fawkes. I like how the author shows how Harry feels saving another universe isn't his job, but after a seeing how corrupt the universe is he just can't let it go. It's a middle-ground between sleeper and Rent A Hero.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]]. Harry met Sirius after falling trough the veil. A few days later, they have fun together.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here][I'm Still Here]]. A good Powerful!Harry, but I don't remember anything else.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/A-Riddled-Universe][A Riddled Universe]]. Harry met Good!Tom in another universe and help Tom to solve a mysterious murders.
