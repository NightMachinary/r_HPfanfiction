linkffn(Imprisioned Realm) has one of the best true GG Dumbledore (not evil, nor stupid, actually working for the greater good at the cost of everything that is at his disposal) Multiple plot-lines that are extremely interesting and unique, 2 Harrys that are completely different and yet quite similar, in a world torn by the non-ending war.

Just a warning. There is A LOT of dark shit. From child slavery to graphical descriptions of wounds(both mental and physical) of rape.

100% worth it though, its marvelously well written and complete.
