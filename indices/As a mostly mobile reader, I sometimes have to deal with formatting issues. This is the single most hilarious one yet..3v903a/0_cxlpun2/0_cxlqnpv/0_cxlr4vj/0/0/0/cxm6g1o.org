Yes. The author is off course free to add restrictions like "no old folks" but it's up to them. If it can happen to Lily Potter, Minerva, Amelia Bones, Augusta Longbottom, Hedwig, etc it can happen to anyone...except Petunia or Dolores. I base that on the assumption that no amount of time travel or de-aging potion can produce a scenario where HP would pair with either character. That being said, there are anarchist writers out there looking to break the bounds of decency who may write a HP/DU, but lets hope for the best.
