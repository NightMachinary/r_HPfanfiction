There's a multi-cross by Tenhawk called [[http://fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com/viewstory.php?sid=35][Alexander Harris and the Shadow Council]] that, though abandoned (apparently) is still worth a read (109 chapters and a partially done sequel, so a good bit of story despite being incomplete). It's not quite what you're after, but one of the better HP/Buffy crossovers.

In total, it's a HP/Buffy/Addams Family crossover.
