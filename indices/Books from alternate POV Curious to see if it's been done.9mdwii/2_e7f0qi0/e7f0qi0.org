[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6654621/1/Beside-Me-Always][Beside Me... Always]] linkffn(6654621) covers a lot of the series from Dumbledore's perspective. (I haven't read the whole thing though, so I can only partially vouch for its quality.) I've also seen the following fics recced, but haven't read them at all: [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1][Minds Eye, Souls Reflection]] (Luna's perspective of Order of the Phoenix), [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3867967/1/Asking-for-Roses][Asking for Roses]] (Neville in the summer before Deathly Hallows) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4007457/1/The-Sleeper-Awakes][The Sleeper Awakes]], and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3784000/1/The-Scarlet-Pimpernel][Scarlet Pimpernal]] (both Percy during the Deathly Hallows).
