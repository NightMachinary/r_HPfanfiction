I'm not a huge fan, but that's more because Ron is a very different character than canon and there's mafia boss Slytherin children. If you're not a huge Ron fan, you'll probably like it a lot after the first couple of chapters especially if you enjoy indie!character or manipulation stories. This Ron is developed a lot more than any indie!Harry I've ever seen tbh.
