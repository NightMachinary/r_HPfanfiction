Yep! Although correct me if I am wrong, but I think Harry doesn't tell Lupin that. I think Lupin sees Pettigrew on there himself after confiscating the map from Harry.

Anyway, two fics I would recommend for this are:

1)[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7860277/1/Chemistry-Timing][Chemistry and Timing]] - A GREAT WIP time-travel fic with Lupins POV during most of canon (starts with POA though). One of the best time travel fics I've read and I've read a LOT. The basic premise is that adult Hermione travels back to 3rd year and hides in the castle for 10 months until she can go back to present day. The only people who know are Remus and Dumbledore. The POV switches between canon Remus and time-traveling Hermione.

2) For Sirius and Remus's POV during POA, check out [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/940338][Padfoots Tale]] and the companion [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/946711][Moony's Tale]]. They are 100% canon compliant but do take the view that Remus and Sirius were a couple before Sirius went to Azkaban. IIRC they aren't smutty at all if you aren't into slash.
