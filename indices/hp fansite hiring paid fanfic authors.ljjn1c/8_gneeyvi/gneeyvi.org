A solid no from me. This is the kind of thing that may destroy fanfiction eventually. You're supposedly going to be paying people to write fanfiction, to publish on a site that I assume will give you some revenues from advertising.

This is 100% illegal. I suggest you can this idea immediately, if only to save yourself the headache that will come your way, if you persist.

Having said that, I wonder if commissioning an artist to do a picture of your Harry, for example, which is then posted on their Deviant Art, would be considered the same thing?
