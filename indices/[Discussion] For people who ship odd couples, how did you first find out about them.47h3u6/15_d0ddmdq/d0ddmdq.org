It really depends what you call odd. I've heard Harry/Luna be called odd before but I consider it pretty standard. One I would consider odd myself which I like is Draco/Theodore. I don't tend to go for slash but I really like this one for some reason. I found it on the old Fiction Alley Forum back in the day... good times...
