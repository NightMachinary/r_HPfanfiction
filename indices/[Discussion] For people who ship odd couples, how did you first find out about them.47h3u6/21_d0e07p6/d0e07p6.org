I ship Draco/Ron. Draco is shipped with just about everybody, so it's not the rarest rarepair out there, but of the Draco/MC ships it's definitely the least popular.

Basically, back when I was first getting into HP fanfiction I went through cycles of favoring different pairings. (Today, when I go in to a new fandom I've usually already got a pairing in mind, but it was one my first fandoms so my shipping goggles had yet to develop.) I was briefly into Draco/Ginny, Draco/Harry, and Draco/Hermione until I came across a Draco/Ron fic. I fell in love, and the rest is history.

I think it's mostly because Ron is my favorite character, so he's going to be half of my OTP no matter what, and I really like enemy-to-lovers.
