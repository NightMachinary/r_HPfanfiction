linkffn(The Tapestry of the Red Horse) is one of my favorites and the one that got me into the pairing. I'll admit it doesn't have the best writing, but it's good enough to handle. The main attraction is an asshole, controlling Draco that's closer to canon than a lot of other Dracos, and it's honestly probably the most realistic depiction of how their relationship would /actually/ be.

Others that are fairly long and mostly cute/funny:

linkao3(The Better Part of Valor)

linkao3(Tinker, Tailer, Soldier, Spy)

linkao3(Archipelago)
