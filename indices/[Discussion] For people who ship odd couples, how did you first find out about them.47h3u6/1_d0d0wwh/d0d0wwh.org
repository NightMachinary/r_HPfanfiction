I like the idea of Luna/Charlie but don't think I've come across any. I can see Charlie being so excited about traveling and exploring with her, hunting for her creatures, and Luna is one of the few characters who I can see happily moving to Romania and trying to make friends with his dragons. I know a relationship needs more than that, but a mutual love of the outdoors, and travelling, and unusual animals is a damn good start.
