I'd never thought of Tom Riddle/Minerva until you brought it up, but I fell in love with the idea almost instantly and had to go look up if this existed anywhere. And it does. And it's quite good. I'm only on chapter 9 (out of 34), but if it continues the way it's going I would most definitely recommend it. It fits your description pretty well, too.
