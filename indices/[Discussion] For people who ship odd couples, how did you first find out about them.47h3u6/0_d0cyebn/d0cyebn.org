I ship young!Tom Riddle/ Minerva, but it only metaphorically because no one writes the pairing. So there haven't been any fics in the fandom to ruin it for me yet. If Tom wasn't such an evil maniacal sociopath, I imagine they'd get along swimmingly though that would be no fun. So, instead, I like the idea of them having an antagonistic but strangely involved powerplay with the occasional twisted display of pseudo-affection that very thinly borders romance, but lacks any prerogative to really take form.

They'd crash and burn but it'd be really interesting to read about. No one's ever going to write it though, so meh -_-
