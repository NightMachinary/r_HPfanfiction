I began reading HP fanfictions right after rewatching GoF (I've read all the books don't worry please don't put my head on a spike I swear I'm innocent) and a quote from Moody describing Fleur got me really interested in what people have wrote on her, so I read all the good H/Fleur, and it started to make kind of sense after the 10th one. But I have yet to find a fic where Fleur is as badass as Moody (Hu...Barty Jr. I guess?) describes her. I'll have to write it myself it seems. The quote was: "She's as much a fairy princess as I am." Have you ever encountered a Fleur as badass as this? Oh, and to be perfectly honest, I'm french too, so...
