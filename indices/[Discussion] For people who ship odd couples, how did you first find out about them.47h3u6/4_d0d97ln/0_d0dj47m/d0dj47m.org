Hmmm you're right, there is a distinct lack of badass Fleur fanfiction. I'm usually a big fan of H/F but that's mainly because i really like the stories about her trying to prove that she's more than a pretty face, and while that's not too hard to find she's never a /real/ badass.

In case you find any or write one yourself please notify me :)
