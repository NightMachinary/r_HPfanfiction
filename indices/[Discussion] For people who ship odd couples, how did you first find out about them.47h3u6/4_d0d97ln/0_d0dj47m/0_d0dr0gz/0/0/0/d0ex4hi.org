It starts fairly late in the story IIRC. The relationship is just about to get serious when it was abandoned but there is a little bit of getting to know each other, a (more or less) date and a lot of pretending to hate each other before that.

It's a pretty good fic even without the relationship though. If you don't mind that you won't get to finish it you should give it a try.
