I'm actually writing a fic featuring Neville x Pansy as one of the main pairs. Unfortunately I lack the time and talent to do it justice but it came about as me thinking how canon wrote off every Slytherin student as (basically) evil and I wanted to challenge that. Plus, Neville ends up being kind of a badass in canon so I think more people should be into him, lol. Which Haphne fics do you rec?
