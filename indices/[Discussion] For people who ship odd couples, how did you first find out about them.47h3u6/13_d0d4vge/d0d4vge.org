I discovered Severus/Tonks from the work/thoughts of [[http://cokeworthcauldrons.tumblr.com/tagged/sevedora][cokeworthcauldrons]] on Tumblr

I found a [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/16241][Severus/Daphne series]] randomly scrolling through AO3. Not really invested in it, but I found parts of it endearing. It had [[http://bacchanxl.tumblr.com/post/115739590962/art-for-the-epilogue-of-the-thoroughly][a neat piece of art]] to go along with it, too. Even had past!Sev/Tonks, which was interesting.
