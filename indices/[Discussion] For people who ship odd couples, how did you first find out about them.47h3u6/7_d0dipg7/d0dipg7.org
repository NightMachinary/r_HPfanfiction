If you are looking for a specific pairing, fanfiction.net generally offers a nice filter. For example, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=10&s=2&c1=546&c2=1&_c1=6][this one]] gives the result for Harry/Bellatrix while excluding Draco Malfoy (avoid Drarry slash stories).

The top of the list, *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), makes a very convincing Harry/Bellatrix Black ship.

Sometimes you find odd pairings just by chance. *Patron* for example, linkffn(11080542), is doing a nice Ron/Pansy job.

Then sometimes you find [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2298556/Wanda-Ginny-Greenleaf][a author]] who has some really interesting ideas. Her stories contains some truly rare, but well written pairings (Ginny/Flora Carrow, Harry/Astoria). She could become a great writer if she were to cut down typos in her stories or find a beta.
