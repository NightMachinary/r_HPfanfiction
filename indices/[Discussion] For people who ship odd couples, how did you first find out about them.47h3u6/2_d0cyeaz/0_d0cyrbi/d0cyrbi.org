I like some of the stories with this ship, but it often gets bogged down in a love triangle with remus. I like them when they are hermione/remus OR hermione/sirius because honestly remus and sirius are bound to like different types, and even if they didnt love triangle angst is not my cuppa tea

Also, if the linkffn doesnt work, its because you have a space between the call and the parentheses.
