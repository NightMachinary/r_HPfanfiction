Yeah, roundabout destiny is one of the ones I read. Very . . . solid. I was hoping you had another one there with a VERY similar plot to roundabout destiny that was a) great and b) very smutty but which I c) didn't save and don't have in my favorites because I'm an idiot. I'll find it one of these days.
