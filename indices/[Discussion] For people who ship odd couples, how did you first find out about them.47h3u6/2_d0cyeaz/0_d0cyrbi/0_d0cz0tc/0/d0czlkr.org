Mmm, surprisingly no? I grabbed 3 time travel hermione stories in a row a while back, and the first was Hr/R, and hermione obliviated remus. I quit at that point, i just couldnt believe that romance anymore, and i hate obiviations with a passion, its just awful. The second was 169, liked it a lot. The third was a very angsty love triangle. I didnt finish it

Some pretty good related pairings:

Hermione/James: linkffn(Storm of Yesterday by ShayaLonnie)

Hermione /Potter//Sirius: linkffn(Roundabout Destiny by MaryRoyale)

Both are pretty good, but neither are amazing imo. Solid 4/5.
