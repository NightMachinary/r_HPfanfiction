There are a couple abandoned Harry/Katie ones that have a good start, but...they're always abandoned early. :/

I'm really surprised we don't see more fics with Harry paired up with one of the chasers. It seems like a relatively easy way to lay the foundations for the relationship. But like you said, the only ones that seem to crop up are smut fics with all three.
