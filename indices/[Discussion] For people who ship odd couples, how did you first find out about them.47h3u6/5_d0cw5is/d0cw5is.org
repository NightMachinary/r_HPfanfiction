Harry/Daphne isn't what I would call an odd couple. Sure, it's something you'll only discover once you're reading fanfiction, but there's pairings that are a lot rarer or odder, like Harry/Angelina, or odder and weird, like Harry/Lily or Harry/Rowena Ravenclaw. As for finding them... mostly just browse. Once you filter out all the bad pairings, some of the odder ones will pop up.
