I don't believe that H/L is a minority ship. Sure, it may have too few good stories, but in the fandom as a whole, H/L is the most popular Harry-ship after H/G.

If it doesn't exist, someone should really make a comprehensive list of do's and don'ts of characterizing Luna in fanfic. Luna centric as well as H/L fics would be much more numerous.
