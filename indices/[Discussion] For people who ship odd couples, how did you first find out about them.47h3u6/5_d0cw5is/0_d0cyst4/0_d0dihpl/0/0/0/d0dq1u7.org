Im not sure what fandom you've been living in, but H/Hr and H/G are two of the most popular pairings, and comprise the vast majority of main heterosexual monogamous relationships. Id expect H/Daphne or H/Susan is next most prevalent as a blank slate named character, and H/L is somewhere below H/Tonks on the amount written scale.

One must only look at harry/Luna main ship requests on this forum to see how few there are: i think the last one i saw got 4 fics listed, where H/G and H/Hr can easily get 15+ in a broad request, and H/Tonks at least 6
