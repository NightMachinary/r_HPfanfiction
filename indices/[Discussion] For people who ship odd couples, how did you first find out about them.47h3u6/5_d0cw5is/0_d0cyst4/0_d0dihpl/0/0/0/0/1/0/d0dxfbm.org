  H/Hr is probably just as popular as H/G out in the wider world though

If we were to talk 10-15 years ago (when no ship had been confirmed yet) then you would be correct. But now that we're almost 9 years since DH was released, H/Hr has gradually faded. Hell, even Dramione (which is definitely more unrealistic than H/Hr) is more popular now, which I've never understood the appeal of.

You'd be surprised how dominant H/G is in the wider world among book fans. There's a poll on Goodreads that shows H/G close to 60%, while H/Hr and H/L are around 20% each, where 1300 people have been polled. Not even the Donald can do better than that lol.

On the flip side though H/Hr is absurdly popular among movie fans, an MTV poll for DH1 shows H/Hr absolutely trouncing R/Hr by like 90% O__O
