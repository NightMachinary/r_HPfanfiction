Well I have a lot of friends who haven't read books but have seen the movies. They like the idea especially for half-blood Prince when Draco is all sad and Luna always has a great view point pretty much all of the time. Again I think both pairings are interesting but I like Harry and Luna more.

In addition I've also have found a lot more stories with Luna and Draco that I like than with Harry.
