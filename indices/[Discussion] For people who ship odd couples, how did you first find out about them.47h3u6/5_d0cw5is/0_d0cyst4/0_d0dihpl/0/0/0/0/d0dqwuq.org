I probably didn't make myself clear. I wasn't talking about the fanfiction community, I was talking about the general popularity in the fandom. H/L isn't as popular as H/Daphne in fanfiction, but it certainly is more popular generally. H/G isn't as popular in fanfiction than it is generally. Conversely H/Tonks is not really that popular generally, but it definitely is very popular in fanfiction.

So there is an obvious discrepancy between the popularity of certain ships and how many fics you can see of them.
