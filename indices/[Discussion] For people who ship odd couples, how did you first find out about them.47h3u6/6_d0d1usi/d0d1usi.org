Well I read a time travel thingy were Pansy fell for a young Minerva (as secondary pairing i think) and that kinda went well surprisingly.

I dont get why there seem to be so few Harry/Luna stories, because thats just awesome.

Also I didnt want to touch Harry/Snape with a ten foot pole for the longest time but after reading it I definitely shipped it. Though I often prefer them in a mentor/mentee relationship or something similar.

I once read an awesome Harry/Percy too. But I think thats like the only in existence, lol. And I think normally its just a nono.

Hermione/Krum is not very weird but I havent read any good ones - I think Hermione/Ron is too cliche so I really love this one ship at least in my head canon hehe.

I've been eyeing a few Riddle/Bellatrix ones lately, havent read them yet but it actually might work, in an insane murder spouses kinda way. Though I prefer dark-but-not-evil Riddle, so it might not. Anyway, i think thats it from the top of my head.
