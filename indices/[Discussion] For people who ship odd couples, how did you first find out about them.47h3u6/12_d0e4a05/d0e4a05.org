My first ship was SSHG (mostly because my roommate that introduced me to fanfiction said to read anything BUT that, so I read nothing else for months because I'm contrary and by then I was hooked). Now, when two characters have an interesting interaction in a fic I'm reading I think to myself, "Hmm, I wonder if there are any good stories shipping those two?" and search it out. I've come across some pretty odd pairings, but unfortunately not very many recommendable stories, haha. I do tend to gravitate more toward stories that are focused on anyone other than Harry as the main character.
