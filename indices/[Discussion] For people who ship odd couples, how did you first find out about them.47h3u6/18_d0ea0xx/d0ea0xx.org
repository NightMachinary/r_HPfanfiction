I guess it depends on what you consider odd. Harry/Fleur is probably my favorite, but I dunno if I really found out about it. I just liked the characters and started searching for fics.

Most of my other favored pairings started out similarly (Harry/Luna, Harry/Tonks, Harry/fem!Blaise) or happened from just searching by exclusion (Harry/Daphne, Harry/Bellatrix, Harry/Narcissa).

Mildly related, it still kinda bothers me that Blaise became male in canon. I assumed the character was a female for five books, and I still assume Blaise is female at first blush--takes me a minute to remember.
