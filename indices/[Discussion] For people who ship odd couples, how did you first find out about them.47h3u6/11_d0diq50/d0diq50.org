I decided to write a fic for a Doomed Ship challenge, and picked one purely because the prompt was a favourite song of mine. I almost didn't because the prompt also specified it had to be Padma/Astoria and I've never written slash or had any interest in either of those characters. But I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed writing it, and now definitely ship them.
