Aenor is pretty obvious in my opinion. Remember that Black girl who was so good at memory charms she had to wipe herself from everyone's memory? Guess who her descendant might be.

The Letifolds were part of a duelling practice with Aenor where Harry cast that spell without properly knowing what it did.

The girl thing is childhood trauma due to the treatment he got from the "light" nannies which were taking care of/abusing him.

I ditched the story a lot earlier than where you are because I found everyone but Hermione and Bellatrix's daughter unlikable dicks in that fic, especially Harry and Daphne.
