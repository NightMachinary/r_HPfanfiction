I feel the same way. The author uses this kind of unreliable narrator, keeping-the-readers-in-the-dark thing as plot device (?) or something. TBH it is too convoluted to be read incomplete. Not that it is a bad story, I, personally can't accompany what's happening, every new chapter I had to turn back and read the previous 3-5 chapters so I could remember. In that way, it could be unremarkable, or maybe I'm too daft to understand YakAge's nuances. I will read it in its entirety when it's complete though.
