With all the fic I read, I'm not even sure if this is canon or not, but from what I remember, Horcruxe does not offer any additional protection to an item and this is the wizard responsability to prepare a suitable receptacle, resistant enough for it.

Like, for example, Voldemort's Horcruxe may have been Basilisk venon resistant if he had found enough Phoenix's tears when he created them.
