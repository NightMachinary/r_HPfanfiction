I'm pretty sure it doesn't actually matter. Hermione says something when laying it all out about how horcruxes need to be destroyed "beyond magical repair," so it's not about the fact that the objects that house the soul fragments are indestructible, but rather that destroying the object with anything less than basilisk venom or fiendfyre or whatever all else would work in canon that wasn't explicitly mentioned is a waste of time.
