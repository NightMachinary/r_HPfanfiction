I agree with some of the other comments here - I feel like it would help with some specific tasks -mdepending on mechanisms.

For example, dementors seem to operate by bringing negative memories to the forefront and burying good memories, which suggests that they use a rudimentary form of mind-reading to identify negative memories.

Veela don't operate based on any conscious memory, they just manipulate a very basic instinct (i.e. lust, or the sex drive) so my headcanon is you'd need a different type of defence against that (say, controlling your lust!).

None of us knows for sure what the limits of occlumency are, not just because of JKR being deliberately vague, but also because what she does tell us is through Harry's filter, and Snape's very unsuccessful lessons. I do get tired of people using it as if it was this super power granting immunity to weaknesses that affect literally everybody else with a mind.
