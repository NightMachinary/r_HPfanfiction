Veritaserum thing is a retcon, so considering it canon or not is up to preference, really. If you do, you are directly contradicting what was said in the books, if you don't, you are contradicting what Rowling came up with after the books were all released in a futile attempt to close off some of the many plot holes.

In my opinon, Occlumency could be used to defend against them on a superficial level, pushing the bad memories Dementors are drudging up away from the forefront of your mind. But the Dementor's Kiss implies that Dementors target the soul, not the mind. So, like, it could help you focus on casting a Patronus in the middle of a group of Dementors by not focusing on the bad memories, but you'd still feel the effects. This is my headcanon, at least.
