My headcanon is that dementors leech the happiness from happy memories but not the love from loving ones.Eventually the happy memories are drained of the happiness and therefore it gives incentive to go out and make more.Occlumency allows you to hold a happy or loving memory around them to form a patronus. I also think thats why Harry is so resistant later on and can form a patronus so easily as the memory he uses (his mums death) is full of love but no happiness.
