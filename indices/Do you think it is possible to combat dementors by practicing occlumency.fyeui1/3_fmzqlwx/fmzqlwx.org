I think no, or at least very little, since dementors seem to interact with the soul, and occlumency with the mind, and those seem to be quite separate things. I have no idea what to think about the veela part, I suppose they effect the mind since they make people behave differently? So if that is true I think occlumency working with them would make sense, but they might be effecting hormone production or something, in which case I'd be going with no.
