I think it would work in the short term but not long-term.

Someone who was at Hogwarts during the 1993/4 year might have been able to use Occlumency to stave off the bad memories while walking past Dementors or even having to deal with them while orchestrating a search.

However someone imprisoned in Azkaban would find their Occlumency quickly failing them due to the constant strain of it as well as the physical stressors - poor food and little of it, poor sleep, cold etc - and once your bad memories swamped you once, getting back to a state of emotionlessness would be very hard. Within anywhere from a week to a month they'd be in the same boat as everyone else.
