It's a *retcon*.

Rowling realized that Veritaserum would introduce plot holes into a lot of her stories so she made the statement that Occlumency can circumvent the potion. However, that also introduces plot holes because I don't believe for an instant that Crouch Jr wouldn't be skilled in Occlumency, since he had to impersonate Moody.

  “you don't need me --- you could use Legilimency ... or Veritaserum. ...”

  “Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be ex­pecting both,” said Dumbledore. “He is much more accomplished at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be aston­ished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection.

This is from the /Half Blood Prince/. I take this statement as meaning Occlumency being a defence against Legilimency and Veritaserum having an antidote.
