I don't think Occlumency is going to help you at all against a Dementor's Kiss. However, I do believe that it could protect you from the general aura of despair, allowing you to cloak yourself from them somewhat, meaning there's a much smaller chance of you getting their attention in first place.

This also explains why Harry was both very susceptible to Dementors, and why he was also hopeless at Occlumency -- he is very open emotionally (making him useless at Occlumency) and have a lot of bad memories, which combined makes him very susceptible to them.
