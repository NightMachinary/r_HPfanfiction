I think occlumency is built upon control of one's emotions - Snape often enough snaps at Harry about controlling his anger, and the way I read it (though it's been a while) is that controlling and projecting the right emotion is important to fooling legilimency.

That's why I mentioned that it matters on the take of occlumency that the writer takes - because your argument as to how well it could handle magic is perfectly valid, but I don't think that it's the only valid conclusion from canon - nor from a more fleshed out magic system.

For instance, I would think that a cheering charm would make occlumency /harder/ to use, but not impossible. That's a magical effect on one's emotions, just like dementors - though presumably weaker. Do you think emotion/emotional state altering spells like that would be able to help break through occlumency defenses, or would they just make it harder to maintain? I fall in the latter category personally.
