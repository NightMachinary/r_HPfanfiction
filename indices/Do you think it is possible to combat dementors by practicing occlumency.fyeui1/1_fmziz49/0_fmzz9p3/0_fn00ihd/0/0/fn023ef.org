Thats my point, controlling your own emotion is a requirement to use occlumency, not a result of it, meaning in the end any emotional control you have would be of the non magical kind, so not overly useful against a magical attack. It would be Occlumency itself which protects the user against foreign influences, not the control over the emotion.
