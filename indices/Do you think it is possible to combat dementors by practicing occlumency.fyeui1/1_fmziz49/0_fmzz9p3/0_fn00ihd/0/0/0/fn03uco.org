IDK - I think occlumency and practicing does affect one's controls over emotions, even over the magically induced ones. Again, that's my interpretation of it, and I can tell yours disagrees - which is perfectly fine in this case! It's written vaguely enough that both are valid enough IMO, particularly for fanfic purposes.
