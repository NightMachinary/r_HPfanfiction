Good point - though I think it does matter on the interpretation of occlumaency that we take. If occlumancy is capable of controlling ones emotions, I could see the argument that it could be used to 'hold in' one's happy emotions, becoming more 'dead' to the dementors.

After all, Snape /does/ say that one should empty themselves of emotions for occlumency, and that should include happy emotions. It also involves a lot of controlling your own emotions - again including happy ones.

That being said, I would expect even a more generous fandom interpretation of the powers of occlumency to have this particular usage of it be both very advanced and very difficult - dementors seem /very/ powerful at drawing forth those happy memories and emotions, and the occlumens would probably heavily struggle at keeping a grip on themselves, particularly over long periods of time. It'd also seem to be more temporary - unlike the patronus, it can't drive the dementors away, so it's more just delaying the inevitable.
