I dont think it wold work against dementors.

The dementors don't really seem like they trying to affect the minds of their victims, but rather that the effect it has on it, is merely a by product of them feeding on the happy emotions.

But I do think it would work against a veela's charm, since that seems be something that directly tries to alter the mind of the victims, and the way Snape described occlumency implies that it would defend against this.
