how close to cannon are you looking? For some things completely off the wall try:

The Darkness Within: The Rewrite by Kurinoone

Growing Up Kneazle by Manatocfox

Growing Up Black by Elvendork

Harry Potter and the Wastelands of time and its sequal

Harry Potter and the Heartlands of time by joe6991

Building Bridges by Melethril

Prince of the Dark Kingdom by Mizuni-sama

I would have made the titles into links, but I am still pretty new at reddit and haven't really had the chance to look up how to do that.
