I am guessing H/Hr is Harmony because if you did the same as Romione with Harry, it becomes Harmione (which looks like you just misspelled Hermione) or Hamione (which is basically the same/similiar misspelling of Hermione). Harmony is different enough to be distinct in what you are talking about.

Plus, it wouldn't be Romany, but rather Romony. Which just looks wrong. Then again, I dislike the idea of Ron and Hermione together, so all names for that seem wrong to me. Lol
