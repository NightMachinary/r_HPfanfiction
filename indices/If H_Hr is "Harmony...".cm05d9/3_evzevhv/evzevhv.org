I like to think that Harmony refers to how the pairing, being the classic "main guy gets main girl" clich√©, is harmonious in it's /tropeness/---Or conversely, how JKR disrupted the perceived harmony of people who shipped H/Hr by pairing Hermione with Ron, and how fanfiction restores it. In all likelyhood I'm looking way too deep into it and it's only a little word play on "Harmione", and if that's the case then I don't think "Romany" would be justified, since it's not really a word play and more of a contrivance.

Can you believe I'm spending my sunday afternoon analyzing shipping names of a fantasy fandom. lord where did all go so wrong
