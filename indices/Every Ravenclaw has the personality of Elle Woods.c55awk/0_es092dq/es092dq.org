After much petitioning and blatant use of colour-changing charms whenever a teacher tried to enforce the traditional house colour scheme finally Ravenclaw's house colour has been officially changed to Hot Pink. For applications where a complementing shade is required you may chose between Light Hot Pink, Deep Pink, Ultra Pink and Shocking Pink.
