Ah, if you haven't heard of ashwinder prior to this, check it out for sure. Also check out archiveofourown.org - I highly recommend:

Cantata for Three Voices in G Major (by Wirefish1) - WIP

Also, not Snamione but probably one of the most beautiful (short) works I've read:

'Every Saint is an Accident' by teddyradiator

Also on ashwinder, and archive of our own, anything by lariope, melusin, anoesis, tychesong etc etc.

Sorry, I don't read much fanfiction nowadays, but those authors really are fantastic. And there are a billion others that I adored that I'm omitting because of time ... check out ashwinder and archive of our own!
