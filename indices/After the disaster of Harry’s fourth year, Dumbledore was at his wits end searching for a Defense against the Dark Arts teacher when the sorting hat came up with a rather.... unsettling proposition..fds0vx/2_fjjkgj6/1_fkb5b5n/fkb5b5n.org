They're echoes, like paintings. Think of a person as a shape, their conscious mind and apparent personality being the outer shell. When a ghost is created, the soul passes on, but leaves behind an imprint of that outer shell, but only that. Their existence is like negative numbers in mathematics - they have a form of negative life, or undeath. Life despite being dead. However, because they're only an image of the surface of a person, and a person's 'real shape' would be defined by everything that sits deeper than the surface, they're imperfect echoes of the person they once were.
