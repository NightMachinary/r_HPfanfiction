"Hello everybody..." came the voice of the new DADA teacher.

It was oddly familiar and every single student could somewhat recognise it. The name was just at the tip of their tongue...

"I know you!" A boy from Slytherin suddenly exclaimed. "Your Barty Crouch Jr. Didn't you die in Azkaban ages ago?"

"My body is Barty Crouch Jr." the familiar voice corrected. "But I am the Sorting Hat. Now anyway-"

"How are you even in the body?" shouted a Ravenclaw. "Did you even enter the body in a ghost way? What happens to your Hat then?"

"Obviously I can occupy a body, I am doing it just now. And as for your second question, I.. do not know." 'Barty Crouch Jr' admitted.

"Then how can-"

"Anyway," started the Hat." around fifty years ago, Defence Against the Dark Arts was the best class ever! Teachers there used to actually teach for more than a year-"

"-You can't keep on ignoring my question-" the Ravenclaw interrupted

"-Now I want all of you to sit next to a person of another house. Merlin children! Don't look at me like that! To think you all behave worst than Godric and Salazar when they are drunk, and that's saying something... Anyway, lets start with some basic shield charms. Why don't you tell me the incantation, Mr Anderson, since you were all too eager to question how I acquired this body."
