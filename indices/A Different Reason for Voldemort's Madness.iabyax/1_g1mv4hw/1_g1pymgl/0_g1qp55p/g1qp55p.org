Well perhaps if Tom Riddle raised him then he might be different but then again the psychopathic tendencies present within Salazar Slytherin's descendants would have manifested at some point if not combine it with his fear of death, his desire to be detached from his humanity leading him to having no relationships of any healthy kind. Mostly relationships with Voldemort were parasitic of a kind...also combine that with his unusual circumstances surrounding his birth then yeah he was evil incarnate... I mean imagine a guy who has gone their entire life without getting laid... he's as rotten as it gets..
