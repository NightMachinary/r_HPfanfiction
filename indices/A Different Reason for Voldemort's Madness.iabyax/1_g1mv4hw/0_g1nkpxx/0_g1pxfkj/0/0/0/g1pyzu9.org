yes but plenty of people do grow from experinces messed up

also tom grew up in an orphanage where might makes right so he used his magical abilities to be at the top of the food chain and then he went to hogwarts and got sorted into slytherin as someone who would have belived to have been a muggle born so once again he had to showcase his might.

everyone reacts differently from trauma and abusive childhoods while toms birth is tragic I would wager the abusive orphanage shaped his mindset and then being throw into slytherin reinforced it
