I don't see that explanation appear that often if fics, but I always thought Voldemort never "truly" changed. He always was that caricaturesque villain we see in canon, but was forced to wear a mask at school in order to not lose his follower, or be sent to Azkaban.

Once he became a Dark Lord, charm and diplomacy became useless to his plans, so he just discarded them (though I always liked the way he interacted with his followers, as if he was putting a show for them).
