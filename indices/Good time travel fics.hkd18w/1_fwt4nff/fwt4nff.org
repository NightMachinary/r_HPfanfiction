If you are looking for fics that feature time travelers changing things fast and effectively, check these out:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): 20 years old Hermione goes back to her 2 years old self, tells everything to Dumbledore the next day, who then takes things from there. It's my poster fic for how Peggy Sue time travels should be done.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry is thrown back to 1975 and has to team up with Bellatrix. This fic is interesting in that Harry possesses only *incomplete* information. He partly improved things before suffering another magic accident. This new Bellatrix is a delight to read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8669569/1/][Don't Waste It]], linkffn(8669569): Perhaps the only Wormtail time travel. He defeats Voldemort in a way true to his character, but very efficiently.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/][Ginny's Return]], linkffn(4740107): Perhaps the only completed Ginny time travel. This fic assumes manipulative!Dumbledore so she has to do things herself. It takes a little longer than "A Little Child", but she completes primary mission still very efficiently and painlessly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717): A unique Hermione time travel narrated from James Potter's POV, and she's not paired with anyone.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059): Very powerful postwar Harry gets thrown back to his 11 years old self, and promptly neutralizes Voldemort even before arriving at Hogwarts. But as the summary says, he will kill them all over again, and without getting other kids involved. This fic is more about him fitting into this new reality.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan travel back 25 years to their 8 years selves, kill most of the bad guys before even returning to Hogwarts. But they couldn't quite get Snape and Karkaroff...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/][Spectrum]], linkffn(9561455): Perhaps the only fic in which a time traveling Hermione kills Tom Riddle in his orphanage, instead of raising or shagging him.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4487319/1/][The Greatest Minister of Magic]], linkffn(4487319): Cornelius Fudge gets another chance. Very in character.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4061219/1/][The Time Meddlers]], linkffn(4061219): This fic is interesting in that they create a new villain after dispatching Voldemort relatively quickly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/][We are the Golden Trio!]], linkffn(7405516): Powerful Trio Peggy Sue time travel. They solves the Voldemort problem by Halloween 1991, adding to drama is a 5 days old Rose.
