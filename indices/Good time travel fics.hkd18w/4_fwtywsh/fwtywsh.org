Aww, no one is mentioning Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past? It's not on FFN anymore, and hasn't been completed (nor abandoned!), but it does a really good job of balancing foreknowledge with the butterfly effect, and it avoids having an overpowered Harry by focusing on his friends and how he tries to build them up and prepare them. The most complete version is the PDF/ebook at [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1]]
