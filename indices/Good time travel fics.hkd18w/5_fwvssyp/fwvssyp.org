Willing time travel, or accident? Does universe hopping count? I'll assume it does.

*That Universe Over There* - linkao3(23702959)\\
Harry touched something in the DoM he wasn't supposed to and finds himself on top of a certain school. He notices a little girl there with him. Yoink. Spoilers: That girl is that universe's analogue of him.

Harry is the MoD, is forced to take up the Peverell Lordship, has a vault filled with money, and the Goblins /want/ to help him. But does he use this? Hell no, he's anti-social, and the Goblins grin all the time which frankly scares him.

Ivy (Girl Harry) is an experience of itself. She's like Fred and George, the Marauders, Hagrid, Charlie, Bill, and Hufflepuff rendered down into one person. And dosed with cocaine. She turns Hogwarts on its head. And may or may not have a Hufflepuff Army.

*Double Back* - linkao3(19267840)\\
After an accident, Harry wakes up in the past. After about a week of moping around, he decides to change things and apparates to Privet Drive and punches Vernon in the face. Yoink. Also, he parades around as James Potter.

There's Polygamy, but that's more of the political and pureblood side of things. One is for love, and the other is for politics and line continuation.
