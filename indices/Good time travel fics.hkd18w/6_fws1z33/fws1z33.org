Kinda Roundabout Destiny by MaryRoyale but it's more like AU where Hermione is James Potters sister... but like it makes sense. Also gosh I've been reading so many Hermione-goes-back-in-time fanfics that I get them all mixed up, but I'm pretty darn sure I'm thinking of The Last Marauder by Resa Aureus. Dumbledore charges Hermione to go back in time and break Peter from the group and also fix some other stuff. (I just remember absolutely falling in love with it)
