In my fic, linkffn(Driving Miss Weasley), I simply say that shield charms don't work with guns. It's not a case of whether or not it's logical (because nothing is logical in the HP universe), it's more a matter of plot reasons and upping the excitement factor. I think that's the most important thing to consider. We know absolutely nothing about the way shield charms work, so you can pretty much do whatever you want with them.
