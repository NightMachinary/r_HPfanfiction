Guns are a tool, and to effectively use them you need training. Not as much as to effectively use magic, but you can't just pick up a gun and be good with it. Which means that if you want to use guns in a war involving wizards, you need a good reason to make the time spent getting proficient with guns worth it.

Guns do offer several advantages over wands. Much longer range (especially for longarms), much better rate of fire even with semi-automatics, and much better precision (and no, in canon, spells do not auto-aim - even Voldemort misses Harry in his fight in the graveyard). But all of those advantages are situational. And people will adapt. You can't count on sniping working well forever. Or machine gunning clumped up enemies from outside their range.
