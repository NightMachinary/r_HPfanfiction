Did it really /contradict/ it? Because as far as I remember it wasn't that it didn't work against things but rather it never got used by anyone to protect themselves, and with Madame Rowling's track record with certain things I don't feel that this can be taken as proof that it wouldn't ever work.

That said, this does still speak a lot about any kind of “average wizard versus average muggle” scenario, sure, because if the wizards don't remember their protections then that's not very effective anyway.
