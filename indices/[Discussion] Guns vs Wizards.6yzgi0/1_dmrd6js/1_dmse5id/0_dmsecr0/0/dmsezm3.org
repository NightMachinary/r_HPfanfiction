I can agree with that. That said, the point of my reply was not to state that it was “about Muggles vs Wizards” (the “muggle” in the quoted part of what I wrote was supposed to represent a person with a gun), but rather to say that while I do agree that the charms aren't shown to be effective in the books, they aren't shown to be ineffective either because we haven't seen them being cast at all and thus they may very well simply not be there which would mean that canon does not contradict the idea, at least not as far as we know.

That said, I will expand that unless the caster wore many layers of clothes all enchanted with those charms, it would probably still hurt like heck because that's a lot of energy for a small point of impact and heck knows if a single cushioning charm stop that from bruising, so yes, I do doubt that it would be as effective for an average wizard as OP makes it out to be.
