I'm not disagreeing as such but do you think there could be a case for the arrows used by the centaurs, the claws of a werewolf and those other things you mentioned having their own magical element? As in it might be possible to potentially create a armour or some defensive item against the physical but years of battling other magical threats has rendered it all obsolete?
