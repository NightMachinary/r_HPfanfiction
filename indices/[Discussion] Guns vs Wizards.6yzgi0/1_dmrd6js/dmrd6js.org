  it's not entirely unreasonable for pretty much all wizarding clothing is completely bulletproof. Unbreakable cloth means you only have to deal with the force of the (non-magical) impact as there will be no penetration

Plenty of Canon evidence contradicted this form of 'Wizard Wank':

In the Final Battle, many Death Eaters were shot down by Centaurs using bows and arrows and cut down by House-Elves using kitchen knives.

Throughout Harry's time at Hogwarts, students beat each other all the time, with plenty of injuries to boot.

And then Wizards were scared of Acromantulas, Giants, Trolls, and Werewolves, whose attacks were all physical based.

Even if these charms offered some protections against non-magical damage, they could be easily worn down and overwhelmed by constant assaults or attacks much stronger than, let's say, rain drops.
