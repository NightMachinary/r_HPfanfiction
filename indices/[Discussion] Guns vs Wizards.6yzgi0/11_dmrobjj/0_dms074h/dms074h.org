  So, disregarding my previous comments on how a muggle/wizard war would go down, I think...wizards would barely win out over guns, if only because wizards can buy Shield Hats, very comfortable day-to-day wear that also functions as armor.

If it came to actual fighting, perhaps. I think a war between Muggles and Wizards would be won long before that by infiltration and mind control.
