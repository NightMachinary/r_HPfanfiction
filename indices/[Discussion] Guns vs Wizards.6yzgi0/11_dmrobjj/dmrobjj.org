Well, what can a wizard do against a gun-wielding assailant?

Use a shield charm, transfigure a solid object or levitate one to use as cover, Apparate out of the line of fire, use Disillusionment or an invisibility cloak to avoid being targeted, use a human-revealing spell to locate the shooter then down them with a curse...

The thing is, muggles have equivalents of almost all of those, except perhaps Apparation; wear armor, take cover or use a shield, wear camouflage, use thermal-vision goggles...

Now, admittedly, a regular muggle is not going to have all (or any) of those, whereas a regular wizard, assuming a functioning DADA class at Hogwarts, will be able to summon up their defences with their multipurpose wand they always have with them. Sort of the equivalent of having a 'Force Field' app on your smartphone.

Still, the point I'm trying to make is, since muggles have their own, real-life equivalents of many wizarding defences, the things that can foil those muggle defences should also be effective against wizarding defences; in a nutshell, a handgun might not work, but a rocket-propelled grenade will.

And, while most all wizards have wands, it's a mistake to assume that all of them are perfectly combat-competent; it's pointed out in Half Blood Prince by Fred & George that most wizards in the Ministry can't actually do a good shield charm, instead getting their hats and robes enchanted with it.

So you have wizarding civilians who aren't hot at combat, and muggle civilians who aren't hot at combat, and Aurors and Hit Wizards who /are/ hot at combat, and muggle S.W.A.T. and military who are hot at combat.

So, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6qguv8/lf_fanfic_where_the_pure_blood_discover_the/dkyne6t/?context=3][disregarding my previous comments on how a muggle/wizard war would go down]], I think...wizards would /barely/ win out over guns, if only because wizards can buy Shield Hats, very comfortable day-to-day wear that also functions as armor.
