In the duel between McGonagall and Snape at the end of Book 7, McGonagall shoots daggers at Snape and he has to block them with a suit of armour, so I guess that's a point towards physical projectiles. Also, if cushioning charms could stop bullets, they'd probably be able to stop swords or claws or whatever, which they don't seem to be able to do. I suppose guns might backfire around magic because of too many moving parts or something? In the third book, a description of a gun in the Daily Prophet is "A kind of metal wand muggles use to kill each other". This seems to imply that the general Wizarding population doesn't know what guns are, but they don't seem all that worried about them, so who knows?
