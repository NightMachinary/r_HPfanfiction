If they had their wands. Without Wands, wizards were weaker than the average Muggle.

A sniper shooting from 100+ yards out will generally get the unsuspecting wizard.

No Wizard was running with a disillusionment charm around all day.

Shield charm was useless if they were shot in the back or sniped outside their range of perception.

Guns in hands of Wizards however would be brutally effective.

Guns could be further enhanced magically, with features such as limitless/vastly expanded magazines, cooled barrels, and reduced recoils.

Wizards maximizing and optimizing both magic and technology would eventually crush those who relied solely on magic.

Wizards who knew how to leverage Muggle manpower for their benefits would eventually crush those who relied solely on their fellow Wizards.

The next Dark Lord would heavily involve Muggles to do his/her bidding.
