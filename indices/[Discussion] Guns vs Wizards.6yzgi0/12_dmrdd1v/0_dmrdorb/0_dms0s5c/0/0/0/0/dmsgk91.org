Isn't it what I said?

In this case, it's actually very powerful. How can you make war to an enemy whose premises you can't find?\\
With that, the kind of protective charms we see in Fantastic Beasts, the mobility options, and the mind reading/control Wizards have got at their disposal, I don't see how a Muggle force could prevail.

Now if the Muggles have some wizards siding with them, it's another matter entirely.
