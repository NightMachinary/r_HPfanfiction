  Wizards have things like unplottable locations, apparition..

Stealth was Wizards' best defense. Any target that could be identified could be destroyed. It's actually the same in Muggle warfare. During wars, locations of those in chain of command were actually unknown. I'm pretty sure the US would very much want to kill Al-Baghdadi and Kim of North Korea at moment, but they are in hiding.

Apparation would not be too effective against Wizards with guns. I expect anti-apparation charms to be standard combat and security procedures. Furthermore, apparations would be very risky because destinations that still allowed apparations could be designated kill zones.

  It's actually quite possible that for every bit of Muggle technology, you have a better magical option. Or that one can rapidly be devised.

Which required research, human resources, time, and outcome was uncertain, whereas Muggle solutions already existed and could be thrown into combat immediately.

  Isn't it what Grindelwald did?

Nazis almost won. If Grindelwald had picked the stronger Muggle side, he would have won. Next time, the Dark Lord/Lady would pick those strongest Muggle governments to go after his/her Magical enemies.
