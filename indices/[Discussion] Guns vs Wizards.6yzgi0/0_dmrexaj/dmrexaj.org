This is one of those topics that everyone gets all up in arms about, pun intended. Honestly, the only answer I can come up with is that it doesn't matter if one is stronger than the other. If you are the writer of that story, if you are trying to write a compelling and engaging story, then it is your obligation to find ways to fix that power imbalance between the the two kinds of weapons. If you believe guns are better than magic, then you have to write situations in which the effectiveness of guns are reduced, in order to allow magic to fight back. If you believe magic is better, you must create conditions in which gun users are able to actually make their weapons effective. Make excuses for how magic is unable to combine two spells, make guns jam, turn bullets into fish. The list goes on.

Buff guns and nerf magic, do the opposite, or buff or nerf both of them. It doesn't matter, just make it so it's not a curbstomp on one side.
