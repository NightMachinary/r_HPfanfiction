Hm...probably depends on one factor and one factor alone:

The element of surprise - if the person with the gun has that then the wizard is probably dead, but if not? Yeah, then the gun-wielder is probably the one incapacitated or dead (depending on the mood of the wizard and if they like killing or not...Voldemort and the DEs would probably splatter muggles with guns all over the place, while the order would probably stun then and modify their memories)

ps: Only two things could change that: Firing many guns while making it impossible to apparate (forcing a wizard's shield down with overwhelming force!) or modifying the gun (runes on the gun and/or the bullets for example) with magic
