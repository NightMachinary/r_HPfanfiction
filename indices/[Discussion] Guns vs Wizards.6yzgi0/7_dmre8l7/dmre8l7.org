Honestly I dont care what should win based on canon and logic derived from it. I'm reading fantasy. I dont want to read about Harrys new M14 that spays down his enemys in a red blur. I want to read about Harrys prodiguous control over fire magics that he earned through trials he survived and beat, his understanding of magic growing with the readers.
