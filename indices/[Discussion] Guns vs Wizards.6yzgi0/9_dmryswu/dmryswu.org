My head canon on this that I will use if I ever get around to writing a fic is that there is a spell that every 1st year learns that is designed to stop bullets. When the first year demonstrates that they know the spell they are given an enchanted amulet which provides them with that protection at all times. The spell however would not work for the Centaurs arrows because Centaurs are magical thus the arrows bypass the protection.
