I think you should wait at least until you finish the second book before you make a conclusion.

IMO you won't easily find a story this deep. I can understand certain people not liking Alexandra's personality(I actually like it, but I see enough who don't), but I also believe this series really does get better as it goes on. It would be a waste not to read it because of a premature judgement about the main character.

I also get the impression a lot of people give up on it too early, before it gets interesting enough that they don't mind what they did initially anymore. It's a very very rich and deep story and you'd be missing out if you didn't hold out a little longer. :)

I would answer your question more directly, except I don't see her as having an impulse control. What you and others call that, I understand as instinct, and in many cases, a lack of other options. I think Alexandra is more tragic than bad in any way. It is easy to not see that because of her hard, uncompromising attitude.

Also, if I made more excuses for her, which you no doubt will understand yourself soon enough, I would spoiler everything for you. There are good, deep-seated reasons for why she is like she is, and that's why I love her. Because it's genuine and thought-out, not merely something "edgy" the author imposed on one of its characters.

Let me know if you've kept with it, I'll be curious to know. I would love for there to be more of a community around AQ. It's so underestimated, IMO.
