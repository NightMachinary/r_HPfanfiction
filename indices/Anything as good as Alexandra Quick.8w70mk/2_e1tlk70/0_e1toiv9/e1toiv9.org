Thank you. Think already have, long time ago, but not all of them, and can't remember them anymore.

I don't think anything is quite like AQ then. Anyone, feel free to disagree with me, ofc.

It's really too bad the author can't monetize on his novels. They deserve as much recognition as Rowling's, IMO. I would love to see [[/spoiler][Quick and her brother journeying through the lands below, for instance. The whole second book in general, would make for a great movie, don't you think? :)]]
