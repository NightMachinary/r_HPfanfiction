I never implied anywhere that Inverarity should or anywhere said would try to monetize AQ. I have merely expressed my opinion on the series from a literary standpoint. I don't know how you got the former from the latter.

Thank you for the HP recommendations. But once again, like I said previously, they are, in order, Harry, Harry, Harry, Hogwarts, Harry and Harry.

There is 0 mention of Harry Potter in Alexandra Quick. That is its greatness. That it did that and wasn't a massive failure. It is riveting and completely original from the character standpoint and partially from the cultural one(less so from the world-building pov, but there too).

I will take your advice and post a better ask next time, perhaps, though that wasn't necessarily the only thing I was looking for, and as such am plenty pleased with all your recommendations to date. I will check them out.

I am sorry that "looking for a set of novels/series that shares Rowling's magical universe but not necessarily its characters and is as good from a writing standpoint as AQ" wasn't clear enough.
