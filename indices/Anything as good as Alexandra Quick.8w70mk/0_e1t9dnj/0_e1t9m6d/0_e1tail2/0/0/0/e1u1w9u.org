It's appreciated.

I don't agree with your dismissal of Inverarity's masterpiece as mere fan-fiction. I have not read much HP fan fic, but I have read enough to be able to appreciate AQ for what it is.

AQ is barely AU. All it shares with HP is its history(only implied by the mention of Voldemort). On a more relevant note, the thing it takes from Rowling's world is its magic and the rules that accompany it.

And now we come, perhaps, to part of what I am seeking, and of which I am sincerely skeptical is to be further found out there. An original series that doesn't describe the lives of any of the characters mentioned in the original seven Harry Potter novels, but new ones, in a new setting, that rival the original in their deep and rich world-building. Inverarity hasn't merely taken what Rowling has so conveniently provided and played with ideas about what would some characters from her world do, as so many other authors I notice have done, but has added to her world of magic in their own unique ways.

But I admit I am ignorant of much of what comprises the fan literature of HP. I am simply not as comfortable classifying AQ as mere fan-fic. I feel it deserves a unique consideration among others, until such as I've seen something akin to it.

It is very much a novel in my opinion. With a proper publishing agency, Inverarity's AQ series would perhaps be even greater than Rowling's. Such is the original depth of their world - we cannot simply dismiss it by putting it next to something like the Albus Potter series(however good that series may be on its own).

I would very much like to read HP fan fic, in the meaning of relating the stories of its British characters mentioned in the books(whether past, present or future), if there are any such that are original enough to rival Rowling's creation at least in scope and ambition if not necessarily in practice. But I am far more interested in original takes on the main element of the story with which Rowling has gifted willing writers of all stripes. Her type of magic. The rules by which it abides. Its magical creatures, items and its wizarding history and culture. That is what fascinates me, not the fate of Ginny/Hermione/Ron and company...

If you honestly hold such a low opinion of AQ, I can only think one of two things. You haven't read them or payed attention to the incredible depth and originality added on top of Rowling's canonical descriptions of the world of magic. Or you know there are many others which do the same just as well, in which case I would rejoice and ask you to name the best, assumming you haven't just done that.

I am not looking for flavor fan fic. This coupling or that one. This historical event or that one. I am looking for quality. Something I didn't think I would have to describe, but would be understood intrinsically by comparison with the series mentioned in the OP.
