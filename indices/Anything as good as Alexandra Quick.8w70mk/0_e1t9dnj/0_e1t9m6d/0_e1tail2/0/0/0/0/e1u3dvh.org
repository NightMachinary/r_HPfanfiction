To be honest, *that right there is dangerous territory regarding publishing rights*. There is a reason most authors put a disclaimer in their chapters stating that they do not own the material and all rights belong to JK Rowling.

Inaverity could get in serious trouble if she tried something like that, and when people have done similar things like Patreon for chapters, it has never gone well. Besides which, many writers have actually gotten started in fanfiction (ex. joe6961, White Squirrel I think). Fanfiction is a polishing ground for that.

BUT I can offer you new explorations of the magic and world of HP that should be interesting, and I would heartily recommend looking through them for this:

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) has Harry as a twin brother to the Boy Who Lived. However, he decides to go to Durmstrang instead. There, he meets new characters (some good OCs too) and slowly begins to explore all that magic has to offer. Highly recommend this one.
- linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) is an AU started back before OotP came out, and is one of the /best/ examples of a Hero's Journey style fics I can think of. Harry is sent on a quest away from Hogwarts, then spends the rest of the story trying to return to Hogwarts. Everything past Goblet of Fire is scraped, and many of the OCs are the best in the fandom (ex. Danny Oakes, Dahlia, Andross Gallowbraid, Magnus Aragon, Lyle).
- Forging the Sword has a much more in depth exploration of magic and the systems of teaching Hogwarts.
- linkffn(The Mind Arts) is one of the best fics currently being produced. Harry has a talent for mind magic (Legilimency) in particular, and it focuses on his exploration of magic and his time learning from Dumbledore.
- For developing the world of Harry Potter, my personal favorite is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin), which has more world-building and exploration of the Harry Potter universe than any fic I have read.

It may be easier though to post another request (or several different ones) asking for specifics like: exploration of magic, world-building, different schools from Hogwarts, etc. That way you can narrow things down.
