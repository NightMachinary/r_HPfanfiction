Read Heart of the Lion, its in the Founder's Era so its a thousand years before Harry was born.

Also, there are a few fics out there that I cannot recall at this time that focus on the period during Grindelwald's War (mostly continental Europe), but the quality of those fics will vary much more. Still interesting stories though.

Also, the fic linkffn(The Ollivanders) revolves around an OC son of Ollivander before Harry was even born, and dives a lot into Wand Lore and the like.
