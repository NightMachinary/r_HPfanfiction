I would also add, as an after-thought:

Rowling did not invent the idea of wands, of spells, or of Wizards.

If I, say, or anyone else, intended to write a series of novels involving all of those things, all I would have to change is perhaps the names of the spells, and some other such arbitrary things, the list wouldn't be all that long. I don't know how far you'd have to go to not be liable to prosecution, but I don't imagine all that far indeed. So perhaps you overestimate the power Rowling has over this type of fantasy. Just because no one has emerged to write something as popular contained within a very similar world, does not mean one can't. And I do believe we will see much of this type of literature in the future, as soon as someone does it first.
