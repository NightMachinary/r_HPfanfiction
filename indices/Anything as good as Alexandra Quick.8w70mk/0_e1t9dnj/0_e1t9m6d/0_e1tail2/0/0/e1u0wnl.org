I am going to give you an honest opinion here. Please do not take this the wrong way, but it sounds like you do not have a large amount of experience with the wider HP fanfiction community (not an insult, merely how it sounds from here). These are not novels, these are fanfiction, regardless of length and novel-quality writing in many cases.

While many there are many cases of the things you are asking for, I think it would help to gain some knowledge of the type of material available in the fandom, so you can narrow down what you are interested in.

1. I would recommend starting at the low-end, with material closer to canon. Possibly some post-war fics, like the Albus Potter series for instance. Alexandra Quick is an AU, but it does not affect canon at all so its fine. Some alternate POV of canon will also work (ex. Ginny or Neville's perspective during Deathly Hallows linkffn(Not From Others)).
2. Then, start looking into more AU changes: what if X happened in canon instead of Y style fics. Some noteworthy examples include: Harry sorted into Slytherin in canon linkffn(On the Way to Greatness), Harry choosing to kill Ginny in the Chamber of Secrets linkffn(Forging the Sword), and what if Lucius Malfoy took over after Voldemort's defeat linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died)
3. After that, you should be able to look into more alternate universe (or AU) style fics. These are where there are significant changes to the world in canon. Some noteworthy examples include: Grindelwald defeated Dumbledore in 1945 linkffn(The Skitterleap), Neville was the Boy-Who-Lived linkffn(By the Divining Light), and what if Muggleborns were much rarer than in canon linkffn(Patron).
4. Once you have seen the major canon, you can begin to look into different genres and tropes that interest you: time-travel, comedy/crack, romance, adventure, dark, etc. Once you have an idea of what you want, you can more easily ask questions here about what you are looking to read or not read.

I hope this helps you. I took a bit of time to write this all out since I feel it would be more helpful than shooting names in the dark for you.
