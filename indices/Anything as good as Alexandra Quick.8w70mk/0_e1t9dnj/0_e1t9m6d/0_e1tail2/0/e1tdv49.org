Thank you so much. I will check out all of them.

Do you know of any HP fanfics that continue from OOTP without Sirius dying? I know that's a long shot, but just in case. I am really interested in something where Harry takes more of a central role in the fight against Voldemort, and where the war is described at greater length than Rowling did.

I think I have already read some of the Albus Potter series a long time ago if I'm not mistaken, though I don't think it was finished at the time perhaps. But I think I'll enjoy rereading it.

The LOTR one sounds weird, I have no idea how it would make sense, but I think I'll try it, same as the others.

Is there any archive of sorts where I can see many titles? How do I look for novels in the Potterverse(if I'm using the term correctly? Do I just browse the posts on this sub?
