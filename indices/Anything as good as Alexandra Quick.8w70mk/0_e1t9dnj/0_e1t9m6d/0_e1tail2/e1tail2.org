First, you have to understand that AQ is a respected series, but it is also a /divisive/ series. I would say its fifty-fifty on people who like or hate it, mostly because of Alexandra herself.

Now I can provide you with several series of fics, but the problem here is you still did not really offer much to clarify what you want. There are multiple series out there:

- The Albus Potter Series by NoahPhantom: starts with linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation). A seven-year set of fics where Albus goes through Hogwarts as a student. Possibly better than AQ, frankly, though the Lily Potter series seems dead now.
- Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger linkffn(Shadow of Angmar): Harry is MoD living in Middle Earth 1000 years before the LoR trilogy began.
- Prince of the Dark Kingdom linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): an AU where Voldemort won and remade Britain. Voldemort is possibly the most interesting incarnation ever in this fic, and it follows Harry through his time in Britain and at Hogwarts, up to the end of 6th year (word count its more than 4x the length of OOTP, and the pagan/celtic religious elements are rather detailed and a great part of the fic).
- Heart of a Lion linkffn(Heart of a Lion): a founders era fic with decent writing, the group meet up in this fic.

And a number of others. These are just some examples of fics with good/great writing and well-developed though still HP like world building (although SoA has a lot of Tolkeinverse mythos invovled).
