I was under the impression from the posts I had read in this sub that AQ was up there at the top in terms of popularity amongst HP fan fics.

I meant just what I said. I want something as well written as AQ, preferably a series. I'll leave it to the replier to determine that.

If I would discriminate, I would simply ask for something similarly detached from HP's world, and only sharing in the rules of the universe, the magic, and its history. I say that because I noticed the author excelled in their own "original" series, in a way they didn't with Hogwarts Houses Divided.

It seems too good to be true, if, as you say, there are plenty of other novel length books that share the quality of this one set in this Universe. Please name at least a few of your favorites, if it's not too much to ask.
