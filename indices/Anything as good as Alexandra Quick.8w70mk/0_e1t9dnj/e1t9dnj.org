You know, there is a subreddit ( [[/r/AlexandraQuick][r/AlexandraQuick]]) where you might get some more pertinent information. If you want good novel length fics, trust me when I say this fandom has plenty.

However, it would help to clarify more what you are looking for. There are literally /millions/ of Harry Potter fics (though 9/10 are immediately discardable), and anything to discriminate would be more likely to get responses /and/ to not waste your time with something you may not want anyway.

Just saying it would help.
