/Sigh. There's a reason why is called crossovers. You get concepts or characters from one place then apply it to another.

Iirc that's a Vertigo Darkness crossover. I think I read that. I'm not too sure though. Would suggest having a witchblade cameo or any of the major Vertigo characters *cough*Gaiman's Endless, Swamp-Thing, or Constantine*cough*
