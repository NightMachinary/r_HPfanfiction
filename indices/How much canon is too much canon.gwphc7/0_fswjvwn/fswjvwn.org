If your characters are just discussing what's going on, not actually witnessing it, that's fine. The problem, well, mine at least, with rehashing canon is when it's literally the same events copied almost verbatim from JKR, but usually worse.

If you MC isn't interacting with Harry much, is doing their own thing and hearing about the Trio's escapades through the grapevine then it shouldn't be boring.
