I suppose it depends on how much new material you are introducing. If your MC gets up to their own shenanigans, while the canon story remains unaffected, then I think it's fine. As a general rule when doing canon compliant stories, try to introduce subplots which are interesting yet ultimately unimportant to the canon storyline.
