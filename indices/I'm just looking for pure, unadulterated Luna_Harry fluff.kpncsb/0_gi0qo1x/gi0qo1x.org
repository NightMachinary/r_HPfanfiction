Professor McGonagall asked Harry if he could give Luna a few tips about quidditch announcing. The whole school was aware at this point that Luna had little technical knowledge of the game, but she was certainly a fan favourite so McGonagall opted to keep her, provided she brush up on her quidditch terminology.

Harry met Luna in the quidditch stands a week before the upcoming match between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw. He thought it might be a good idea to bring his broom and provide real examples of quidditch moves so Luna could practice spotting them while in the announcer's box.

Half an hour into the training session:

Luna (into microphone): “It appears Harry Potter is attempting a Ronky pank”

Harry: /calls across the pitch to Luna/ “Luna! It's called a Wronski feint!”

Luna: “oh yes, I know Harry, but how do you expect to trick the other team if I say it properly?”

Harry was glad Luna couldn't see him roll his eyes across the pitch.

Luna: “On second thought, as you're against Ravenclaw maybe I should warn them”

Harry: “Oi!” *jokingly throws a practice quaffle in Luna's direction
