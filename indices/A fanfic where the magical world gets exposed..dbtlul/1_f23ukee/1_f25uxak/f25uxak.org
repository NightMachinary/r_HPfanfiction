I hadn't read this because I worried it was going to go all Dark Knight Returns & Have minister Thatcher serving for life. It nicely averted that.

It has a couple of very nice arcs (Sirius is great), and I love the Hermione & co becoming animagus for their friends. And the Granger's being Republican was a nice touch.

It does have a few problems though. I cringed at the formally swearing 12 year olds into military service. Actually given how this fic tended to advert the steriotypes, I was surprised to see it played straight.

And the author has an annoying tendency to overuse "they didn't know it, but this would be remembered as". Over and over and over again.

And the timetable was a bit too compressed. There wasn't any reason to have so much stuff happen every year, the amount of events in the fic could have easily happened over twice the time frame...
