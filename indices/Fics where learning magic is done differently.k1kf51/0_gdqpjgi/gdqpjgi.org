Everything you said is something I try to incorporate into all my fics. IMO it's less about magic and more about having a well-rounded character. It's rare to have someone that's good at EVERYTHING. For example, one of my characters isn't the best duelist, but she is ace at runes/rituals, wards, and runes.

Anyway, your best bet would be to focus on fics with dark magic, specifically Harry learning dark magic. Those fics are the ones that take a fresh look at magic or change the system. It's probably the closest you'll get to what you're looking for. I can recommend a few if you want, but they probably don't focus on learning magic.
