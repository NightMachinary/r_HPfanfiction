  What if wizards can choose a different era to live in every hundred years?

That sounds like wizard wank to me, and is completely unsupported by canon materials. Wizards don't need to switch time era to get more advantages. They already have enough.

  Magic breaks all the laws of nature

Actually no, almost all magic feats described in the Books are possible under quantum mechanics/theories. Still, wizards are insanely powerful since they can tap those fundamental forces of the universe with their mere willpower. Muggles are still dabbling in electronic-magnetic forces, and they have no way controlling gravity, nuclear forces, and other quantum level effects.

I think there are very good reasons why so many fics bash wizards:

- HP series was written as children's literature and it's common to dumb down adults. Many people HATE dumb characters. Ministry, Dumbledore, and the Order were depicted as especially incompetent. This kind of characterizations gives up an impression that wizards are idiots.
- JKR actually described the magical world as a horrible dystopia, once readers got past the 'fantastic' facade of the magic. Many readers HATE this world.
