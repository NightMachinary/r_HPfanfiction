I think the issue is best illustrated by the thought experiment of what you would or could do IRL if you had the same powers as a competent HP wizard. You could easily become a billionaire at the very least. Likely you could take over every world government without anyone knowing about it, if you so wished.

That's *one* person.

Another useful comparison is to compare wizarding capabilities with sci-fi universes. Consider Star Trek: teleportation, shields, rearrangement of matter, "energy" weapons, cloaking... wizards have all of these, and moreover they can use them without relying on any industrial infrastructure or power source. On top of that wizards have all sorts of mental manipulation powers.

So saying contemporary Muggles can beat wizards is like saying they could beat the Federation from Star Trek.

The main thing Muggles have going for them is that there are lots of them. But I'm not sure if this is really all that relevant. It's not like there are going to be any pitched battles.

This is the point at which people usually bring up wizards fighting for the Muggle side. But that's not Muggles beating wizards, that's wizards beating wizards.
