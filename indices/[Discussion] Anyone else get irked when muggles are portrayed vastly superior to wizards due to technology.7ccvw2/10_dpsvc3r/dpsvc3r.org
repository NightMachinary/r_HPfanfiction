The wizards never manage to put a man on the moon, the muggles did. Can a wizard destroy a whole city with just one magic? The muggles sure can with just a flick of a button. I wouldn't say that muggles are superior with their technology but they are in no way they are inferior to wizards with the many achievements and evolution of technology they have.
