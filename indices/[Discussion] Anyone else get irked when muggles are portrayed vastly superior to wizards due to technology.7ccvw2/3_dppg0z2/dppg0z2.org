Totally agree. Besides I think that wizard have every benefit of muggle technology without the negative effect.

They can travel with broom, portkey, and apparition, which is much faster than a car and doesn't pollute. They can communicate at long distance with mirrors or floo talk, without having phones sending wave to their brain like mobile phone. They can heal everything that muggle science couldn't dream of, like growing a effing bone back.

They are much more example but those who already think that muggle are superior to wizard are... annoying (read stupid) enough and can't be convinced. Strangely enough they are the same person who are Hermione fanatics.
