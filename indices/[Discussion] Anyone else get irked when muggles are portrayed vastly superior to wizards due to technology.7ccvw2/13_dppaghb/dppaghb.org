In just about any kind of conflict, magic would win over technology. But muggle technology is superior in many ways, even if ultimately beaten by magic.

Floo communication is 3-D image + instant transfer of small items, like [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Toast][toast]]. But muggles have mobile, knee-friendly, instant communication to anywhere in the world.

Floo, portkeys, apparition and the Knight Bus is near-instant travel to just about anywhere (at least relatively short distance), or at least very fast travel. Muggle travel is comfortable.

Wizards have pensieves, muggles have movies.

Television and Moon travel is clich√©, but still fair points IMO. But the wizarding world might just be too small to support variety or large projects. They have at best a handful of radio channels, and sports and games seems very [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Magical_games][limited]]. They might not need more, but then, do muggles really /need/ Settlers of Catan?

I'd say muggles beat the wizards in imagination and innovation. There's not much in the wizarding world that isn't based on muggle technology. Are there any examples of non-muggle-based stuff?
