Yep. People are quick to assume wizards don't have some stuff because they can't when they very well simply might not need it.

Look at computers, for example, wizards don't seem to have them, but if you can make McGonagall's chess set or virtual personalities (such as the animated mirrors), you're probably able to make computers as well.
