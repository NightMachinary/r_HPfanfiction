The thing is that Floo communication predates mobile phones, social media, and the internet by several centuries. Brooms predates airplanes and other aerial transport by over a millennium at a bare minimum. Pensieves predates movies by over a millennium at the absolute bare minimum. And this isn't even getting into the various charms and Potions that can cure every single non-magical illness in existence. Health-wise, only magically inflicted damage (i.e. cruciatus-induced insanity) or diseases (i.e. Lycanthropy) would actually affect wizards. But stuff like broken bones and major blood loss can be with very little difficulty, and same would apply for all non-magical diseases (e.g. cancer, STDs, etc)

So stuff like flight, instant communication, and various media was done by wizards long, long before muggles got the idea. The only things that the wizarding world actually really borrowed from the muggle world was the Knight Bus and the Hogwarts Express, and even then the creation of both was influenced by the Statute of Secrecy more than any desperation for it.

What most who like muggle-wank stuff forget is that the wizarding world was far ahead of the muggle world when it came to social issues. Sexism, racism (based on skin color), and homophobia were all non-existent in the wizarding world. To put it into historical context: in the same era of America that the KKK would have been prevalent and when sexism was rife, Magical America had a female non-white president.

Socially speaking, wizards only care about whether someone is a fully-human wizard. Stuff like race and gender and sexuality mean nothing to wizards, not even to pure-blood supremacists. As per Word of God, even someone like Lucius Malfoy wouldn't care about that stuff. Not even Voldemort shows the prejudices that muggles display like racism or sexism, even though he grew up in the muggle world in the 1930s.

If a black wizard like Kingsley wanted to join the Death Eaters, Voldemort would let them so long as they aren't a muggle-born. Even then, Voldemort did try to recruit Lily, and Wormtail is heavily implied to be a muggle-born based on Word of God and Voldemort's treatment of Wormtail in-universe, so Voldemort would certainly allow a black muggleborn wizard into the Death Eater if they are useful enough. Yet neither the KKK nor the Nazis would actually let an non-white and/or Jewish "undesirable" into their group, let alone get a high-ranked position (e.g. being in the SS as a Nazi). Which shows how much more progressive Voldemort is when compared to groups that most compare to the Death Eaters.

*Besides, technology is NOT exclusive to muggles. Wizards can use technology AND use magic. Muggles can only use technology, meaning wizards can literally achieve everything that muggles could achieve and more.* Wizards, objectively speaking, completely outclass muggles in every single aspect. Wizards basically are a master race compared to muggles, since there is no downsides to being a wizard instead of a muggle. Wizards get access to anything a muggle could use, but also can use magic.
