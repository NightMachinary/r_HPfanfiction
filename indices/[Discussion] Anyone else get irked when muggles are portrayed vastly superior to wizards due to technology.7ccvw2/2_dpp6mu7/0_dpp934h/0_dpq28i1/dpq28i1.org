  see Kingsley Shacklebolt protecting the PM
#+end_quote

So send five Death Eaters instead of one, I guess. Honestly, if Kingsley's the only protection the Ministry sent, the Ministry either doesn't care or doesn't understand how to protect them.

I really don't think there's enough Aurors around to both police the wizarding population /and/ prevent the majority of Parliament from being placed under the Imperius.

Alternately, if the existing Muggle government /is/ well-protected by wizards, use the Imperius to stir up a revolution. Mind-control a suitable figurehead and elite, have them do their recruiting, ram them into the government until one snaps. If your fifth column wins, you've circumvented the Ministry for the most part.

  I'm not sure that Voldemort had any aims regarding the Muggle world beyond the occasional use of Muggles as sport

Wasn't he going for Muggle genocide or something? The wiki says the Death Eaters' goals include a global dictatorship under a magical regime. Either way, given canonical abilities of magic, Voldemort could genocide the Muggles first through puppets and front organizations cobbled together by mind control, and then even if he dies on the way to Nazi Wizardtopia the Muggles aren't coming back anytime soon.
