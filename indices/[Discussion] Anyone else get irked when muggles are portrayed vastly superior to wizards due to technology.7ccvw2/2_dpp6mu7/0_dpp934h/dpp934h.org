  Voldemort didn't need to take over Britain for anything but his own self-aggrandizement. With his Death Eaters alone, properly used, he could have thrown the Muggle world into complete chaos and brought superpowers to their knees. He subverted and overthrew a wizarding government that knew the identity of its foe and that foe's predilection for the Imperius. The Muggle governments would never even know what hit them.

Well, the wizarding government appears to protect the Muggle government - see Kingsley Shacklebolt protecting the PM. Any wizard could easily manipulate the Muggle government. The problem is that other wizards take a dim view of it, and so will stop you.

So if you want to take over the Muggle government, taking over the wizarding government is a prerequisite.

All that said, I'm not sure that Voldemort had any aims regarding the Muggle world beyond the occasional use of Muggles as sport. His focus seems to be more on keeping the wizarding world pure and free from Muggle influence.
