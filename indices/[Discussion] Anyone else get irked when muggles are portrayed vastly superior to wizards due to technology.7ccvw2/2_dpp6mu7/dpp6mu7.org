Any technological gap Muggles achieve is completely useless unless they develop a technological method for nullifying or blocking magic. Since magic canonically supersedes natural laws (iirc) that is effectively impossible, and the only effective counter to a wizard is either another wizard, or catching him with his pants down/wand snapped/asleep and unprotected.

The whole of Muggle society could be brought down in maybe a few weeks tops by a very small group of dedicated wizards, through clever use of Apparition, the Imperius Curse, Muggle-Repelling Charms, Legilimency, and if necessary Fiendfyre. No matter how antiquated the trappings of wizarding society might be, they have the capacity to read minds, turn any Muggle into an unwilling drone, systematically deny areas to Muggle access, teleport to circumvent any defenses, and unleash self-propagating all-destroying animate fire without counter.

Voldemort didn't need to take over Britain for anything but his own self-aggrandizement. With his Death Eaters alone, properly used, he could have thrown the Muggle world into complete chaos and brought superpowers to their knees. He subverted and overthrew a /wizarding/ government that knew the identity of its foe and that foe's predilection for the Imperius. The Muggle governments would never even know what hit them.
