  I feel like you might be overestimating the effectiveness of guns? People have to aim, after all.

Not at close range, you don't. A human being is a fairly big target. If it's at 5m or even farther, if you just point your gun in its direction and instinct shout, you still should be able to put a bullet into it.

  Being hit by a bullet isn't even a guaranteed death sentence without healing magic.

That's true. Statistically, you have more chances to survive being shot than being stabbed with a knife. And canonically, wizards are tougher.

Another thing against this 'wizards can be shot with guns', yes they can. The question is how many will go down this way before countermeasures are devised. I'd hazard a guess and say very few.\\
Also, as already pointed out, if the wizards find themselves in a position where they can be shot by muggles, they're doing something wrong.
