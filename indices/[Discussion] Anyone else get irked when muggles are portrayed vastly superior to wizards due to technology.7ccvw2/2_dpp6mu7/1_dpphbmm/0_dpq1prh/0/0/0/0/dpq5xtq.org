I feel like you might be overestimating the effectiveness of guns? People have to aim, after all. If you could kill someone with a gun that quickly - before any kind of reaction were possible - modern warfare would be vastly more lethal. Being hit by a bullet isn't even a guaranteed death sentence /without/ healing magic.

Anyhow, maybe it's just the Slytherin in me but I probably would stay under Disillusionment Charm and abuse the hell out the Imperius to assemble an army of mind-slaves rather than actually duel Muggles, tbh. Just duck the whole bullets issue entirely. I agree on the last bit though!
