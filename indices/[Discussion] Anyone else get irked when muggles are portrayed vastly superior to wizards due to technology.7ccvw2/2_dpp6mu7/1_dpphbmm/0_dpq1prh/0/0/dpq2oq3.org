So they just throw up a shield charm if they have time. I assume force fields are effective against bullets. And after a few casualties I presume even the Death Eaters would get the idea that bullets hurt if you let them. But in general, wizards shouldn't be trying to go toe-to-toe with Muggle soldiers without the element of surprise. Play to strengths.
