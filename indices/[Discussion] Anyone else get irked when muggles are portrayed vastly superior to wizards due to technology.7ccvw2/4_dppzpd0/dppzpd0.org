I honestly can't take HP wizards seriously as they are portrayed in cannon. They have nothing going for them other than magic, yes magic is amazing but they are portrayed as bumbling idiots with not one iota of common sense. Honestly one nuke and the british wizards are history, and the eternal "but meh wards" argument is pointless here since they don't even know what a god damn telephone is, not to mention nukes, nuclear fusion and understanding that to make a ward for that.

Usually when I see fics where the magic world is super superior to everything I just drop them instantly, the same with pureblood Harry. I prefer the ones where he brings in some tech or something.
