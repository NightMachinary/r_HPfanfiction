  Honestly one nuke and the british wizards are history

No. One nuke and the British are history, wizards or not.\\
I'd like to see the British PM explain why he felt acceptable to nuke London to get rid of a few hundred or thousand wizards.\\
And if any foreign power tried that kind of crap, they'd be nuked to hell and back by all the other nuclear powers out there.

Wizards are protected from nukes to the same extent and for the same reason than their muggle counterparts. They happen to live in a country that's sanctuarized and attacking it that way simply equates to suicide for the attacker.

  and the eternal "but meh wards" argument is pointless here since they don't even know what a god damn telephone is, not to mention nukes, nuclear fusion and understanding that to make a ward for that.

It isn't obvious that they need to know how it works to ward it. It's completely possible that the simple, usual wards they're already using already stops nukes, as magic seems to trump completely the mundane world. The amount of destructive power doesn't really matter in this case, it's about the nature of what you throw at it. You need magic to defeat magic.\\
Canonically, the shield charm was able to ward off explosions after all IIRC.
