I think y'all are looking at it the wrong way, always asking who would beat up whom. I don't know about y'all, but overwhelming majority of my life is /not/ spent beating people up or being beaten up.

The crucial advantage that technology has over magic is its scalability. Yes, a wizard with a wand can do amazing things. Good for them. But, the rest of humanity doesn't have that option. However, they still can and have benefited from technological progress. Sure, it's more challenging, posing issues of availability, distribution, and education, but as it happens, magic has almost all the same issues.

Technology also requires infrastructure, yes, but it requires it to do something that magic can't do in the first place: reach people (and other beings) who were not endowed with magic by the genetic lottery.
