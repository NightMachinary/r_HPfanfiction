I'd have to say that yes, the vast majority of wizards are what we muggles would in fact refer to as luddites. Apparently magic and electricity don't get along terribly well, and with wizarding life spans being longer, and having the ability to alter reality with a bit of concentration and a wand flick, you don't have any real incentive to modernize.

So yeah, backwards Luddites. They've not needed to advance beyond their current technology level.
