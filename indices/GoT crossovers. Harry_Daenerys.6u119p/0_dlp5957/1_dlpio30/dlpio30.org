They're two incompatible worlds, Magic in GOT is more nuanced and less pronounced aside from Dragons. And Harry Potter Magic is both at the same time. I guess you could take Harry's wand and only allow him to use Wandless Feats of Magic, and then, in turn, he can't cast wanded spells. So we have a Harry with Telekinesis, Elemental Creation/Control, and some Transfiguration/Illusionist Abilities.
