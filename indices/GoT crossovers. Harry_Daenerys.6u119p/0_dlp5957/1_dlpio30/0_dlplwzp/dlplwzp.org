Does he really need a physical way to limit what he's capable of? As I said earlier, I'm not a fan of the loss of his wand being the limiting factor. Plus, I'm not a huge fan of wandless magic either, at least of the kind we typically see in fanfiction. However, I am a fan of Animagus!Harry. If there was any story where a dragon animagus would be cool, it would be this. I know there's a story where Harry is literally born as one of Dany's three dragons, but that's not what I'm thinking. Regardless, I still probably wouldn't go with a dragon (or a wolf) as his form, but it does bring up some interesting ideas.
