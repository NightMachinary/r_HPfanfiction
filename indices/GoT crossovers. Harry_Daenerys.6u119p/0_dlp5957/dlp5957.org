There are no good Harry/Dany stories. I'm not just saying that out of edginess, I'm serious. It's something I've wanted to read as well. There's a few stories, but they're all multipairings, or just not good. I've tried to write it myself, but it's actually quite hard to get a proper story out of it. I've seriously got about 15 decent attempts at writing it.
