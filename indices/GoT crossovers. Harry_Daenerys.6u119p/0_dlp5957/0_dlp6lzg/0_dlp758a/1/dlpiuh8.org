I'm currently dabbling in a crossover where Harry is basically stranded in Westeros/Essos, a world where magic for all intents and purposes is on the brink of extinction. The main driving force of the story is for Harry to find a way to bring magic back in the world with his extremely limited magical capabilities (And the birth of three dragons do not suddenly bring magic back into the world, like it does in the books). You need to curb or divert Harry's magic in some way, as he's pretty much unstoppable with his full capabilities.
