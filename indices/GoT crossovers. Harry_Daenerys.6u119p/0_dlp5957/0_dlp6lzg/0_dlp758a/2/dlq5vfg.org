My first thought was that Harry should talk Dany out of the whole fire and blood thing but they would never be safe because the mere existence of the Mad King's daughter is a continuous threat for the Iron Throne, no matter who sits on it. And due to Dany's appearance simply posing as Lord and Lady of Bumfuck somewhere in a small castle in the Reach would not work either.

About the lack of conflict. Unless you go with Dark Lord Harry who razes everything with fiendfyre and uses the imperius on everyone there are quite a few things that could stop him. Magic is not that effective against assassins in the night, poison or a crossbow ambush if you have no time to react. He cannot apparate to places he had not visited before. He would be overwhelmed by a cavalry charge or the good old human wave tactics.

If I would have to go with a plot it would be:

Harry mysteriously arrives in Pentos (maybe during the DoM battle so he is not so much older than Dany) and has a vision of Dany's less than pleasant first night. He basically sees a girl getting raped and wants to stop that from happening. Magic makes survival easy (just make yourself invisible and steal some food) so he walks around and tries to figure out what is going on and where in Merlin's name he ended up. After a couple days he sees Dany and follows her home. When everyone is asleep he breaks in (again quite easy with a sleeping charm and some magical lockpicking) and warns Dany, who does not really believe him. Harry stays in Pentos and keeps a low profile while reading up on the history (or uses magic to make someone talk and forget about the whole thing afterwards).

When Dany is told that she has to marry a Dothraki she realises that Harry is right and contacts him. They run away disguised as merchants and head to Westeros to get away from the whole Dothraki scheme. After finding a temporary home in the Stormlands they think about the next steps. Magic is powefull but since Harry is not a cold blooded murderer he cannot take out armies or capture cities. Ned hears a rumour about the return of a Targaryen and decides to look into the matter. He is not in KL when Jamie goes there to attack him and Robert dies without Ned nearby.

Ned arrives in the Stormland hideout and takes some time to track down Harry and Dany. Once there they talk and Ned is conflicted since he has another Targaryen hidden away himself. News of Robert's death reach the hideout and Ned refuses to swear loyalty to Joffrey so they make their way north back to Winterfell to get a better picture of the situation and talk with the Northern Lords. Ned stays out of the war of the (now) four kings or commits a token effort to Stannis and simply holds the Neck. He takes Harry and Dany to the wall to find Jon where he finds out that the Nights Watch marched north.

I could come up with more if you are interested. And if it is a little messy, I wrote this at 1am and can provide an updated version.
