I feel like I've tried pretty much everything at this point, including a lot of the popular tropes, like Harry being the person to rescue Dany before she's married to Khal Drogo. I've also had Harry be a substitute for Khal Drogo, whereas Harry would lend his support to Viserys cause. I've had Harry be a lost hero from the Age of Heroes, I've had him be Azor Ahai, I've had him be an Other, I've had him be a wayward wizard, inventing things in Myr and looking for an apprentice, I've had him be the ruler of his own new city, I've had him be a shadowbinder from Asshai, I've had him be the cause of the Doom of Valyria, I've had him be a member of the Thirteen of Qarth, who just happens to know dragonlore when Dany strolls in...

None of them worked, and some of the ideas are trully atrocious. My most recent attempt is kind of a mix of a few of them, such as Harry being an Alchemist in Qarth. I can get that to work, but still, the problem is having a story with actual conflict that just isn't immediately solved with Harry involvement. But, if you hamstring Harry enough (like by taking his wand away or something like that) for the sake of plot, then he doesn't really feel like Harry, and more like an OC, and at that point, why bother?
