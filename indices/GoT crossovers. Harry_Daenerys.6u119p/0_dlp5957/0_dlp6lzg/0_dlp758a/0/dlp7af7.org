  I can get that to work, but still, the problem is having a story with actual conflict that just isn't immediately solved with Harry involvement. But, if you hamstring Harry enough (like by taking his wand away or something like that) for the sake of plot, then he doesn't really feel like Harry, and more like an OC, and at that point, why bother?

There is one crossover I really like. Its "The Difference One Man Can Make". In it, the only reason Harry isn't just roflstomping Westeros is that he doesn't want to. That is literally the only reason. I like it because it deals well with the world, but the problem always remains that he's just way too powerful with a wand.
