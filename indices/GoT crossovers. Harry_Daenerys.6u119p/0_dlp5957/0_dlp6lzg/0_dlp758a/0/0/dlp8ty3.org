Could you make something work where Dany and her dragons/Army gets slapped down by Harry defending whatever city he makes his home. The idea of great power comes great responsibility etc. Harry's from a time of democracy, he might find the idea absolute monarchy silly. (Now I have images of Harry taking the place of one of the peasants in Monty Python's Holy Grail.) Harry doesn't want to get involved in the war, he's a one man army who would rather make a nice home for himself.

You'd have Harry's modern day sense of morality vs a young woman willing to unleash dragons on a city yet she's trying to do the right thing with regards to slaves etc. A man who holds the potential to rule as a god or a king and yet chooses to live a simple life. He might be the answer to all her problems and yet he doesn't want to be involved. Would he join, not to fight for her but to prevent loss of life? To save the common person and make the 'kings' fight without the lives of their people? A reluctant guide and moderating influence all while not believing in the cause but seeing no way to stop her trying to seize her birthright with blood and fire.
