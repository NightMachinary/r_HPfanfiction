I can't see him not being one of the most intriguing people in the world to her. He holds the potential for power that she's always sought and his reasons for shunning it would disagree with what she's heard her whole life. That's before anyone argues between the Others vs Fiendfyre. I don't know where Harry would settle, have you read linkao3(7551730). I think it was Anarchy who linked it the other day. While obviously not completely compatible I could see a story being similar to this. The whole magical defender aspect.

Obviously internal conflict and morality are much harder to write about than smashing obvious bad guys, especially without them descending into angst fests but who would compromise? Over what? How long would it take and how would the other characters react? Obviously Danny isn't going to give up her dream of conquest because some stranger powerful or otherwise said she's being silly but she'd want to know more. How would you motivate Harry? You threaten those around him. How would he work with someone willing to do such a thing? You've also got the whole religion things going on. Harry hates prophecy and people think Gods are real. Where does Harry's power come from, where do people think it comes from? Is he there for a purpose? That's before you get into the whole Dragons + Fiendfyre vs Others stuff that other fics get hung up on.
