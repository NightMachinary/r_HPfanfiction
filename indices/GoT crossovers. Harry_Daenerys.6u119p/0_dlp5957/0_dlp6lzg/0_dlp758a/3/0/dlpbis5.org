I think it's more about mindset, than age. A 14 year old Harry's prime motivation would probably be trying to find a way back home, rather than worrying about who sits on what throne of a Kingdom he's never heard of and has no interest in. It would be a pretty tough job to try and sell the idea that Dany is his way home, unless she's literally the first person Harry comes across.

Not to mention, if Harry is 13-14, Harry would actually be younger than Dany, if you go by the show (which you should. She starts at 13 in the books, but that's really creepy to write about, and not my kind of thing.)

The first idea that comes to my mind is to play off the whole "low magic" thing, where magic all but died out when the last dragons were killed. Perhaps that gives motivation to Harry to want to see the dragons grow and flourish. Then again, that same idea could act as the reason why adult!Harry isn't super OP.
