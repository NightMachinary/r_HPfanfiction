A fourteen-year-old Harry has no real home. I personally would go with after the DoM so that Harry does not particularly care about returning since Sirius just died but fourteen works as well. He has no way of returning, there is no Hogwarts library in Essos so he accepts that fate. And Dany's age is no issue. Simply avoid anything more than a teenage romance (although the age of consent is 14 in quite a few western countries so if they need to fuck it would not be too amoral. A contraceptive charm takes care of any surprises nine months later. Again, they could stick to French kissing and petting for some time since "Hey, I just got here, let's bang that chick" is not a good story.
