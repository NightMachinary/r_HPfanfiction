I have any magical character over the age of 20 wearing robes, even the trio or muggleborns. But I always imagine kids, except for very traditional pureblood kids, wearing muggle clothes because I imagine robes would be inconvenient. But even the traditional ones I imagine dressed like little Victorians.
