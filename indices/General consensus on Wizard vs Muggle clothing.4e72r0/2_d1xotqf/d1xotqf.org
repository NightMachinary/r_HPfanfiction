I don't recall canon saying that magical children wear Muggle clothing, and to me that wouldn't make much sense- if (many) pureblood adults can't do it properly, how would they show their children how to?

The way I see it, magical people who haven't been surrounded by Muggle fashion aren't going to dress in Muggle clothing (and certainly not well). If, however, they have been, then they might adopt it. Half-bloods, muggle borns, purebloods that have dealings in the Muggle world (and are also more open minded), purebloods with half blood/muggleborn friends.

The robes can be fancy or plain, but we get a silly scene in GoF regarding muggle dress for a reason, and it's pointed out in PS that they look /odd/ out in public.

(This would also explain Molly making sweaters/jumpers for her kids. Arthur's relatively obsessed with muggles, and sweaters are relatively easy to make, possibly even more so w/ magic (it's three tubes pretty much).)
