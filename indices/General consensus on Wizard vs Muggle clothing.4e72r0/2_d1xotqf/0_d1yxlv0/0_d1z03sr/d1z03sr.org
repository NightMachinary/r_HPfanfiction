But I'm talking about a subset of people who go out of their way to distance themselves from the Muggle side of their history. Electric power had been a thing in most homes for most of the last century (and known about for far longer), yet we get purebloods who can't pronounce electricity or telephone.

Even though they're all required to try and blend in with muggles according to the statute of secrecy, they go out of their way to not do so. Pants stifle magic use, wearing deliberately inappropriate garb. This comes from the Pottermore article on clothing.

My point was that the Weasleys are comfortable with the idea of Muggle culture, even if they don't fit in with it. The convenience it provides compared to an outdated fashion sense, and the relative ease of providing clothing that would easily comply with the requirements for their children.
