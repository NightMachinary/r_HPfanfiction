In canon, adults are pretty much robe rockin'. /Fantastic Beasts/ might end up retconning this, seeing as it is Rowling's direct brainchild.

Out of sheer aesthetic preference, I've taken somewhat of a middle ground in my fics: most European wizards and witches generally wear the "robe, shirt and hose" ensemble, or at least two out of three (not counting accessories like hats and scarves, etc.), so Diagon Alley might resemble a Ren Fair or something if you squint hard enough.
