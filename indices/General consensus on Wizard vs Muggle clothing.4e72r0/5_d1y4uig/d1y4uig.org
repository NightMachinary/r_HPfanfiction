I think that wizarding robes are common, but that muggle clothes are an accepted part of wizarding life. I also think that the younger generation tends to wear more muggle clothing than the previous generations. Harry mentions that the Weasley children "might don Muggle clothing during the holidays, but Mr. and Mrs. Weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness."

Wizards are certainly supposed to wear muggle clothes in muggle areas, and that includes people like the Malfoys. Professor McGonagall complains that people are walking around in muggle clothes in broad daylight the day after Voldemort's downfall. The characters repeatedly change into their clothes on the train, and when Harry hides in Malfoy's compartment in HBP, even Malfoy says, "we better get our robes on." Which could mean that he's wearing a different set of robes and needs to change into a uniform, but muggle clothes are the correct dress for King's Cross.

I think that some people wear muggle clothes under their Hogwarts robes (though it's probably comfort and weather-dependent). Obviously if Ron is wearing a t-shirt/jeans under his robes, he might enjoy the chance to take off his robes after a long day of class and lounge around in t-shirt/jeans. And if students are allowed to walk around Hogwarts in muggle clothes outside of class hours, some students might chose to do so. Other students, like Malfoy, would be more inclined to exclusively wear robes during their leisure time.

So it doesn't bother me when wizards wear muggle clothes, especially when it's people in the trio's generation. And even Death Eaters need to wear muggle clothes on occasion, though they really shouldn't be enjoying it too much.

What does bother me is when a character like Harry or Hermione is somehow fashionable despite spending most of their time at an isolated boarding school with a uniform policy and being part of a socially isolated community.
