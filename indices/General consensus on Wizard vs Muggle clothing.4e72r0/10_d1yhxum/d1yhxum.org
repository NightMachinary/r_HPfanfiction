The books never really game me an idea of what robes were supposed to look like. When I imagine robes, I imagine something along the lines of a Thawb or the cape/dress thing Gandalf wears. But the books never really gave specifics, so I don't mind it much when they have characters wearing muggle clothing, especially since there is mention of sweaters and stuff (Mrs. Weasley knits them all sweaters).
