I've said it before, but I don't mind the inclusion of muggle clothes. Especially because it lets us, the readers, connect better with the characters because its something we are used to.

What I can't stand are the parts of magical individuals being completely confused by muggle clothing, even though that is canon. They may live in different societies, but they still do live relatively close to one another. Plus, the separation between magical and muggle only happened relatively recently. In my mind, robes are worn for strictly "magical" situations like class or going to the ministry. But just going into town seems like wearing some pants and a shirt would be easier.

In my opinion, the idea of wizards not knowing how to blend in to muggle cities was an aspect introduced because they were children's books and it offered a clear separation of societies. It may not be practical in a real world, but in a book it is helpful to paint a picture of two clear, distinct cultures.
