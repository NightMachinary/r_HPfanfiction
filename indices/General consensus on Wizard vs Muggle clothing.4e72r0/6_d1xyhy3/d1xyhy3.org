Honestly, it generally doesn't bother me at all. With the exception of the Malfoys since they obviously have certain beliefs regarding their superiority. Even then, you can excuse it.

The thing is, given how the nervous system of the UK magical world is damn near in the center of /London/, muggle fashion should have had strong affects on magic fashion. If their clothes are a bit dated, that's fine, but I don't really expect them to be wearing linen shirts and breeches under their robes and cloaks. I see the robes and hats as fashion that's persisted as part of an identity, not as something they think is up to date with the outside world.

I thought the movie did a good job of this, actually. With a handful of exceptions later in the movies, there were some very strange outfits that were obviously inspired by dated muggle clothing. Arthur's earlier outfits, for example. There's a muggle professionalism in them, circa 1930 or so, but with robes and weird bits like the keebler elf hat. I especially think the later Hogwarts uniforms were fantastic. Take off the robes, and you could go out into the muggle world without anyone noticing, but when the robes come on, it still looks right. They didn't look as overtly magical, but they looked like proper uniforms.
