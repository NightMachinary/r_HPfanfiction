He's one of the bravest kids of his year, willing to sacrifice himself in their first year. He followed Harry down into the Chamber of Secrets with a broken wand. He also stood up (with a broken leg too) to who he thought was a mass-murderer in their third year. His problem is that, like with so many other characters, his characterization was wrecked several times for plot reasons, to the point of him becoming a joke.
