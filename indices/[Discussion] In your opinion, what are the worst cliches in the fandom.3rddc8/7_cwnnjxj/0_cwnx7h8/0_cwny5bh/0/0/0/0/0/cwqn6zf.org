Well, then, you're missing out on some of the best-written fanfic in the fandom - if not THE best-written. It's really professional-grade stuff. But I see what you mean about reading fic primarily for Hermione; I guess a good way to approach /Alexandra Quick/ is to think of it as an original-fic series in the same universe, and not as fanfic per se.

But the reason I mention it is that it's very, very character-driven. Nobody gets the idiot ball just to drive the plot forward, and there's no derailment. (Yet.)
