And quite a lot of his issues can be attributed to jealousy and the desire to actually have anything of his own. A petty reason, sure, but there are signs that point to him actually being his family's unfavourite child (signs that he might actually be noticing and taking for what they seem to be), so though I do get annoyed at him for once again throwing a fit because of jealousy, I sort of can understand the “why” of it.

And most of the problem with him in both book 4 and book 7 have their root in jealousy as the motive. So a prat he still is, but not to the degree that the people bashing him make him out to be.
