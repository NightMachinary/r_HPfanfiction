Wait, so Ron being willing to sacrifice himself to Sirius (who they thought was a mass murderer) in order to protect Harry is merely idiocy? Ron being terrified of spiders, but being willing to go into the Forbidden Forest in order to try and establish a friend's innocence is idiocy? Ron's willing sacrifice on the chess board, aimed towards stopping what he thought was the return of Voldemort, is idiocy?

Maybe those examples are idiocy to some people, but to each their own. To me, they're brave acts by a guy who struggles constantly with his own insecurities-- and maybe some people will scoff and say that folks should get over insecurities, but that's not how it works. You struggle with them, deal with them, and try to make the best choices you can, all while feeling like you're not measuring up to the person you think you can be. Ron is the kind of character who has to deal with that his entire life, and I think he comes out on top.
