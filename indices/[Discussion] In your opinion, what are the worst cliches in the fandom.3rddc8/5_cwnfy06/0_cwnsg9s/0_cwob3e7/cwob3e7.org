I don't think it's too hard to dodge most fics that involve that list. The summary alone is usually an indication of quality. The bashing part might be the hardest thing to dodge, since most stories have /some/ bashing since authors are generally predisposed to disliking their least favorite characters, so the writing will be slanted towards that

Also, the no STD thing is weird, since I'm skeptical at how common STD's would be in private high-school setting. It's not like they just appear from nowhere, so it would have to be something like Hermione boning her older muggle neighbor who has one, and then transmiting it to the school because she's a slut. I tend to avoid fics where everyone is boning everyone, so I don't really see it as an issue that needs to be covered in gen fics at all.

There are harder trops to dodge, such as friendly!goblins, magical cores, Hadrian Potter, multi-compartment trunks, and evil!Slytherins.
