I was more implying that if the author wanted to explain how magic can be manifested, a core can be used that is easily explained. It also helps explain how someone can be magically exhausted, since their core is depleted. If there was no evidence of a core or a manifestation/source of their magic, and was just explained as bring magical, it wouldn't fit to the storyline it presents itself in.
