Bonds. Especially unintentional bonds, of all kinds.

One could be lead to think that self-control or even basic survival instinct don't exist in the realm of Harry Potter. Bonds popping up because divine figure number 3 said so, or because character Y did this, or because character Z made this mistake.

That potential topic for debate aside, fics with bonds of any type have a tendency to also use the term "magical cores". I have yet to read a decent implementation of said cores or mechanics behind the various potential aspects of having one.
