- Harry finds out he has a completely different name and immediately switches over to using it.
- James and/or Lily randomly deciding to abuse Harry in Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived stories.
- Weasley and Cho bashing, extreme Dumbledore bashing.
- Titles like The Golden Trio, Slytherin Prince, etc.
- "I don't want to be The Chosen One, I just want to be Harry!"
- Harry being too nice. I hate it when he is portrayed like a pure innocent that's too good for this world.
- Academic!Harry.
