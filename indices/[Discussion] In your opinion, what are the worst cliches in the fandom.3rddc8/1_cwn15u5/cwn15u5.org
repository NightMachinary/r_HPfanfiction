Lord Potter-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Black-Dumbledore-Peverell-Evans-Bones-Greengrass-Parkinson-Weasley, half the titles claimed by right of conquest the others by betrothals. He also has controlling interest in every magical business and has a majority of seats on the Wizengamot, or he will so long as his best friend Lord Longbottom-Abbott-Lovegood also votes with him.

He's also a magical, political, and economic prodigy at age 14 with established alliances with all magical races.
