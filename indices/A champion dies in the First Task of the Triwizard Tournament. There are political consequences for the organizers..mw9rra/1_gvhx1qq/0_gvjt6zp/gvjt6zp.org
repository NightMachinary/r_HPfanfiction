Harry sank down into the soft, leather armchair. It was clearly charmed for comfort, and just as clearly made for adults much larger than him. ‘Nice,' he mumbled, figuring he should say something.

The man sitting in the chair opposite him nodded. ‘You like it? I had it specially made. Its magic helps my patients to relax.'

Harry shrugged. He'd barely said a word in weeks.

The man leaned forward slightly. ‘Do you know why you're here?'

Harry shrugged again. That had become almost his entire way of communicating.

‘Your reprobate of a godfather is worried about you. He asked me to help.'

Harry felt his lips twitch at the apt description of Sirius.

‘My name is Healer Tonks, but you can call me Ted. We're related by marriage, you know.'

Harry frowned and looked up at him.

Ted smiled gently. ‘My wife is Sirius' cousin. Her Great-aunt Dorea was your Grandmother.'

‘Really?' Harry said.

Ted nodded. ‘I'm muggleborn, of course. So I don't have any attachment to idiotic wizarding traditions.' He smiled again. ‘Like the Tri-Wizard Tournament.'

Harry's breath caught in his throat. ‘I don't want to talk about it,' he ground out.

‘I understand. But it is bothering you.'

Harry felt a spike of anger, but the chair was very comfortable, and it didn't last long. ‘Wouldn't it bother you?'

‘I dare say so. So many deaths of people close to you would bother anyone.'

Harry narrowed his eyes. ‘It's not like I was close to Krum!' he spat.

Ted nodded, his movements slow and even. ‘You weren't friends with him?'

Harry shook his head. ‘I hardly knew him. I don't think I even talked to him. Not really. We each took our dragon figurines out of the bag and the Task started. Krum was third, he left me all alone in the tent, and never came back.'

‘The dragon.'

Harry swallowed past the sudden lump in his throat. ‘Yeah. I didn't see it, but I heard it. And later I heard all about it. Over and over again. For months. He cursed the dragon's eyes, it went mental, and smashed his head in with its tail.'

Ted looked sympathetic. ‘When did you first learn what happened to him?'

Harry shrugged. ‘Dunno. I heard the screams from the tent. Then lots of people were shouting. Then nothing. For hours. No one came in or anything. I didn't know what was going on. I couldn't even look out; the tent flap was charmed shut to stop us from looking.'

‘And then you had to face a dragon.'

‘Yeah. At least Mo... at least Cr... at least I got some advice that helped me. It helped that the stands were mostly empty by then.'

‘Did anyone try to talk to you after the Task?'

‘Hermione. Ron.'

Ted raised an eyebrow. ‘Any teachers? Any adults?'

Harry shook his head.

Ted reached up and pinched the bridge of his nose. ‘I see. Were you friends with either of the other Champions?'

Harry shrugged. ‘Not really. I talked to Cedric a couple of times. But Fleur...'

‘Yes?'

With a snort, Harry said, ‘She called me a leetle boy.'

Ted smiled his gentle smile. ‘A tremendous insult to a teenager.'

Harry barked a short, abrupt, bitter laugh. ‘Yeah. I thought she was a stuck-up cow. But... I saw her. In the lake. Her blood just... hovering in the water.'

Ted stayed silent, letting Harry speak without interruption.

‘The Grindylows; they were... eating her. Two were fighting over... over her...' Harry suddenly started gagging.

With an almost imperceptible flick of his wand, Ted conjured a small bucket in front of Harry. The boy grabbed it and retched.

After several noisy, pungent moments, Harry got his stomach under control. ‘Sorry ‘bout that,' he mumbled, wretchedly.

‘You've nothing to be sorry about, Harry.'

Harry nodded, finding himself believing Ted. ‘Thanks.'

Ted vanished the bucket and contents. ‘Any time. As I understand it, you had to fight them off too.'

Harry was silent for a while. ‘First.'

‘Come again?'

‘I fought them off first. With a Revulsion Jinx. It made them mad. Then they left. They went after Fleur.'

‘I see. Harry, what happened, it was not your fault.'

‘Then whose was it?' Harry demanded, raising his voice for the first time in weeks.

Ted leaned forward into the anger and self-loathing. ‘Not everything bad that happens is someone's fault,' he stated flatly. ‘Sometimes, bad things just happen to good people.' ‘I made them mad,' Harry said, his voice breaking.

Ted shook his head. ‘They were already mad, Harry. The Tournament is dangerous for the participants. It was no accident the idiots in charge chose that spot to start. They wanted you to encounter enraged Grindylows.'

Harry frowned. Ted's assessment of the organisers' intellect matched Harry's own, which made him at least consider the claim that the encounter was planned. ‘But her sister blamed me.'

Ted sighed softly. ‘Few people consider eight year olds capable of forming reliable conclusions at the best of times. Especially in emotional times. It's so easy to blame someone for a tragic misfortune.'

‘What about Cedric? That wasn't misfortune. That was my fault.'

‘Why?'

Harry laughed darkly. ‘Because I told him to take the trophy. I didn't deserve it.'

‘So why is what happened your fault?'

‘What? If I hadn't told him to take the trophy, he wouldn't have died!'

‘But you just said you didn't deserve it. So Cedric deserved to take it. Anything that happened was out of your hands.'

Harry looked confused. ‘What? He took the trophy because I told him to! He vanished, and then came back dead!'

‘Yes, but that only matters if you deserved to win. If you had deserved to win, you would have taken the portkey. But you didn't.'

‘But,' Harry said, his voice thick.

Ted slowly eased himself out of his chair and knelt in front of Harry. He placed a hand on the boy's shoulder. ‘It's not your fault.'

Harry shook his head. ‘It is,' he forced out.

‘It's not your fault.'

Harry couldn't say anything.

‘It's not your fault.'

Harry's mouth opened and closed silently.

‘It's not your fault.'

Tears welled in Harry's eyes. ‘Stop it,' he mouthed.

‘It's not your fault.'

Like a dam breaking, a wail burst from Harry's throat. He threw his arms around Ted's neck and cried. For long minutes, he trembled and shook, purging himself of the emotion he'd bottled up for months.

‘They cancelled it for a reason,' Ted whispered.
