I was playing with the idea that all three Champions before Harry are killed - in front of the audience, watching in horror. But the magic of the Goblet somehow makes it so that no one is able to interfere with the Tournament, so they are forced to go on. Maybe the Goblet feeds on the magic of Champions who are killed? And usually it's only strong enough to nudge certain events so that Champions are more likely to be killed, but the introduction of a fourth Champion, and one with a whole other soul - and that of a Dark Lord - in him, means the Goblet is super-charged for this particular Tournament. So it is able to kill three whole Champions.

And then Harry, kept isolated in the tent, knowing nothing, comes out to an audience that is silent and shell-shocked, but assumes it's just because everyone hates him. And then he outflies the dragon like in the book, is the sole surviving Champion. Actually what if he actually slays the dragon? He kills a basilisk at twelve, maybe this time he's flying, the dragon comes close, and the Sword of Gryffindor pops in front of him just when he needs it most?

Either way, he's now sole Champion, and still bound to compete in the tasks pre-determined by the planning committee while the Goblet waits, hungrily.

As an aside, I was kind of annoyed that Harry actually being a Triwizard Champion, which he did win fairly if you ask me, never came up. So much for eternal glory. But you know, even being an Eagle Scout, which seems way less prestigious than Triwizard Champion, seems to come with more benefits.
