Absolute in what terms? Legal or magical? They may call it a binding magical contract, but they also call their government the "Ministry of Magic." It doesn't mean that the Ministry governs magic itself. Similarly, it's never stated whether the contract is binding as in /magic/ itself or *by law enforced by the Ministry. * It makes far more sense for it to be the latter.

The consequences of breaking the contract are never stated in the book or movie and that is something that is never discussed with Harry; which is something that would've happened if any adult had spoken /to/ him rather than /at/ him.

Also, Barty Crouch is under the Imperius curse at that point.

No, that's fanon. The Goblet is the impartial judge who chooses the champions. It is /never/ stated that it /enforces/ the contract.
