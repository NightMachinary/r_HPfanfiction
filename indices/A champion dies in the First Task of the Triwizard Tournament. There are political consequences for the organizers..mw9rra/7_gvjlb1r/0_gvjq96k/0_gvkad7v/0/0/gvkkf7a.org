nobody said it enforces the contract, but it's clearly made through it

from the book itself  "We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament. "

  "Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front," said Bagman, beaming and turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as though the matter was now closed.

We can claim Barty is under the imperius at this point, it's probable but not stated in the books so there's no reason to believe he isWe can also claim he is lying, but why?

and then this  "Empty threat, Karkaroff," growled a voice from near the door. "You can't leave your champion now. He's got to compete. They've all got to compete. Binding magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Convenient, eh?"

Clear as day, that Magic is enforcing the contract, meaning the most likely suspect, and therefore the only logical thing is it being the Goblet's choice of Champion enforcing said champions to compete, not the Goblet enforcing it, The Magic itself around it

also, the Ministry of Defence doesn't govern Defence itself, but the application of it for the country said Ministry is in.
