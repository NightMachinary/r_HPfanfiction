  We can claim Barty is under the imperius at this point, it's probable but not stated in the books so there's no reason to believe he isWe can also claim he is lying, but why?

Crouch Jr confesses under Veritaserum that Voldemort put his father under the Imperius when he was freed. He wouldn't get out of it until the next year when he escaped to Hogwarts. That implies, he would be under orders not to volunteer information that gets Harry out of the competition.

  "We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament. "

Nothing here says that it's the Goblet enforcing the rules, which was my point. Nor are any consequences stated.

  Clear as day, that Magic is enforcing the contract, meaning the most likely suspect, and therefore the only logical thing is it being the Goblet's choice of Champion enforcing said champions to compete, not the Goblet enforcing it, The Magic itself around it
#+end_quote

No, it's in no way "clear as day." Contracts are legal and enforced by the Ministry, not some nebulous concept of magic around the Goblet. *The Goblet merely acts as the impartial judge, responsible for choosing a champion.* It's the Ministry's responsibility to ensure that rules are followed.

Given the fact that it's simply not clarified in the books very well and we've gone on a tangent not related to the original post, I'm going to stop here as it's clear that neither of us is going to convince the other.
