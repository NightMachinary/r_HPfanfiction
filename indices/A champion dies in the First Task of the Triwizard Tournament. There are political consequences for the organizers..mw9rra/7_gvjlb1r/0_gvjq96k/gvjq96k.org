I've never liked the notion that it was the Goblet that was forcing Harry into the Tournament. It wasn't and it couldn't have been; if an object existed that could force someone into a magical contract against their will, it would've been used as a weapon against Dark wizards like Voldemort.

The Goblet is a convienient scapegoat for authors who don't want to face the fact that it was the Ministry, with Dumbledore's tacit support, that was forcing an orphan into a bloodsport against his will coz he had no adult who was ready to speak for his rights.

  And then Harry, kept isolated in the tent, knowing nothing, comes out to an audience that is silent and shell-shocked, but assumes it's just because everyone hates him. And then he outflies the dragon like in the book, is the sole surviving Champion.

I like this. /I like this a lot./ Harry, the unwilling, underage but only surviving champion. Not the /killing the dragon/ part but surviving and completing the task part. And then, the Ministry and the three schools, having egg on their faces, cancel the rest of the Tournament and declare Harry as the winner. They also insinuate that it was fishy that an underage wizard entered and won while the other three died, and while openly not saying it, blame Harry for the deaths.
