The Goblet made a pretty handy reason for 'Why the Tournament is forcing the fourteen-year-old to continue to compete even if Harry is the last one standing', 'why the super traumatized audience isn't allowed to leave and must keep watching' and 'Why the remaining tasks must be carried out as before' in my rough little concept, but I suppose it could be tweaked so that it's not the Goblet.
