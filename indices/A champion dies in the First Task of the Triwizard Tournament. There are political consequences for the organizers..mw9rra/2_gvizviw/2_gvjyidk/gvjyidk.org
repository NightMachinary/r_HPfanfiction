  Our first warning should have been when they demanded nesting mothers. It's well established that no dragon is ever more dangerous than a nesting dragon.

The Arithmancer, chapter 69:

  Harry shook his head: "Charlie said we only have to get past them. They're nesting mothers, so I think we only have to steal an egg from them, or something."

  "/ONLY?!/" Hermione shrieked. "Harry, that's even worse! Don't you know anything about animals?"

  "Sorry, Hermione, I didn't get to watch many nature programs growing up," he said, backing off from her anger.

  "Oh, Harry," she groaned. "Look, if you were...if you were a dark wizard---just hear me out---would you rather fight Bill Weasley, the brilliant cursebreaker, on his own, or would you rather try to kidnap Ginny from under Mrs. Weasley's nose?"

  The colour drained from Harry's face, and his eyes nearly popped out of his head.
