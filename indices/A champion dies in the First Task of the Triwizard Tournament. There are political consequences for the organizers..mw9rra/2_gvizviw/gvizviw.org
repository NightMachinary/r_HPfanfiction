They told us everything had been handled; they told us there were precautions.

Our first warning should have been when they demanded nesting mothers. It's well established that no dragon is ever more dangerous than a nesting dragon.

Our second warning should have been when they demanded the Horntail on such short notice.

The contract, the preparations had only been made with three dragons in mind. And we chose the three with care.

Every dragon is dangerous, of course; but the three species chosen were chosen because they are the tamer species. More controllable, more reasonable. Not safe by any means, not safe at all, but more like a raging wildfire than Fiendfyre.

The Hungarian Horntail, on the other hand, is /mean/. I won't say /cruel/, because most animals can't be /cruel/ but the Horntail is a nasty piece of work.

Only seasoned Handlers deal with the Horntails and only in teams of dozens and still we lose Handlers every year to them.

We had a dozen Handlers for four dragons, four nesting mothers.

They told us it was safe. We were stupid to believe them.

The arena, gods above the arena, should have made us call it off. Never put an animal in a pit with so much noise and movement around them. Never corner an animal.

Diggory went first, facing the Short-snout. On a good day, with her usual Handlers, the Snort-snout can be almost friendly.

Kid was smart, trying a distraction. Shame about the burns. But everyone got out of that alive and he got his stupid egg.

The French bird, she got lucky, hopefully. Her Veela blood might have saved her life when the Green lit her like a match. The Healers are cautiously optimistic about her chances to survive this. Trying to charm a dragon to sleep? A nesting mother in a strange place with her clutch? Suicidal.

Everyone knows it takes teams of wizards to bring down a dragon by magic. And some schoolgirl thought she could do it herself?

Krum...Krum, I won't say he deserved what he got, nobody should go like he did, but Fireballs are severely endangered. We lost nearly an entire clutch to his stupidity. I was never one to follow Quidditch religiously, would catch a game now and then with my mates, but Krum was supposed to be a brilliant Seeker, the best of the best.

I guess nobody ever told him not to be on the ground when a blinded, hurting several ton beast is flailing around.

The coffin will be horribly light. His team is already looking for a replacement Seeker and I hear the Bulgarian Ministry, or whoever he belonged to is going to bring charges against everyone involved to the ICW.

Potter. Potter was maybe the smartest of them all. The unlucky bastard drew the Horntail.

People are calling him a coward, you know; people are saying he should have been able to save Krum. Bah! He's fourteen and he did the smart thing. He refused to meet the Horntail. Said he didn't care about whatever punishment the Goblet would give him. He'd rather be alive and not looking like Mad-Eye, thanks ever so.

No amount of cajoling, of bribery or threats could get him into the arena. He didn't finish the Task and he's the only Champion still in mint condition.

He still has his magic, so I don't know what that says.

Champions? Ha!

Those poor kids were sacrifices.
