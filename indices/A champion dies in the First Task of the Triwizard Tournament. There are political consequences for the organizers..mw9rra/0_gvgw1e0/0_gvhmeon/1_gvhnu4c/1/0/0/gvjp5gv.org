Um, there was no mention of anyone thinking that Moody was the one putting anyone under any curses and not Barty. Could you point that portion out in the book?

As for Barty Jr.; well Fudge wasn't really hiding much. He was quite clear about his thoughts on the matter: that was an escaped convict and he was Kissed. He didn't care about anything else because he didn't want to consider Voldemort coming back. Jr being alive was Sr's fault. Sr was conveniently dead. That wrapped that case up nicely

If you're talking about that time when “Moody” put all those kids under the Imperius as a practical demonstration... from what I understand “Moody” got permission from Dumbledore who probably followed protocol and got the right approvals in order to cover his arse if nothing else
