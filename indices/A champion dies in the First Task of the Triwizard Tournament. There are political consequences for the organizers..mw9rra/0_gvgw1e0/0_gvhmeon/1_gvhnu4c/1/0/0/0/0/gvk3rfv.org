True

But then again, this was in the point of view of a teenaged boy. I doubt he'd be privy to the board of governors' thoughts or the parents' thoughts of the things that happened in Hogwarts and Dumbledore's hand in things or the results of Dumbledore's decisions or even events they felt the headmaster was responsible for (even if he truly wasn't)

“Moody's” year as teacher could actually have been a factor in allowing Fudge to take so much control... the board of governors might have been swayed into allowing Umbridge in and getting all that authority because of what happened in fourth year

After all, it certainly couldn't have been the first time the ministry has tried a stunt like this to get control of Hogwarts
