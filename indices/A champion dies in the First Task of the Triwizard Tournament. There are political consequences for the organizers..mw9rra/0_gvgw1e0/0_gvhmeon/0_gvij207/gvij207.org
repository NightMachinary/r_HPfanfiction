It would be interesting if there was a political scuffle between the UK, Bulgaria, and France in the background of a story due to what happened in the maze. Krum tortures Fleur where no one can see them and his defence is that he was controlled by the notoriously hard to prove Imperius. And it's not like the British MoM is going to risk looking like idiots and giving Dumbledore evidence by coming out and saying "yeah it was all organised by a criminal we thought was dead, but don't worry we executed him before he could give any kind of official statement".
