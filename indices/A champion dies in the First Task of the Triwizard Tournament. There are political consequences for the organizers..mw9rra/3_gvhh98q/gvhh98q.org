A good hook for Cedric being the one who dies, is the canon setup that he is the only one whose teachers /didn't/ tell. Maybe Harry is a little less forgiving that Cedric is okay with all his housemates (and even Sprout!) calling Harry a cheat, and doesn't share the info. Or maybe Harry is still a bit naive and assumes---since he knows he, Fleur, and Victor have been told---that Cedric was also told (and, for once in his school career, doesn't think it's his responsibility to make sure).
