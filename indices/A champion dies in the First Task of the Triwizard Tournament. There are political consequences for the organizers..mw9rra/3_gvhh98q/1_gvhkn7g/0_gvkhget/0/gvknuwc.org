All of the tasks involved magical creatures and many of them were moved or even imported. I feel that it is plausible that it was the most interesting thing that Amos' department had worked on for years. I feel that it would have been one of the first things mentioned if at any point over the summer he talked about his day at work over dinner. If only as 'its been so busy with half the guys pulled away to work on the tournament'.

Also while the teachers aren't meant to help, is there any rule against parents? Even if there was would you expect a father to let his son go up against an nesting dragon unprepared?
