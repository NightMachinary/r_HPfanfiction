  Also would be better if Cedric was the last to go.

Easy enough with the setup we already have. Since Cedric DIDN'T know it was dragons ahead of time, he kind of freezes up when Fleur pulls the first one out of the bag, and doesn't step forward to take one before Harry. Cedric thus is the last to pull a dragon out, getting the last slot and the most dangerous dragon. He's pretty much doomed at this point.
