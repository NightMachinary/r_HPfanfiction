Given how they behaved in the tent, I don't think any of them quite got over it, and they could do plenty of thinking in the tent and at the entrance.

That said, I can definitely see Krum's Conjunctivitus spell or Fleur's sleeping spell not being as strong due to lack of practise, leading to their demise; but Cedric in particular just did a good Inanimate to Animate transfiguration.
