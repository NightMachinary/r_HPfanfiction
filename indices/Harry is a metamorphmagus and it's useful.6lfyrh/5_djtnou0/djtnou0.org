linkffn(Altered Histories by Acaykath) I have no idea if it's useful in this one, but it has a Metamorph!Harry.

linkffn(A Cloak and Dagger State of Affairs by Sage Ra) Alternate identities, at least.

linkffn(Nobody told Me the rules by Zaxaramas) Original Character instead of Harry, but useful metamorphing happens.
