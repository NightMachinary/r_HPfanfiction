In my story(darkness ascendant) he's a minimal skilled one. He can affect the 'dead' parts of his body: hair and nails essentially and he's learning how to make his nails into pseudo-blades, using a potion to strengthen them so they don't get torn off when he has to use them as such in third and/or fourth year. When his friends learns about it one asks what he can do: he demonstrates the nail growth which is easy for him while hair growth is difficult for him and changing hair color requires him to concentrate on it and just looks like a thin sheen of the color on top of black hair.
