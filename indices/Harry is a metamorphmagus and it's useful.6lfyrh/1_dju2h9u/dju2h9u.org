Gives me a passing idea for "The Megamorphagus"

Olivander's second phoenix feather wand was stolen as a spare by Voldemort. Harry was not successfully matched with a wand. It's rare but it happens and there is protocol for this. He is excused from all wand related classes at Hogwarts. He latches on to his inborn abilities especially the shapeshifting.

He becomes very skilled but it's not enough. He begins to question why his ability has limits. He learns of Obscurials which he sees as a squib unlocking something inside themselves due to a state of mind. He determines he is limited because his mind is limited.

He starts doing anything to expand his mind. Things like having his friends freeze him with Petrificus Totalus and leave him in his bed while he strains against it as hard as possible. Forcing himself to endure unnatural levels of the emotional spectrum via various potions. Divination rituals that let the spirit temporarily leave the body. Basically anything he can think of that won't kill him as long as he is stronger for it.

You eventually wind up with someone who is combination of Tetsuo and Martian Manhunter. He would even learn the Obscurial transformation eventually.
