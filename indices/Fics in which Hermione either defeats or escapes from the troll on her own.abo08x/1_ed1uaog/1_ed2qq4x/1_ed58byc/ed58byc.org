Had that been the problem, it could have still been a good fic. A Hermione who is a high-functioning psychopath is an intriguing reenvisioning of the character and one that isn't actually that big a divergence from her early-to-mid-canon personality.

This fic has, shall we say, /other elements/, including, but not limited to, Dumbledore-bashing, Hermione irrationally attaching herself to Harry, and, from what I heard, some later weirdness with Diary!Riddle.
