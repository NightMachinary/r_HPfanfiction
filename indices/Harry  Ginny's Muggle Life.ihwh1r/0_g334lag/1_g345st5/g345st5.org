It's not explicitly specified in any canonical source why Muggle-borns or wizards, in general, familiar with how the Muggle world works, are not rich. I had thought about your suggestion in the past as well, but my headcanon is that reparo would not account for wear or deterioration of the pieces. So a house fallen apart could probably be put back together but it would still look like an abandoned house. Also, most people who choose to leave the Muggle world in favor of the Magical world, do so at the early age of 11, therefore not acquiring significant skills in interacting with Muggles (say negotiation skills, marketing skills, etc.). Even when they return, they struggle to adapt and they cannot really use magical shortcuts (such as confounding or imperiusing the Muggles) because they are still under heavy scrutiny due to the ISS.

The only families in the series mentioned to have broke bank due to relationships with Muggles were the Potters (specifically the Potter ancestor whose name I forgot now) and, ironically, the Malfoys, who actually got most of their wealth from real estate prior to the enactment of ISS.
