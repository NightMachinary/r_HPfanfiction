Fixing and selling houses is an obvious endless machine for getting money (as observed in “A Wizard's Guide to 'Banking' by Bakuraptor” linkffn(12327848)), but the prices of these two houses are certainly not the average ones. Selling house used in the world-famous film franchise will get you a way over the fair-market value of the similar non-famous house. Just a warning for anybody who plans to use these prices as anything resembling the fair market value of a home in UK in the given time.

Quoting from the BBC article:

  Its current owners have put the house on sale for £475,000 - it was bought for £290,000 in 2010.

Perhaps those £290,000 represents FMV more?
