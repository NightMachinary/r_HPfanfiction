Why does Harry need a Muggle job he hates if he has Black and Potter gold at his disposal?

If he needs Muggle money, he just needs to reparo some distressed Muggle real estate and flip them at market prices, or reparo some clunkers and sell them.

He can make boatloads of money easily that way. Do you know that [[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-berkshire-37409273][4 Privet Drive sold for 290000 pounds]] in 2010? Or that [[https://time.com/4508563/hermione-harry-potter-house-sale/][Hermione Granger's house went for 3.1 million pounds]] in 2016? If we go buy JKR's pounds to galleons exchange rate, they would be 58000 and 620000 galleons respectively. Remember, the Twins only needed 1000 galleons to open a big shop in Wizarding Britain's primary commercial district.
