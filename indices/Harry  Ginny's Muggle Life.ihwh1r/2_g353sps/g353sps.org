I'd read most of this except for the last two points before the cameo, i.e. Harry working a muggle job and Ginny being a closeted muggle-fanatic, because I just don't see either of those happening. I'm happy enough with their canon jobs of Auror and professional Quidditch player respectively.

What I'd definitely love to read though is Teddy in the muggle world. The nice Ms. Robinson next door is surprised to see her new neighbours allowing their adorable charge to dye his own hair - and every two to three days at that. Every time she sees him, the boy seems to sport a different hair colour. She questions Harry and Ginny about it, and Harry has to come up with a lie about it being 'washable dye.' As Ms. Robinson doesn't really know these 'young people things', she supposes it's probably true and probably fine.

What's even odder, however, is that young Teddy's /features/ seems to change sometimes too. She could swear the day before the boy had had honey-brown eyes, but today as he skips past her going "hello Ms. Robinson!" she thought his eyes looked...green. Very green. Almost as green as his godfather's.

The next time she knocks on their door with her leftover scones, Harry chuckles in what she thinks of as a nervous fashion, and says they're contact lenses, approved by an optometrist for child use and all that. "Teddy was very insistent," he says, with a helpless smile. "We like to let him make his own fashion choices, as long as it doesn't hurt him."

The other day, she could almost swear she saw that Weasley girl playing catch-and-release with a fluttering golden bug of some sort on their balcony. When she blinks again, the girl had gone inside, and Ms. Robinson blames it on her lack of sleep from catching up with EastEnders the night before.

Her new next door neighbours are certainly very eccentric, Ms. Robinson thinks, but they seem to be the good sort. She wishes them all the best.

I'm always of the opinion that we need more Harry-raising-Teddy fics! There can never be enough.
