  “To make sure that the basilisk dies?”

  “To make sure that Hogwarts is well and truly safe,” Harry corrected. “The year Hagrid was expelled, the Chamber was open and there was a chance for the snake to be killed. That chance was missed, ignored, whatever. Fate had to wait for a true Parselmouth to arrive to offer the chance again.”

  “What do you propose we do, Evan?”

  Harry looked Dumbledore straight in the eye and said, “We kill the damn thing.”

  “And I assume you know how?”

  Harry shrugged and looked sheepish. “A twelve year-old did it the first time, I think I can manage it, sir.”

  Dumbledore gave the idea some thought. “You believe this will help us in finding the diary?”

  “I don't think it will just suddenly appear in our laps, sir. But,” Harry's voice was full of conviction, “I do think that until the basilisk is destroyed, the diary is necessary to the future.”

  Dumbledore finally nodded his agreement and looked at Harry, the twinkle reemerging in his eyes. “Twelve, Mr. Potter? You must have been an interesting child to have about.”
