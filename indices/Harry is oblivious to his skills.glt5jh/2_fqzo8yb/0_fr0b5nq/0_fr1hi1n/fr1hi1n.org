Because his achievements look like plot requirements rather than the result of his developed skills and innate talent. They're not contextualized in his general performance, they're basically one offs in a sea of mediocrity.

Worse, his greatest gift after flying, namely DADA expertise, which could actually be seen as remarkable, is extremely cheapened by the necessity of having death eaters and school kids fight on even grounds, so he doesn't really stand out even in combat where he ought to shine.
