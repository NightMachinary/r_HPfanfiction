Pretty much. I don't get people who don't think that Harry isn't powerful. Oh sure, he's not book smart like Hermione is, and doesn't practice as hard with certain subjects like she does, but he's powerful for sure.

Not many 13 year old kids can cast a patronus. Not many people can out fly/trick a dragon (the other contestants did other ways to get the egg). He also taught DA to people when Umbridge was at the school, was able to escape Voldemort multiple times, Harry was able to hold his own against variety of Death Eaters, stopped Voldemort, was involved with stealing something in Gringotts (With help sure, but still all incredible stuff).
