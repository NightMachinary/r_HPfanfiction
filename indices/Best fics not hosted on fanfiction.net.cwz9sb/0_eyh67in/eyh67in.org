Are you asking for AO3 stories, or ones that aren't on any major sites? I don't read AO3 much, but linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) has some great dry humour and an excellent Snape redemption arc.

Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past was on FFN but was recently taken down for bogus reasons. It's not so much world building, but IMO it does a wonderful job of fleshing out some of the people who were side characters in canon. Ginny and Neville and Luna are right in the thick of things all along, and there's a lot more time in the Weasley home.
