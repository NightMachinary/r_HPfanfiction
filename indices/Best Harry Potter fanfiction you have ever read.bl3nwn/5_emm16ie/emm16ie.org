It's too hard to pick just one, so have a list of my alltime fav's instead...

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts]]),

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4356667/1/Wish-Carefully]]),

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11913447/1/Amalgum-Lockhart-s-Folly]]),

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer]]) and it's trilogy,

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish]]),

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10136172/1/Core-Threads]]),

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2695781/1/Gabriel]]).

And sadly you asked for No Crossovers, so I've had to remove three from the list. I'm also not into Fem!Harry tho', so that didn't effect me.

If you're curious, “Sort the Dragon”, the “Lone Traveler” trilogy, and “The Queen Who Fell To Earth” and it's trilogy are the ones I've not linked. Feel free to search them out if you'd like to, later...
