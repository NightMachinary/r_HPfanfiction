He started writing original stuff, which I believe he is still doing last I checked. If you liked his work you may want to check it out. I've read his super hero series and it's decent, pretty similar to a Marvel or DC fanfic honestly, which makes sense since he started as a fanfic author. Not on the level of a series by a top tier professional author, but a pretty decent easy read non the less.
