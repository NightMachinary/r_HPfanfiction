Just a few off the top of my mind:

Linkffn(The Arithmancer) I really like the magic system and the creative inventions in this one. /Lux cohaerens!/

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) The real horrors of guerilla war. Also, lots of cool explosions. And a bloody scary Voldemort.

Linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) Also very grim and brutal. Unique take on stations of canon.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) Oceans 11 style crime thriller starring Hermione as the cat burglar and Harry as the heroic auror.

Linkffn(The Evil Overlord List) If only this one wasn't abandoned just as it was getting good... Tom and Jerry aim for world domination.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) This one is controversial, but if you like it, you'll love it. The only fic I've found involving daily, paradox free time travel like in PoA. There's a reason why this fic has its own, active subreddit.

Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) Favorite Sirius raising Harry fic.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina) Second favorite Sirius raising Harry fic. Awesome Regulus Black, creative use of magic, time travel almost as good as in HPMoR.
