Anything by jharad17 over at fanfiction.net. I'm incredibly partial to linkffn(3659602), There's two stories in the same universe where Snape discovers the horrific physical and mental abuse that AU-Dursleys have doled out on Harry and circumstances force him to adopt him (Harry is very young in these stories). They're very long and deal with how Harry comes to cope with trauma and how Snape changes as a person after becoming a father.

There's also a 1st-year-AU done by the same author where Harry is sorted into Slytherin, told mainly via Snapes POV.
