Basically anything by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Northumbrian/pseuds/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]], except when I have reread it lately I can clearly see that most of them can use some serious editing and cutting down (5% of linkao3(Friends and Foes by Northumbrian) is Harry and Ginny dismounting a bike). However, still, I haven't found any better Hinny, Lavender, Creevies than there (and everybody loves Bobby Beedle!). His nextgen (especially linkao3(James and Me by Northumbrian)) are very good as well. linkao3(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian) is just category of its own.
