I'm leaning heavily towards Fleur right now, but it's not set in stone. The romance is so light that I could honestly change the pairing even after her fourth and fifth year. Fleur and Iris won't even get together until Iris's sixth or seventh year, if my outline goes as planned.

And for the most part, the tasks are different. The first task still features a dragon, but the dragon is more like the climax of the task. The task is more about getting past magical creatures than it is a single dragon.

There's still the lake, but it'll be modified just as much too. They'll be a mist/fog above the lake that'll show what each of the champions are doing, so the audience isn't bored.

I'm throwing the maze out completely and adding three completely original tasks.
