Linkffn(Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise)

The first few chapters might be a bit rough in terms of the balance between humor and the serious stuff, and that's because I originally intended for humor to be one of the two genres. I was going to start another story, one that's more serious, but then I realized I didn't want to have two stories going at once, so I kinda merged them. Whoops. I've gone back and edited the stuff people think is almost borderline crack though.

As to how much of an AU it is... To be honest, I don't know how I'd rate it.

Iris is more best friends with Hermione than Ron, leading to her studying more magic than canon Harry did, which will lead to her become more powerful than Harry. She won't become as strong as Voldemort or anything. In a fair duel, she'll always get her ass whooped by Voldemort.

Ron definitely isn't bashed, but he's not as big of a character as in canon, but he's still Iris's second best friend.

There are five tasks instead of three.

I've created my own spells, but canon spells still exist of course.

I've completely removed magical vows, as I think they're stupid and far too convenient.

How much would of an AU would a fic be with stuff like that? I've seen fics that are canon rehashing and fics that change up so much that it might as well not be the Harry Potter universe anymore, so I'm not sure how to rate mine. The horcruxes, deathly hallows, prophecy, and that kinda stuff is all still there.

There's more warnings and expectations in the introduction on Chapter 1 too.

Iris isn't like canon Harry though. She's much more vocal and not as passive as Harry is. I try to give explanations for why Iris is different. For example, she curses more than Harry, and can be quite vulgar. This is because Vernon was much, much more vulgar than in canon. I'm just giving you a heads up so you know what to expect. She's also a lesbian. I know you don't like slash, but I dunno how you feel about femslash. An actual lesbian relationship really isn't at all an important part of the story though.
