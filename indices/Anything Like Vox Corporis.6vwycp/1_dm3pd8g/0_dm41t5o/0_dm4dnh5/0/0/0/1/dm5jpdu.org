  Yeah. I mean none of the characters in the books are directly taken from life, but real people did inspire a few of them, but of course, once they are on the page they become something completely different. Yeah, Hermione is a caricature of what I was when I was 11, a real exaggeration. I wasn't that clever. Hermione is borderline genius at points and I hope I wasn't that annoying because I would have deserved strangling. Sometimes she's an incredible know-it-all.
