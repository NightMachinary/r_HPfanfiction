That's not what she said, but it is closer to truth than what OP mentioned.

Rowling felt that Ron/Hermione wasn't a good pairing and that Hermione would work better.

  JKR: [...] What I will say is that I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment. That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with *me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione with Ron*.

  Watson: Ah.

  JKR: I know, I'm sorry. I can hear the rage and fury it might cause some fans, but if I'm absolutely honest, distance has given me perspective on that. It was a choice I made for very personal reasons, not for reasons of credibility. Am I breaking people's hearts by saying this? I hope not.

  Watson: I don't know. I think there are fans out there who know that too, and who wonder whether Ron would have really been able to make her happy.

  JKR: Yes exactly.

  Watson: And vice versa.

  JKR: It was a young relationship. I think the attraction itself is plausible but the combative side of it... I'm not sure you could have gotten over that in an adult relationship, there was too much fundamental incompatibility. I can't believe we are saying all of this - this is Potter heresy! [...] *In some ways Hermione and Harry are a better fit*, and I'll tell you something very strange. When I wrote Hallows, I felt this quite strongly when I had Hermione and Harry together in the tent! I hadn't told [Steve] Kloves that and when he wrote the script he felt exactly the same thing at exactly the same point.

But that doesn't mean anything about Harry/Ginny because:

  Harry and Ginny were always meant to be together. I thought it was obvious, but apparently there were internet wars about this.

#+begin_quote
  Harry and Ginny are real soul mates. They're both very strong and very passionate. That's their connection, and they're remarkable together.

#+begin_quote
  Ginny and Harry really are soulmates. I think she's like Harry. He's got an intellectual curiosity and she's got something of belief.

#+begin_quote
  The plan was, which I really hope I fulfilled, is that the reader, like Harry, would gradually discover Ginny as pretty much the ideal girl for Harry.
