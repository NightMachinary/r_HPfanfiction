I will second Something wicked this way comes. Essentially, at the start of the 5ht Harry and Co decided to summon a demon to help take down voldemort. This get /fun/ from there onwards.

It is also brilliantly written, with solid characterisation, witty humour, and a full complete story with an satisfying conclusion to boot. ( slightly rushed in the ending though imo)

If there are any fics worth checking out in this fic, this one easily takes the cake.
