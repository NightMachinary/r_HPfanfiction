linkffn(The Song of the Trees; Hell Eyes by Jezaray; Eclipse of the Sky; Animagus Mishap; Outcast's Alley; Won't you Save me; Chrysochlorous; To Train a Dragon Rider)

Those are the ones I remember. You said that Veela aren't considered creatures, so I excluded any that would go a bit more indepth into veela lore.

Animagus mishap is a smutfic with several disturbed things, but fairly well written, with somewhat of a plot. He bangs a lot of creatures, people, animals, animagus, etc.

Song of the Trees is a secret, cuz spoilers.

Hell Eyes is fantastic. If the author decided to go solo OG work with just the extended universe he created, he'd make money for real.

Outcast's Alley was a bit meh for me.

Won't you save me is a bit interesting, but not a really healthy relationship imo. I liked overall and is quite fluffy, but it has some unnecessary angst sometimes.

Chrysochlorous is a fantastic Twilight crossover with a unique and logicaly different Rosalie. Also, I disagree with your point about Alice. Jasper is as developed as her, imo and there's a few femHarry/Jasper out there. Even Harry/vampBella

To Train a Dragon, Its Arya, so a sexy elf. def no smut but good romance and extended plot. Unfortunately, its abandoned in a pretty sucky place, with like 3 more chapters , it would've end.

Saved the best for last, imo. Eclipse of the Sky is simply wonderful, it has a OG creature as the pairing, a complete character, with flaws and personality, with fantastic world building, a bigger and darker war (its pretty much global) a better and worse Voldemort, close to canon personality for Ron and Hermione, but without going into that trope of Ron being the most jealous person on earth and Hermione being muggle wank. The synergy between the Trio is only matched, imo, in The Sum of their Parts. Ron is really funny and cool in this. Kally(the OC) curiously enough, is quite similar to Harry, both are extremely paranoid, prejudiced against the things they think its wrong/evil, and stubborn like mofos. This Harry is basically canon, but with more paranoia, a reason to go to any lenghts to protect those he love, because of Sirius death, which he took as a lesson. A great Dumbledore and really really really close to canon Dumbledore as possible, but with a lot more action for him.

Also, the Horcruxes are badasses. None of the "I've seen your heart and its mine" bullshit that anyone would ignore and not go into a trance, when the person HAS BEEN FUCKED WARNED that some shit would happen... Anyways.... if you haven't noticed, I love this fic, so i'm biased. There are a few flaws, and for some reason there's a lot of flaming going on. I just enjoy it everytime he updates, which is fairly frequently.
