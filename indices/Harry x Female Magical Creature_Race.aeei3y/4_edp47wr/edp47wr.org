Yeah, there are a lot of Veela/WW/vamp out there. There is like a ton of HarryxVeela stuff out there. So many creepy "veela Draco" ones.

Honestly, HP fanfiction seems to avoid the more fantastical. Not a lot of monster girl romances out there. Hell, it is a setting with transfiguration and that is only rarely played with...
