He wouldnt do it. Voldemort i mean. If he is teathered to his servants, that means should his body be destoryed, so would his followers unless he bound it to his soul which he would have to redo with each horcrux, since in his mind the soul isn't infinite. (it is and isnt). The Dark Mark isn't unlike the golden coins that Hermione makes. A glorified protean charm based around a tattoo that is animated. The only question is does the tattoo grant information? Possibly. But that doesnt make them bound to voldemort... Voldemort just has the Master Dark Mark
