In the epilogue, Draco clearly survived.

  Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up to his throat.

Draco Malfoy also took the mark in HBP, so I think Rowling's opinion is pretty clear. (At least it was [[https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/27751][very heavily implied that he did]])

My opinion: Would it be in-character for Voldemort to tether his life to his servants? Sure.

Is it possible to drain someone magically? Sure, as we've seen in CoS.

So is it possible that Voldemort did it in an AU? Definitely - it's just not canon.
