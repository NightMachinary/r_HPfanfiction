Since you've requested long, I'll mention linkffn(Following the Phoenix). In order to properly understand it, you need to first read linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality), which is over 600K words; Following the Phoenix diverges from it about 2/3 of the way through. Both stories are complete.

Note that opinions of HPMoR are sharply divided. You might love it, or you might hate it. I recommend starting with the alternative introduction, linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMOR), which expands the first few chapters and smooths out Harry's interaction with his parents a bit.

What I will say for HPMoR is that it's objectively well written. It has a complex plot, a compelling antagonist, lots of humor, /very/ few typos, and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/a65bk5/harry_potter_fanfiction_clich%C3%A9_bingo/][it scores maybe half a square on the cliche bingo card]]. Criticism typically centers around Harry's personality, which is loyal and generous to his friends but condescending and abrasive to the world at large, and the author tracts, where Harry discourses on some aspect of rational thinking, which some people find distracting.

Following the Phoenix takes the story in a different direction, with the exposure and war you asked for, as well as some really interesting stuff about death and redemption.
