10 years ago, when I had to go to my grandparents home for summer, I spent 2 or 3 days beforehand just copying and pasting chapters and chapters in .txt files.

That's when I decided to make a website which allows you to download a fanfiction in one go.

The advantage of using a website? You download the whole fanfiction in one go. Second advantage. Just provide your profiles link, and it will download ALL your favorites to your pc.

Isn't that easier? [[http://ffnet-downloader.fr/#/][ffnet-downloader]]
