Well there you go! I just saw that text can't be selected on FF.net. What a pisser! I guess to prevent pirating? As an author, when I go to the story manager there's a "download" option and I can select the text on there, but as a reader there is indeed no such option. I know on AO3 there are links to DL stories in ePub and Mobi format.
