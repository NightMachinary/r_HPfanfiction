Most likely, and I can't blame them. For the most part, there isn't much reason for a reader on FF.net to copy and paste things on the website. Sure, there are writers who adopt stories - and then there's us who want to read offline, but I'm fairly sure FF.nrt disregards that, believing viewers will be fine with the minor inconvenience.
