If you don't mind Drarry, Saras_Girl writes warm-hearted fiction with happy endings and little-to-no bashing (as in I can't think of any at all right now). The Foundationsverse probably has the most angst and darkness, and her advent fics are probably the fluffiest. The 2019 Advent fic, /Light up the Night/ has Harry as a magical fireworks maker who goes on a series of ridiculous dates because Percy gave him a brochure for a wizarding agency.
