Since you're familiar with Ladybug, I'll mention linkao3(How to Fake a Marriage). Over 300k words of mostly domestic fluff, Marinette and Adrien being supportive partners to each other as they venture out into work and university. Also has a (shorter) sequel.

linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff) is lighthearted and fun. The protagonist very much does her own thing, occasionally helping to stop Voldemort but mostly just living life.
