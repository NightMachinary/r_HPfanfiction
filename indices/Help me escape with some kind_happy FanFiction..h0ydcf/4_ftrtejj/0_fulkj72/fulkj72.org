Thank you for these recs, I just read Ice Cream and Twins and they were both great, Twins especially was one of the more unique stories I've ever read and I loved it!

Also both Hermione Granger, Dermatologist and Hermione Granger, Demonologist are fantastic stories, Demonologist especially has /so/ many great little parts, not the least of which include her tea parties and the demons arguing among themselves.
