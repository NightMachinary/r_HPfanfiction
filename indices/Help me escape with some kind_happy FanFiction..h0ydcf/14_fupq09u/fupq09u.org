I'd like to apologise in advance for the length of this comment.

There's a bunch of humor fics I loved, like linkffn(Severus Snape and the Toddler-Who-Lived by nicnac918), a hilarious fic featuring Snape and an adorable baby Harry. linkffn(Potter Ever After by Kevin3) is also one I enjoyed quite a bit. linkffn(A Dramatic Reading by White Squirrel) and it's authorised, WIP sequel, linkffn(A Sensational Story by Srikanth1808) are both pretty funny too. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Manipulative Old Coot by Brynmor) is a hilarious take on the Manipulative!Dumbledore cliche.

For fluff, there's linkffn(White Nights by PotterforPresident1997), a short Haphne fic. linkffn(Picnic Panic by LeQuin is a Harmony fic which has a bit of Ron bashing, but is pretty good otherwise. There's linkffn(Days of Dust by NotAMuggleMiss), which I don't remember much of, but I'm pretty sure was fluff except for some more emotional parts. Sorry if I'm wrong on that. linkfnn(How A Slytherin Gets What They Want by Captain Cranium) is one of my favourite Haphne fics and linkffn(A Most Peculiar Girl by KingOfJacks) is another one of my faves.

Then there's linkffn(I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love by billowsandsmoke), which isn't fluff and is a bit more on the emotional side, but you might enjoy it anyways. linkffn(Sink or Swim by AkitaFallow) and linkffn(Learn and Adapt by AkitaFallow) are two character studies of Queenie Goldstein and Newt Scamander respectively that are also a bit more on the emotional side, but that I enjoyed immensely.

Since you said you're open to other fandoms, you might like to read some Zelink fics from the Legend of Zelda fandom. Zelink (Zelda/Link) is pretty much canon at this point (but Nintendo is being stubborn...), so there's a lot of great fluffy fics with that pairing. I'll recommend a few of my favourites.

linkffn(A Princess for Midwinter by Lyxie) and its sequel, linkffn(A King for Midsummer by Lyxie) are two fics where the authors (it's a collab between Lyxie and her friend CrazygurlMadness and is also on CM's AO3 account, DoYouCeeEmNow) try to stuff as many tropes into a fic as they can and they managed to make it one of the best things I've ever read. I literally was reading this at 4 a.m. in the morning, because sleep is overrated :). Anything by these two authors is something I can recommend. Lyxie also has a series of fluffy Zelink oneshots in linkffn(Order Up! by Lyxie). You might not get a few references if you're not a Zelda fan, but it's not set in any one game world, so you should be fine. One of my favourites by CM is an older, short oneshot called linkffn(Evading Protocol).

There's also linkffn(On a Wing and a Prayer by Della Ithilien) and it's WIP sequel, linkffn(On a Cloud and a Dream by Della Ithilien). I haven't started reading the sequel, but I /loved/ the first one. It is set pre-/Skyward Sword/ though, but I think it should be understandable for someone who hasn't played the game, save for a few places where Google might need to save the day.

Author fioreofthemarch has also written a series of fics set post-/Breath of the Wild/, which do have /some/ Zelink, from what I remember, but is mostly plot-focused, with politics and fighting. If you want to give them a try though, here's the links. linkffn(The Ballad's Beginning; From the Ground Up) linkao3(The Ballad's Beginning; From the Ground Up)

There's also a few more plot-focused stories from authors like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/28417/Seldavia][Seldavia]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6569/Shadsie][Shadsie]], but I don't have any specific favourites, really.

If you want to see more Zelda fics, I moderate the community [[/r/ZeldaFanFiction][r/ZeldaFanFiction]] and our Wiki has a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeldaFanFiction/wiki/index/stories][recommendations page]]. You might find something you like there. :) I hope I was able to help at least a bit.
