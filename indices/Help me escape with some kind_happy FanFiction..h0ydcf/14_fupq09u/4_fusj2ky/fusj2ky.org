Thank you a million for all your recs. My commute has suddenly become the Highlight of my day thanks to everyone's suggestions. I Know was always one of my favourites, and I'm excited to get into the Zelda fandom, I'm a sucker for good romance. I'll start on some of the Haphne ones tomorrow morning.
