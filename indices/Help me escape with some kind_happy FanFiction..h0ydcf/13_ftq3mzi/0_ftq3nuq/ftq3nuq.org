  “I'm so proud of you, my nephew.” Uncle cups Zuko's face in his lined hand. The gesture is so tender, his palm so warm, that Zuko has to take a fortifying breath against the sudden swell of emotion in his chest.“I want to be a good leader, Uncle,” Zuko says. “I want to look after my people.”“You will,” Uncle says. “You are, nephew.” In a new era of peace, Zuko works to be a very different Fire Lord than his forefathers. Based on this tumblr post.

  AU where Zuko realises early into his banishment that Ozai is an abusive bastard who sent him on a wild goose chase. Iroh turns their decommissioned warship into a floating tea shop, and Zuko settles down as a tea server onboard the Jasmine Dragon.And then, years later, the Avatar emerges from the iceberg.And then Aang decides that he wants Zuko, the first good firebender he's met this century, to be his firebending teacher - even though Zuko wants nothing to do with him.Based on this tumblr post.

  They gravitated towards Zuko whenever the temperature dipped even slightly. At night, he often woke to someone pulling their bedroll towards him, or slipping under his arm, or turning over in their sleep and colliding with his shoulder. It alarmed him, at first. It had never been a good thing when someone woke him in the dead of the night.It was strange, then, that he was on the run without Uncle, officially a traitor to his homeland, and for the first time since his mother left, he woke in the night sandwiched between bodies, feeling safe. (Zuko becomes the group's heat-pack.)

  Zuko finds Aang a month into his banishment. They're both 12. Expect not-a-kid-person!Zhao, gratuitous saving from pirates (dangit Katara give little Zuko back his shirts), and some solid Appa/Zuko bromance. It is the hole in your life you didn't know needed filling.
