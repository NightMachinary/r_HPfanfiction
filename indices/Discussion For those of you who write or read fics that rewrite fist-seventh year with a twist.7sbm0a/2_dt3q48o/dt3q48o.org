Depends on the manner in which you are staying close to the canon stations or the way you are moving away from them.

I don't mind some canon rehash as long as it's not complete rehash. The main stations can be visited but should be treated differently. Don't write canon with characters swapped. Ex: Don't have Malfoy steal Scabbers and then get dragged to the Shack. Think of a new way around the plot.

If you are spinning off in a completely new direction, think for a bit what canon events might still happen without the changes you made. Decide if they are important to the story you are trying to write, if they are, approach them from the new setting you have created, if not, write them out somehow. You are already writing AU, it doesn't just have to be single point of departure, you can say that Barty Crouch Jr never escaped and that's okay.

Also consider where you really want your story to start. Is the main point of your story the friendship between Harry and Malfoy from Madame Malkins? Or is it how a friendship with Harry changes the role of the Malfoys during the war. You can start during fourth year of your AU and fill in the readers with flashbacks and conversation driven exposition, or you can lay the base ground and then skip forward, highlighting key events until you get to the main point of your fic.

Either way is good, many people have read a lot of canon rehashes already, so there is often more call for something completely new. But write the rehash if that is the story you want to tell, because the story you want to tell will be better than the one you feel obligated to write for other people.
