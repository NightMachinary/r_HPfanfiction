My general advice on writing a believable Draco "redemption" is to start the process by Second year. Draco grew up believing that the Mudbloods were just worthless but then he spends a year at Hogwarts where Hermione trashed the pureblood elite's next generation in classes. The summer holidays would be a perfect time for some self-reflection. So Malfoy decides to get to the bottom of it and tries to be nicer to Hermione to find out how she did "the impossible".
