Thanks all for your comments, you've given me a lot to think about. This started because I was thinking about how really, really small things can drastically change everything. So I started writing the Madam Malkins scene from Madam Malkins' point of view. And I always sort of felt like part of Draco's asshole-ishness was him putting on a show for an audience. So I had the assistant spill her coffee on Draco's new robes, and the tow women go off to fix the problem, leaving Draco and Harry alone. And Draco is still a total asshole, but their conversation makes Harry realize that its mostly because Draco doesn't actually know /how/ to be nice. So they don't really become friends right away, but Harry kind of decides he's going to teach Draco to be a good friend. Of course, Harry has never really had friends, either, so he's kind of shit at it too, and most of the start of first year is the two of them misunderstanding one another and getting progressively more antagonistic towards each other, at which point Draco rats them out about Norbert and they end up in detention, like in the books. I picture that as the moment when they clear the air and actually become "friends," and I think things will diverge from the main plot a lot more from there. But since they are still at odds for most of the first book, a lot of those major aspects, like Harry and Ron becoming friends, the two of them becoming friends with Hermione, and Harry becoming a Gryffindor, all still happen. So, yeah, that's kind of where I saw it going. Again, this all just sort of happened because I wanted to write a scene where spilled coffee changed the entire world. And I wanted to write a scene from Madam Malkins' point of view. And then it ran away with me, and then I made the mistake of posting what I had, so now I feel obligated to finish, haha.
