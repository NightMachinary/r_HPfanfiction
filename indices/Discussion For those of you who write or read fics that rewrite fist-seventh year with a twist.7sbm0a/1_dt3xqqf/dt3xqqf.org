There is a simple rule for "What if..." stories and it is as follows:

*Everything that follows the divergence must involve the logical conclusions of that divergence.*

For example, if your Harry and Draco become friends, Ron and Harry probably won't. If Draco and Harry are friends, chances are he becomes a Slytherin due to Draco being there. If he is a Slytherin, chances are he won't become friends with Hermione. You get the idea.

Logical conclusions. The great conflict of Draco - deciding between Harry and Voldemort - can still happen. It all depends on your creativity and writing skills.
