The overwhelming sentiment on this sub favors original plots.

I personally hate canon rehashes with a passion, especially in time travels.

I mean if I want to reread the canon plot, I'm going to read JKR's original work. I don't want to read that again in a fanfic that usually lacks quality controls.

As for making Harry and Draco friends in first year, this topic has been beaten to deaths in HP fanfics, and there are literally thousands of them. But should they become friends, it would be a MAJOR divergence and would completely blow out the canon plot. For example: Harry would end up in Slytherin, Snape might be more receptive to him, nobody was going to save Hermione from the Troll, Hagrid would not tell a Slytherin!Harry anything about the Stone, and so forth. Voldemort then got stuck in front of the Mirror and was neutralized by Dumbledore.

In Year 2, now relieved that Voldemort was gone for the time being, Dumbledore went after Lucius Malfoy, who retaliated by planting the Diary on Ginny. But instead of carrying out a bunch of attacks, Diary Riddle went straight for getting a body back, the resulting merger with Ginny's soul created the next threat, the dark lady Ginnymort.
