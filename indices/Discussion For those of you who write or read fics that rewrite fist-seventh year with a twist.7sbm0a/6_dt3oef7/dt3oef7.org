Linkffn(darkness ascendant) is my story. It follows the canon of 1,2, and 4 but diverges away quickly though not a lot at first. Harry's too busy with family stuff to worry about the stone. He only becomes involved by accident. In book two i'm still debating how it all goes down. Book four is where serious divergence happens.
