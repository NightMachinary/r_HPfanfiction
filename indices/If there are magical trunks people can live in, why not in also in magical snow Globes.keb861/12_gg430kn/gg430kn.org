Oooh ... I think I read a drarry fic with the same concept where Cissa gives Draco a magical snow globe as a getaway ... Something along the lines of Draco and Harry being auror partners and getting injured so Draco takes them both into the snow globe to heal ... I don't have the link but I think it was a oneshot ... :)
