While its not quite what you were talking about, your post just inspired a similar idea for me but your office at work.

Wizarding work briefcases could be just a compacted office that when you get to work you put in the slot in the corridor and it expands to make a doorway to the room. It allows for convenience for travelling to other sites as you can take your work with you, allows for work from home if the same set up is available there, and allows for security as there is no office left behind for someone to break into when you have left for the day.

Maybe it could be something that only works to expand into an office in the Ministry of Magic building if you wanted it to not have them everywhere and wanted more security to keep secrets within.

Just the mental vision of the ministry worker finishing up for the day, stepping out of their office and activating something that puts it into stasis and collapses it down into a brief case they walk off with to go home feels like the rediculousness that could be normal in the HP wizarding world
