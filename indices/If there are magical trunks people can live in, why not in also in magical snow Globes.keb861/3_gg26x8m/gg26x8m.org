Idea 1)Magical university: admission to magical university is cut throat. If you can't learn how to enchant your very own snow globe appartement by the end of the 1 Day seminar you clearly are unfit to live on campus because they don't have the space to house you.

Coincidentally; the entire university consists out of a very narrow hallway with countless snow globes. Some student or teacher housing, some classrooms.

Idea 2) Also very interesting is of course the entire separation from the Muggle world trope and somehow making a network of linking snow globes for each and every magical location. This could be because muggles have started to hunt magical again, or as bio-domes in a post-apolyptical greenhouse-envirment earth.

Idea 3) The fancier and at the same time more understated solution to wizarding travel and conspicuous wizarding tents.

Idea 4) Someone made a fantastic beast sanctuary/ mini village for family and friends and enchanted their snow globe to have muggles hold it very dear and protect it at all cost. It ends up in a family where some muggleborn child touches it and sucks the kid in a la Narnia.
