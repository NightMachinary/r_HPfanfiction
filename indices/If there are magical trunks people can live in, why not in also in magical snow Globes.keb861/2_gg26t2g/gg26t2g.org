Ooh, there's a fanfic I read with this concept. Hermione asks Dumbledore to help protect her parents by getting them somewhere safe. She has no idea what he plans, but the story goes on that she's able to get letters to them through Dumbledore while they're in hiding.

Meanwhile Dumbledore actually hasn't sent them very far away at all. They're literally in Hogwarts the whole time...in a snow globe he keeps on his desk. When he wants to send them communication, he says a spell to send the letters magically to them, and he's able to go inside the snow globe and be their only visitor. The Grangers have no idea where they are, so their letters to Hermione talk about how very cold and snowy it is all the time and how there are no neighbors nearby. They get excited when Dumbledore comes to visit as they haven't seen another soul in months.

It was actually a very cool concept, and I enjoyed that story a lot for the creativity.
