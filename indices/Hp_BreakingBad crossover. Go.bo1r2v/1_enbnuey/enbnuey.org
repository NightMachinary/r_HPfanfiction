"Yes, these whiskers aren't just whiskers. Within five years but in as soon as six months, you're going to be a weasel."

Percy looked at the healer blankly. He had never considered where exactly his surname had come from. It wasn't unheard of for a maledictus to skip several generations, but he had never even heard of a Weasley becoming a Weasel.

But he hadn't risen to the top of the department of magical cooperation and come in second on three separate elections for minister of magic by stopping and giving up when he came upon a problem. He also hadn't ran three separate campaigns for minister of magic without going deep into debt, and he had no intention of letting Audrey, Molly, and Lucy be affected by that debt after his mind was lost to the weasel.

"Uncle Perce? Please tell me you're here because you heard this is where you buy Billyrox and not because you caught me and you're going to tell me to stop or you'll tell my parents."

"Not exactly either one. I find myself in need of some extra income and I expect you understand that having a consistent supply of authentic Australian Billywigs will give you a significant advantage over your competitors. No one's going to choose euphoria elixir over billywig extract if you get access to the real deal."

Roxanne stared intently at her uncle Percy, looking for a tell. He was unlikely to pull a prank like this, but he was even less likely to get into the illegal recreational potions trade. There was a third option.

"And what if I think you've decided that blood is thinner than politics and you're just trying to use me to finger my suppliers, get the lot of us sent to Azkaban?"

"There's a greenhouse in a location thirty kilometers north of here containing a blue silk oak infested with billywig nests, ready to give birth in three days. If you tell the ministry about this conversation, I would go to Azkaban with you."

This gave Roxy pause. The Australians were notoriously protective of their magical flora and fauna, and if this were exposed there was a serious risk of their declaring war on the British ministry. No investigation was worth that kind of risk.

"Uncle Perce... I don't... I mean... why?"

"Never ask me that again, never say a word of this to anyone, and we'll make a lot of money together."
