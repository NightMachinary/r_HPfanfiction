There's this one and its sequel. It's complete and the sequel is brand new, just updated the other day, ongoing. It's a Harem fic (tho' there's no sex shown on screen), not a Harry/Daphne only fic. The sequel is a Stargate SG1 crossover...

..additionally, it's one of the few fics that does Magical Science right (or maybe Scientific Magic?), so there is that.
