I've once read a fic -really don't remember which one, but Harry goes to a bunch of countries and is mentored by Dumbledore I believe- where on average, magicals from certain regions have different magical affinities. And the British were, on average, just a lot more powerful than most others. "If facing a northern wizard, bring fire. Face a French wizard, bring poison. Face a British wizard, bring 10 wizards." or something like that. It tied into that Britain was magically powerful enough to go independent and progressive a lot earlier on, before the ministries were really formed and despite the wars, they were still ahead of most other countries.

I've also seen mentions sometime of magical America being much more prejudiced in law than Britain. For example, marrying a muggle was forbidden in the states, in Britain merely frowned upon if you were pureblood and that was it.

But yeah, the "British are neanderthals" is much more popular, usually involving a Harry who somehow knows law better than fudge and dumbledore combined by doing laps around the lake.
