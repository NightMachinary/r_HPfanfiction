I would say that you either need to heavily modify canon Wizarding British society, or have it less of "Wizarding Britain is the most enlightened" and more that "everyone else is primitive and backwards".

Personally from how I look at it, it'd be one of the more developed magical nations - certainly not primitive or backwards in a lot of ways. However, the treatment of magical beings, along with the rather dark laws and the presence of a powerful noble/pureblood faction in the country makes me rather sad if that's the most enlightened in the world. So I like the idea of making other nations be more open in those respects - not all of them, of course, but at least some, or in different ways.
