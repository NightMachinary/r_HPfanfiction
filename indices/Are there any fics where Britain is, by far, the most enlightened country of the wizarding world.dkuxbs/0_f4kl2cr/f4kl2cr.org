I've always kind of wondered how Hogwarts is the most prestigious wizarding school in the world when the History professor is a ghost with memory problems, the Divination professor is basically a fraud, the Potions professor clearly doesn't actually teach and is super biased, and the Defense professor is sacked or dies every year.

Kind of makes you wonder if every other school is like [[http://www.cc.com/video-clips/p9do4b/key-and-peele-inner-city-wizard-school][Vincent Clortho Public School for Wizards]].
