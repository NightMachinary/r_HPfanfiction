To be fair about Snape, even though he is a terrible teacher, he doesn't seem terrible at teaching considering that the three Students he hates the most still receives Excellent grandes at their O.W.L exams and except for Lockhart who was a fraud, all the Defense teachers were very competent in the material.

And History and Divination are probably not considered to be that important.
