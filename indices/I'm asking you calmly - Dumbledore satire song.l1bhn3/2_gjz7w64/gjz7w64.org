Top notch video, flailing hands almost made me spit my drink.

Also, I'm a big sucker for rhyme so here's what I think might have rhymed better...

--------------

Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire\\
Did you put your name in Harry?!?!\\
Did you know your life would be in serious danger\\
Cuz these challenges are batshit *scarry*

[Bonus points if you pronounce the -arry in scarry exactly like the one in Harry. It's a pun on scary, on scarry (scar-like) and rhymes with Harry.]

Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire\\
Or was this just an anomaly\\
Did you put your name in the ******* goblet\\
I'm asking you calmly

[Closest I could get to rhyming calmly]
