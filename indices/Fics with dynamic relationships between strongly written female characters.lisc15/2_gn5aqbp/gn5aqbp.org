Linkao3(The Never-Ending Road by Laventadorn) does a really great job of Fem!Harry & Hermione, and Fem!Harry & Astoria Greengrass, though it's /supposedly/ going to have a Harry/Snape romance eventually and that's gonna be a turn-off for some people (I say “supposedly” because we're 600,000+ words in and there's still nada, basically, which is good if you don't care about that aspect but probably torment for the shippers lol).

Linkao3(Victoria Potter by Taure) has a great Fem!Harry & Susan friendship, and Pansy and Daphne get some interesting characterization as well. I'm not terribly keen on Hermione's portrayal in this one, but luckily that's not a huge part of the story, just a recurring thing.

Linkao3(Welcome to Slytherin) is also nice.
