Yeah! Totally get what you mean. We don't have a lot of good fics compared to fics with the male characters.

I loved [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29158347/chapters/71584359][Hold the Line]]'s Minerva McGonagall. The fic is Minerva-centric...complicated and brilliant characterization of her as a woman surrounded by men. Not really a female-female dynamic but I liked the friendship between Aurora Sinistra and Minerva in this one.
