linkao3(coven by naidhe) it's kind of Hermione centric but it's split between her and Pansy Parkinson, other girls are bought in later. The synopsis sounds really clich√© and tropey but it's not like that, it's an honestly brilliant read where Hermione and Pansy accidentally create a coven bond between them, temporarily boosting their power. Their dynamic is twisted and they become addicted to the thrill of the dark magic they perform together. We get a look into their psyches as they justify worse and worse acts.

There's a great fic centred around Tracey Davis, based on the premise that she's actually a Muggleborn called Tracey /Davies/ but Daphne misheard her when she said her last name and so the Slytherins think she's a pureblood. I'll try and find the title in my history. Edit: found it! 17 pages down in my history lol. linkao3(I rose from marsh mud)
