linkffn(2407704) is mostly a Hermione/Theodor Nott romance fic but the premise is the Hermione, Katie Bell and Tracey Davis are captured by Death Eaters and given as spoils of war to whoever claims them. The three girls collaborate on escaping having a pretty good and realistic dynamic, behaving as you'd expect someone of their age to behave in a situation like that. Hermione and Katie Bell are well fleshed out and to a lesser extent Pansy Parkinson and Tracey. It has some disturbing scenes that hint at off-page rape and torture though.
