  The Death Eaters ... [formed] a silent circle, ... Yet they left gaps in the circle, as though waiting for more people. Voldemort, however, did not seem to expect more. ...

  Voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space --- large enough for two people --- that separated Malfoy and the next man. ... "The Lestranges should stand here," said Voldemort quietly. "But they are entombed in Azkaban..." ...

  He had reached the largest gap of all, ... "And here we have six missing Death Eaters ... three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return ... One, who I believe has left me forever ... and one, my most faithful servant, ..." (GoF, ch. 33)

It's all very specific. I'd say they all returned that could or would, since Voldemort is specifically calling out exceptions.

EDIT: Voldemort names some of the DEs: Avery, Lucius, Macnair, Crabbe, Goyle, Nott. But some DEs I remember I don't see named here: the Carrows, etc. (but the scene is /long/ and I was just skimming).
