  Rowling really should have used the Lestrange brothers as the DADA and Muggle Studies Professors in DH instead of the Carrows. It would motivated Neville even more, and the Lestrange duo are certainly important/loyal enough for Voldemort to give them those responsibilities.

Were they interested? Were they mentally stable enough (I mean, Sirius was not totally here at the end of Year 5, 2 years after he escaped, and they have been in Azkaban longer than him, without being animagi, and have only been freed a year and a half prior) to be in a school?\\
Wouldn't Neville try to kill them any possible way? I mean, if his grandmother let him go (or didn't know they would be here), they tortured his parents into insanity. No way Year 7 Neville would have stood em even for a day.
