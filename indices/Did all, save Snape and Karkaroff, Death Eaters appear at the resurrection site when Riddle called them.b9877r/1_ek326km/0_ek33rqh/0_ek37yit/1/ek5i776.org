From what I understand the reason Rosier lost to Moody was becuase Moody was only using stunning/knockback/otherwise non life threatening spells, but due to Rosiers prowess and level of violence Moody resorted to the Killing Curse, which instatntly took Rosier out of the fight since it is unblockable and he wouldnt be expecting an order member to use it.
