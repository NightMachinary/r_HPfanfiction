  Who are the three dead?
#+end_quote

IIRC, the three dead are Regulus, Evan Rosier, and Wilkes. Regulus died in the cave where Slytherin's locket was kept, though its implied Voldemort never re-visited the cave until he knew Hufflepuff's Cup was stolen. He didn't know Regulus actually swapped the Locket with a fake. In fact, Voldemort's internal monologue after the Cup suggests he never checked up on any of his Horcruxes after making them. He just made them, dumped them in their canon locations, and then never checked them since he assumed nobody would ever find the Horcruxes. In the case of the Diary, he probably expected Lucius to give him the Diary shortly after his resurrection in the graveyard.

So either Voldemort asked Lucius for the Diary back and tortured him as punishment for losing the Diary (most likely)... or Wormtail blabbed to Voldemort about Harry destroying the Diary, since Wormtail might have overheard Ron talking to Harry/Hermione/Ginny about the Basilisk and Voldemort. In HBP, Dumbledore speculated that Voldemort punished Lucius for giving away the Diary and getting it destroyed. Though at that point, Voldemort had no logical reason to check the Horcuxes. After all, the Diary was only destroyed because of Lucius giving it away. The rest were hidden in isolated locations whereby they couldn't just be given away carelessly.

Evan Rosier was the one who cursed a chunk of Moody's face off, and Moody's account basically confirmed that Rosier died dueling against Moody. In hindsight, this might make Rosier at least the third most talented duelist among Voldemort's Death Eaters (after Snape and Bellatrix), and depending on how skilled Moody was in his prime, it might even have made Rosier the most skilled duelist of the Death Eaters (obviously not counting Voldemort).

Wilkes also died fighting against Aurors, but he is seemingly very insignificant of a Death Eater. He didn't die putting up an impressive fight against Moody, nor did he contribute to any of the Death Eaters' major attacks on the good guys (e.g. severely damaging Moody, killing Molly's two brothers, torturing the Longbottoms, etc). The fact that Wilkes is never mentioned outside of Karkaroff's trial also suggests he wasn't a notable threat to the Order or the Ministry (unlike someone like Bellatrix or Dolohov). Even within the fandom, Wilkes is probably one of the most forgotten Death Eaters. IIRC, he might have been in the same year as Snape and the Marauders, or perhaps 1-2 years older or younger either way. I think the tiny impression we are given of Wilkes is that he died young (as did Rosier and Regulus).

  And why only two spaces for lestranges? The brothers and bella are three.
#+end_quote

Perhaps Voldemort (and by extension, Rowling herself) subconsciously was thinking of Bellatrix as a Black rather than a Lestrange at that moment. So the two spaces were in reference to the brothers. Alternatively, and much more likely IMO, perhaps the two spaces were for Bellatrix and her husband, and that Voldemort simply just didn't care about the other brother. Even if it was a mistake, it would still be in-character for Voldemort to just overlook the existence of individuals who are less important to him.

Though a more reasonable answer would be that Rowling just made a tiny mistake, whereby she either forgot about Rabastan Lestrange (since the two spaces are clearly meant to be Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus). It would be an understandable mistake, given how both Rodolphus and Rabastan don't really do much in the series. I always found it odd how unimportant they were in the timespan of the books, given that both brothers took part in the torturing of the Longbottoms and that Rodolphus was married to Bellatrix, who was consistently portrayed as a major character. Though the Lestrange brothers are an entirely other topic given what happens in DH (why not just make them the DADA and Muggle Studies professors instead of the Carrows? It would give Neville even more motivation to fight against them).

*TL;DR: Three dead Death Eaters were Regulus, Evan Rosier, and Wilkes. Two spaces for the Lestranges would likely be a slight mistake on Rowling's part, whereby "the Lestranges" would be Bellatrix and Rodolphus whereby Rabastan is forgotten. Rowling really should have used the Lestrange brothers as the DADA and Muggle Studies Professors in DH instead of the Carrows. It would motivated Neville even more, and the Lestrange duo are certainly important/loyal enough for Voldemort to give them those responsibilities.*
