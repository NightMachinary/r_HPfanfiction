You don't need an OC or SI to do that. That's basically canon and filled with characters like Snape, Malfoy, and Hermione (who is basically a JKR self-insert so the author as well). JKR did everything she could to strip anything special about him away.

"Oh, you can cast the patronus during 3rd year! Adults struggle with that spell!"\\
"Whoops. Not really. The DA learns how to do the spell including 4th years."

"You're AWESOME at quidditch!"\\
"Which... has no real practical application to fighting the bad guy. And even Hermione learned enough about Flying to outfly fiendfyre in the room of requirements."

"You won the tri-wizard tournament!"\\
"By... flying the broom, eating a plant and an adult clearing the competition out."

"You beat voldemort at the end!"\\
"Because he literally used a wand that you were master of. He'd have beaten you with literally any other wand in the world. He could have picked a stick up off the ground and done better!"

That is why so many fanfictions out there have him... not a complete incompetent?
