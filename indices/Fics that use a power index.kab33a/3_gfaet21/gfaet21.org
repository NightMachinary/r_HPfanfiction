[[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54][Meaning of One]] by Sovran has an exponential power system. Your magical power rates from a 1 to a 10. A 1 is enough magic to be alive, most muggles fall under this. A 2 is twice as powerful as a 1 and is the bare minimum to be enrolled in Hogwarts. A 3 is twice as powerful as a 2 and a 4 is twice as powerful as a 3, so on and so forth. Dumbledore registers as a 7, and Voldemort and Harry as an 8.

However Harry and Ginny are soulbonded, and together have the only registered 10 since perhaps Merlin. Certain spells are hard to cast without over powering them as such. For instance, Bluebell Flames, the spell that makes fire that doesn't burn, can be lethal.
