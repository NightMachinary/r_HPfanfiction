I can't seem to find the fic but I remember reading one where Filch is actually an Unspeakable and Mrs Norris is his animagus wife. They are "stationed" at Hogwarts to keep track of things.

Well if you think about it actually why would you have a caretaker let alone a squib one in a castle that has elves? Because he isn't needed to actually clean anything as tge elves handle that.
