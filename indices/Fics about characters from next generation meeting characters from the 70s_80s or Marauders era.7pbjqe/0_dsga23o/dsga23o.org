I read one fic where Harry, Albus, Rose, and Hugo end up sent diagonally through time to the Marauders era, where Harry almost immediately kills Bellatrix. (It is explicitly stated that they are in a divergent timeline that will not affect their own, and they're stuck there for a year because that's how long it will take to create another of the time-travel devices to get them home.)
