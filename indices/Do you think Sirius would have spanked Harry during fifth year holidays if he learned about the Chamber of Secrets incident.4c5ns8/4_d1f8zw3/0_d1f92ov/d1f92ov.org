The crazy part is that Sirius /did/ talk to him, and honestly those parts were fairly well written and fleshed out their relationship rather well, but then even after they come to an understanding Sirius still thinks it's a great idea to spank him.

It boggles my mind, and considering how often the subject comes up during the story, it's most likely the authors kink.
