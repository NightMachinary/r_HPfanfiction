It sounds like that's the author's / reader's kink and they'll use any excuse to justify it.

I don't see the point in punishing a teenager for something he did /three/ years ago when he had no real authority figure. For most of the books Harry's only source of rules were wizarding laws and Hogwarts school rules. When he broke those, he was punished according to those rules (warning letters from the ministry, points deducted, detentions, etc). He also /knew/ he was breaking a rule, although granted, some of them were beyond his control or he was wrongly accused. He never had rules set out by a parental figure, so he can't really be held accountable for breaking arbitrary rules that he was given years after the fact. Sirius could talk to him, especially if he has concerns, but punishing him is weird.

EDITED: I also think corporal punishment is wrong, especially on older children. I can see toddlers getting the occasional swat on the bottom when they're misbehaving, but that's about it.
