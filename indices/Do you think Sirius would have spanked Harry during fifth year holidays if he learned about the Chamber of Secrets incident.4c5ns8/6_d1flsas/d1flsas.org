Sirius's family life is the sort where I would expect him to have been subjected to corporal punishment repeatedly and often, and it would only have made him more defiant. It would have made him resent his family even more. So he of all people wouldn't use it.

Punishments work best when they are closely linked to transgressions. In this case, it's three years after the fact.

Here, Sirius is essentially telling him that he was stupid or evil to trust Hagrid and for not being forthcoming toward other adults. Hagrid was the first person in Harry's memory to be kind to him, and a neglectful or abusive upbringing does not teach you to be trusting. It's worse than normal. Also, in this story, apparently the Dursleys had been physically abusive, which makes it even worse.
