Yeah...I tend to nope out of stories with corporal punishment. Completely leaving my opinions on it in real life out of the equation - in fics, it just tends to feel like the author indulging their kink, particularly when it involves spanking a character older than twelve. I don't share that kink, so it makes me uncomfortable and I leave.

What you just described reminds me of that, only this author is trying to sneak it in with a weak justification. At any rate, Sirius doesn't strike me as the spanking kind. I think, in the situation you described, if he was really that upset about it, he would make Harry promise never to do anything like that again, and then maybe ground him or something. If that. I've never thought of Sirius as the disciplinarian type.
