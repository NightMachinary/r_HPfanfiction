As others have pointed out, this seems totally out of character for Sirius. As a Hogwarts student, he routinely put himself in danger--becoming an Animagus, hanging out with a werewolf, etc. And then he left school to be in the Order, and pulled the Secret Keeper bluff so that Voldemort would come after /him/.

Honestly, I would expect Sirius to be rather proud of what Harry did. If anything, Harry is less reckless than his godfather. Consider how in OOTP Sirius has to be shouted down by Dumbledore and Harry several times with regard to his dangerous choices, like coming out to the Platform, or coming with the Order to the Ministry (though he doesn't always listen). And when Harry refuses to meet Sirius during their Hogsmeade weekend, Sirius gets mad and says that Harry is "less like his father than [Sirius] thought."

I suppose one could argue that while Sirius himself would have done the same thing as Harry in CoS, he's teaching Harry to be better than he was by spanking him. But aside from the aforementioned reckless tendencies (which indicate perhaps a blindspot where such behavior is concerned), I think that Sirius wouldn't actually see a refusal on Harry's part to put himself into danger as the right choice. Yes, Harry did make some unintelligent decisions, but the kid was twelve and not thinking straight, seeing as his best friend's sister had been taken down into the Chamber, so I don't see how spanking would actually teach him anything ("Harry, I'm spanking you because 12 year old you needs to learn to act more rationally in an incredibly emotional and stressful situation"). And Sirius is in the Order; he knows what it means to sacrifice yourself for a greater purpose. Spanking Harry would probably discourage that, which isn't something he'd want to do. Not to mention the fact that Harry managed to win in the end of CoS.

So...no. Definitely not.
