Even given that the books are about characters a decade older than me, Sirius simply doesn't seem like the type of character who would spank a kid, particularly not Harry, particularly given how shitty Harry's childhood was. Or if he did, it would be because he lost it, not because he thinks it's a reasonable punishment. Part of this is that I'd be shocked if Sirius's parents were not overly fond of corporal punishment, and Sirius very obviously strives to be completely different from his family

If you told me that Augusta Longbottom spanked (or used some magical equivalent on) Neville, I wouldn't be terribly surprised. But that's partly because acceptance of corporal punishment is extremely generational. Given that the wizarding world is slow to modernize, it is conceivable that the adults in Harry Potter would be less opposed to corporal punishment than adults of the same age in the muggle world, however, so once you get to the younger adults, it's not so obvious how they'd approach matters. But I would definitely assume the older ones would not be in the "never hits" category.
