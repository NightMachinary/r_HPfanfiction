If one believes in corporal punishment, but not in abuse, then it would follow that you would wait until you were calm to administer the punishment so you wouldn't go too far in your anger (and fear). I can see an angry dad just whaling away, but a calm one counting out 20 strokes exactly, or whatever had been decided.
