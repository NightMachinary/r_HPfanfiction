In real life I wouldn't put anything past anyone...meaning I think people are capable of doing all kinds of crazy things even if I wouldn't myself do them.

But if he did spank Harry, I would immediately think he is a creeper. For one thing, as someone else pointed out he has only known Harry for a month and Harry is 15!!

If Harry were say 2, and had been staying with Sirius this entire time then a swat for something or other would be more reasonable.

But anytime a story features a teen or pre-teen getting spanked by someone I stop reading and start wondering about the author of the story. Yuck.
