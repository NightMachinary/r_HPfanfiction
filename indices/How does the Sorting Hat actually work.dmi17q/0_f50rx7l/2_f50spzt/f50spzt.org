Yeah, I agree that it does have a form of sentience but some writers almost make it seem to be almost human, which I think goes a bit far. And that it has been enchanted by the founders (Gryffindor in particular) is obvious. My main gripe comes from how it sorts students. Does it read memories or does it just go through surface thoughts, feelings, etc? Because I can't recall any instance in canon which insinuated that the hat could actually see memories.
