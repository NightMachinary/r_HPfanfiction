It is undoubtably the case that the Sorting Hat is genuinely intelligent, as it is capable of artistic creation (the Sorting Songs) and displays a lot of personality. If you want to limit the number of magical AIs running around in your fanon universe, you /can/ cut him down to just a chatbot-like illusion, but this goes fundamentally against the grain of canon.

On the other hand, you're right that it does not seem to be all-seeing. What we see of it in canon is limited, of course, but its comments during Harry's Sorting are all about the nature of Harry's personality, not about his memories, let alone his future. It /could/ likely have a look at some of Harry's memories, but it can't just take in all of them at once within seconds, any more than a human Legimilens could.

I think the magic of the Hat is all in all very like human Legilimency, and he's no better or worse at it than the average human Legilimens, just more experienced in deducing people's personalities from a quick glance at their thought-patterns. I certainly don't think the Hat could get past decent Occlumency any better than a human Legilimens. Why would it have to? There's no such thing as an 11-year-old perfect Occlumens. Perhaps some kids with good mental training and/or soul-focused accidental magic might be able to effect crude mental defenses, and the Hat can likely get past /that/, but why would it need to be the stuff of Voldemort's nightmares?

I think the idea that the Hat /must/ be an all-powerful mind-reading device likely comes from the idea that he's an artifact of the Founders and that artifacts of the Founders /must/ be deceptively powerful by default. But A), the notion that the Founders were uniquely powerful even by modern standards is misguided, and B), the Hat /does/ have a secret Founder-given power, and it's got nothing to do with being better at Legilimency than it looks: /it can summon the Sword of Gryffindor from anywhere in the world/.
