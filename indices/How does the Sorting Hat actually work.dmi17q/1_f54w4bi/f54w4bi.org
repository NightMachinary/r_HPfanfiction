Crack plot twist, the hat has just been a normal hat all this time.

An unknown rule is that the headmaster must be skilled in legilimency and charms in order to qualify for the position. Nobody is watching the headmaster right before or during the sorting, all eyes are on the hat or the student being sorted. So the headmaster can get away with sneakily casting a few spells, reading the students minds for the sorting, then using a ventriloquism charm and some simple animation charms to make everyone think the hat is the one talking.

The hat didn't actually start giving a song before each sorting ceremony until Dumbledore became headmaster. The start of term song tradition started because Dumbledore's always liked a good musical number, helps the nervous first year students relax a bit.

"But how did the sword of Gryffindor come out of the hat when Harry was in the chamber of secrets?" Space expansion charm, it was already in the hat when Fawkes brought it to Harry. The sword wasn't actually lost lost, it was just hidden somewhere amongst the chaos of random trinkets in the headmaster's office. Dumbledore found it, put it in the hat, gave it to his firechicken, and yeeted the firechicken down the chamber entrance. Boom, magic hat gives the sword to a worthy Gryffindor.

"What about when Harry talks to the hat when Dumbledore isn't in the room?" Dumbledore has a time turner and can cast disillusionment charms strong enough to turn completely invisible.
