Three things that strike me right away.

1) New baby magic thing is invented in 85. Let's say at the earliest he has gotten all the DNA he needs from multiple sources later that year. Still it would Iikely be 86 before they are 'born'.

2) All the kids would be 1st year in 97, that year Death Eaters were in charge. Oh boy, it's like magic itself us gifting them tons of mudbloods to torture!

3) Only way to not send the kids straight into a slaughter house is to alter your timeline. Move the invention date backwards a bunch, forwards a few years, or shift the timeline that canon happens in.
