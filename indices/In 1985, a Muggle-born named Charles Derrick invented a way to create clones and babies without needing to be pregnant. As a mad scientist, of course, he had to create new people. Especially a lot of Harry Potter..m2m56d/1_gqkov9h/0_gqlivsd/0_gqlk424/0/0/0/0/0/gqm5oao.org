To clarify, at this point we are petty much discussing fandom, more specifically the more tropey stories with the whole nobility angle.

The way those tree's work on those kind of stories is /really/ inconsistent as hell, assuming that the magic on them is automatic instead of needing someone to manually add each name then it would supposedly be along the lines of the magic tracking each new person who is born from that particular bloodline (won't even try muddling through the whole family Magic's thing cause /that one/ is a contender for the top spot as the most vague plot-device /ever/) in this case it would only include people who are born from a member of the family and include /all/ of them, regardless of carrying or not the name or even considering themselves from another family. Alternatively the enchantment covers the whole planet and updates itself when someone with the blood of the family (?!?!???? Like, how would it even recognize if someone has the blood of the family unless they are birthed by someone of the family? Maybe tracking based on being related to a particular ancestor or another? It /really/ has some /serious/ plot-holes) the second one is pretty much the only way I can see Harry being added to the tree on those kinds of stories.

Regarding Voldemort it really is up to your particular head-cannon, we generally interpret it as him literally building himself a new body, hence the idea of him being technically related to Harry, but alternatively he could be borrowing/stealing the power to re-make his own original body from scratch, the bone of a parent to symbolize where he came from giving him a foundation in which to rebuild who he is, the flesh of a servant to be the tie he still has to the material plane in the form of those who still serve him willingly and also giving the filling of the body and the blood of the enemy as a reason to go back to deal with unfinished business plus being the stolen vitality which re-ignites his life-power. Bottom line is that both takes are among the many possible interpretations the ritual may have, so while Voldemort /could/ become related to Harry he also could /have not/.
