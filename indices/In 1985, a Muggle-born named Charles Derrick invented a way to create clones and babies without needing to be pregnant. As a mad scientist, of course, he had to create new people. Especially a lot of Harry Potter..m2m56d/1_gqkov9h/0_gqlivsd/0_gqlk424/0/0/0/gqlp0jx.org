Not sure? It is not explicitly stated whatever it works by tracking blood or if someone had to add to it. In FBCoG the Lestrange tree was said to do it, but since the name of Leta's brother only disappeared when she told the story I have no idea how reliable it really is. I figure that if it /did/ track down by blood it would have to be far bigger then it is shown, plus there is always the possibility that it just doesn't use the blood of the person to keep track, but the act of giving birth or fathering a child, a bit like the trace actually.
