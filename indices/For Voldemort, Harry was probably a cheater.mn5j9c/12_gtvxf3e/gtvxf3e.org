Honestly im surprised voldemort didnt cut Harry's head off in the forest then toss it at the defenders when he came to brag. Thats if you accept him being a showboat who wants to silence rumors of him being afraid of/weaker than Harry, or whatever nonsense protagonists say to bait the villian, way back when he got rezzed in 4th year. His baby wouldnt die to the killing curse, he had the protection in first year, you got the cocky "i can touch you now" phase out the way, he bullshits his way out an ambush with ghosts a rare wand effect and some quick thinking. At that point id respect him on a level where not only is he a maybe threat, but also a rat to the highest degree, which was showed in voldemorts thinking of needing the full prophecy to get answers. The whole ministry battle was a big L that im not going to touch, but now id be setting up to get PERMANENTLY get rid of him at the earliest opportunity.

Oof just got an au idea. Lemme write this down
