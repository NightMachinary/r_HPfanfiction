More like the Gumshoe of Hogwarts. He gets embroiled in basically every asinine plot to take over the school, steal precious artifacts, rig tournaments, literal invasions by terrorist armies and he almost always ends up defaulting to going up to the big bad of the day with barely any sort of plan that isn't 'fight me'.

His two friends have superpowers too (being brains and common sense) and get into their fair share of crazy situations, but in the end, he Magic Kung Fu's his way to victory while they're incapacitated or holding the line elsewhere.
