  Seven Horcruxes. No one is going to figure out you even have one. Except for your old head of house that is. And the very same lieutenant who carelessly gave it away. At least that cave is safe, what do you mean another elf took it away with OP-magic, and after serving a muggle-hating family for decades he'd spill the secret to a trio of Muggleborn, half-blood, and Muggle-loving teens?

To be honest this one's on Voldemort, he was very lackluster and melodramatic with his horcruxes, and his (and the evil pureblood supremacists' in general) tendency to underestimate small, unimportant and shabby people and creatures such as house elves is a big moral theme of the books.
