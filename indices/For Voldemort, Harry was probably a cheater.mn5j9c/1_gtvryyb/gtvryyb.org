- Your lieutenant mentions an incredibly talented half-blood in Hogwarts. Always have a spot for the smarter ones do you? Oh, he got a bad breakup from a Muggleborn he fancied? The more reason for him to dedicate for the cause. Too bad from the self-fulfilling prophecy he told you, his request for sparing the Muggleborn, and up to the very last act he did, all contributes to your downfall.

- Your lieutenant provides you his home for keeping prisoners and holding meetings. Great! They can't possibly lose wandless prisoners and failed to keep beaten-up teens from escaping. Oh, the elf who served for his family has OP-magic.

- /Seven/ Horcruxes. No one is going to figure out you even have one. Except for your old head of house that is. And the very same lieutenant who carelessly gave it away. At least that cave is safe, what do you mean /another/ elf took it away with OP-magic, and after serving a muggle-hating family for decades he'd spill the secret to a trio of Muggleborn, half-blood, and Muggle-loving teens?

- Well at least that boy is dead. Surely you can trust the wife of that lieutenant to verify that, a quick severing charm to the neck will do if he still actually survived AK all this time. Right, she lied to protect her baby boy.

Voldemort would be ruling Magical Britain if he just killed Lucius in their first meeting.
