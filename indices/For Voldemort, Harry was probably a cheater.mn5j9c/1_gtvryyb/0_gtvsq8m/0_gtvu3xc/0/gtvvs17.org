Lucius Malfoy is an Order Spy, you cannot change my mind.

- He secretly sent an artifact of the Dark Lord to Arthur Weasley because there's no WAY he would miss such an obviously dark tome.
- Sent his house elf to protect Harry with orders to paint himself as an abusive owner.
- Made it unbearably obvious to anyone who looked that the Minister was corrupt. Practically had a neon sign saying 'Remove him from office' floating over Fudges head.
- Went to jail to maintain his cover, conveniently helped destroy the prophesy so the Dark Lord couldn't hear it.
