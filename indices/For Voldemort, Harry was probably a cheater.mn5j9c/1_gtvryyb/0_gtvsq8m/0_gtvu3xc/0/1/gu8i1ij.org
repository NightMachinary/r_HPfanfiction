This is actually a premise in a fanfic I enjoyed. Really had no issue with it except towards the end when the relationship between harry and daphne got mucked up for no real reason except "angst". However, Harry Potter in the Claw of Raven, is overall a very good read if youre interested in a fanfic with your lucius is a spy premise being a key element.
