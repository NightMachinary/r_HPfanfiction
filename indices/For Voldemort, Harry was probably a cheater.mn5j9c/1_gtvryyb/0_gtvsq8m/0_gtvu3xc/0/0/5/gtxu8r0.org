Haha, cool! This sounds like an AU where Riddle didn't start a war or something. Malfoy being able to competently act alone on his own plots suggests that Riddle wasn't as active in binding the second generation of Slytherins to him. Or maybe he stopped making Horcruxe appetizers out his soul.

It kinda reminds me of the nice, happy moments I felt while watching any of the Fantastic Beasts movies, where I idly wondered about American and British magical espionage. I like that we can see how Grindelwald (and Dumbledore) reshaped the WW, that Tom Riddle continued their plot.
