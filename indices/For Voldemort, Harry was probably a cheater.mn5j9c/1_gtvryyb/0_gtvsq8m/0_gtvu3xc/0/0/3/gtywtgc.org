[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8495269/chapters/19468255][To Reach Without]] features an absolute clusterfuck of sides and conflict, where the only person on the side they claim to be on is Albus Dumbledore. Tom Riddle's scheme is to bring down purebloods supremacy using Voldemort to discredit pureblood supremacy while legislating it out of existence as Thomas Gaunt. Severus Snape is spying on the Circle of Agastya (a cabal of dark mages who hunt down dark lords) for Thomas Gaunt, spying on the Death Eaters for the Circle of Agastya, spying on Dumbledore for the Death Eaters, and spying on the Death Eaters (again) for Dumbledore. It gets complicated.
