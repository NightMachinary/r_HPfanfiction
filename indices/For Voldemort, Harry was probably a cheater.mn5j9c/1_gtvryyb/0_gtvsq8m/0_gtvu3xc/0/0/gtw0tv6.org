Now I want to read a fanfiction where

#+begin_quote
  Snape works for Dumbledore

  Malfoy and Umbridge work for Fudge and Fudge willingly portrays himself as a corrupt buffoon

  Crouch Jr. was his father's spy and was working for the DMLE

  Pettigrew worked for the Potters and is the real reason why Harry survived

  Rookwood was an unspeakable spy

  Crabbe Sr and Goyle Sr were Malfoy's spies

  Macnair and Yaxley worked for the DMLE Death Eater Task Force and even the director didn't know who they were

  Bellatrix was working with Regulus, Rabastan and Rodolphus didn't want to go against her

  Dolohov was a foreign operative from an overseas ministry who wanted to stop Death Eater recruitment on the mainland
#+end_quote

All the way down the list right up to Tom Riddle having started the Death Eaters in the first place as an ICW sting operation for surviving Grindelwald supporters
