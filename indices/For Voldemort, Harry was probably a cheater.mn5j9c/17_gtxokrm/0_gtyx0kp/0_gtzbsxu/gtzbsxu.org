But that's not what happens in HP. He wins by: 1) asspull of "mother's protection", 2) asspull of phoenix and magic sword, 3) asspull of sudden superpower plus time travel, 4) asspull of family ghosts and wand interaction... etc. He never overcomes the antagonist through superior morality or wits, but by author fiat.
