How do those points indicate that Harry has virtue or accepts death or whatever? All that they indicate is that he had dead parents, and that the author didn't have a plausible way for him to defeat someone 6 times his age and therefore had to resort to bullshit deus ex machinae that had no buildup or basis in the story. They certainly had nothing to do with Harry's innate value, character, or actions.

Keep in mind that your initial argument is "The protagonist overcomes the antagonist not through strength, but through superior morality or wits" and that has NOTHING to do with HP. He doesn't win through morality or wits; he wins because the author says so. I think the only time he wins through morality is when he's possessed by Voldemort in book 5, where his personality is what drives V out. That was the only victory that depended on the character as written rather than some extra thing the author threw in at the last minute.

Even the final deus ex machina, where Harry kills Voldemort because the Elder Wand recognizes him as master, is bullshit. Harry "won" the wand by shooting Draco in the back when Draco wasn't even wielding the wand, yet after that Voldemort flat-out KILLED Harry and yet the wand didn't change alliegance to him.
