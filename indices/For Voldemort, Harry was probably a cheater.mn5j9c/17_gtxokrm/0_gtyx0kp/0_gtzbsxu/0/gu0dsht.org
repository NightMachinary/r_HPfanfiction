While Harry Potter develops a tone oriented more towards young adults in later books, it's still a fairy tale at its core and as rudimentary as you might think the conflict may be, the moral superiority is there. Just think: Harry loves people and he is loved, while Voldemort is feared and loves himself. Harry accepts death as a natural thing and is rewarded for that, while Voldemort tries to cheat death by defying the laws of nature and is punished for that.
