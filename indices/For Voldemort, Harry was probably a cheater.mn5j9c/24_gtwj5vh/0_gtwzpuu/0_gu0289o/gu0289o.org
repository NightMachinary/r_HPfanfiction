I havent seen any where they develop hermiones character from book one and then just have her die during the raid on mysteries. Or where Harrys love interest tries to help him and it goes well for half the fic and then they die in the middle and they explore the depression he goes through while trying to push through in order to save a country from a mass murderer.
