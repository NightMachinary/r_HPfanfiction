Books 6 and 7 weren't magical. They were McGuffin hunts that dragged out endlessly. They were about things, not spells or people. That massive tonal shift ruined those books for me. They're not fun or interesting. Book 5 is kinda borderline. I really only like the ending, the last 15-20% of the book, because the rest is annoying teenage angst and whining more than anything. Books 1-4 are magical fairy tales about wizards and witches in school, but the rest are kinda trash.
