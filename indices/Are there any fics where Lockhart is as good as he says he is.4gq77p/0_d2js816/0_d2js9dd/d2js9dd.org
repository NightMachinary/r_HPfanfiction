  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.
