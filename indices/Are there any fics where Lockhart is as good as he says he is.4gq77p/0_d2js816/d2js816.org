I'd be very interested in reading one if any come up.

He hasn't done the things he claims, but Lockhart in linkffn(Harry Potter and The Prince of Slytherin) is an awesome character! Strong magically, has fascinating project groups, and involved in core plot at the current point of the story. It's ongoing, updates regularly and I think the next update (scheduled for today) should give us a better idea of what Lockhart's really up to.
