Matou Shinji series has powerful Lockhart, but his histories are partially lies, used to mask his real actions. He debuts in the second part as a new History of Magic teacher.

Linkffn(Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone)

Linkffn(Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin)

Linkffn(Matou Shinji and the Master of Death)

Linkffn(Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains)

There is also Lockhart who did exactly whst he claimed to do in linkffn(Draco Malfoy and the Practice of Rationality) which is semi-sequel to linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality)
