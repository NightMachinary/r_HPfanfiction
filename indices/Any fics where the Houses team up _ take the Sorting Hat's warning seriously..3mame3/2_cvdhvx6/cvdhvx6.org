I don't think I've ever come across a fic with these themes that isn't full of terrible writing and overused cliches, especially when Slytherin is involved. Also, stories of these type usually end up feeling too naive. Hopefully someone links a good one, though!

linkao3(D.S.S. Requirement) has students banding together, though. Also sci-fi!
