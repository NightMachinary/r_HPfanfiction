Without making specific suggestions, if you want to keep the tasks thematically consistent with those from canon, here's what I suggest:

- Give each task an elemental theme.

- Make sure you do NOT have the Champions competing directly against each other (in the sense of casting spells at each other). Rather they should each be seeking to overcome some "third party" (animate or inanimate), and the one who does it best wins.

- Make sure the task is designed such that it is essentially a problem-solving task, one which has multiple different possible solutions.

- Consider the following dichotomies: creature opponent vs obstacle, preparation vs improvisation, confrontation vs evasion, placement vs retrieval. So, canon first task is a creature-improvisation-evasion-retrieval task. Canon second task is a obstacle-preparation-confrontation-retrieval task. Create new combinations to get new tasks.

I like your "escape from a room" idea. Now change it from a boring old room to a more exciting locale with an elemental theme, and make sure you have multiple different ways for the escape to occur so each champion does it differently.

Not a fan of the dragon survival task. Firstly because it's boring, it lacks any kind of goal that requires the champions to take positive actions. Secondly because it seems easy. Without forcing the champions to take risks in order to achieve their goal, surviving against a dragon doesn't seem difficult at all for a competent wizard. Fourth year Harry would struggle but the others could just sit it out behind a well cast shield charm.
