Oh, yeah, that's a good point. Each task needs an elemental theme. That has really thrown a wrench in my plans. Having the elements could also be used as a clue as well. I like that.

The only task that would come close would be #2, which even doesn't really pit them against each other as they're the 'generals' and their job is to make their troops win the war.

Hm. Yes. That's where it gets complicated. Maybe I need to sit down and improve the solutions rather than the problems.

ooh! That is handy. I'll save that and use that.

I must admit I was watching Saw when I was debating it. :P I did plan on the rooms having plenty of escapes and for the rooms to be somewhere else, somewhere inetresting. I was gonna use the RoR for it as it'd remove any plotholes.

Neither am I. I just wanted dragons xD The task is essentially a defensive game. The thing is that they wouldn't be told what to do, just tossed into the arena and told to not harm the dragon. There would be subtle clues that clued them into survival. I do agree, however, that it is a boring task.
