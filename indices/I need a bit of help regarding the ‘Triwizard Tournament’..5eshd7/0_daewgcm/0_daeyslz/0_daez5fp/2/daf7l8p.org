I'm not the OP but here's my opinion : It's for the flow of the story. If I was writing a story totally centered on that particular year, I would surely do more than 3 tasks but while they are fun to write (and I hope, to read as well) there's still other things going on. I personally write about 30 000 words a year in my main fic so that's just not possible if I want to show good tasks.
