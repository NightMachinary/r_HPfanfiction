On the subject of elemental themes, I remember a fic pointing out that the first task was fire-and-air themed, the second was water themed, and the third earth (or, you know, wood) themed; it used this as justification for why Fluer did poorly in the second task, fire-chucking Veela don't work well in water elemental conditions.

...I wonder, why have just 3 tasks? I know there's 3 competitors usually, so it's a tri-tri...But why not make it 9 tasks in groups of three (a triple triad, counting the competitors), or maybe evoke the 12 labors of Heracles?

...Perhaps not that last one. Those labors can be summed up as kill-the-unkillable, catch-the-uncatchable, ^{row} ^{row} ^{fight} ^{the} ^{power} and in the last few a fair bit of divine sabotage.
