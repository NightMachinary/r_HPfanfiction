  ...I wonder, why have just 3 tasks? I know there's 3 competitors usually, so it's a tri-tri...But why not make it 9 tasks in groups of three (a triple triad, counting the competitors), or maybe evoke the 12 labors of Heracles?

I think the individual tasks should be of great significance. Maybe you could do multiple smaller tasks back to back in a single day, but I doubt you could have 9 large events on different days with press attending etc.
