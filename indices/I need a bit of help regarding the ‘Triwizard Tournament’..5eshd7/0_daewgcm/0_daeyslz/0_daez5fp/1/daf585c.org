  ...I wonder, why have just 3 tasks? I know there's 3 competitors usually, so it's a tri-tri...But why not make it 9 tasks in groups of three (a triple triad, counting the competitors), or maybe evoke the 12 labors of Heracles?

Because 3 is a number with significance for wizards, and 9 not particularly.

That said, you could really make it have any number of tasks that works for you.
