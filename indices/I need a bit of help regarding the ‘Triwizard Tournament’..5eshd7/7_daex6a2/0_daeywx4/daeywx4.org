The issue is I didn't want to write more than 5 tasks. Other things are going on such as chess tournaments, Quidditch games, dueling tournaments, and other such things. The students won't be bored. :)

The task is rather simple, but complex depending on everything. The joy of it is what goes on once it has started. Whether the champion puts them in small forces or goes for a blitz strategy is up to them. How Hogwarts will handle having 2 people to choose from is up to them.

Anyone who entered their name has to participate. You have to be fifteen or older to add your name, hence fifth-year and above.
