A lot of those people will be a bit peeved that they weren't chosen. Not all of them will be willing to support a different champion. They'll be a little peeved if they suddenly have to obey orders from someone they saw as competition. They won't work with the champion as well as they might, and that's just the baseline. Some will actively dislike the champion and want them to lose.

This effect is somewhat, but only somewhat, mitigated if you announce this event before people are allowed to enter.

You still haven't resolved how to distribute students between Cedric and Harry.

What happens if five people enter from Durmstrang and thirty enter from Beaubatons?
