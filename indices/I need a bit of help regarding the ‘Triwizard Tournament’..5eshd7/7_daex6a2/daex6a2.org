  I want to have 3 or 4 tasks

By canon, you have hundreds of students imported from across the continent, staying at Hogwarts for eight months, to put their names into a cup, dance, and watch one lucky person from their school do tricks for three hours. This does not make sense.

The school standings are determined solely by the champions. This does not make sense.

The solution to the first part is to have more events. The solution to the second part is to have events that are not about the champions.

Debates, a dueling tournament, artistic demonstrations, crafting competitions, all with varying degrees of formality. Multiple social events -- Beaubatons and Durmstrang both providing food for their schools' feasts, and perhaps dances using their styles and their music.

Different, I'd say. Canon tasks had some problems, and they've been done a lot.

  Each champion will be given control over the fifth, sixth, and seventh-year students and to prepare them for a schoolwide battle.

With just the champions, things are easy. Champions each choosing one companion, that's also easy. Using small teams is harder, and using the entire school is just asking for trouble.

How do you determine who competes? Are people forcibly drafted using the Goblet's magic? What if you don't want to compete, or you're sick that day? How do you make fair teams? What happens if someone's upset with the champion and decides to backstab them? How do you divide the Hogwarts students between Harry and Cedric? How would the Goblet handle it if someone (not a champion) cheated during the event?

You might want this sort of trouble for your story, or you might think it worthwhile, but it's a load of work regardless.
