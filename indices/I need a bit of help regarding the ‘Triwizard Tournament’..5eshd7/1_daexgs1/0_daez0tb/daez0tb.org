Oh, God, I can hardly decipher riddles let alone create them. :p Mythology is something I lack in. :( Time to do some studying.

I must admit that it was a quick idea draft and I was going to add it to something else, but dragons are frightening and I was certain that it would shatter the champions' confidence by facing a dragon -- you're right, though.

The task is meant to test how the champion reacts under pressure, can recruit and handle a bunch of troops that can turn their back on you at any given moment. I like the tournament to be about the schools, not the individual person. It's kinda why I chose to have a battle as a second task.

The point of the puzzle rooms was to be a more confined version of the maze. Each room would have a trap or two, a riddle to solve, or a brute force method. Depending on how you solved the room you could be teleported to another room or onto the podium.

I dislike the maze as it's impossible to watch and I want each task to have spectators.
