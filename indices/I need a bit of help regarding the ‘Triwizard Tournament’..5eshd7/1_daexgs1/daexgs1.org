I've always thought the Tasks were twists on old fairytales and legends, or at least inspired by them: battling a dragon, retrieving a 'treasure' from a dangerous and unknown 'land', and navigating a labyrinth filled with dangers (including a sphinx, who poses riddles!). If you want inspiration, perhaps look at other myths and legends such as the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labours_of_Hercules][labours of Hercules]].

The changes you've made to the first task don't really add anything, and actually seem to reduce the conflict - instead of actively trying to steal the egg, Harry now has to avoid a dragon for ten minutes. There's no point changing little things for the sake of it - if you want it to be different, make a new challenge entirely.

Your second task as it's structured right now doesn't fit the spirit of the tournament imo - the tasks are meant to test the individual intelligence, resourcefulness, and magical skill. The idea does have potential though - perhaps instead of students, each champion is given command of a legion of transfigured soldiers, like McGonagall's chess pieces. You can tweak the rules to make it interesting - champions can modify their soldiers, eliminate each other by capturing an competitor's base, etc.

The third task is again an extension of the labyrinth as a series of escape rooms. I suppose you could make the 'puzzle' in each room interesting, but that could be done in the maze challenge as well, and this seems a little anticlimactic compared to the maze. It could fit as an alternate first or second task though.

Some other ideas for tasks:

- All four champions are dropped deep inside the Forbidden Forest with only their wands, and must navigate back to Hogwarts. They're free to work together, or got their separate ways.
- Champions have to scale (on foot) one of the mountains of the Scottish Highlands to retrieve a clue for the next task on the summit. The mountain is inhabited by all manner of dangerous magical creatures like roosting dragons, and takes more than a day to climb.
