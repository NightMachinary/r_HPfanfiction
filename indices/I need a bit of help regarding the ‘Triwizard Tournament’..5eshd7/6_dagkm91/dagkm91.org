Idea I just had: since it's Hogwarts hosting it, do four tasks and have each task represent one of the founders' values. The "steal an egg from a nesting mother dragon" canon task is a great example of Gryffindor courage. Finding a way to survive in a lake long enough to rescue someone would invoke the intelligence Ravenclaw valued. For Hufflepuff, maybe something that's a lot easier on the champions if they work together? I have no idea how to represent Slytherin best through a task though.
