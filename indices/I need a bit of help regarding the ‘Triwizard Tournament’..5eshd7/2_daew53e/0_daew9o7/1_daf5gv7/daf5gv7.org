If you have no idea how to change them to keep them in spirit, then keep them the same and simply fade to black and have the characters talk about it later. Ambiguity is your friend; if you give them just enough details and no more, many of your readers will come up with the tasks that were interesting on their own.

That said, I think only part of the problem comes from the fact that so many people wrote about the very same tasks. I think that at least a part of it comes from people forcing themselves to write the tasks as if they all had to be narrated second-by-second when they themselves don't know what exactly they want to do with that stuff.

So the question you should be asking yourself is: Do you know what you want to do with this stuff? Or do you just want to get through it for the sake of having it?
