Here's my contribution:

Set up the triwizard tournament as a test of wit, power and imagination.

The canon setup for the first task is sufficient, but you can have the competitors focus on defeating the dragon not with spells, but with smarts-i.e. they are graded on how cleverly they handle the dragon rather than by just getting past it. Hence wit-getting past the dragon is not important per se. How you trick it into allowing you to get past is far more important.

The second task would be one of power. What counts here is the spells being used and how they are used. Given the rather nebulous way in which power is defined in canon and your own setup with how power is defined/handled in the fic, it can be literally anything-a straight up magical duel being the most basic idea while an obstacle course would be the less obvious route.

Imagination, though, that's going to be the main event. How the competitors use a limited set of spells to overcome a challenge will be the focus here. A good fit for that one would be simple-given a week or more to prepare, the contestants have to navigate through an urban area and find the Cup before the others do. They can bring whatever tools they can make in that time, but are limited in the spells they can cast to get themselves from point A to point B. Using any other spells would lead to immediate disqualification. That the competitors end up fighting each other is expected, of course, but if they do fight each other, they are forbidden from doing so with a wand.

There, premise set-enough leeway to play around with, different enough to be interesting and a nice sandbox to use to showcase the wildly different ways in which the various contestants will approach battling a dragon, getting across dangerous terrain and hunting for the Cup in a completely alien environment.
