If Voldemort is still trying to interfere, you could rework the tasks so that each one has a (different) trap for Harry that would take him to the Little Hangledon graveyard, rather than that only happening in the last task. It would require him having more followers at the Ministry who are able to influence the details of the tasks, but it could be both a good justification for the changes and a starting point for designing the tasks.
