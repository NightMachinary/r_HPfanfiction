I have to say, one of the greatest parts of Barefoot was the character building regarding Dumbledore and Harry. Their relationship is impossible to describe properly as terms like 'friends' or 'companions' and the like seem so fragile and even weak. The best term I can think of off the top of my head would be 'platonic intimacy'. I feel like you've written their relationship so well, which is not something I can say about many fanfics, though that is not particularly surprising considering how well you have woven the intricate pieces of this story into a beautiful tapestry.

I hope you are doing well and will continue to do so, and I hope you don't give up writing altogether.

I also hope that in the future, be it in 3 years, or in 10, that I receive an email telling me that barefoot has updated once more, even if it is only to say that it will be no longer be continued.

I wish you the best,

farewell.
