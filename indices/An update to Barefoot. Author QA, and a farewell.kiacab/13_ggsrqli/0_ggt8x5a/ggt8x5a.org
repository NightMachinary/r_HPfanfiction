This is such an overwhelming praise, thank you so much.

I love having Dumbledore in my stories, and i like to see the protagonists interact with him on a human level rather than him being 'the light leader' or whatever, something i imagine wouldn't be too common in his life. I'm so proud of how Harry and Dumbledore so naturally connected when i was writing it in the early days, so the foreboding future they could see together along with the solemn comfort they took in each other's company. Really means a lot to me to have the high points recieved so well!
