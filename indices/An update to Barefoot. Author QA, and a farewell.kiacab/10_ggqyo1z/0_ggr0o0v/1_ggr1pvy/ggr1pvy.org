You know, I love your story. It would sadden me to see it abandoned. Altough there are some concepts that I don't really understand... Such as Hedwig suddenly becoming a person thanks to pixie magic. The parts I've enjoyed the most is when Harry had to solve mysteries for Dumbledore/the ministry.

And btw, I support the relationship between Harry and Tonks. Whereas he's quite young, he does have an especial gift that makes him know a lot more than any 14-year-old. He doesn't speak as a 14yo boy and act as a 14yo, I'd say.
