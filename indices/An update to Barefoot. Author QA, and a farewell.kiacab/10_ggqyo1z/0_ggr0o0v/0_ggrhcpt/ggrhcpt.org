I do wish you hadn't put "Farewell" in this post's title in that case --- and been clearer on this point in the /Author's Note/. It's been a bit of a roller-coaster going through both, trying to figure out if we were on "indefinite hiatus" or "goodbye for good".

Nevertheless, yours is a decision I respect (I did, after all, make the same one, although for slightly different reasons), and while I will always be looking forward to the day this story updates again, I am also eager to see what fresh new places your now-liberated imagination will take you!
