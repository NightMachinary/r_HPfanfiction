You were amazing. Truly. I will try to say that to you with my broken english as much as possible. Barefoot was one of those fics that kept calling to you "read me, again,again" and I listened. For the last few years, I've re-read this story from the begining almost everytime you post a new update, everytime I feel down, sometimes when I'm high and just wanna have some fun I read barefoot. It distracted me from my live everytime I need a distraction and I thank you for it. Your ideas were really original, you were building a awesome world. I posted this on ff, now I'm saying it again, no story is perfect but barefoot very close to it. Tonks stuff didnt really bothered me much yeah Harry is a child and there is a big age gap but you didn't really wrote harry as a child, you wrote him as a cranky and quirky old man and I've always seen him as one. I'm definetly against pedos but what is age but age of your body and your life experiences. Harry had the life experience of many, and this made him old in my eyes. Still, I wish you waited a few more years before starting that relationship. And talking of quirky old man, I loved his relationship with Albus, his friendship and communication was very well-written. So I'm saying this, even if other people and you critize this work of art, It will always have a special place in my heart and my fav stories. I understand your feelings, and I hope this break makes you feel much better about yourself and your writing. Even if you stop writing barefoot, I hope you keep on writing other stories because I really think you have an amazing talent. Thanks again for this great experience. And thank you for reading this letter to you that is written with a broken english but it's the least you can do considering I've read thousands of your writings, again and again :D Cheers
