in part i blame that most of the fan base was very young when this series came out. I was on older side reading the books to my cousin i was helping with. So, now 20 years later we are all very different people.

Its not like say a horror movie which attracts a certain Niche, but rather was read by a whole generation who all pictured it their way. Add in alot the fanfic was to start written by young people with low life experiences, or without the emotional knowledge to understand how horrible a person snape really wa s just because of "always"

Now we are all a varied lot who have very huge life differnces, and few this series very differently.

never mind JKR basically shitting on her own canon ( IE. I have no issue with a Black hermione, but in the books they talk about her skin being white in a few places.) and now shes all for it. her her dropping dumbkedore is gay after the books for basically publicatiy, now the whole " sat on nagini for 20 yrs"

we dont even have a stable basis of stuff.

another great issue is How the new series while i love it, is just magically superior in ways. lol
