1. don't always like 1st person , but i enjoyed yours
2. it can happen to all of us. about rushing
3. no one will like every choice you made. Ive written under a few pen names both T and M, and all the stories got praise and hate.
4. the tonks thing? You realized there are ppl who ship him with Snape, Voldermort, heck Molly, and His own mom. I forgot how old you had him in the story, but this is No worse or better than hundreds of people dreaming of other ships with older people and (keeping it clean) with fade to black or writing it.
