Can you open it up to other authors to take over please (I have my fingers crossed for a third person but you have really made it work well, potentially the pony first person I've enjoyed, and that incudes me judging it against published fiction) like a prompt and maybe when one or two have made a bit of progress you do one more chapter update linking us to them all so we're aware.

While I understand people issue with tonks you put more the tenderness of a friendship side of a relationship rather than pedophilic detail for which stories have been kicked off of FF before (and I would have reported it for this) as it is the honks was the reason I got into the story as way back then had been reading a few of them.

I can't remember the Hedwig thing but surely it can easily be retconned.

The scope of the story has definitely grown in the past few chapters
