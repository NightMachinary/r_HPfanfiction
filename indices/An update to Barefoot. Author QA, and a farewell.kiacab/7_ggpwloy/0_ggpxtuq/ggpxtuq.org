I have been contacted a few times by people asking to translate the story, or write in the same setting over the years, and i think a few of those projects have gotten well established.

I may make a list of usernames and stories to check out if anyone wants to play off the idea of Barefoot! I've always loved the PMs i get from other FFN users talking about things that Harry could do, or the things they would do if they wrote it. I always encourage creativity, no matter the inspiraton!

I'm not sure if i'm the right person to try and spin it as a third person telling, it's just not my writing style, but i'd love to see somebody take a swing at it from another character's perspective/third person!
