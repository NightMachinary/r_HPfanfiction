You may not see this, as it is a little late, but this is my all-time favorite HP fanfic (The second being a Black Comedy of course.). You understand moderation while also giving us a taste of what Telemetry can do for someone. I was initially confused by Tonks and Hedwig dynamic but I grew to understand and enjoy it. This story is a work of art, I really love the ideas that you have put into it. I have read it many times, every month or so, returning to start at the beginning because I couldnt remember which chapter was the last I had seen. Every time it was just as interesting to read as the first. I understand the abhorrence that an author can hold for his work, but understand that this is a fantastic way to use the universe and lore of Harry Potter while also creating new lore of your own.
