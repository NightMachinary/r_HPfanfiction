Your fic had a unique idea that you executed and mapped fairly well in my opinion. I certainly hope that one day you return to this story but even if you don't you can count me as one of your fans on whom you left a deep impact.

I read Harry Potter when I was a wee child and, looking back, one wonders of the alternative reality in which one didn't didn't read it. But then I am left pondering in fear that if I didn't have Harry Potter as my fictitious friend, who would I have left indeed. I could wax on but I will stop here and say this. Being a member of this expansive fandom has had both, incredible highs and unimaginable lows. You can rest assured that this story was indubitably one of the highs. Farewell and good luck with your life.
