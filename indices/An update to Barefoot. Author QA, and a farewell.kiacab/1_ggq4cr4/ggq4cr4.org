I think taking a step back is a good thing, but maybe not for the reason you think. You have taken the words of readers who didn't enjoy your story for legitimate reasons, but also haters and flamers to heart, and they've hurt you with their criticisms, justified or not. It hurts to read what you wrote in your author's notes because I've felt similarly although, my fics have never met anything close to your level of success.

Writing is about your world that your mind imagined. I followed your fic and read every chapter. You had some fantastic ideas and the writing in the first person thing never bothered me. Not every book is the same, yet i see fanfiction favouring certain styles. Don't worry about that. Sure, I didn't really need the hedwig or tonks aspects, but this is YOUR story. One that garners as much success as barefoot is always going to attract jealousy and entitlement from others. Those who get mad about small mistakes or unusual/unpopular decisions.

So I agree. Take a break, take a step back, and remind yourself that you own Barefoot. You created this beast of a fic. Some people don't like it, others love it, others just follow along. I appreciate your work, your efforts to making Barefoot what it is: ultimately, a cool story with a very cool premise that is executed in a very cool way. And it's fanfiction, but with a proper AU vibe about it. I loved the exploration of Azkaban, nothing has felt quite like it. I'm sure that beside the criticism that seems overwhelming, you have received very good and enthusiastic reviews. But they don't have quite the same impact, I know.

Maybe focus on writing for yourself a little bit, just when you feel like it. Either don't post at all, or maybe with a different account so that you can be a bit anonymous again. You have talent, you can craft interesting worlds and legends within legends. Maybe some short fics to get your own groove back.

Don't let entitled douchebags and trolls get you down. Take the well-written, constructive criticism, have a look and see if you agree with it. Those parts you agree with, incorporate into your new writing if you want. Or don't, because this is fanfiction, and you have ultimate control over what happens in your story and how it is written. Hang in there! You are not a bad writer for using first person or making miracles happen with Hedwig. I bet you had fun writing it, and that's what really matters.
