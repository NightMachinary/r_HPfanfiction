I just wanted to tell you that I have enjoyed your story very much. I love the "learning by touching" twist that makes your story so different. You manage to create a lot of history/magic to fit in your story and it is not that common in fanfiction. You had amazing ideas (the floo in the last chapter is a good example)

Don't let the critics getting you down. Your story has flaws but hey! it IS a fanfiction not a published book that has been re-read countless times AFTER being finished. And really, I just don't get the "first person POV" problem. It is only a problem in badly written stories.

Anyway, take care and thanks for sharing your work ! (and I do hope you will eventually feel like finishing this story)
