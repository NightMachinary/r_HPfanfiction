Let me just tell you, i didn't intend to reply to this post, i actually closed Reddit right after reading it, not because of anything against you or the fic, but because at the moment I'm going into a deep depressive state and am in no state to give justice to what you fic has done for me.

I fully intend to come back and write to you in details what i thought about it, mayne after my hands stop shaking and i havr to correct every word I'm writing.

Just know that every time you posted an update, i would go back and reread barefoot, and on those days when i just want to feel better i read it again, it had the sort of effect on me where i simply imagine what it would be like to hold a violin and be able to see all of it's history, to see the struggles and blood and tears that went into mastering it.

I have always had a very deep imagination, and there are always those fics that make me live the scene, where i am so immersed that i just stop reading and drop into that world and live it myself.

As a writer myself i completely understand the feeling where you feel your work isntup to your standards I have the same thing, even when I'm being sowrn to it's perfect, i still find fsults in it

Just knoe that whenever you do decide to come back, if you do come back, you'll have a definite reader ready to tackle it once more.

Sorry for the strange reply here I'll do better when I'm better
