Thank you for your continued support!

The inital name for the story was actually posted as "Copycat" due to the ease of learning from other wands.

I think Blindness had just been published at the time, and i thought it was a fascinating idea with the magic-sense i think was in that story. I didn't want to just spin another take on being blind, so i thought "What other senses can i use?" and just landed on this idea.

An early comment also recommended the Jeff Goldblum film "Vibes" to me, and that resonated with me very well!
