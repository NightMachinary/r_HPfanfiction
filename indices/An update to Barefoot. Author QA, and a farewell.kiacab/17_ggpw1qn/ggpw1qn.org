I've honestly never read your story but i have seen it pop up everywhere when I'm looking around. I'm thinking about finally reading it this weekend and will post a honest review on it. Some may hate parts and love others but you still took the image in your mind and crafted it for others to read -even if they hate parts of it in the end. A good story will never have all positive reviews and if it does then some of the readers are lying.

Cant wait to read you story.
