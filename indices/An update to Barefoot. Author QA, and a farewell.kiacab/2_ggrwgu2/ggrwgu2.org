Hey just wanted to let you know I loved barefoot. Loved the characters, writing style, the concept and the UNIQUENESS (Hedwig being a person, the feeling the history of objects thing, ...). This was definetly a 1% kind of fic. Not amongst the best out there but definetly close. You deserve credit if only for daring to do things differently.

At the end of the day it's your story and intellectual creation. It's entirely up to you whether you want to continue this or not but don't let yourself be dragged down by negative comments. There might be some legitimate constructive criticism in some of them but I assure you most can be categorized by two groups:

- young teens who only read Harem fics where Harry has 6 lordships and everyone is bashed.

And

- DLP 'professional' critics who like to shit on other people's works all the time whilst having usernames like: Lord Hadrian Peverell.

P.S. so even if it means little, I personally really enjoyed your writing and my day in turn was made better by it.
