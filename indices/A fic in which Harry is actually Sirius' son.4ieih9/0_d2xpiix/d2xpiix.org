It's almost played this way in linkffn(Rise of the Wizards by Teufel1987): [[/spoiler][Sirius gets about one minute of screen time, just long enough to explain how he went through the Veil and ended up back in time, where he impregnated Harry's maternal grandmother in a one-night stand. Combined with a blood adoption ritual thingee Harry had done at Hogwarts, this is sufficient for him to become Sirius's son, triggering the obligatory marriage contract with the elder Greengrass daughter.]]

Kinsfire also has a crazy-assed story where Harry dies and goes to Hell, finds it better than living with the Dursleys, and gets booted out. He gets taken to Heaven where he meets up with his family and learns that [[/spoiler][his mother was the Marauder bicycle, routinely having foursome sex with all of the Marauders (less Peter--poor guy never gets any nookie). Apparently, she wasn't sure until Harry was born just whose child he was. I also seem to remember skimming ahead and seeing Harry getting it on with his mother at some point]] but then I quit reading.

edit: added the second story.
