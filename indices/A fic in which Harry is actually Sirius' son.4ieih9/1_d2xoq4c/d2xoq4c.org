huh, the only father Sirius I can think of is "The BlackHeir" by FirePhoenix8

there's a good one where he's the fake dad in both "Harry Potter and Morrighan's Gift" by Athey and "Necessary Gift: a Harry Potter Story" by cosette-aimee.

and also it's not Sirius but an excellent Regulus as Harry's father is "Death of Today" by Epic Solemnity
