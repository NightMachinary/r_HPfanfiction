I completely take back what I said below. It is absolutely very promising. It's written in several parts with three posted and the fourth presumably the last as yet unwritten, though the author is active. And those three parts are like holyfuckingshit good. Harry's quite OP but it totally works in context. Definitely worth the read at slightly less than 94k words.
