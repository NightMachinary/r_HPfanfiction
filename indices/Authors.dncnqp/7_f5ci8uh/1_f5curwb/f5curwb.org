I have two longer fics as well, one just shy ^{of} ^{^{100k}} ^{^{^{words...}}}

Oh who am I kidding, the cracky premises done somewhat seriously in under 10k are my trademark thing. And it's not helping that I have a lot of WiP oneshots which will be finished eventually simply because I write them when I'm annoyed at the way a fic (or canon) handles something.
