Going by your flair, you are the author of Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting and Departure from the Diary, right?

If you are then, I just wanted to let you know that you're one of those writers that I drop whatever I am doing to read your work. You honestly got me into Harry and fem-voldemort fanfics because I just enjoyed the dynamic of the two from Departure from the Diary.
