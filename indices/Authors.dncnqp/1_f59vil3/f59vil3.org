For me, there are a few authors whose fics I've enjoyed so much that I would now read anything by them, even if the story is in a fandom I care nothing about or revolves arround tropes that are normally not to my taste. I trust them to take any premise imaginable and turn it into a good story.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/The_Carnivorous_Muffin/series][The Carnivorous Muffin]] is the best example for me since she has written so many crazy crossovers. In my experience, regardless of how absurd the summaries look at first glance, her fics always turn out to be stellar. Her SI fics are the only SI fics I've enjoyed reading, because she always deconstructs the usual tropes ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15499401/chapters/35981172][example]]), and she even manages to make something great out of a [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20331721/chapters/48207466][Harry Potter/Little Mermaid crossover]].

In other fandoms, there are a few authors for whom I would read anything they write and know it's going to be excellent without even glancing at the summary. [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Shadowlurker13/pseuds/Shadowlurker13][Shadowlurker13]] is one of those for her unusual /Labyrinth/ fanfics, including a surprisingly excellent [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11120619/][Chronicles of Amber/Labyrinth]] crossover. (I haven't even read any of the /Chronicles of Amber/ novels, but I still loved the fic.) Another of my favorite authors is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4078374/ninepen][ninepen]], because she has written so many excellent Loki focused fics in the Avengers fandom. In particular, her main fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8293519/1/Beneath][Beneath]], is a behemoth clocking in at over 1.5 million words long and still nowhere close to completion. The author stretches the idea of "slow burn" to previously unseen lengths, but the fic still managed to hold my fascination even when entire chapters focus on conversations between characters with moments of action spaced few and far between.
