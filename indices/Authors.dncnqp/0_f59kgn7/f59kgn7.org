There are two kinds of authors that I take notice of:

- Authors who consistently have story premises that are memorable, executed with engaging characters and writing style, and ultimately deliver on the idea they promised. The first author that comes to mind is [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/esama/pseuds/esama][esama]]. When I see HP crossover works by them, I don't hesitate or skip over as I usually would.

- Authors who consistently finish stories. They may not have story premises that are memorable and draw me in, but the writing and characterization is competent, but follow a complete arc/plotline, even if I don't like the subject matter. The first author that comes to mind for this one is [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Lomonaaeren/pseuds/Lomonaaeren][Lomonaaeren.]]. Some interesting stories, and also some explicit porny stuff that I'm not interested in.
