I know anything by Ebenbild will have an interesting premise and a fairly executed plot.

Ebenbild might have a quite a bit of bashing in her longer stories but the one shots she make are very good. I think she is very marvelous because she manages to always capture a real feeling of mystery in her works

You might not like her longer stories but her short stories are definetly awesome!
