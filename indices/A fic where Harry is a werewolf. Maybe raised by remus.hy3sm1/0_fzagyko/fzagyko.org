The Beast Within: linkffn(9527368)

Voldemort took Fenrir Greyback with him when he attacked the Potters. Greyback did what Greyback does - as a result, the best option for raising Harry is Remus Lupin, who homeschools him until he's 13. One of the few I could find that have Harry as a normal werewolf.

Weres Harry: linkffn(8106168)

Harry gets bitten as a kid, and the werewolf curse interacts with the Horcrux - the Horcrux is destroyed in the process, and the end result is more of a magical-creature-Animagus than a werewolf.
