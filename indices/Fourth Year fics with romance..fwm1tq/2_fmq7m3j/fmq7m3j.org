I don't know how you'd rate the quality of writing, but His Angel by durararaaa (I think I spelled that right?) is a Fleur-Harry romance fic that's about as cheesy as you get. Same with Harry Potter and the Other Champion by Fongstar. Cheesy, romancy, and pleasant both of them. I think His Angel would probably count as bashing to most people's definition (it is relative, and surprisingly so) - mostly toward Ron and Hermione, but a little towards Dumbledore (the latter is resolved really nicely, IMHO, and the former is unsatisfying, but that unsatisfaction is very thematic to the fic and kinda fits). There's also The Lie I've Lived, which is another Harry-Fleur fic and is a bit more crudely roguish, but the romance is still pleasant (and probably regarded as the highest writing quality of the three by this fandom, so I suspect it'd appeal).
