Maybe he intended to once he actually killed Harry and took over (as opposed to leaving things to his minions while he went of doing other shit). Of course, there's also the issue that by that time everyone was too shit scared to use his name, so insisting on King Voldemort would have been no good anyway.

(Also, maybe it's just because we're not used to it, but "King Voldemort" doesn't have the same ring to it as Lord.)
