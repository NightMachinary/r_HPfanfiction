  Neither of them are a thing, which is what makes Harry Potter magic so great. The only limitations are your own talent, will and knowledge. There is no mana-pool that limits you, no natural power level you're born with and no anime-esque magic power you can train up like a muscle by constant use. Its all mental, all in the mind (and the wrist...). The only exhaustion you can suffer is mental, the only pool you can run dry on is your knowledge.

I can appreciate a good manna system, but I have to admit you have a very good point here. I'm not sure what other fantasy series have a system like Potter's. Even Dresden appears to have some sort of manna/power limits.
