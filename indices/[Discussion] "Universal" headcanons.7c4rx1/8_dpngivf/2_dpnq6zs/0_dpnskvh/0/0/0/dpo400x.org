  “Dumbledore chuckled. “Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake. I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it.”

  “But then ---?”

  “I do not think you will count, Harry: You are underage and unqualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine.”

It sounds power-levelly on the surface, but Dumbledore also says "unqualified". It could be that when mentions "the amount of magical power", what he means is the combination of knowledge, understanding of magical concepts, and mastery of spells that Voldemort's enchantment is somehow able to measure.

I don't like age as a deciding factor because we see plenty incompetent adult wizards in canon that Harry could take with one hand tied behind his back.
