I seem to see the concepts of magical cores and magical exhaustion a ton in fanfiction. To be honest, magical exhaustion, but not magical cores, seem pretty logical and not /too/ much like headcanons to me; I thought it just meant that the characters were getting tired, which happens after any action.
