That's exactly what t1mepiece meant, I think :) That in canon, a lot of Slyhterins aren't purebloods, but in a lot of fanfics it's almost obligatory to be pureblooded to become a snake. I see a lot of Slyhterins in fics being against half-blood Slytherins, but in canon it's mostly Draco hating on muggleborns.
