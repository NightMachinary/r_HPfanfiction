I think that if tempus did exist in canon people would not wear watches. Watches are going out of style today (except as jewelry) because of cell phones. Just like wands for wizards and witches, cell phones are something we always have with us that can tell the time. Arguably, it's simpler to just glance at your wrist than pull your phone out of your purse or pocket, turn on the screen and look for the numbers there, but because we always have phones with us anyway no one wants to strap on an extra device to do the same thing our phone can do.
