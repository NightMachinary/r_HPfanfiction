Ran a +quick+ search for watches.

Students definitely have watches.

Definitely wristwatches: Harry-as-Goyle's is explicitly so. Montague has a watch strap. Pansy's is on her wrist.

Definitely pocket watches: Dumbledore, Fudge, Arthur, Wizard-Who-Is-Not-Basil, Daedalus.

Honorable Mentions: Harry's Third Watch, which was previously Fabian's, that I cannot tell if it's either a wrist or a pocket watch.

/Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone/

- Dumbledore, Dudley, and Ron.

/Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets/

- Arthur, Ron, Harry-as-Goyle, and Harry-as-Goyle again.

/Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban/

- Vernon, Hermione, Ron, Hermione again, Ron again, Harry, Fudge, Dumbledore, Hermione again, Harry again, Hermione, Hermione, and Hermione again. Time travel will do that to you, I guess?

/Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire/

- Harry, Arthur, again, still, Wizard-Who-Is-Not-Basil, Ron, Random-Students-Waiting-For-The-Goblet, Harry, again, again, again, again, /again/, Pansy, Harry's-watch-doesn't-work-anymore, Harry-Checking-Ron's-Watch, and Hermione.

/Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix/ or, /Harry Potter and the New Watch/

- Lupin, Arthur, Hermione, Tonks, Ron, Harry, Hermione again, Harry again, Angelina, Montague, Ron again, Fred, and Dumbledore.

/Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince/

- Molly, again, Harry, Ron's-Coming-Of-Age-Watch-That-He-Believes-Is-A-Year-Early?-I'm-So-Confused, and Harry.

/Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows/

- Daedalus, Ginny, Harry's-Third-Watch, Ron, Hermione, Harry, again, again, again, again, Yaxley, and Harry's-but-17-years-later-and-it's-still-his-third-watch.
