Source for Homenum Revelio? The only time it was cast and the effects were stated, nothing was visible.^{[1]} By WoG,^{[2]} Dumbledore used it to see under the cloak, and in Hagrid's hut no one noticed anything odd.

That definitely eliminates an illusion, but not a hallucination. I think it can only be solved by headcanon at this point.
