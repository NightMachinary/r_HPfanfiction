Tempus isn't directly contradicted, but it's a spell that's wildly different from any we see. It's usually a holographic display of time. I don't think we've seen either a spell to create an illusion or one that gathers information.

As for the warming charm, every single Hogwarts student we see is bundled up in clothes and flames are used to generate heat. That pretty much makes it an unknown charm, if it exists at all.

The Beauxbatons students were visibly cold, and the Durmstrang students were in furs, as well.
