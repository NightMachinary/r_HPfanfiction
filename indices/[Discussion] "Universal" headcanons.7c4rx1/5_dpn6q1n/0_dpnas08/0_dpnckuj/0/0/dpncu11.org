Dumbledore, and Hermione both use this spell in canon. If you want to call it a warming charm that's fine. The point I was trying to make is that this canon spell has little resemblance to the warming charms constantly seen in fanfiction. These spells are also contradictory to what we see in canon, which is people bundling up or carrying around flames in a jar in order to keep warm.
