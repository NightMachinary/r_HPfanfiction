My headcanon is that the protections the trio used during their camping trip were temporary, and that a more permanent version requires some kind of an anchor, like the blood protections being tied to Petunia living in 4 Privet Drive.

Many wizards we see in the books tend to be absent-minded and not very conscientious. If they could permanently ward off an area with a casual sweep of their wand, I doubt many of them would bother to take the protections down once they were no longer needed. So over millennia, Britain would be absolutely filled with these little hidden pockets of space.
