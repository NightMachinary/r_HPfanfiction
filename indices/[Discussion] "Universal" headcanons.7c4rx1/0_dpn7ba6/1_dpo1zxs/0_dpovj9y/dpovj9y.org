In my mind, it's doable, but very difficult, especially when trying to affect something outside of yourself. The material of what you're trying to manipulate comes in as well. For example, gold is very stable element-wise, so it's resistant to magical manipulation and extra hard when trying to affect it wandlessly. I imagine most witches and wizards they have perfectly fine wands, so why bother?

Also, WRT wandless magic, I can see Harry having a special interest in it since his parents were caught flat-footed without theirs. If James could have done a wandless Shield Charm, things would have been very different!
