That wands are actually necessary. I mean, it is sort of JK's fault, since she teased the casual use of wandless spells in the early books before dropping it and splurging all of that worldbuilding cash on wandlore in DH.

Then we come to find out that European wizards are just stupid or something, because their African and Native American counterparts are Cursing people's jaws off barehanded. So I guess this is more "book canon cum plothole" than anything else.
