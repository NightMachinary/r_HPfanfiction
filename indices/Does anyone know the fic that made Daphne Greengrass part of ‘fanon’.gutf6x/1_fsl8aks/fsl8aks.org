The oldest Fanfic that labels Daphne as a character on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] is A Line In The Sand - linkffn(2700237).

Funny enough I was wondering about this earlier today. I wonder she popped up randomly in a bigger fic and someone was like "You know what I like that character, time to write fanfiction." Too much to filter through to try to figure out where she came from sadly. Just that she's here to stay, maybe.
