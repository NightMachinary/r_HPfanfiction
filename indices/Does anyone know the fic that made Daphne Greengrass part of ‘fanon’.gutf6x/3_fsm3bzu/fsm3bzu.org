[[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=2&r=10&c1=5549&s=2&p=62][Here]] is a sorted list of complete fics on ff dot net with Daphne in them according time. Just work up from the bottom of the list. There are a few small fics, but there are a couple of fics a little up that are actually successful. One is a Dramione fic in Spanish, the second, Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts is one of the most successful DG fics ever, so I suspect that fic is the one that really popularised Daphne.

I was not reading fic from the beginning so have no idea if there are fics on other sites from earlier that are comparatively successful
