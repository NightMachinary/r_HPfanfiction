Another note, do you want us submitting here or with the sidebar link? And is it possible to see what others have recommended in the google doc?

As for my recommendation, I'd like to submit a couple runic magic stories. I'm always fascinated by how different authors portray the completely unknown subject of Ancient Runes.

  Following his fifth year, Harry finds himself depressed in self-induced guilt over Sirius' death, subconsciously altering the wards surrounding Privet Drive, forcing Dumbledore to move him to Headquarters. Acting upon a hunch, Dumbledore sends Hermione to be with Harry to help him get over his grief... and discover a magic long forgotten: a unique runic system to cast spells. H/HG.\\

This was just updated after more than a year, and the author has committed to finishing it.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.\\

This is the first Runes!Harry I ever read and it is incredibly interesting and well written. I'm surprised that Tigerman hasn't been in a suggestion thread before.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.\\

Most everyone here knows this story. it's use of runes is incredibly unique, and I love the ideas for the Triwizard Tournament. It's incomplete, though, and according to the author, he might start it up again but much like the "Lone Traveler" stories, it's designed such that it won't really ever have an end.

If I remember correctly, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] by jbern also has some good rune stuff in it, but it's been far too long since I read it.

There are probably many more I'm completely missing, but that's probably good enough for now. I would like to see some other authors make it at least on the suggestion list (even if I can't choose a single favorite) such as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/769110/chem-prof][chem prof]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1228238/DisobedienceWriter][DisobedienceWriter]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1013852/GenkaiFan][GankaiFan]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1251524/kb0][kb0]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4036441/Silently-Watches][Silently Watches]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2936579/sprinter1988][Sprinter1988]].
