I loved Stay Standing. I really liked the way the author portrayed Ron, but I also liked how some of the other characters were written, especially George and Harry. It's not perfect--sometimes the author used the wrong words in a way that almost made me think they were dictating to write it, and a few parts toward the end were a little unclear, but I think it's worth overlooking those things and staying with it. I recommend it as well.
