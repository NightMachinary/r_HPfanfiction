Canon doesn't really go into details about the goblins, here's pretty much everything we know about them:

- While visiting Gringott (as a client), all the Goblins Harry met were perfectly polite, though in a "customer service" manner. We don't know if Goblins act the same between them or if they "put a show" for their Wizard customers.
- Griphook, the only Goblin Harry met outside of Gringott is bitter and distrustful toward wizards. But we don't know if he always felt like this or if this is a new sentiment after his treatment at Malfoy Manor (though the discussion he had with Dean Thomas, Ted Tonk and another wizard seem to indicate he always felt some kind of disdain).
- We also don't know if Griphook sentiment is only his, or if it is shared by the Goblin race as a whole. But the impressive number of Goblin rebellions in Magical History seem to indicate that, at least until recently, he was far from alone.
- In Goblin Culture, at item belongs to his maker who only "lease" it to his customers. Because of this, "Goblin made heilooms" are a touchy subject for them, and they feel like wizard are stealing for them when they don't bring an item back after the death of his bearer.
- Even after working with Gringott for years, and being pretty "close" to some Goblin, Bill Weasley is not sure if he could even call them friend. So we can deduce that, no matter how close a wizard and a goblin will be, they will be come kind of distant because of their races and their shared history.

So yes, "Goblin culture" (outside of Goblin made items ownership) is a pure fanon concept. It became a fanfiction trope because people saw this in a story, liked it and decided to use it in their own story. It's not impossible that HPMoR created this trope, but the "culprit" may also be an older fic that we don't know about.
