I think that they are not I'll mannered but there is bitterness in them, especially towards humans. For, firstly they are firstly a warrior race. The wizards and witches forced them to settle down and act in contrast to their true nature.

Secondly, from their view point the Humans are half breeds or half bloods. I mean humans can be both magical as well as non magical. However, a goblin is always non magical.

Thirdly, they are a proud race. However, the way they are treated is something to despise. An average pureblood wizard always treats a goblin as inferior. (Yes, even an average wizard, like a shop owner in diagon alley. However, it isn't that obvious because this superiority is mainly due to common stereotypes and prejudices)

Fourtly, there have been numerous goblin wars. I mean, look at Binns. He taught them Goblin wars for 5 years!! Remember that all he does is drone on about the topic and doesn't care for the students. So the amount of topics he must cover, if anybody cares, is massively more than a normal teacher. And one can believe that these wars were due to goblins who revolted as wizards already had them in their control.

Fifth, they were not allowed magic. They can of course perform magic, but they are not allowed wands. Remember how difficult it is to do wand less magic, and even if goblin magic is different, it would still be impossible for a goblin to do everyday things using it. For example, look at Dumbledore. Although he can use wand less magic, he still prefers using a wand to it. (PS., wand less magic is seriously underhyped in Fanfiction)

However, with all these above points, we must remember that goblins aren't angels with crooked teeth. They are sneaky and are always looking for a way to gain something. If Wizards were to follow someone unfamiliar to the wizarding world, like Hermione, then that ofcourse would be disastrous because Hermione would do her best to make every race feel equal, which would seriously instabilize Wizarding Britain.
