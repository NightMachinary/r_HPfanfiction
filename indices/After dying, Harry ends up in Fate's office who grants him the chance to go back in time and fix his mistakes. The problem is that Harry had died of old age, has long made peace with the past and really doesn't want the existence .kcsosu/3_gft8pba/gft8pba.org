I read something like that. Harry dies without any big regrets at the ripe age of 90 and wakes up as 11. He is not sure if it's just an imagination of his dying brain or some fate thing and rather angry about it. All the children are younger than his great grandchildren and he does not befriend them. There is a more interesting fight with Quirrell. I have forgotten the name of the fic but I believe it was abandoned
