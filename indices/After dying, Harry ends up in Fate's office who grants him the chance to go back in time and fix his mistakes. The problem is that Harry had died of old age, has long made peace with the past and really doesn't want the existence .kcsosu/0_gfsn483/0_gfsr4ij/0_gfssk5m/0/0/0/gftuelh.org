I had thought of a fanfic once where a bunch of the characters from the sorting of 1991 (plus Ginny and Luna) travel back in time.

However, all of the POVs (Dumbledore, Percy Weasley, Sally-Anne Perks would have been the main three with some others) would be from the non-time travelers who are getting consistently wigged out by these creepy children who try and fail to act like children.

One of the things I thought about was that none of the returnees would feel comfortable dating 11 year old children but some of them returnees were married/dating and continue to be so...but outsiders like Percy Weasley feel insanely creeped out that his younger brother and a muggleborn witch are dating already.

But yeah, I always feel weird about people in time traveling bodies dating kids. It's icky.
