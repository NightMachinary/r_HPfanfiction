This could be written as a really dark and interesting fic.

Fate would ignore Harry's please and send him back to his 11 year old self no matter what arguments he makes, plunging Harry into a powerful mix of panic and depression. He quickly decides to actually do everything exactly the same way so that he eventually lives his way back to where it was, but fails almost immediately. No matter how much he tries, even if he says the exact same things verbatim, he can't emulate the exact same context and emotions as originally, and the butterfly effect escalates rapidly. He realizes his original family and interactions will never return, plunging him deeper into desperation.

It could also explore the mental effects of having an old and jaded adult in a child's body. Even if he did want this, I still imagine being extremely frustrating, doubly so for someone like Harry that would turn everything in a moral dilemma. If the journey was forced on him, this whole thing must be downright horrible.
