It could also alternatively have a result similar to the way Tom choose to take power in linkffn([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16329614]]) -I highly recommend it, it was absolutely brilliant and hilarious- meaning that, while Harry wouldn't do something so OOC as siding with Voldemort or anything of the like, he would do his damm best to make sure to get the exact opposite results as the list given to him.

The reaper wants him to get together with Hermione? Well it is not like he /wants/ to jump on the bones of an 11 YO child when he died of old-age, so no biggie sidestepping /that/; the reaper wants him to disregard his old friends in exchange for ones who would /'help'/ him on his assigned goals? Than he makes sure to never let anyone he befriends help with the things the reaper asked (can't see him trying to befriend someone based on anything other than the person's own personality even if it is out of spite); the reaper wants him to oppose Dumbledore? His old headmaster is the most knowledgeable wizard he knows, is old without ambitions to immortality and has a lot more of resources and skills at his disposal than Harry could reasonably attain, going to him with the information earlier so they can try to figure out ways of dealing with the “Voldemort issue” without him dying (putting Quirrelmort in a permanent coma?) is really a no brainer; the reaper wants the unifying of the magical/non-magical world or whatever political goals are generally found in this types of stories but that Harry never gave a hint of caring about in cannon? Then doing the complete opposite in separating even more the worlds should be relatively easy and leave him with enough time for something he actually enjoys.

And last but not least, he has to get his own philosopher's stone or some other path to immortality to make sure there is no going back again and ‘fixing-it' after his death.
