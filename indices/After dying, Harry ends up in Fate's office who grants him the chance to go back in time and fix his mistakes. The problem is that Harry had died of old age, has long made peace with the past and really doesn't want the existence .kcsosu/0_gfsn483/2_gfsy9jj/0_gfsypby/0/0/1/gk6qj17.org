Alternatively, the shit Harry got into gave him a very screwed up perception of what constitutes as ‘dangerous' and an intrinsic disregard for what the ministry says helped by the fact that /he/ is one of those responsible for setting up and execute it's politics and thus knows exactly just how much is swept under the hug or just outright disregarded. All the while Ginny (who became more cautiously after the diary in her first year -hence the distrust towards the potion book in HBP- and then became one of the responsible for ensuring the safety of the younger students in Hogwarts during the war) took up this side of parenting since she is far more overprotective, but also being unable to filter all of Harry's ‘brilliant' ideas since she is busy most of the type with her career.

The end result is situations like her coming back home to find out that Harry stole a dragon's egg to let their children see it's birth and potentially even raise it while it's mother is drugged to the grills and back in their backyard ‘cause little Al (not even Hogwarts age!) saw a wizard flying dragons in a cartoon and thought it looked cool. She naturally starts screaming and tearing her hairs out while a serene Harry is looking slightly confused while trying to understand what is wrong with the new family's pet, Ginny surely wouldn't be so insensitive as to suggest an owl after what happened with poor Hedwig.

I imagine that this Harry going back in time would probably result in Norbert growing up in Hogwarts raised in secret with the help of the students, Acromantulas becoming normal pets (to Ron's horror), advanced and dangerous magic being taught to anyone who asks and the chamber of secrets becoming a club house /with the basilisk still inside/.
