You forget though Ron only said that because Hermione had spend weeks at that point being completely obnoxious and nosy.

Harry wouldn't be able to stand either of them to be honest. lets say its old man harry who lived 100 plus years. he would have been friends with both ron and hermione for close to a century.

he would find it impossible to spend time with their childhood versions. they would be lesser versions of the friends he knows.

Honestly this would be a nightmare scenario.
