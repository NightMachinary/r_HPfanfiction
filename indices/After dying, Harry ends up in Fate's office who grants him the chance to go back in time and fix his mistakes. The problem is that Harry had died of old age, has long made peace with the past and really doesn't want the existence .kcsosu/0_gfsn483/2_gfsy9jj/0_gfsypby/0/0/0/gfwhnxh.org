I honestly like the idea of great grandpa harry no longer doing that.

He called out his kids out on doing stupid and dangerous stuff, but then his kids basically pointed to all the shit he did and what they are doing is a million times safer.

so grandpa harry just encourages them to have fun and be cautious while doing so to avoid injury
