I believe that too, but even a fun adult sees dangers where kids don't see them. And I totally believe that Harry was "the fun grandpa" but there are things you do as an adult that you don't do as a kid.

For example: Do you really see Harry letting Ron getting away with how he treated Hermione in the first month of Hogwarts? Or Hermione being an insensible prat to Ron in POA when he loses his pet? And that's not even the dangerous things, thats only them being kids.

Now to the dangerous things: Only because they had insane luck the first time around, I don't see Harry risking his friends with stupid stunts a second time - especially when he already knows what lies ahead of them. And Harry knows they survived mostly through luck - I mean, they are all very talented kids, but in the end they are just kids and survived situation most adults wouldn't.
