This is more or less Remus Lupin's dilemma in "The Bureaucratic Error" by Iniga on ffn.

At the time of his death in Deathly Hollows he begs for some more time so that he can fix his mistakes. He gets send back in time to the beginning of PoA. Now he needs to avoid the desaster in the Shrieking Shack, get Sirius freed, prevent Harry from getting kidnapped during the Triwizard Championship and get Tonks to fall in love with him so that he can get Teddy back.
