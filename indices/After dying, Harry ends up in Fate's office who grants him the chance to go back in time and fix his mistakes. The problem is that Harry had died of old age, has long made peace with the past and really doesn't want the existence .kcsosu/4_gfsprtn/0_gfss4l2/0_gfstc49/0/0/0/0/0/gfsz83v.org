Yeah.

Harry more or less manages to repeat everything with some deaths changed due to the chaos of war (Fred doesn't die, but McGonagall does, for eg.). He even repeats the conception days of his children.

Still, his children are a bit different.

James is not a prankster but looks up to Percy. Albus isn't gay. Lily is somehow a squib.

He still loves them because they are his children, after all.

And then he dies and meets Fate once more.
