Very true, but if I were writing a 'lifetime groundhog day' (ie. Meet and chat with Fate, then go back and wake-up in the past on 'day one', live 'til you die, then get to see Fate and then wake up on 'day one' again), I'd probably write more snippets or highlights of the lives rather than a full day-by-day. Plus, time-skips. Have a new run begin with something like "He'd tried this. Again and again and /again/."

Plenty of options. :)

Give in to the inevitable. He's going up against 'Fate', a literal God-like being. No matter what he chooses to do, if he doesn't do what it wants, it'll just reset him again. He basically can't win. Whether it takes ten resets or a million, eventually he'll get bored and be disinterested in the endless repetition, then he'll stop believing he can do anything and will just give up and do what it wants. It's just Human nature and the nature of causality. If you're starting with the same 'prologue' and the same 'finale', then eventually you'll get bored of repetition and you'll start to wonder 'what if I did it different'?
