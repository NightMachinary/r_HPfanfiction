The problem is that Teddy gets written off as well if Harry is sent back before his birth.

Remus and Tonks met in the Order of the Phoenix so to not butterfly their meeting away, Harry can't preemptively destroy Voldemort and his Horcruxes (if Voldemort doesn't return, the Order of the Phoenix will not reconvene).

Also, it is likely that Tonks and Remus' whirlwind marriage happened due to the threat of the upcoming war against Voldemort. If there is no upcoming war, Teddy's birth might get butterflied away...
