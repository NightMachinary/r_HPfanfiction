My main gripe with time travel fics is the lack of consequences, stakes, and the existential anguishes that the mere concept implies. Really think about what it would be like to be an adult stuck as a child. It would be fucking weird, hellish, boring, awkward. Social interaction would be practically impossible. And yet very little of the fics are about time travel and the experience of such. it's all a rushed over reason for the author to dismantle every bit of plot or conflict in the canon to write self indulgent boring changes. I like your prompt because it has an actual reason for existing. Most time travel fics cannot justify their premise, and would probably be more readable as normal AU's.

Time travel is a moral, philisophical, existential, scientific paradox and question. It should not be used as a throw away plot device. (I actually like it in POA, even if it seems out of place in the series as a whole, because it works well as a powerful metaphor that is thematic to the core of the book when Harry saves himself from the dementors.I cry everytime I read that part._)
