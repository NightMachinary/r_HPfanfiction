"doesn't want" is a hell of an understatement. If that was you, you'd develop a permanent seething hatred against the "powers that be".

I would like this time-traveller Harry develop contempt for the world he's thrown back into. Maybe just be inconsolable and kill himself on Day One, and either fate will throw him back to his timeline to die /properly/, or he'll just die hoping that this was all a cruel joke and his family still exist /somewhere/.

Imagine the case where Harry has died dozens of times. Is reborn dozens of times. Has no control over his destiny and no control over his rebirthing powers. Just stuck in an endless Groundhog Day/Groundhog Life.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] is a decent story that explores this concept. A bit cracky, and if I remember correctly it's a slash male/male romance.

Funny thing: there's a cool incremental game called [[https://mogron.itch.io/groundhog-life][Groundhog Life]] that I've played before. Pretty cool.
