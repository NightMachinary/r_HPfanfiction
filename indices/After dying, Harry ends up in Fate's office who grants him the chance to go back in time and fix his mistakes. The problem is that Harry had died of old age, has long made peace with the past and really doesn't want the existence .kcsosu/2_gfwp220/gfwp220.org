This prompt absolutely gripped me, for some reason, and I started writing and started drinking and... well here you go.

Harry reflected, and decided he had not lived his best life, but he had lived a /good/ life, if one could call it that. He was certainly far more privileged than many, and if he could go back and change things, well, they'd be mostly the little errors that ate away at him; relationships he had failed to keep up with, words said in anger, those sorts of things. There were certainly things he /wished/ had been different, but he had no idea how he could have fixed those things.

Sometimes, broken things can't be fixed. Sometimes, when you're destined to kill Dark Lords of magic, accomplishing anything else is a bonus.

--------------

He was most proud of James, Al, and Lils, as they managed to become somewhat extra-ordinary sorcerers given the circumstances of their upbringing. Dad being famous was often the subject of wonder, outrage, frustration, fear, remorse, and bullying at different stages of their lives: both for the children and parents.

Harry was proud of Teddy Lupin, too, who grew up in as difficult a situation as any of his kids and still managed to do the right thing.

Harry and Ginny's nightmares never really went away, and their method of coping with the emotional scars of war involved a dangerous combination of doubling down on their respective careers (Harry as an Auror, Ginevra as a Seeker for the Harpies), self-medicated alcohol and potion abuse, uproarious, passionate arguments, and uproarious, passionate make-up sessions (of which both Albus and Lilly were the result). Harry and Ginny's marriage became further strained as both their jobs sent them home injured more often than either would like, and the subject always came down to what was best for the kids.

In the end, Harry caved first.

--------------

The Auror life was not the life for Harry. Post-war Britain was a mess of sorting out skirmishing former Death Eaters, the Death Eater aligned and sympathetic, those claiming to be under the Imperius (and of course, many of them /had/ been under the influence of the Unforgivable), copy-cats, and the general mayhem of reconstructing a collapsed government.

Harry slowly grew to resent bureaucracy in all its forms. Hundreds-year old laws prevented him from doing his job, or let known, dangerous criminals walk free; or else let him and his "colleagues" do unspeakable things in the line of duty. Harry never wanted an innocent man like his godfather (well, /mostly/ innocent) to be punished for a crime he didn't commit, but there had to be a happy middle-ground between the chaos of a government with no teeth implementing Rule of Law, and the authoritarian grip of Law and Order, yet, it seemed like the new Ministry -- mostly Moderates, as the influential extremes on both sides of the political spectrum were either dead, in prison, or under investigation -- oscillated between the two extremes. It was unbelievably frustrating, and Harry had a bad habit of either bottling all this up, or else taking his work home with him.

The fact that the Ministry /still/ used Dementors upset Harry to no end.

Ron confided that he and Hermione had similar issues, what with Ron riding Harry's coattails in the Auror department (but still far more competent than the vast majority of the staff; it was just that Ron and Harry worked best together) and Hermione quickly rising in the administration on her own, of course, but Ron and Hermione weren't nearly as combustible as Harry and Ginny.

They'd both been personally possessed by Voldemort, in one way or another, after all.

The arguments always started and ended differently, but Voldemort needled his way in each and every one, like an annoying tune stuck in your head.

"Did you go to St. Mungo's?" She'd ask.

"I'm fine," he'd reply.

And then it would start.

"You're a reckless mess, Harry Potter. What would we do if something happened? Do you even think of what might happen to your children?"

"They're yours, too, or did you forget that /I also played Quidditch/ and know what a broken collarbone looks like."

"It's entirely different, and you know that!"

"I'm not risking my life for /sport/, I gave that up!"

"Just like you gave up so many other things, so you could chase evil and be a hero?!"

"YES! But I never asked for it."

"You aren't always the victim, Harry, even when you think you're being a hero!"

"I've been the bloody victim since before I was two years old!"

There was only so much the /Muffliato/ spell could conceal, and inevitably one of the kids would start crying, and either Harry, or Ginny, or both, would go to the Firewhiskey while the other, or both, tried to put the kids to bed and make up.

It was a disastrous time.

"I'm done," Harry said, one day. He was only thirty and retiring from the Aurors.

"With what?" Ginny asked, shakily.

"The Aurors. The Ministry. I'm not involved any more. I put in my notice. It all just... conjures up too much."

Ginny knew how much Harry couldn't help "helping," so she was sympathetic.

Teddy was starting Hogwarts soon, and James a year after. Life at home wasn't good, so Harry had to fix that. It's what Harry did. Fix things. Bugger the rest of the Wizarding World, Harry would focus on his own.

Life was good for a while, but the nightmares persisted.

Harry was in his mid-thirties, supposedly the prime of his life, as a wizard, but he felt much older. The stress of a rebuilding magical Britain, raising a family, and hunting Dark wizards, after fighting a war as a teenager just took its toll. All of his kids, and his godson, were in Hogwarts, and while they required intermittent catastrophe-level parenting intervention, they were physically away for so much of the year that Harry grew practically bored most of the time.

He helped Ginny with her flying and acted as an unaccredited consultant for the Harpies, did various social works, traveled, and mostly acted as a stay-at-home-dad and part-time-former-hero.

Then the Goblins rebelled.
