   :END:
The post-war economy was in shambles, due in tiny part to a trio robbing a Gringotts vault and escaping on a dragon just before the war's end. The Goblins took that as an act of aggression, and it took a lot of capital to appease them, which Harry had, in part, personally donated on the condition they were subject to the Creature Cruelty laws that the rest of Britain had to follow.

It seemed almost whimsical in remembrance, until you were much older and facing down a horde of armed goblins and their king deep underground.

Harry had went back to the Aurors as a third-party consultant. Ron hadn't necessarily suffered in Harry's absence, he was still a bloody good cop, but he didn't get the recognition he deserved and should have been at least two ranks above his current. Harry's assessment of the department, recruits, and senior staff was wanting as he was brought on for emergency purposes.

Too much politics and not enough getting the bloody job done.

The Goblins held a lot of Wizarding debt. Turns out that wars and deaths cost a lot of money, especially when pureblood families get involved. The escape from the vault over a decade prior caused a cascading effect where the Goblins couldn't secure funds as effectively on the international market, or match the Galleon to the Geobukseon to the Vasa and whatnot (why the Wizarding world traded in /ships/ always confounded Harry until he learned of a convention in the early 12th century that standardized such things) while the muggle market skyrocketed in value, just tipped things over the edge. Suddenly, muggles and muggle-borns were financially empowered outside the Wizarding World, and even some old families were trying to secure financial assistance in the muggle world.

In the end, the wizards were weak because they were struggling to rebuild, and they were using borrowed money to do so, and pretend Dark Lords and Dark Ladies were running amok around Europe as the Great and Powerful Harry Potter seemed to be no longer persecuting them.

It was a total system collapse of Goblins seizing vaults in order to secure gold for loans the Ministry was making in their reconstruction efforts and reparation and a host of other social experiments designed to prevent another Voldemort from happening, but when people couldn't withdraw gold, the economy ground to a halt, wizards rioted, and people died.

Harry was to meet the goblins alone, it was the only way they would negotiate. Harry agreed, and Ginny was pissed.

Harry received a litany of texts, notes, and suggestions from Hermione on how to deal with the situation. He met with Ragnok the Greedy (Thirtieth of His Name) in the chambers deep below the bedrock.

--------------

"We ask for an arbiter and they send a thief," spat the king in Gobbledegook.

"You think so lowly of wizard-kind that they wouldn't think their arbiter knows the language?"

"Do my insults cut, oh /mighty/ Harry Potter?"

"Your actions do."

The king and Harry insulted each other with an audience of goblins before finally getting to the crux of the negotiates.

"Wands and liberties as citizens Britain."

"Out of the question. Our proposal is sensible: you will be solvent again within 20 years and making far better interest than now if the post-war reconstruction goes as planned. You'd have stakes in nearly every venture."

"You mean if there isn't another Dark Lord to trash the place," the king retorted. "You speak in terms of generations. Do the wizards not bother to know the lifespan of a goblin?"

Harry thought about it, and realized he didn't know. A shorter lifespan might explain why they rebelled every few centuries as the younger generations forgot the lessons learned by the older. Harry shrugged.

"If we are at in impasse, then I'm afraid there is no choice. You can not win a war."

"But we can bloody your noses, starting with Harry Potter."

The Elder Wand was a terrifying thing in battle. Spells flew at mere thought, sometimes, and almost everything combat related was easier. It was the perfect duelist's wand.

It was also perfect for slaughter.

Ragnok died with a sputter and the goblins came down on Harry, and he repelled them with wave after wave of surging elemental spellcraft. Some of them might have died, but Harry wasn't really trying to kill them, just send them off until they got tired.

There were just so many.

Eventually, Harry decided the goblins had had enough and apparated back to the surface, where a standoff between wizards and goblins broke into all-out battle. Harry diffused the situation by rounding up the goblins and levitating them back inside the bank. Harry breached the walls of Gringotts, dozens of alarms and traps screaming and blazing uselessly at him. He tore through the stone and granite and bedrock and sent any goblin he encountered down into the deep chasm.

With a /Sonorous/ and the potion that let Harry speak Gobbledegook, he sent the goblins a bellious, echoing warning: "To your next leader! You CAN NOT fight us. You can not even defeat ME! So give up! Take the deal! We'll both be rich in the end. Or Die. The choice is yours."

"Mate," Ron looked shaken when Harry returned to the group of wizards on the surface. Harry was still bristling with energy, and everyone kept their distance from him. "That was bloody terrifying. We've been partners since we were kids, I've never seen you do anything like that."

"Yeah, I guess I got a little carried away." Harry glanced at the wand in his hand.

Hermione was disturbed but grateful the situation was diffused without any more unnecessary bloodshed.

Ginny and Harry argued again.

Or maybe they'd been having the same argument since they were 17.

--------------

It wasn't long after the goblin incident that the ICW started calling Harry again, about this or that Dark Sorcerer, or some potential breach of the Statute, or some brewing rebellion, but Harry refused the calls as politely as possible. Harry was pushing 40, now, and felt it.

Teddy Lupin graduated Hogwarts, and the Tonks' hosted a big party.

Teddy was going into the Auror corps, taking after his godfather, which left Harry feeling pride and indignation.

"Maybe you should reconsider teaching, Harry." Hermione was always offering /good/ advice, it just wasn't always the advice Harry wanted to hear. Hermione was /finally/ making her play for Minister of Magic, and hopefully some good changes would come of it in the Wizengamot. Harry's seat had been acquiesced to Andromeda Tonks for twenty years, and Harry had no plans of taking up his spot, butting heads against bureaucracy.

The 'Golden Trio' might have been more effective at changing the Wizarding World if they were working together, but Harry's heart and soul were not in it.

He sipped his drink in contemplation as the kids played games outside. The Weasley clan had ballooned even more as Bill and Fleur, George and Katie added their own red-heads to the mix. Charlie Weasley seemed content as a bachelor and expert animal handler. Ron and Hermione had Rose after some time, and she was a turbulent ball of curly-red hair and curiosity at the party.

Maybe he should go back to Hogwarts? His own kids would be graduating soon, so there wouldn't be that awkward situation of your dad also being your professor, but Harry didn't know.

"Every time I go back there, it's like I'm seventeen again. I'm pulled back. I see their faces, Hermione. All the dead. Not even in my nightmares."

"Harry James Potter, you would happily face a demon if it threatened your family or friends, but when are you going to face the demons that threaten /you/?"

"There's something missing in me, 'Mione. A part of me died that day, a part of my soul is missing and I can't piece it back together. I just go in circles in my own head. A lot of the time I just don't really care about anything. Sometimes I think I'm better off dead, that I should have just taken that train and everything would have worked out for the better."

"Harry, you have Ginny and the kids. They exist because of you. We /all/ exist because of you. You made the choice to save us, and it was the right one."

"Right," Harry said. "But I can't save myself, Hermione."

Fireworks started as Teddy zipped through the air on his Nimbus, laughing. Harry met his eyes and couldn't help but be reminded of the dead Remus Lupin.
