Harry did go back to Hogwarts. He taught DADA, of course, and took up filling the role Hooch left behind when she retired.

"Can't rightfully keep the rascals in line at my age, not with this damnable curse, anyway. You'll do great, Potter."

Hooch had a permanent limp and was missing an eye as a result of the Battle of Hogwarts. The scars of the war were visible everywhere, even if Harry's no longer was.

Lilly was seventeen and very mature for having her dad in her NEWT defense course, and Harry was a fair teacher. He thought he wore both hats well, and tried to give her as much freedom as possible (there were SO many boys to keep up with, it was exhausting).

Things got easier from there, as the children took up jobs in their various fields. James worked at Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes for a while after graduating, Albus was a potions genius and earned himself an apprenticeship, and Lilly was fast becoming an expert curse-breaker under the tutelage of Bill and a woman named Rakepick.

Life became an easy routine for a few years, but the notes Harry received from various ICW agents were getting more and more dire. The Statute was practically falling apart as muggle technology advanced faster than the wizards could keep up with ways to confound it, and Dark Lords were popping up everywhere as a result of the "muggle question." Muggles were also apparently destroying the planet by polluting it and wizards wanted to stop them. It was a mess.

They practically begged Harry to come back and fulfill Albus Dumbledore's role as Supreme Mugwump.

Harry wanted to ignore it all and live his life in peace, watching his children grow old and maybe have children of their own.

Then Ginny got injured.

--------------

When Harry got the call from St. Mungo's and rushed to find Ginny paralyzed from a training incident, the arguments and drinking and terrible nightmares started again.

Ginny was a witch, so a broken spine wouldn't keep her from walking again, but it did bring an end to her quidditch career. Harry felt valid in his accusations bordering on "I told you so!" and "What were you thinking, testing an experimental broom!"

"The kids are grown up now, Harry!"

"They still bloody well need their mum!"

It all came to a head when Harry mentioned something about Ginny's parents, and Ginny made a comment about Harry's parents. Everything came crashing down.

Harry grabbed the Firewhiskey and apparated outside of Hogwarts. He trounced around the forest for awhile, wondering what he was doing there, then saw the Headmaster's grave by the lake, and felt the weight in his pocket.

The Elder Wand refused to be bound in a sling, yet jumped into Harry's hand as fast as any quick-draw sling whenever he mentally called for it. He rarely used it these days, and he hadn't noticed it in his heavy coat pocket until sighting Dumbledore's grave. Like the Hallow had called /him/. He drew the wand and cast a quick spell, turning his meandering to purpose.

The Stone was vaguely where he'd left it all those years ago. Forgotten for so long, buried by dirt and dust and time, waiting for someone to pick it up and accept their own death.

Harry reached for it and felt the connection again.

"Potter," said the ghost in a high pitch, cool and controlled. It was Tom Riddle, and it was an ugly baby-thing, and it was Voldemort.

"Just checking," Harry mused. The ghost of Voldemort shifted between its various forms, seemingly between various times in its life. Harry wondered if it was because of the Horcruxes.

Ogden's Finest burned as Harry took a sip, but he was a long way from being drunk enough to deal with this.

"Yes, Potter, I am truly dead. Do you have any other obvious observations you wish to expound upon, or is your curiosity as dull as your wit?"

"What is it like?" Harry found himself blurting out without thinking.

"Death? What a stupid question. It is nothing and everything. It is being everywhere and nowhere. It is seeing everything whilst blind. Death is the opposite of Life. Satisfied?"

"Are you proud of what you did? Satisfied that you brought so much pain and misery that it will take generations to undo it?" The bottle was getting lighter in Harry's hand, and his head was getting heavier.

"Proud? Come now, Harry, surely you've had enough of me in you that you can ask a question like a proper Slytherin rather than the dull dolt of a Gryffindor." Harry didn't know how to respond to that, as Voldemort shifted between Tom Riddle and his elder, snake-like self, but Voldemort continued: "Ask like a Lion and I shall answer as one. I had my reasons. You see them even now, don't you? The world is a broken mess. The Ministry is next to useless. The muggles take over the planet like a plague in a Petri dish. Power is the only thing people respect, and progress requires strength and decisions only few are capable of making. I was capable and tried my best."

Harry thought about that for a long moment. The ghost of Voldemort seemed content to just hover and observe as Harry grew more inebriated. Maybe he should summon another bottle? Harry shook his head to clear his thoughts.

"You failed miserably, though. If anything, things are worse."

The ghost shrugged: "I was distracted. Splitting one's soul can do that. I also never really got the chance."

"What?"

"Don't be an idiot, Potter. You're powerful and can change the world, even now. Our origins are not so different, are they? Neither of us were ever really given a choice."

"You had plenty of opportunities to change! You didn't have to open the Chamber, you didn't have to make your first Horcrux, you didn't have to start a war! You didn't have to kill my parents and make me your /SEVENTH/ Horcrux! I was just a baby when Fate fell on me!"

Voldemort shifted to Tom. "I was dutifully invested in magical learning, Harry Potter. I was an academic prodigy as much as you were a quidditch one. I didn't shy away from the so called Dark Magic, as ridiculous as that moniker is, because I was invested in learning all of it. I discovered the Chamber over the summer after my first year at Hogwarts. It provided me a place to hide instead of returning to the orphanage, or something worse. The basilisk was one of my few friends. Myrtle was not supposed to die, and I had already completed the ritual for the Horcrux beforehand, so I might as well use it. As much as we think we are in control of everything, Fate has a cruel way of reminding us that our destiny is not entirely within our own control."

"But you said it yourself, you were a prodigy! You could have gone to the ministry and made the changes, even while being an evil git. You didn't have to start a war!"

"Tell me, Harry, how much success has Granger had?"

"She's busy cleaning up your mess."

"And I would have been busy battling the idealistic Dumbledores of the world in the wake of Grindelwald's war. Besides," The ghost shifted again, "I never had the opportunity. Slughorn, ironically, made it impossible."

"Slughorn? You were his favorite student!"

"Were," Voldemort practically growled. "You saw the memories. Ask yourself, O Brave Lion, why would Slughorn give up everything to go into hiding after my fall? Hmm?"

Harry thought about it. It was perplexing, he had to admit. Then the answer hit him like the Knight Bus.

"He blocked you?" The ghost nodded.

"He pulled out every stop, every favor, every connection. I couldn't get a job as a rat catcher for the Ministry if I wanted to."

"You know," Harry said after a long moment, "Dumbledore was right about one thing. You /were/ defeated by the Power of Love, as ridiculous as that sounds."

"Prey tell, Harry Potter."

"Maybe your Fate would have been different if you had just recognized that people mattered a little bit more. Maybe you could have actually accomplished something other than the scars and curses and broken relationships you left in your wake."

"Are we quite done with your little therapy session, Potter? It is getting cold, after all."

"I'm not cold."

"That would be the whiskey."

It was cold, Harry realized, and Voldemort faded away. "Until next time, Potter..." said the wind.

Harry basked in the cold for a while, in the middle of the Forbidden Forest, emptying the bottle down his throat. He needed to decide something. He felt it, the crossroads of decisions. He thought about his children, Ginny, and Teddy. His friends and family. The reports about muggles and climate change and dark forces brewing.

Voldemort didn't regret his path, even if it ended in disaster. Harry knew he wouldn't, either, but clung to hope that the same Fate wouldn't befall him.

"Our origins are not so different..."

Harry shook off the voice of the ghost and returned to the castle to sleep off the whiskey. He'd made his decision.
