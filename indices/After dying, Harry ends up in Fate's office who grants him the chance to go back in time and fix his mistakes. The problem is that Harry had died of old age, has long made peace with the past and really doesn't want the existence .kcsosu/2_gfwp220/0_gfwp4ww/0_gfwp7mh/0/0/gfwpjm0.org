   :END:
Harry got used to being... whatever it was he was being.

Lord of Light, some had called him. Everyone knew him as Dumbledore's successor. Many called him another Dark Lord.

Idiots.

Harry went from place to place, putting down Werewolf Kings, Goblin Rebellions, Eldritch Intrusions, Fey Inquisitions, and the like. It was as exhausting as it was exhilarating.

The other shoe dropped when Harry's enemies attacked his family.

--------------

Harry appeared in an explosion of green flame in the middle of St. Mungo's admittance auditorium. People cried and yelped and pulled out wands.

Harry ignored them.

"Lilly Luna Potter. Where is she?" Harry asked the frightened receptionist.

"Err--"

"No matter." Harry erupted in another explosion of green flame, leaving the waiting patients coughing in his wake.

Lilly was in stable condition. The best curse-breakers were working on her. Someone at work had slipped her a "clue" about their shared project and upon reading it, Lilly had succumb to a blood curse.

Harry was furious.

It took days, but Harry found an approximation of the curse in an esoteric journal, tracked down the "colleague" who had cursed Lilly, and confronted him.

"Macnair."

"Potter."

There was a twinge of fear in the Man's voice, but he had avoided the post-war cleanup for a long, long time.

"You know why I am here."

"I know you are Harry Potter, Paragon of the Light."

"Don't try to appeal to my better nature, Macnair. I'm not your Lord Voldemort. I don't care about my own ego."

"What of your reputation?"

"Did you do it?"

"Does it matter? We are legion, Potter. We saw this coming as soon as the Dark Lord fell. If I die, another will--"

"/Avada Kedavra/," Harry intoned. The bolt was not the quick, lightning-arcing thing that always found its target despite its defenses. It was a lazy, haphazard thing.

Bright green brought an end to Macnair. Harry pilfered the residence, disabling wards as he went. The lone house elf stood wide-eyed at the Great and Wonderful Harry Potter Sir.

"Tell his friends to leave me alone, or else the same will happen to them." The house elf nodded and POPPED out of existence.

Harry had work to do.

--------------

Hermione Granger Weasley took her seat as the 42nd Minister for Magic with great effect, but not as the sweeping reformer she had hoped to be, years ago.

Time in the Ministry dulled her idealism toward practicality, and though she resented it, she knew it was for the best.

Change couldn't come all at once, she knew, and societies weren't conjured out of thin air. Things took time, and though she was studious, there was just SO MUCH to the Wizarding World that Hermione had to catch up on over the years to effect any sort of change.

She had a fairly firm grasp of it all, now, and had been making progress, but then Harry Potter happened, and Harry Potter isn't something you can ignore.

He stood in her office, staring out the window to the lower levels of the Ministry, seemingly contemplating what all the workers were busying up to.

"Harry," Hermione almost gasped as a way of greeting.

"Hermione," Harry said without taking his eyes off his vantage.

"When did you get here? No one told me--"

"Just now," Harry said, cutting her off. "I thought to chat with you privately." Harry waved his wand, /that wand/, and Hermione felt the privacy spells erect around them, though the movement was too quick and subtle for such a dramatic list of spells.

Hermione deposited her files and briefings onto her desk and regarded Harry with her full attention. She kept her wand hidden in a holster, covered by the elegant arm of her business-like blouse, but she quickly dismissed the thought of using her wand. Harry was orders of magnitude beyond her in combat magic by this point.

"So what did you want to talk about?"

"Azkaban," Harry said, turning to her. He was as disheveled as ever, but it was in a chaotically handsome sort of way. His black hair went in all directions, and his beard turned to youthful stubble. Harry looked young. Younger than she remembered him at thirty.

It was the eyes that concerned her most. They almost glowed; green, impossibly green, like a picture of a rain forest at maximum saturation.

"Azkaban?"

"You've been trying to close it for years. Decades. I'm done waiting, Hermione. I'm tearing it down."

"Harry--"

"You can't stop me."

"Then why are you here? Harry! Wait!" Harry twitched in movement, and Hermione knew that Harry could apparate out of the Ministry at the speed of thought, if he wanted to, wards be damned. He hesitated and turned to her.

"You need to hear reason, Harry. That's why you're here. Do you want permission? Lawful guidance? What is it you need?" The Boy Who Lived, the Savior, the Next Dumbledore regarded her, with impossibly green eyes. And he shrugged, like he was fourteen and considering her advice for a date to the Yule Bawl.

"I love you, Hermione," Harry said matter-of-factly. "I value your opinion. I'm going to destroy Azkaban and kill the Dementors. I just thought I should let you know."

"Harry. Wait. Think about this."

"What is there to think about?!" Harry burst in a sudden rage. Hermione could feel the magic bristling against her skin in an instant. "You've tried! You did your best! The arseholes just keep blocking you, the system doesn't change, the evil persists! I'm done with it, Minister! Use me. I'll be your tool. Tell the Wizengamot that unless they abolish the petty /bullshit/ they keep holding on to, all the racist shit that persists, I'll come knocking, and I'll knock it all down. Let me be your Big Bad Wolf, Hermione, and I swear -- I SWEAR I'll fill the role!"

Harry's torrent came in quick with sweeping gestures. Hermione wasn't quite sure how to handle it immediately, but a thought and memory transposed upon her. She tried to calm down, as Harry Potter was a great force unleashed, and she really did consider his argument, though perhaps faster than Harry intended her to.

"Harry, do you remember fourth year?"

"The Tournament, the Goblet? Yeah, I remember."

"Do you remember my campaign for the house elves?"

Harry laughed. It was a rich, deep, genuine thing. "Sorry--" Harry apologized between coughing, "--I, yeah, sorry."

"What do you think would have happened if I was successful? Like, if I had actually freed the elves?"

"Disastrous."

"Exactly! I was so concerned with what was right, I had no plan for what was wrong."

"Bloody Gryffindors," Harry responded.

"Do you see the parallels? Harry? If you tear down Azkaban, who is left to pick up the pieces? We need a transition, Harry. You can't just decide that Might Makes Right, society doesn't work like that."

"Sorry, Hermione, but you're wrong." Harry stood up to his full height, now. His habit of slouching never fully escaped him, even in adulthood, but the man standing before her now looked almost entirely not like Harry and like the pure embodiment of him at the same time. It was perplexing.

"Explain," she demanded tapping her foot.

"I wish I could, but I've noticed over time how people just rely on us."

"What?"

"You know it. Don't pretend you don't get the letters, too. You can do things, so they expect you to fix everything."

Hermione knew exactly what he was talking about, and she felt a disgusting pit in her stomach, knowing what Harry was going to do next.

"They need us, Hermione. We didn't choose to be different, but they think we are their saviors, their gods of old. I'm just tired. Tired of waiting for something to change. Please, just let me be your instrument. Let me do this, for all of us, for Dumbledore's stupid 'greater good', so we can get past all this mess and let the world move on."

"Harry." Hermione was crying, now. The tears welled up and she couldn't stand to see her best friend follow this path. It was too much.

Hermione had always felt closer to Harry than Ron while at Hogwarts. They were both effectively Muggle-Born, after all. Harry's home life hadn't been immediately apparent to Hermione, and if she had known earlier, things might have turned out differently. But, she reasoned, Harry had sort of sealed it in their sixth year: Harry was the chosen one. He didn't /need/ her, not in that way, and he'd always find a romantic landing pad, so to speak, if he needed one. Harry was empathetic beyond reason, she knew, and Ron was a goofy, handsome, dolt most of the time, but Hermione felt the need to educate Ronald more than she felt the need to comfort Harry.

And that was her role, she knew, at some point as a child. Comfort Harry and educate Ron.

She threw herself at Harry, tears streaming, embracing him.

"Harry," she repeated, "please. I'm asking you, as your friend. As someone who loves you. Please, just let me try to work this out."

"I--" Harry caught himself, embracing his friend again after so long. "I need this, Hermione. This is my path. I never really had a choice, in the end. I can't let them grow up in a world doomed to die because we ignored the muggle world for so long. I can't let our own hypocrisy scream at them while they benefit from it. It all has to end. The time is nigh."

Hermione gulped and released her embrace.

"I'll have a lot of work, cleaning up your mess, Harry Potter."

Harry laughed. It was a genuine, throaty thing. It sounded like music to Hermione.

"It's a brutal cycle, I know, but something has to change. You can spin it, right?"

"I can try." Hermione felt weak. Defenseless. Harry patted her back, and a thought formed, and as he was letting go, she said: "What will the kids think?"

"Whatever they want," was Harry's cold response. They gauged each other, for a moment. Harry shook his head.

"I wouldn't have been good for you," Harry said.

"Probably. We might never know," was Hermione's response.

Harry's magical privacy charms broke the instant he disappeared, and a litany of flying papers streamed into Hermione's office.

"Good bye, Harry Potter. I wish I could know you better."
