Harry Potter was not a pile of ash on the floor of the atrium to the Ministry of Magic.

Harry Potter was thoroughly confused about his surroundings.

Harry Potter saw rows and rows of bookshelves presented before him, but they were as if made of strings, and instead of bindings and titles, they showed little pictures, like a muggle movie.

Harry Potter couldn't even find normality in death!

Harry did not stand, but knew intrinsically his footing. He sort of floated along where he meant to float. He looked down the rows of bookshelves parallel to him, saw an arrangement of moving pictures before him, and knew that they were infinite.

Harry was in an infinite space surrounded by repeating images in a floating, sort of magical box of impossibility.

Whoa.

“Hello?!” Harry spoke, not quite sure what was happening or where he was. The other time he'd died, he ended up at King's Cross, afterall. This was different.

“Ah,” a voice spoke out from everywhere at once. “I was wondering when I'd finally meet the great Harry Potter.”

A form appeared in front of Harry, in front of the infinite stacks, and quickly coalesced into the shape of an old man. He looked like the Flamels but eerily older, more translucent and with longer hair. Everything about him spoke: OLD!

“OLD!” Harry said it accidentally. He really didn't mean to. The last few hours of spellwrought and deception still had his psyche burned out, but that was his excuse.

The old... thing... laughed. It sounded genuine, but foreign.

“I am Time Eternal.” It sounded like the thing was speaking from everywhere at once, but very quietly. Like an old man with a microphone triggered to speakers about the room. Harry needed to learn that trick.

“Greetings, Time Eternal. I am Harry Potter, cursed to ever-living self deprecation. Coincidentally, I'm the luckiest idiot alive. And not alive. Pleasure to meet you.” Harry bowed.

Time smiled. “You are quite a conundrum, Harry. Do you know why you are here?” The old man gestured to the infinite stacks of bookshelves that played infinite scenes of things on repeat. Harry hadn't the slightest clue why he was here.

“Of course. I was invited to the inter-dimensional time and space emporium exposition, but I'm afraid I forgot my wand. Forgive me, mister Time, for I must depart.”

Time laughed again, but the world whirled around Harry as he did.

“Maybe I should make things a bit easier for you to... digest.” The whirling continued, until the infinite stacks of infinite books of infinite images coalesced into a sort of library with a single infinite stack of infinite images, but there was a floor and a rug on the floor and chairs on the floor and a glorious three-dimensional floor!

Harry planted himself firmly on the floor. The old, battered, nearly translucent being that called itself Time did the same. There were even leather chairs! How cute.

Harry plopped himself in a leather recliner and looked out at the vistage. Ahh. Infinity. It really put you in your place.

“Harry,” said Time, appearing in the chair opposite. “You've lived an exceedingly consequential life. It's rare that I have visitors of the mortal coil.”

“Really?” Harry looked at Time again. His image faded and flickered a bit depending on how Harry thought he should look, but it felt inappropriate to /try/ to make him look a certain way.

“Oh, yes. That spell your friends concocted. I don't think they rightly knew where or when it led. I am, however, delighted to find some mortal company after a while.”

Harry was confused and... more confused. He should be dead, right? He touched his face. It was his face, at about fifty something or so years old. His beard wasn't quite full, but it nestled against his lips and nose all the same. His hair hung black and wild. His robes were the ones he was wearing when he stepped into the Ministry that morning, the all black and stylish flagrant obstruction of fashion.

He had been very careful to look at least fashionable in death.

Except, he wasn't dead.

“Right,” said Time. “You aren't dead. You are in what one might call a tesseract. That spell to reverse your inverted aging, to force you to die of old age, well, sent you here.”

Harry took it all in. The tesseract was beautiful and terrifying. Harry was still confused.
