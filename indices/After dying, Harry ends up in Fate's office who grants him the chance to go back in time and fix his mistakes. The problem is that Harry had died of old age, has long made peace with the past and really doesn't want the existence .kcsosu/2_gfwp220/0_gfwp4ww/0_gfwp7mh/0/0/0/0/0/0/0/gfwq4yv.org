“Erm. Sorry, but I felt myself aging past this point. I was dying. Except I ended up here.”

“You are not on Death's list, Harry Potter.” Time spun his hand and the wall of infinite books of strings of images shifted to reveal something Harry had much trouble seeing.

“Harry Potter was crossed off when he made his first decision.” Voldemort entered the three-story house in Godric's Hollow. There was a duel.

Harry was proud of how formidable his father fought the Dark Lord. James Potter yelled for Lilly to run and take Harry. James Potter never intended to win against the Dark Lord, but he put up a good fight. Harry, after extended use of the Elder Wand and his own forays into defeating Dark Lords, knew the bloke was done from the offset. He planted his feet wrong, his wand movements were too slow, he announced his intentions without needing to, and he was every bit the duelist's dream opponent, if you were a master duelist.

Voldemort was a master duelist. He used legilimency to anticipate his opponent's attacks, he erected multiple levels of shields, and he countered the opponent's spells in their most direct opposition. That is to say, he flung the jinxes back at Harry's father, not wasting to block them.

On paper, or even as a non-partial observer, it would appear that James was being intentionally obtuse and Voldemort intentionally careful about the whole duel. Harry knew that his father was being an idiot to buy time. Transfiguration in duels were very clever distractions, but rarely won them, and that was James' go-to.

“I've seen enough,” Harry waved his hand haphazardly. The image fast-forwarded.

“This!” announced Time, “is the moment of your decision.”

“I really don't want to see it again---” Harry saw the book-string-image shift to Voldemort stalking up the stairs into the bedroom. Harry saw himself as a baby, crying at the noise, trying to escape his crib. His mother was there, kissing him, assuring him, saying everything would be okay, that she had a plan, that Harry needed to be strong and grow up big and tall and oh god----

“Stop!”

Harry was crying. He couldn't help it. The sight of his mom dotting over a baby... him, moments before she sacrificed herself. Harry dreamed it for years. It was a nightmare that played on repeat on his subconscious. Mind Healers couldn't alleviate it, because he didn't want it gone. It was the only way he could remember her, and it wasn't even really a memory.

This, though, was the real deal. Harry knew it was as real as the infinite stacks of infinite images, as real as Neville cutting the snake's head off, as real as Harry waking up.

“Please. I don't need to see her die again.”

“So be it. However, you do need to see /you/ die.”

The image fast-forwarded in a flurry of bright green explosion and then stopped, freeze-framed on Voldemort holding his wand, pointed at baby Harry's head. Baby Harry was looking past it. Current Harry knew why.

/“Avada Kedavra!”/ and stupid Snake-Face blew himself up with the spell, and baby Harry collapsed in a cute little heap. Current Harry wanted to get up and pick the boy up, but Time held him still.

“This was your first choice. You were anchored to the mortal world, but dead.” Harry looked back at the image, and yup. Baby Harry was definitely dead. His forehead was a smoking ruin, and he was as still as a plank of wood.

“I don't remember making a choice.”

“Of course not. Also, mortal children are extremely attached to living. For obvious reasons.”

Baby Harry opened its eyes and started wailing.

A rat entered the scene, stealing wands, and escaped before the flames claimed him.

Hagrid battled the house itself, as it was collapsing on top of him and on fire, and tucked baby Harry under his hunched form, along with whatever pictures and toys and dottles Hagrid had deemed important, rummaging through the place.

“Okay,” Harry said. “My origin story. So what?”

“So, you are not on Ms. Death's list. It was rather appropriate that you became the owner of her mortal artifacts, perhaps some note of Fate's guidance in there. Really, bravo, Harry.”

“What?!”

“I'm sorry, what was confusing about that?”

“Fate and Death and... and you're TIME and...”

“Harry, surely you've read about the Greater Powers.”

Harry had read about the Greater Powers. Harry had immediately dismissed them as lark, except for allowing a small hole in the logic for Death, or ‘Te Most Dethly Pow'r' as the old scripts told it.

“You really are Time Eternal?”

“Why would I lie?” The grandfatherly, not quite Dumbledore, not quite Flamel, gestured to the bookshelf of infinite images again.

“You are here in a tesseract, my boy, and I am Time Eternal, here to guide you.”

“So wait,” Harry was confused. “You said Death crossed me off her list?”

“That's right. You aren't an option. Normally, you'd be mortal. Normally, I can't show these things to mortals. You, Harry Potter, are not mortal. Death does not desire you.”

“The Hallows...”

“A lark, as you might say. Though they are Her engineering, they were designed to bring mortals /to/ Her, not give them immortality. They were engineered by very clever ancestors of yours and Death sort of snuck in and added Her own little tricks. Can't let mere mortals get the best of a Power now can we?”

This was a bit much and Harry slumped in his armchair. Time was already sifting through the images to find the appropriate past to show Harry.

“No, no, I don't need to see how my great ancestors tried to cheat death and got screwed themselves.”

“Ahh. It's a good story, though terribly dull in parts. Suit yourself.”

“What about the Veil? What happens if I throw myself into it?”

“‘The Veil,' as you call it, is merely a portal to the Lands Beyond. No one comes back, because they usually die. I would say it is a good way to treat with Death if you wish to, though.”

“What other Powers are there?”

“Oh, a few, I suppose. Time and Death aren't everything, afterall. There's Chaos and Order, ever dueling, that's how you have magic, by the way, and my partner Space, and Fate, and...”

“And?!” Harry demanded. He needed to know!

“You might not be mortal but you are a mortal being. It's improper to try to explain things that are over your head.”

Harry huffed. “Try me.”

“You really wish to know how Time functions? In relation to Space, in relation to third, fourth, and fifth dimensional arrays simultaneously?” Harry was blasted with thought. It was like being attacked by the Elder Wand directly, a mind intrusion that showed him galaxies expanding and contracting in impossible directions, the birth and death of universes, the images of his mother---

“OKAY!”

“Do you get it?”

“NO!”

“Good.”

Harry shook off the feeling of being... compelled. It was so unfamiliar given his last few decades of power. The Powers were real. They could do whatever they wanted.

And Time Eternal was sitting in a comfy recliner, regarding Harry, in the middle of some sort of interdimensional time obstruction.

Harry wished for a normal life. A thought struck him.

“What about the future?” Harry wondered. “Can you show me that?”

“You can show yourself, if you'd like, but you should be careful with the future.”

“Why is that?”

“Once you see it, you can't change it.”

“That's silly. It's the future, isn't it? Why can't I change it?”

“Because then it has become the past.”

“The future... becomes the past?”

“Only when observed. Time is very particular, Harry, and you can't change the past.”

“WHY AM I HERE!”

“Oh, Harry. Please. If I may. You are here because your friends inadvertently created a tesseract that trapped you in time. Because you are favored or disfavored by several Powers, I was curious about your presence. Forgive me if I've been a poor host.”

“No, Time, I'm sorry for the outburst. I'm just a bit overwhelmed. You've been a great host.”

“Thank you, Harry. I don't get many visitors who wish to stop and chat, most just jump through.”

“Wait----” did Harry really want to know?

“Yes, Harry, and so are you. Here.” Time filtered the bookcase of strings of images of time and stopped once again on Voldemort's attack on Godric's Hollow. “You could go here, if you wished. Stop Voldemort. Save your parents. Save yourself.”

But... “But I would erase the future, wouldn't I?”

“To them?” Time gestured to the still image of Voldemort stalking up the lane. The target, a three-story house on the cul-de-sac with dominating gardens and wide fields behind it. “To them, you'd drop in as if out of thin air. Their world would be forever changed. To you? You would remember your world, your time, but it wouldn't exist for them.”

Harry thought he understood. You can't change the past.

“And I could never go back, could I?”

“Maybe you should study that ritual your friends concocted a bit more before deciding.”

Harry did. He sped up the image and slowed it down. Over and over, until he thought he got most of it. If he jumped into a timeline, he was reasonably sure he could find a way back out.

Or he'd throw himself into the Veil of Death and ask Her just what the hell she was on about.

“What about Teddy and James and Al and Lilly? Can I see them?” Harry asked after some time. It was hard to tell just how much transpired between events, in this place. Harry suspected time didn't really go anywhere, here.

“Of course. Remember what I said about the future?”

“Yeah, I remember.”

“Then take all the time you need.”
