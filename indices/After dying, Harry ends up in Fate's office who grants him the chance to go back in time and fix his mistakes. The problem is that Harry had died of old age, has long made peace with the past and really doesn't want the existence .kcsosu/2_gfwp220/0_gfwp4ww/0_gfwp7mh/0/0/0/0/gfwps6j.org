"Was this what you feared?" Harry asked the ghostly visage from atop his 'throne' above the Wizengamot.

"Perhaps," said Albus' ghost, "if you mean what I might become if I accepted the power bestowed upon me. If you were referring to something else, though, I have no reason to fear anything, as I am a ghost."

"Very prudent, Headmaster.”

"It is good to see you, Harry. Even in these circumstances."

Harry turned to the ghost. "Is it? I'm a monster. Swallowed by the Hallows and the war and trying to fix a future that I can not predict. I'm just frustrated. And too full of power to be happy with anything less than the dramatic."

"I do mean it. I am proud of you, Harry James Potter. You are not quite as fallen as you might believe, and you are alive despite all your attempts. I am very proud to see you living despite my own influence, in fact."

"I wished to die, you know." Harry was angry and tired and frustrated and annoyed. The Headmaster had left so many things unanswered, and despite all attempts to talk to his portrait and ghost, he never really revealed his true intentions. “You were never honest with me.”

“I always told the truth, Harry. Trust me, I wished I could tell the whole truth the whole time, but there were too many moving parts, the stakes too high to give you the keys you sought. They were always within reach of Voldemort, and he was /your/ Dark Lord to defeat, not mine. I am sorry you wanted to die.”

Harry wondered what the hell that meant, but continued.

“You could have prevented all of this, you know. You had the Elder Wand. You could have taken control of the Ministry, like this, and put an end to the pureblood nonsense. The muggle-hating. I could have lived a normal life, and I wouldn't have to become a monster to get what I want.”

“Is that what you are, Harry?” The old visage asked. “Monsters do not often contemplate the ramifications of their actions on their wary children, or opine upon the opinions of their friends. It is not like you to wish for me to have taken your burden for you, after all.”

The old man knew misdirection, even from the grave. Harry knew in that moment what houses the Hat offered Dumbeldore.

“I never wanted you to suffer,” Harry started. “You took the burden upon yourself. I was just curious, wondering, why you stopped halfway, why you went to such extremes in some circumstance to protect and direct me, whilst in others you misguided me, like a lost puppy, or as Snape said, a ‘lamb for slaughter.'”

“That---” Dumbledore looked genuinely offended--- “Is a misunderstanding of my character. Harry,” the old ghost sighed, as if his old age affected him now, even in death. “There were no possibilities of you living a normal life. I did the arithmancy and divination. The Fidelius collapsed, the Potters were dead, the Longbottoms were our only hope, and Hagrid found you, with a scar, and got drunk and proclaimed you the Boy Who Lived. I had no time. Nothing to engineer. The world knew you were destined for greatness, as did I when I first saw you, but really. Harry---”

“What about putting me with my aunt and uncle?”

“What would you propose?”

“Andromeda Tonks, for starters.”

“And they'd be inundated with a litany of fan mail and cursed letters, both equally as dangerous.” Harry had to admit, he /had/ had to deal with a lot of cursed mail over the past few decades. It was easy, after taking up the Hallows, but it left his family vulnerable. Was Dumbledore's protection so complete?

“Harry, my boy. I am not a master of charms, but with the Wand and my knowledge of the effects of Dragon's Blood in conjunction with alchemy, I found a way to move your mother's ritual sacrificial connection to a place. It only worked if they were your blood relatives.”

Harry almost started again, but bit his tongue.

“I am sorry, Harry.” The ghost looked truly sorry.

“I had to keep things from you, Harry,” Dumbledore spoke on. “Once I knew of the Horcrux, and your connection to Voldemort, I couldn't doubt that anything you knew /he/ also knew. You were our greatest hope and liability, at the same time.” Dumbledore looked down, apologetic.

“And preventing this?” Harry gestured wide in the office above the Wizengamot, as if to encompass the whole of the world.

“I do not think you have fallen, my dear Harry, but I did not have the Hallows complete to protect me as you do now. The Wand is a wondrous thing, but do you fear mortal Death with all complete at your command?”

Harry did not fear Death. It was an almost laughable situation.

“Your ascension to Master and Governor is most curious. You may think me invincible from your understanding of magic in your youth, but do you see that now, knowing what you know?”

Harry wasn't sure. He could picture Dumbledore holding four jobs and taking power and commanding the peons to his progressive bidding, but it was only an image you could conjure if you ignored Dumbledore's Achilles heel, so to speak.

“What of Ariana? Your family?”

Dumbledore looked up, startled. Achilles Heel indeed.

“I suppose---” The great Grand Sorcerer and Supreme Mugwump and Headmaster looked started and ashamed.

“I left them behind to achieve the Greater Good. It was always for you, in the end, Harry.”

Harry nodded.

Love. The Power He Knew Not.

That was Harry's problem. He loved too much. He wanted so much, because he loved his friends and family and wanted everything for them. Not for himself, but for them.

Harry felt nothing for himself.
