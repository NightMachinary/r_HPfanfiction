That was amazing! Excellent story and the passing was great (also thanks for clarifying about Hermione&Teddy, I had wondered, also just to be sure, did they plan for the trap to kill Harry or only to make it seem like he died?). You've got real talent there if this is a result of a single sitting, really, an excellent read.
