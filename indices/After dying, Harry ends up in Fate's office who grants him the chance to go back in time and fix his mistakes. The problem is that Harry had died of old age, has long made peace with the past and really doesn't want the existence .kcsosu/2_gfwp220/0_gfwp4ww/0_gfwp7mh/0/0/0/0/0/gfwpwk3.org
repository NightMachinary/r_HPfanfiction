** Part 8:

Harry walked into the trap willingly. He wasn't afraid to die; if the time was right. It was always the right time, he just worried about his friends and family, and what people would think.

Maybe he should have written some of this down? Protect his legacy? Whatever. No matter. Things were in motion and Harry preferred motion to a tormid let-down. He played his part, conjuring a terrifying circle of whirling energy around him with the simple flick of his wand.

"What have you done?” He demanded. Harry's voice was cool and calm, but the atrium was crowded around him, far away, in the upper levels, with dozens of wands pointed in his direction.

“You've been voted out.” Hermione was very matter-of-fact. She wasn't a good actor, Harry knew, but most didn't know that her disapproval counted as bravery.

Harry looked around. He flourished the Elder Wand for dramatic effect.

“It's treason, then!” Harry loved his internet memes of late.

And then the battle started.

Harry defended himself lackadaisical. The aurors in the room couldn't hit him with a spell nine times out of ten if they'd tried. Half the commotion was just for effect. Harry briefly considered conjuring extra would-be Red Coats to attack him as mirages, but then Ron entered the atrium.

Ron and Harry had been best mates. They both loved quidditch and food. There was little to misunderstand about their relationship. Harry loved Ron.

So it was very difficult to think about killing him.

Ron and Harry dueled while the other aurors tried to stop Harry. It was futile. Harry loved Ron too much to put him down, but loved the game and distraction too much to stop it any other way.

The atrium exploded in all directions from spellfire; granite morphed into living lava that attacked Harry, and Harry was having fun with it. Shrapnel that would harm Harry swirled around him like a shield. Conjured and Transfigured creatures became his puppets, directed back at their creators. It was pure, unrivaled, chaos, and Harry loved it.

More and more poured into the atrium to attack Harry. Wow. He was so loved. The attention of half of wizarding Britain was upon him, casting spells and melting pillars as Harry deflected spells and countered jinxes and returned curses.

“You know---” Harry said during the onslaught, “It might be better if you executed some sort of plan, or else I might get bored and start killing people.”

There was a demonstrable pause in the spellcasting at that.

Hermione appeared again, and challenged Harry. “If this is part of the script, then sure. I accept.”

They dueled. Hermione was like an ant before an elephant. Inconsequential.

She summoned, conjured, transfigured, froze, exploded, needled, and cursed her way at Harry's protections. She even tried some psychology.

“Harry Potter! You really want to go down as a Dark Lord? What of your children?”

Harry laughed.

“My kids are adults, Minister. They can think for themselves.”

Harry spun the Wand in a looping motion and suddenly disarmed dozens of wands to him. There was a moment of pause and confusion as everyone took this in, then another round of aurors faced Harry.

Harry paused, seeing Teddy's face. It was Professor Lupin's face, dead and still and his fault. Something caught Harry.

“/Expelliarmus!/”

Teddy was flanked by Ron, and Harry really didn't want to kill them. Even without the Elder Wand, Harry could summon or transfigure death in an instance.

Runes alighted all around him.

This was the trap. Finally!

“Now!” Teddy screamed, and Hermione said some words in Greek that Harry didn't quite catch, and the world was on fire.

Harry bristled. Fire was painful, but not the worst way to die.

Harry's arms and legs caught, paralyed, and the fire abated. Runes lit the atrium amidst the terrible damage. Harry commended himself for not killing anyone directly, but noticed a few dozen unconscious bodies lying about the corners of the battle. Someone said some words, and the ring on Harry's finger shot off, taking part of his finger with it.

“Ow! That was rude!”

“Harry. James. Potter.” Hermione descended upon him, flanked by Ron and Andromeda Tonks. Teddy was just off to the side, looking bewildered at Harry and the dual wands in his hands.

“You are accused of crimes against humanity. How do you plead?”

“Erm. What?”

Hermione sighed. She made an elaborate, not so subtle gesture that this was an act.

“Oh.” Harry knew the gambit, but he loved a good story all the same.

“I am guilty of many things, Minister, but crimes against humanity? I only hoped to help humanity. If death is what the world wishes of me---” Harry spun in his bonds and they wriggled away from him, as if disgusted to touch his flesh, or even be near it.

Everyone gasped.

“Do it now!” Teddy yelled.

The trap alighted, a ritual circle cleverly hidden beneath the stone plinths of the Minstry's atrium, and Harry gasped.

The Elder Wand ignited the circle.

Harry wasn't afraid to die. He'd been called the ‘Next Dumbledore' for years.

Harry was mostly disappointed. He didn't see the fruition of his plans. He didn't see if the efforts to influence muggles had saved the planet. He didn't see his children grow up to have kids. He didn't see if the Ministry could effectively change, if his ruse had any impact at all.

It was fine, as Harry observed the ritual runes affecting him, and then a desk appeared, and exploded, and appeared again, and exploded, and --- Harry had seen this before.

“Harry Potter! You are Banished!”

The desk exploded. And then it was whole. And then it exploded.

Harry was aging, now. Rapidly. He aged up back to his thirties and forties, growing a beard. His hairline receded thereafter, but his beard grew, and his face tightened, and his hair grew white, and his voice stuttered.

Teddy looked at Harry.

“He--- Harry!”

“It's okay, kid.” Harry's voice transcended from old to Grandpa in a second. “Take care of that for me? Love ya---”

Teddy spun the Elder Wand at the infinitely self-destructing Time Turners, but it was too late.

Harry was crippled and decaying a moment later in front of the... well, the whole wizarding world, as much as it mattered.

Harry Potter was a pile of ash on the floor of the atrium to the Ministry of Magic.
