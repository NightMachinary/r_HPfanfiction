** Part 6

   :END:
Harry killed the Dementors as promised. It was cathartic, in a way.

The island was still bleak and sad and housed criminals awaiting the expiration of their sentences; Harry wasn't going to completely upend the situation, he just hated the Dementors.

The blinding light of Harry's Patronus weaved patterns beside the nothern Aurora in a spectacle of dance and death and not-death.

The fact that many of the life-sentenced residents also died in the attack went underpinned in the reports.

--------------

Great and terrible things followed in the 'destruction' of Azkaban. The world feared Harry Potter, and felt in awe of Harry Potter, and no one quite understood Harry Potter, even his family or closest friends.

"I Pray for the child," whispered Molly Weasley. Of course, Harry was just a child in her mind.

"Harry's Wrackspurts have come up with some very troubling solutions," Luna minded.

The papers all speculated on Harry's next move, after every public move. Harry confided with Ron and Hermione and Luna and Neville whenever he felt it necessary, but he continued his campaign privately, until now.

Harry cleaned up Knocturn Alley; it turned out that the place was both the source of the Snatchers (low level gangs aligning with the big boss), and rife with discontent and power-struggles now that Voldemort was not around to give some semblance of order to the dusty rot of a neighborhood. Harry outright killed direct dissidents and plied the residents for information at every turn.

The Ministry was turning out laws like they were going out of style, and most of them Harry approved of, but there were many reservations. A lot of them seemed directly aimed at Harry in particular; emergency measures, Hit-Wizard recruitment, Obliviators. For every step forward Harry garnered as 'The Enemy', the Ministry took equal steps backward.

It was infuriating.

Harry planned to take direct control, and told his friends as everyone gathered in a rented room above the Leaky Cauldron, a loose barrier between the magical and non-magical worlds.

"You, what? Mate--"

"Ron, please. I've breached the Ministry dozens of times without anyone noticing. This is just a statement."

"You want to pronounce your plan to the world, Harry," Hermione stood in stark defiance in contrast with most of the old gang; Luna and Neville were there. "However," Hermione continued, "I don't think it wise. The Wizarding World just doesn't quite yet understand the concepts you're trying to instill. Climate change sounds like a muggle problem, and the technology thing just engenders them to more anti-muggle prejudice...."

Hermione was right, Harry knew.

"You're right. Which is why I'm taking control. Hermione, you can either acquiesce power, or I can take it. Which do you think will have a better result?"

Harry was talking about overthrowing the government as casually as casting a levitation charm. Harry was not demanding power, he was asking what the best result would be.

The others didn't understand.

"Let me explain," Harry started. "Since rejoining the ICW and eliminating threats to both the Statute and Wizarding-Kind, more and more people simply give up responsibility to me with the misguided notion that I'm the one to fix everything. I haven't a clue how to fix everything, so, I need your help.

"I can take over as an authoritarian figure," Harry continued, "as it is easy for me to do and easy for the press and population to digest. What we need to do is engender the muggles into complying with rapid technological change in order to prevent them from destroying the planet whilst convincing the magical world that taking over the muggle governments is not a good idea. Any thoughts?"

"Errr."

"I don't care if I'm painted as the bad guy," Harry reminded them.

So they formed a plan.

Harry did many great and terrible things leading up to his assault on the Ministry.

He took over without casting a single curse. Aurors and Old Family members alike stood aside as he took the office of Minister of Magic.

Harry held the titles of Supreme Mugwump, Minister of Magic, and to his friends, Master of Death, all while being the source of public legendary admiration simultaneously.

Years past like flies.

Society changed just as swiftly.

--------------

It was, perhaps, ironic that Harry suddenly knew that the swift changes he'd enacted as Minister and de-facto King of the Wizards could be undone the moment he relinquished power, though he persisted anyway.

If anything, he wanted the world to know he'd tried.

Harry's ascension to power surprisingly bloody-less. He commanded the Wizarding world with the authority and conviction only the Master of the Hallows could lend, but Harry was annoyed at how much people /relied/ on his decision making. He just wanted people to figure it out for themselves. He was the director, not the actor and engineer and lighting technician and script supervisor....

Harry was starting to see his life as a movie, which was troubling.

Harry spent most of the time in the Minister's office, overlooking the Ministry and its capacities. There was a benefit to inept bureaucracy, Harry finally admitted, as it allowed those who were not-quite good at their jobs an easy escape from punishment and terrifying remorse.

Bureaucracy was good for morale, as dumb as that sounded.

Harry's reign was not quite 'dark' as most might describe it. There was a lot of work to be done, for sure, and inept peoples were dismissed to find their own way in the world. It was a bleak time but not a bloody time. For that, Harry was grateful.

Everyone wondered why Harry seemed to grow /more/ youthful with time passing, as if he aged backward. Harry knew the answer and couldn't explain it.

Harry was almost proud when his friends and family gathered in late July to lure Harry to his death. It was almost cute.
