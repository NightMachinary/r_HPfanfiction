** Part 4:

The following years went by quickly. Harry returned to work with the International Confederation of Wizards, and was quickly elected Supreme Mugwump. Rumors and whispers were calling Harry the next Dumbledore.

Dumbledore was not so cruel or effective during his tenure, but Harry really did try to keep himself in check.

Firstly, there was the Statute question. Harry shifted the ICW from outright blocking muggles' knowledge of magic to introducing tiny slices of the truth into specific places. Governments, intelligence agencies, et cetera. He enlisted teams, muggle-borns, to infiltrate internet spaces and sew a bit of chaos with conspiracy theories. A dab of truth mixed with flamboyant lies were enough to buy time, at least, and muggles seemed to eat it up.

Lockhart's lessons weren't entirely useless, afterall.

Harry directed his agents to drip-feed a bit of truth about the magical world to various muggle governments. Threats and misdirection, as well as subtle guidance in the form of what technologies those governments should be prioritizing in order to save the future of the planet were /primo directiva/ of Harry's administrative role in the Confederation.

Harry's personal role was to seek out and quell Dark Sorcerers and rebellions.

It was easy work, with the Elder Wand at Harry's beck and call, but there were some close calls.

Ginny was furious, as expected. Harry was a hypocrite, and Harry didn't argue the point.

What was the point, after all?

Harry's children grew distant over the years, and understood what he was doing, but didn't outright say they disproved. Harry could read between the lines of frequent Owls, and they all told each other how much they were loved.

It was good to be reminded of love, Harry thought. It kept him grounded.

Teddy was absolutely infatuated with Harry, though. He wanted to know about every mission, every defeated wannabe Dark Lord, every spell and confluence that Harry conjured to combat the mild terror that had taken over the magical world.

Harry acquiesced, but only some. The details were gruesome much of the time, and Harry tried to use the opportunity as a learning tool (being a Hogwarts professor doesn't really escape your psyche, especially when it comes to people you care about).

Hermione's letters were dripping with personal concern and well wishes and hope. Harry had grown to be a master of interpreting the brilliant witch's not-so-subtle diatribes, and it became clear, now, the choices the Sorting Hat had given Hermione all those years ago. She was not subtle or ambitious for he own sake, but she did have trouble making friends, and was obviously studious to a fault, but what she desired most, deep down, was the bravery to do the right thing.

That was what Harry was trying to do. The right thing. And keep himself from becoming another Voldemort, but it was hard to cling onto love when you had so much power.

Ron's correspondence was brief and to the point, as always, but Harry appreciated it nonetheless. Harry asked about quidditch results between news of various missions Harry conducted.

"Wish I were there, with you," Ron wrote.

"Shine on, Ronald," Harry replied, not knowing if the wizard would pick up on the Pink Floyd reference.

Ginny argued, and Harry didn't care. "I know," was his answer most of the time. Ginny would run out of steam, and Harry would suggest something to do with her time, now that she couldn't fly professionally.

"I've been talking to Teddy and Ronald, and I think about the Auror corps a lot," was her response.

"Oh," was all Harry could conjure. There were so many opinions and thoughts and emotions roiling around in his head at the idea of Ginny working for the Aurors. "Not in the field, I hope?"

"Research, mostly." Ginny's response was a small epithet to her conscience. Harry could read minds without really trying, these days.

"That might be for the best."

"You look younger. You always keep looking younger," Ginny left the question out of the statement, but Harry knew.

"Probably the Hallows." Harry knew the answer but didn't want to start another argument, so he played at Ginny's role and gave her something without losing out on his own secrets. He was good at that, now.

"I'm scared, Harry."

"I know."

"Mum says it feels like another war is coming. I feel it, too."

"I'll be there. I'll always be there, Ginny."

"I know, and I'm scared."

"I just..." Harry felt something, and he didn't know what to say, how to form it into words. How do you explain Destiny and Fate and fixing The Broken Things to turn the world into something it needed to be, but didn't necessarily deserve? "I love you, Ginevra Weasley Potter. I always will."

"I love you too, Harry."

She was crying, and Harry couldn't feel anything.
