Ugh, the whole 'I must avoid changing the future!' trope is one of my biggest pet peeves. It always leads to a boring story following the stations of canon just with more narrator angst hamfisted in. Shoveling some self-righteous Harry-knows-best into the mix doesn't make it sound any more appealing.
