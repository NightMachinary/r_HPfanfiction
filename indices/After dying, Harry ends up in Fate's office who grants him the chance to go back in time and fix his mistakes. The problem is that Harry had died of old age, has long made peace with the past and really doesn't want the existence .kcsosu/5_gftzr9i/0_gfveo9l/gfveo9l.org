I think it could be a really good story if the "I must avoid changing the future!" trope goes wrong. Like - let's do it realistic: How many details do you remember from the school year when you were elven? I don't remember much, too be honest. Sure, I know who my friends were and I cleary remember the basic things I learned... but details? Not a chance in hell. I am not even sure if I could still name all my classmates (though the school system in my country is different, I only attended classes with them 4 years from 10-14) And I am not even thirty - Harry died of old age, so he was probably over 100 years.So Harry tries to do the same things but doesn't remember the details. So it's not the big things he fucks up: he still remembers how he got into the quidditch team or how they saved Hermione from the troll (even better if he only remembers the details after Malfoy steals the rememberball and Quirrell runs into the great hall). The devil is in the detail - for example: Harry, Ron and Hermione don't offend Myrtle at the Death Day Party. She doesn't fly back to her toilet and floods it - so there is no water - Mrs. Norris is dead not petrified and all this little changes lead to bigger and bigger changes. With such details the story could really become interessting.
