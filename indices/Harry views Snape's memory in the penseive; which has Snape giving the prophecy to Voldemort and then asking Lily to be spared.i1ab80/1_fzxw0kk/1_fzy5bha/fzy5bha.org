The memory resurfaces again in the Prince's Tale, at which time Snape was dying so I doubt he would have been fit to manufacture memories. Also in Prince's Tale, the memory just before it is about Snape arguing with Lily about Snape's theory of Lupin's condition as well as the fact that James saved his life. So it means that Snape had already been in the Shrieking Shack to have seen the werewolf there even if he didn't know for sure whether it was Lupin or not.
