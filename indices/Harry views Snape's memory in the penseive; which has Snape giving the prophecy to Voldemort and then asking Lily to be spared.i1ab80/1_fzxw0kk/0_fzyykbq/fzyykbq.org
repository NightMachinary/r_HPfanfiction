I hate Snape as much as the next person, but you have the chronology of the order of events mixed up.

The incident where Snape snoops around the Willow after Sirius tells him about the knot at the base of its roots (and subsequently sees Remus transforming into a werewolf) happens before the time when James strings him after their defence OWL. We see this when Snape tries snivelling when he inadvertently admits to Lily that he found using dark magic on her schoolmate funny.

The memory after their OWL happens afterwards, since Lily is still talking to him.
