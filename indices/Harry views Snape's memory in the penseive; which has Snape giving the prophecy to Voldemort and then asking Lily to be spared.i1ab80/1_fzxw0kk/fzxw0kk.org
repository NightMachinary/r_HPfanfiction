From my pov, the entire 'memory' was manufactured.

Why? Because it makes James look bad, but far more importantly, is shows Remus speaking publicly about being a werewolf, BEFORE Sirius tricked Snape into meeting Remus during his 'time of the month.'

*/Harry looked around and glimpsed Snape a short way away, moving between the tables towards the doors to the Entrance Hall, still absorbed in his own exam paper. Round-shouldered yet angular, he walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider, and his oily hair was jumping about his face./*\\
*/A gang of chattering girls separated Snape from James, Sirius and Lupin, and by planting/*\\
*/himself in their midst, Harry managed to keep Snape in sight while straining his ears to catch the voices of James and his friends./*\\
*/“Did you like question ten, Moony?” asked Sirius as they emerged into the Entrance Hall./*\\
*/“Loved it,” said Lupin briskly. “Give five signs that identify the werewolf. Excellent question.”/*\\
*/“D'you think you managed to get all the signs?” said James in tones of mock concern./*\\
*/“Think I did,” said Lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors/*\\
*/eager to get out into the sunlit grounds. “One: he's sitting on my chair. Two: he's wearing my/*\\
*/clothes. Three: his name's Remus Lupin.”/*\\
*/Wormtail was the only one who didn't laugh./*\\
*/“I got the snout shape, the pupils of the eyes and the tufted tail,' he said anxiously, “but I/*\\
*/couldn't think what else -”/*\\
*/“How thick are you, Wormtail?” said James impatiently. “You run round with a werewolf once a month -”/*\\
*/“Keep your voice down,” implored Lupin./*\\
*/Harry looked anxiously behind him again. Snape remained close by, still buried in his exam/*\\
*/questions - but this was Snape's memory and Harry was sure that if Snape chose to wander off in a different direction once outside in the grounds, he, Harry, would not be able to follow James any further. To his intense relief, however, when James and his three friends strode off down the lawn towards the lake, Snape followed, still poring over the exam paper and apparently with no fixed idea of where he was going. By keeping a little ahead of him, Harry managed to maintain a close watch on James and the others./*

In order for this to have been Snape's actual memory, he would have had to know Remus was a Were before he found out.

So, either this is a manufactured memory or yet another of Rowling's glaring plot holes.
