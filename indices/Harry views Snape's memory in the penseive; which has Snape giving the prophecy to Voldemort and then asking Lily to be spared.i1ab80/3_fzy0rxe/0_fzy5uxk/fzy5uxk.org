Hero that Harry. Goes into a session that's all about shielding his mind because Voldemort might able to read it, knows he isn't having much success, knows the man across from him is a double agent, and thinks it's a good idea to find out whatever said double agent is trying to keep out of his vulnerable mind.

The only way it could possibly make sense is if he was sure that it didn't matter if Voldemort found it out. That is to say, he was /certain/ that Snape was actually loyal to Voldemort, and that therefore none of his secrets needed to be respected, because he just needed to be executed.
