I doubt it. I'm quite sure that as a spy for the Order, Snape knew better than anyone how important it was for Harry to shut his mind to Voldemort. Yet when he catches Harry snooping into the Pensieve, he goes completely bonkers and not only refuses to further teach him Occlumency but throws vials at him as he kicks him out of his office. Also the fact that he refuses to even acknowledge Harry's existence afterwards shows that he is really pissed and rather than dealing with the boy anymore, he prefers to go the Dumbledore route.
