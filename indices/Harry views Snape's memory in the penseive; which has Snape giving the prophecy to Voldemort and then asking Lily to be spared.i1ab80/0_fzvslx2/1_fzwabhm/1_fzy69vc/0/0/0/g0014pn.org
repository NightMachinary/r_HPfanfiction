  Also, Harry got an E in his OWLs for Potions despite being constantly told what a poor student he was, so I'm not quite sure where this whole Snape not teaching fanon comes from.

It's not fanon. We actually see several of Snape's classes. Case in point his first lesson, Shrinking Potion in 3rd year, and his potion classes in fifth year.

He's a horrible teacher; he does /not/ teach (putting instructions on the board and telling them to get to it doesn't count) and he's insanely biased which makes it even worse. I've had bad teachers, though never as horrible as Snape or as biased, and I still got good marks because I studied for the exams, just like Harry did.
