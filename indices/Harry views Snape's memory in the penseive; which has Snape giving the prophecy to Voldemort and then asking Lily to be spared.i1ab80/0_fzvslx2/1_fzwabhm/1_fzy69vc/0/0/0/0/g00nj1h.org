I really don't know what he was because besides a few snapshots of his classes when he's arguing with Harry there's nothing else in the books so everyone can fill in the gaps however they like when they write their fic. He's presented as horrible and a bully but there's no conclusive assessment of his teaching quality in canon. My conclusion is that since Harry got a decent grade probably his teaching style was at the very least somewhat functional.
