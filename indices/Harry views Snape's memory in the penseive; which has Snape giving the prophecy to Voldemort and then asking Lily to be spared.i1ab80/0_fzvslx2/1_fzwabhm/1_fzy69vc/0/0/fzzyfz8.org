It's never stated as such so it's up to everyone to speculate whatever they want. I think it would be stupid for a double agent not to try to shut the mind of the one whom he's spying for to the mind of the one who is spied. Also, Harry got an E in his OWLs for Potions despite being constantly told what a poor student he was, so I'm not quite sure where this whole Snape not teaching fanon comes from.
