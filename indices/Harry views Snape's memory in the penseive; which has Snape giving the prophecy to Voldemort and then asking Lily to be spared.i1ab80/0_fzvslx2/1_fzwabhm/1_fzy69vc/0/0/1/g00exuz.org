  I think it would be stupid for a double agent not to try to shut the mind of the one whom he's spying for to the mind of the one who is spied

What? Anyway, Snape is canonically a triple agent. Voldemort already knows he's a double agent, one that works for him! That's the whole point of the last two books, with the end showing him as a triple agent.

As a reader however I say that last twist plot doesn't really fit with the character. Who he's actually working for isn't clear at all.

As for his teaching, like it has been said, it isn't fanon. He never once taught anything in class. Admittedly we didn't see many lessons, but other teachers at least taught /something!/
