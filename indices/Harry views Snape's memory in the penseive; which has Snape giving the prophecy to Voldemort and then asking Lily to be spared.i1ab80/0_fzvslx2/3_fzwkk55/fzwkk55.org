  Well snape did place several memories in the pensive before the lessons. That was just the one that harry experienced. Had snape not come back when he did it likely would have gone like in GoF andnhe would have seen others

I think the response is pretty justified. The Pensieve would show what you are most curious about. In Goblet of Fire, he sees Barty Crouch Junior in his dreams, and that is what is shown in the Pensieve when he goes to Dumbledore's office.

Similarly. I think the biggest question that exists with regards to Snape at the time is this: Why does Snape hate Harry Potter so much. and that is what was shown to him.
