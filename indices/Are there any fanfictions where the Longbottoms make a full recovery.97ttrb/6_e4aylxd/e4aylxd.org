There's one that i can't remember the name of, but Hermione time travels and grows up knowing the Longbottoms before they are tortured. She ends up using legilimency to “unlock” their brains' fail-safe. Apparently they had been asking for “Mia” occasionally and it's because they were somehow able to remember that she'd know what to do. It isn't a story focused on them recovering though.
