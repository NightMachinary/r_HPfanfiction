The most common way is to use the number of a ffnet story. For example, the one you linked, after the /s/ is 12813755. Since its from ffnet you'd choose linkFFN. So it would be linkffn(12813755)

The easier way is just to put the title in and hope but with the millions of fanfiction stories written some titles have been used across multiple fandoms, I think ties that bind I've seen about seven of.
