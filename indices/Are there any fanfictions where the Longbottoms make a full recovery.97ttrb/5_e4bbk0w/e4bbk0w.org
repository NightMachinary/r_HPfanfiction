There is in the mind of a scientist where they are cured by genius Harry but they are pretty much non-entity. It is just there to be an accomplishment for Harry.

I also remember reading a somewhat cracky story about how they were crack head hippies and licking Trevor the Toad's skin to get high. When the healer had a chance to inspect Neville's toad, they are cured. Can't remember the name of the fic for the life of me though.
