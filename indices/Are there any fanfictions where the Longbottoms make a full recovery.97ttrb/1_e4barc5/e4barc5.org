There's an AU where Harry and Neville's fates are swapped. Harry obsesses over healing Lily and James. Would you be interested in a story like that? It's long, but healing the "mentally demolished parents" characters is the protagonist's main goal.

I know it's not exactly what you're asking me for, but it's very close, and a really good fanfiction. Even if you don't want it, I'll link it for anyone else who might be interested in a realistic Powerful!Harry AU.
