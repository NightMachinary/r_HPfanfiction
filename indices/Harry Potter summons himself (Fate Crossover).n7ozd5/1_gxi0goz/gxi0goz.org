Why would Voldemort even need to be a factor. The Fate series has so many more threatening THINGS ( from characters to powers to concepts and implications) in it that it would be so much more fun to see an ignorant (mby Isekied) Harry have to deal with all that even with an overpowered servant. Mby make the servant all knowing and all powerful, but only concerning Wizard magic, and not Magecraft (but he is still so overpowered that he can easily contend with noble Phantasms and all those world shattering implications that Fate has).
