Ah, sorry. I didn't think to elaborate on what that means. Choose your own adventure stories are the ones where the reader is given the choice to decide what the main character does next. For instance, if Harry sees someone acting weird you could get the choice of a)to follow that person, turn to chapter 2, or b) to return to the common room, turn to chapter 3. I hope that makes sense. It's essentially an interactive story.
