I'm not sure if anyone has written a CYOA in the style of the original books, where you jump to X chapter for decision A or Y chapter for decision B.

The typical style of CYOA, where the readers vote on or write in actions, is banned on FFN. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/guidelines/]]

One of the guidelines is no interactive stories, presumably to prevent review inflation. A CYOA needs reader responses. You could use the forums, but the majority of readers don't browse those and they aren't linked directly in the story. The review button is. So, everyone votes by reviewing, boosting your fic in one of the major categories used to sort and discover fics.

On forums, it works fine because it's a forum. Discussion occurs between chapters anyway, the author can even reply without publishing a new non-story chapter and sending an alert, they can pin a poll at the top, and actual content gets threadmarked so people can stick to just the story if they want. So there's a bunch of these on SpaceBattles and Sufficient Velocity, but those are major hubs for Worm fanfics more so than HP.

FFN just isn't built for interactivity and doesn't want to support it anyway.
