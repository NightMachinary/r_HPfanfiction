Son of the Hell Queen. It's a smut piece in ao3 where Lily is the queen of Hell, but she can't visit the mortal world because of a civil war in there, or something.

There are some time travel shenanigans and Harry & Lily are re-united and she explains her heritage... and Harry's job^{TM} is to corrupt witches and damn their souls to hell basically, as Lily has been doing.

You can see the resemblance.
