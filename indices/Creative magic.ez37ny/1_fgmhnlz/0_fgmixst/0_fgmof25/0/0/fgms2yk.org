I answered in both my comments why we aren't seeing creative uses of magic ; You have to explain why it's only being used now, and by these characters. Harry isn't a unique genius when it comes to magic. He doesn't figure these things out. If it's something that only a muggleborn like Hermione could figure out due to physics, you have to explain why physics and magic sometimes contradict and sometimes don't. It's not as simple as "think of a creative use of magic" because thats the easy part. The harder part would be fitting it into a story without these kinds of questions ruining the immersion. There have been countless generations of wizards before we reach our point in this story. You need a reason why in this time this wasn't figured out, or if it was why it isn't common knowledge and use.
