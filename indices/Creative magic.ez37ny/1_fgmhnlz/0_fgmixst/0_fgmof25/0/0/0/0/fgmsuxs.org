You are ignoring my point completely.

  simple statement of the fact that I do not see many fics where magic, a nigh unstoppable, almost extradimentional force, is used creatively.

Have you ever heard of Sandersons First Law of Magic? in brief summary, magic can be used to resolve a problem only to the extent that we know beforehand how that magic works. If Magic is this " a nigh unstoppable, almost extradimentional force" then you need to explain why it isn't used this way. In either canon, or by everyone in your fanfic if the AU in that fanfic is that magic is unstoppable BS. Again, the hard part isn't making up fun new spells that Harry can use to ROFLstomp his enemies, its explaining why and how he can do that to a satisfactory manner that doesnt ruin the immersion of the story.

Why isn't this trick with a rock the number 1 way of killing dragons? Why isn't it taught at hogwarts? if it is, sure thats an explanation, now explain why the rest of the magic contradicts this particular instance, or rework all of magic (or atleast insofar as it concerns the main point of the stort) to the point where it makes sense.
