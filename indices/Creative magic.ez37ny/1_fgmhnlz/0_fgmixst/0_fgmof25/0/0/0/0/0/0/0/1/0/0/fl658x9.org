Okay. I'm going to attempt one last time.

I didnt say HP was a hard magic system nor treat it as such. I brought up Sandersons law because of its relevance to the original topic of this post, which was "why dont people use magic creatively, like something something banish and summon a pebble until it turns hot as shit then banish it at a dragon. That was the original topic, before you deleted your comment. I brought up Sandersons law because it applied to that, even to a soft magic system (despite your original prompts use of physics very arguably turning it into a hard magic system) as much as a hard one. Why dont people do that? Because they don't. Theres no canon explanation, and since we have smart people who dont do that, we must assume there is a reason, despite it not being present in canon.

This is my whole point. I added it to the first paragraph so you might hopefully read it for once. People dont do x, there are smart people who could think of doing x, therefore doing x must not be possible/practical.

I cannot believe you genuinely think you're the one bashing your head against the wall. If you didnt delete your comments, I'd find some subreddit equivalent of "am I the asshole here" that deals with idiots because either I am desperately failing to get my point across somehow, or you're just flat out not reading my comments. Or maybe you just have some sort of developmental issues, I genuinely cannot tell at this point.
