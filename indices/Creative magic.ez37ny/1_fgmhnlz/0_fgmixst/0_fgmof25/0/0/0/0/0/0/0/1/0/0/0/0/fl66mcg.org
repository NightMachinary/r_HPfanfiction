  read it and be amazed. Having said that if you ever see something I post take the time to realise you are no fun. Because that is ultimately what I was asking why do I not see more fun and creative uses of magic.

in regards to "be more fun"; fanfiction that doesnt explain why shit happens is bad fanfiction. But this is a point of opinion. Your interpretation of what constitutes a good fanfic isnt somehow more valid than mine, so get your head out of your ass.

  As to people being smart in the Harry Potter universe we know damn well they aren't given how only a small minority of people are stated to be death eaters yet all of books 5 through 7 are people cowering when they have the numbers advantage.

You ever seen a bank robbery? dozens and dozens of people cowering from 2-3 bank robbers? they're all goddamn idiots huh? oh no wait, they just dont want to fucking die and know that the bank robbers are willing to kill them, have training (dark arts would be the guns in this analogy) to kill them while they don't. Your complete oversimplification of everything is why you cant get a straight answer that fits your criteria.

Thank you though, for fucking finally, after god knows how many comments, responding to one of my comments in full. I think you genuinely read it this time. I'm not even being sarcastic.
