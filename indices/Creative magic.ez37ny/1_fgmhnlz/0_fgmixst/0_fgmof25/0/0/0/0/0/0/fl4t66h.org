...It's not in-universe law of magic, its a real world author's rule (Brandon Sanderson, author of many fiction novels) for how magic must work in a meta and narrative sense. Did you seriously not even try googling it? Ill spare you the effort of a simple google; "An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic". I even explained this in my last comment. Are you reading my comments at all?

Okay, let me try this again; In harry potter, people do not use magic as " a nigh unstoppable, almost extradimentional force". We must assume that everyone in HP universe isn't a goddamn idiot, or for some other reason choosing to ignore this utility of magic. Therefor, this utility of magic doesnt not exist. Magic is not nigh unstoppable because it is not used as such in series. This topic is over a month old, so quickly rereading, you were asking why people weren't using magic creatively. Well, either you must assume that everyone is pants-on-head retarded and didn't think of it, or you must assume for whatever reason it cannot be used this way.
