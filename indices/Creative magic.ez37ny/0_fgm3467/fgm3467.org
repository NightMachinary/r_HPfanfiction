In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts) and it in-progress sequel linkffn(Harry Potter and the Physical Adept), Harry uses D&D-influenced spells, with the implications of D&D magic. For example, /disintegrate/ is used to not only destroy architecture, but also for crime-scene clean up, and also for direct combat. /Alter self/ is used to gain the ability to fly without a broom, as well as disguise as other people.
