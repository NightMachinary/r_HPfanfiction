There are plenty of Harmony stories, where she finds out glorious secret (which apparently missed JKR completely), that Muggles have telephones, which no pureblood wizard knows about. Thus for example:

- “Eventful Summer” by Harry50 linkffn(13318258) ... premise is not bad, but eventually it turns out to be completely plot-free and author compensated with smut

- “Who Will Fill a Coward's Grave?” by RobSt linkffn(12117770) ... most stereotypic template-based Harmony possible

---- (added later)

(When I said the most stereotypical Harmony story, sorry, I misspoke, “No Thanks” by old-crow linkffn(2275101) and “Banking on Her” by RobSt linkffn(7392700) are the ones, but neither of them starts with the phone call).

On the other hand, phone call (if not in the start of the story) shows up rather important in “Testing Defenses” by canoncansodoff linkffn(3958679) (certainly not PG-13).
