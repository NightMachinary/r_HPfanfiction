Dumbledore didn't ask them to stop writing to Harry, but asked them NOT to talk about the Order and Voldemort. Fanon blew that part way out of proportion and escalated into 'Dumbledore not allowing Ron and Hermione to write to Harry at all'.

Even then, canon Harry was so pissed that he ordered Hedwig to peck on their hands.

--------------

Out of many Harmony fics that have Hermione just doing that, two particular ones stand out and do not follow the usual Dumbledore bashing pattern:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11102515/1/Uncle-Quentin-s-Spy][Uncle Quentin's Spy]]: Hermione at first obeyed Dumbledore's order, but soon receives some serious help. They would contact Harry directly. Dumbledore starts out a little slow and hesitantly, but eventually becomes really awesome.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5265558/1/What-If-An-Alternative-to-Order-Of-The-Phoenix][What If? ... An Alternative to Order Of The Phoenix]]: Harry and Hermione stayed in touch throughout that summer. So after the dementor, they, Sirius, and the Grangers all fled Britain. Dumbledore has no choice but to step up his own game, and has done rather well.
