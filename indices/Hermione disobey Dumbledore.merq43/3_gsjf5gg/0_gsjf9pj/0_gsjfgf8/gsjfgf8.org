Honestly, I haven't read Harry/Hermione orientated stories for years (as in like over 3/4ths of a decade) because of how bad they can be. Most rely on Weasley and Dumbledore bashing to push the fic through. I'm sure some of the Harmonians on here could point you to some good fics that have this pairing but aren't shit, though. Maybe try the Harmony subreddit?
