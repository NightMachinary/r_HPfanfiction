Way late, (I'm also looking for more fics like this) but I know of a couple.

It seems a ton of HP/Stargate crossovers use this.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8218585/1/A-Goa-uld-s-Life]["A Goa'uld's Life"]], Harry, shortly after absorbing the memories of his Hocrux does a number of rituals, among them one that increased the amount of his mind he uses at once to something like 70 percent (the book uses the myth of us using only 10 percent of our brains, where in reality we only use about 10 percent at any one time but all parts are pretty much used)

"[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5931066/1/Oma-s-Choice][Oma's Choice]]" by jacobds, abuses the fact that magical contracts can be falsified by a powerful confundus charm, like what happened to the tri-wizard Goblet of fire. Harry uses it, to, among other things, greatly increase his reading speed, memory, and understanding of what he's read.

Not magical means, but you may enjoy it anyway; In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8551180/1/In-the-Mind-of-a-Scientist]["In the Mind of a Scientist"]], and the sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9261735/1/Madness-at-the-Gate]["Madness at the gate"]] both by ZenoNoKyuubi, Harry Potter starts off as a slightly insane scientist at Hogwarts, in his third year, first fic goes through the rest of his schooling then his start at SG1. Eventually he creates a device that he implants into his head that preserves his mind predestine for the rest of his life with no deterioration. Later on, he creates an updated version with an extremely large database in it, able to be accessed mentally.

As for Occulmancy, I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10136172/1/Core-Threads][Core Threads]], he creates a very strange occulmancy world, giving him perfect memory even just glancing at a page is enough to absorb it (though he has to go into his mindscape and read it for real sort of, but for every hour in the mindscape is something like a day for him), protection against mental attacks and such. Eventually he creates mental avatars of sorts, among them a sort of librarian that makes suggestions based on what he's read and helps sort his memories.

"[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7913377/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Mind][Harry potter and the mind]]" by Overdog, he eventually finds a spell that lets him read and understand books far faster and better, and eventually creates a spell that stores and sorts every book he uses it on in his mind like a library with cross-references
