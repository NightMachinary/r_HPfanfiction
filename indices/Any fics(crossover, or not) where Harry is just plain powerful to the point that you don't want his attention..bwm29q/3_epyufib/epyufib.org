Linkffn(The Havoc Side of the Force by Tsu Doh Nimh) is a HP/Star Wars crossover. Not complete, but what is written is pretty good and it gets updated once in a while.

Linkffn(Legends of Potter by Roff) is actually the first fanfic I ever read. It's a SuperHarry! story. The writing is ok, not great. Fits your description though, there is no end to Harry's capabilities and he pretty much walks over everyone in his path.
