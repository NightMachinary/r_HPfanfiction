In the atrium battle Dumbledore blocks using chunks of stone that explode when hit with the curse. The reason I was suggesting an electric based spell is it leaves no mark when it kills it can hit anywhere and kill someone. It explodes stone that was used to block the spell but not the bronze statue that Dumbledore animated to defend Harry. Bronze would conduct the electricity and disperse it rather than absorb and explode.
