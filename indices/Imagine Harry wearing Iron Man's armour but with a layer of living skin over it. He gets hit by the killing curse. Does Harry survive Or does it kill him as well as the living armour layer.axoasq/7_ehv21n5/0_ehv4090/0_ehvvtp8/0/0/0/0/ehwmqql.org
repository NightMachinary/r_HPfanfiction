Nonono take a look at armor it's not just chunks of metal hanging on someone. I'm not talking about two sets of armor. When they wear armor it's the plate, chain under said plate then leather under that chain. So what would happen would be the curse would hit explode the front plate would be turned into shrapnel then stopped by the chain and dragon hyde chest peice. It's not a very high explosion bronze is able to stop it without shattering the statues in the ministry atrium.
