Extension: with magic it would be more than easy to "airgap" the space between the armour and the external skin with a significant amount of space due to magicals' ability to manipulate spacial dimensions. If sliced in half, from the outside it could look like it's coating it but actually have a foot of space or more between armour and external skin when viewed cut-on.
