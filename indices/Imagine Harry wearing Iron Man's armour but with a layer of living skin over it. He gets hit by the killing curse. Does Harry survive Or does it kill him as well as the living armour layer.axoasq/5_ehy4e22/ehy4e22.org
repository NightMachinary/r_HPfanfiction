Headcanon that the spell, when it doesn't literally hit a living body, sends out 'radiation.' The 'radiation' only extends a scant inch or so from where the spell terminated, but isn't blocked by whatever touched it. If the 'radiation' encounters a living body, then the full force of the spell is directed into the body and targets the soul, decoupling it from the body.

The explosion from a miss comes from the targeting radiation not finding an applicable target and the energy not having a place to discharge, and so physically burning/erupting.
