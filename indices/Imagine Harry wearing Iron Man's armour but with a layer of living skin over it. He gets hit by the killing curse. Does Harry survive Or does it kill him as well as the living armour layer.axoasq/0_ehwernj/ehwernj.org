I'm of the opinion that Magic works on a symbolic level. The Killing Curse is known to be impossible to shield against and therefore is.

Even if you have a reasonable and solid logical reasoning for believing that some type of armor should grant you shielding from the Killing Curse would literally be your undoing. /You/ would consider it a shield and, therefore, the Killing Curse would sail right through it.
