That's actually a difficult question since the killing curse goes through clothes but otherwise explodes. There is no canon indication on the effectiveness of armour, spaced or otherwise. Spaced armour should, in theory, protect you from the killing curse, but then you have a lot of molten metal flying towards you. So you probably need to wear a second layer of armour. Weight is not an issue with magic, but it would be very bulky and hinder movement considerably. Power armour would help with that, but you would still be restricted compared to regular armour or none.
