It depends on how unskillfully they do it.

I enjoy a lot of fics that include real life issues into them. And when they're done well, it can often elevate a fic. When they're done clumsily, however... well, let's just say I can't click the back button fast enough.

I think the issue here isn't that the author is pushing an agenda (since, after all, isn't all writing pushing /some/ sort of an agenda, at their basest level?), it's that they're using their characters as author mouthpieces without any real thought to how these characters would actually act as /human beings/. And sometimes it's like reading out of a textbook or a pamphlet. This aren't how people engage in these discussions! This just isn't how people /talk/!

So, yeah, I like when authors engage with actual issues, but they still have to treat their characters as people first. Otherwise, it just reads like a really badly written propaganda piece. Or a self-insert.
