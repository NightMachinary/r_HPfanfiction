You're in this community for a while now, you should have learned by now: A lot of fanfiction is crappy, ignore it. Close the tab, and move on.

I usually just skim over rants, if the story is good, otherwise I just stop the story.The problem with a thing like that it usually means that the author has no idea of how to write a good, flowing story with realistic human interaction.

People don't often /rant/ in real life, especially in a group of 4-5 people. Hermione never /ranted/ about House-Elves rights, because that's not her style. She uses short, convincing (in her eyes) arguments, and discusses. Short. Communication is two-way.

In real life it's usually like this: You can either convince the other person, or the two people will clash. People /interrupt/ each other. That is why every half-way premeditated discussion has a moderator. Be it in TV, in radio, or anywhere.

[[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36304313][Austria]] tried a debate once without moderator between professional politicians, and it turned into a shitfest. And these are people which have arguing as a job.

So neither a long discussion is realistic (unless between very good friends, and a topic they can kinda agree on - to refine the other's opinion, not to change it), nor is a rant in any two-way medium, except in very special cases.
