It depends. If it makes sense for a character to defend a view, or if it supports/moves along the plot, I'm indifferent about it. Any view I hold that can be changed by fanfiction is worthy of review anyway.

However, if it pauses the plot and becomes "ideology exposition" I close the tab.

You brought up Hermione and Ron arguing about women rights. Character wise it makes a lot of sense. Hermione is brought up in a highly educated household with both parents working (statistically speaking for a progressive family culture), while on the other side Ron grows up in an environment of a very traditional household. Its a culture clash. But then there are fics (,maybe I've read the same as you,) where the inevitable clash ends up being a presentation about the core points of feminism instead of a clever dialogue between two characters of opposite opinions.

In the end I couldn't care less as long as I'm entertained by it.
