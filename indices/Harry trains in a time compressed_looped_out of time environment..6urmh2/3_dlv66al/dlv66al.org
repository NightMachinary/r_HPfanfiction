This makes me think of a Stars Wars crossover fic where Harry goes through a mirror in the Dept of Mysteries and gets trained via torture by a Jedi (must have been a Sith?), and comes back kind of a sociopath who forgets who he was and attacks Tonks. Hermione has to remind him who he is , and ultimately it's a Harry / Hermione romance .
