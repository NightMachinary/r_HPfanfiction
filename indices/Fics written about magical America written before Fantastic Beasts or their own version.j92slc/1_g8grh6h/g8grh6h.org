- There's the /Alexandra Quick/ series, by Inverarity, starting with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra_Quick_and_the_Thorn_Circle][/Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle/]] is a long running series. I personally don't care for it, though, as most of the characters aren't very likeable. It's supposed to take place in the same world as /Harry Potter/ but it's largely disconnected from it. It /is/ darker and edgier than the mainline /Harry Potter/ series, but I'm not exactly sure what qualifies as "super dark and edgy" to you. It is, however, a long running series of novel-length fanfics, with 5 of the 7 planned fics having been released.

On that note, apparently that same fanfic author founded a community for fanfics taking place in America in the Wizarding World, called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/America-in-the-Potterverse/55015/][America in the Potterverse]]
