The problem with this one is it's age. It kickstarted a LOT of tropes that are prevalent in Harry/Tonks pairings, but it's one of the originals so you sort of have to give it a pass. If the author wrote it today I'm sure it wouldnt read as cliche and when I read it many many years ago it didn't seem nearly as overdone as it does now that I've read what seems like 100 Harry/Tonks fics.
