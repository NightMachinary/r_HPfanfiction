Thanks these are awesome!

In this case though I think I will leave it. In the scene, Tonks is having a visceral reaction to some disturbing news, and the POV character is literally seeing her eyeballs bug out. If my readers have a disgust response from the word 'orbs' then that kind of works for me lol.
