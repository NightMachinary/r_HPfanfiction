Using "orbs" instead of "eyes" reminds me of roleplaying on Proboards back in 2008. lol For the most part, I don't actually see this often, and I'm glad that seems to have died off a lot. I think it probably stems from teachings to avoid too much repetition (avoiding "said", using physical descriptors instead of repeating Harry/he/him all the time, etc.), but sometimes ahh... using the thesaurus is not the right call. :P
