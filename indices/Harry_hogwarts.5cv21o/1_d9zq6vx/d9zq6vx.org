[[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Sentient%20Hogwarts/works][Here's]] fics with a sentient Hogwarts on AO3. I know I've found examples of the Harry/Hogwarts pairing in the past, but honestly they are rarely any good so I don't have any of them saved. Another search term you can use is "Lady Hogwarts" as that seems to result in pairings as well, although there will be some cases where Hogwarts' feelings run more along the lines of maternal affection.
