[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11269078/1/To-Be-a-Slytherin][To be a Slytherin]] is really, really long, despite skipping Year 2 and 3. It's about Harry's sightly dark-ish Slytherin twin sister Lorena and her adventures. I haven't finished it yet but so far so good. Also, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10672917/chapters/23626929][The debt of time]] is quite controversial in this community but I adore it regardless. It's a Hermione/Sirius romance that starts during the war when she brings him back from the Ark and continues when she is thrown back in time to the Marauders' past and adopted by James Potter's parents as his sister. The story is rich and interesting and the romance is very well written. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7453087/1/Pride-of-Time][Pride of time]] is a very realistic take on a Hermione/Severus ship. It all begins when she comes back in time to his younger years. But the story also tells about his and Hermione's daughter who's the same age as Harry and co and knows that her mother is also her classmate.
