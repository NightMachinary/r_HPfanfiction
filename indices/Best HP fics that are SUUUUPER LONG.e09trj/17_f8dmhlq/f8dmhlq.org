Sovran's Meaning of One: [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54]]

Seriously, this is like the third time in one bathroom break I've rec'd this.

It's a Hinny Soul-Bond which (rightfully) is a turn off for some people, but this is I think objectively the best fic, at least that I've read so far. Each character feels like their canon counterparts, it is a gripping, tense, and emotional rewrite of Hogwarts, and has some brilliant twists and turns I don't think I've seen anywhere else. The bond itself, normally a trap for uncomfortable moments and trashy tropes in similar stories, is well thought out and given a clear explanation of it's mechanics early on, and the relationship that builds between Harry and Ginny is handled with tact and maturity, while also acknowledging the weirdness (read: puberty) that comes with the bond they have and at their age.

Though honestly, I'd read this fic even just for McGonagall.
