The author doesn't start posting until she's done with the fic. And it sounds like she's mostly done with book 4:

"How close am I to finishing, I hear you ask? (In my mind, at least...) Well, that's the bad news, I still have a lot to go. BUT I'm a lot /closer/ to being finished, and I'd say I'm comfortably over half done, perhaps around two thirds. All the major events are plotted out; I know where this fic is going, and I know how it's going to end. I also know it's going to need ten more chapters to get that all down with the lavish detail I enjoy writing. Y'all want a really long story, right? (If not, you might be disappointed...)

I won't rest on my laurels and I'll continue to try and keep up the pace now I've built some good daily writing habits over the past two months of frenetic writing."

So hopefully we'll see book 4 come out in the next few months--remember to follow the author on ffn.
