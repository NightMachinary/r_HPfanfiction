Thought of another great, long series: linkffn(11591125) First fic is pre-Hogwarts, the author currently goes through 3rd year. The premise is that Harry tries to be 'normal' to please the Dursley's, so that they'd treat him more like a son. It sort of works, and he's treated better, but the Dursley's still don't really love him. Interesting worldbuilding, Harry learns about traditional pagan religious beliefs in the wizarding world.
