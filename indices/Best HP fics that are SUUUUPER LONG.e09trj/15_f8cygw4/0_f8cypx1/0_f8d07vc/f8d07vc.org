The story is really good, my main gripe with it is that it is long-winded and that the author decides to undo lots of this story's character development of Harry near the end of the second part / at the beginning of the third part.

If you like the premise of Snape taking in Harry, check out the "A Very Slytherin Harry" series by geoffaree - 560k words and growing. I actually prefer that series over "Like None Other".

And a long story that really impressed me and blew my mind was "HP and the Conspiracy of Blood" by cambangst. 250k.
