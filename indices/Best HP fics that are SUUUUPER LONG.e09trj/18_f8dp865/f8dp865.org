linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach by acgoldis)

I have not actually read this (waiting for enough time to be available) but it is complete and about only 50K words short of the /entire/ HP series (so should fit your criteria). I really like the summary of the fic and I am pretty sure it would be a great read.
