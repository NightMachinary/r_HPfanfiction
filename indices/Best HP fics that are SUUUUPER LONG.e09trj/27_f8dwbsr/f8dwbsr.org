I'm reading Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux atm, and part 1 and 2 together are at around 500.000 words and it's still being updated (last update Nov. 18) so I'm hopeful this will continue. The first couple of chapter before Harry went to Hogwarts were a little boring to me, but the rest is great. linkffn(11762850)
