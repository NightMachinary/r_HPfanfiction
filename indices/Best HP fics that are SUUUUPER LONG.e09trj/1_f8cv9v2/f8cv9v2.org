A long story I recommend is the “Sacrifices Arc” seven-book series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]], which starts with the book [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][/Saving Connor/]]. At around 3 million words, the series goes very deep into world-building, scene-setting, and side characters, and it wrapped up every plot point I cared about by the end. I enjoyed it enough to finish it. The length is not perfect, however -- when I tried to reread it later, I gave up around book four because I felt the story was moving too slowly and getting tedious.
