linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky; Stranger in an Unholy Land; The Odds were never in my favour; Harry Potter and the Homecoming; Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament; Harry Potter and the fifth element; Black Bond by centaurprincess)

HP and the Homecoming is part of a 6-part series, its around 500k words in total ? something like that.

Though HP and ITT isn't 'massive', at 300k so far, I know for sure that it will be way longer, at least 500k when its done. And its constantly updating.

Black Bond and Fifth element, though massive, are abandoned (Fifith should have a sequel, but it doesn't, and Black Bond has one with 150k words, but abandoned as well).

Eclipse of the Sky is by far my favourite fic all time, rarely have I ever met a better person as the author, and even if the begining of the fic is arguably bad (it was written around 20years ago) the rest is great imho.

Stranger though it has a sequel its 'complete' as it is.
