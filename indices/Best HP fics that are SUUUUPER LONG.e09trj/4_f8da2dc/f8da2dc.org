With its cast of entirely OC's and its unique take on Magical America, the Alexandra Quick series, linkffn(3964606), barely counts as a fanfiction at this point. But it currently stands at around 1.2 million words, which is already longer than the Harry Potter series, and there's still another ~110,000 words of book 5 that have been written but not yet released. Depending on the length of book 6 & 7 when they are eventually finished, the series could end up being close to 2 million words.
