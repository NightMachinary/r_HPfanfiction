linkao3(6835726) Great D&D/Harry Potter crossover fic. Plot is similar to canon early on, but diverges a lot around later on. Mostly follows Rose (OC from D&D universe), Harry is more of a side character. Only fic I've read which includes Sally-Anne Perks as a major character. Note the warning on the main story page: "Warning: Starts out light and cracky, but gets darker the farther in you get." Stop after book 3 if you can't handle major characters dying (won't say which one here, but read the author's description for book 5 if you want to know who).

linkao3(12608820) My 2nd favorite WBWL fic after Prince of Slytherin, which you probably already know of if you read [[/r/HPfanfiction]]. Has a lot of tropes many people don't like (Slytherin!Harry, WBWL, and tropes associated with those things), so skip it if you can't stand those things, but very well written.
