Most fics mentioned here I did not make it through. They become stale and boring after ~500k words. But I have a 1.800.000 word fic I have read multiple times and that is still updated regularly:

Linkffn(9443327)

I am not big into Marvel but still absolutely adore the story. It always stays interesting and is one of the few HP fics with some space travel. But I have heard from multiple others who are deep into Marvel, not just the movies, that they love how many of the more obscure characters are used in the story.

The author also has multiple other fics that are pretty long.
