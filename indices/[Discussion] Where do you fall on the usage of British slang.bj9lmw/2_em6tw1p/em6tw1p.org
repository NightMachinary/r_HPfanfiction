Actually understanding the vernacular is key.

Snog isn't a direct replacement for kiss, it means making out.

Arse is used instead of ass.

Loo is used instead of bathroom, but lavatory or simply toilet see equal or increased usage depending on the formality.

I really have no problem reading a fic based on American English, so long as they don't have a half-arsed attempt at seeming British.
