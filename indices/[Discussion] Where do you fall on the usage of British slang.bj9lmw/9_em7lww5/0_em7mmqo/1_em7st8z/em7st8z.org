And when they describe pancakes and it becomes clear that they mean the thick American ones.

If you can't roll it up without breaking it, it's not a pancake. And while you can presumably have fruit as a filling, I've never heard of anyone putting anything other than batter in the batter.

Also, I'm seriously salty over the lack of Shrove Tuesday in fics. It's theoretically a christian religious thing but mostly it's 'the day you eat pancakes'.
