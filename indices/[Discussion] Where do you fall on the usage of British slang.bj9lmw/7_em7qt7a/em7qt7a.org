As a reader, I find it very jarring when there's lots of Americanisms; a few is fine, as an Australian there's definite use of both American and British slang terms, so I imagine there's some similar absorption into British common use. But there's one thing that drives me literally up the wall. Biscuits are what you would call a cookie. Do not. Ever. (Unless it's an American character in the scene or a deliberate move on your partpartly whatever reason) have a non American eating whatever 'biscuits' are in AmericaLand for breakfast. Especially if you're going to have a character eat a 'full English breakfast', because just no. I apologise for the rant but oh my god it drives me insane...
