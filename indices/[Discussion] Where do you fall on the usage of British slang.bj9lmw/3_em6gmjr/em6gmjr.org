When I'm reading a Harry Potter fic I like to see British turns of phrase, but it's not essential.

I'll only get annoyed if the British characters in the fic frequently use American curse words. To me that seems like laziness and poor taste when the author could have easily spent a little time either brit-picking or making up wizarding world equivalents that would be more in-character. The cursing doesn't make me instantly drop a fic, but usually that sort of fic has other quality issues that make me stop reading it.
