I see what you're saying, I think reducing the whole colourful world of swearing down to two words is bad writing, regardless of setting. We are a country of very creative cursing, but I can assure you we say fuck and bitch a whole lot. So having characters also use them a whole lot isn't really all that bad, but using ONLY those two definitely is.
