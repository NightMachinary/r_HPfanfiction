It's important to realise that there's a lot more to British slang than meets the eye. Each region has its own words for various things. Sometimes these words are used over quite a wide area while sometimes it's a village-only term that baffles anyone from over 20 miles away.

As someone born and bred in the northwest of England I use the term "ginnel" for what most people here would call an "alley". There was a thread on swearing recently where we agreed the word "pillock" is a more northern term too.

There's also a class thing going on too, although that's becoming less true these days. Fifty years ago someone trying to be seen as upper class wouldn't ever have used a term as vulgar as "lavatory", let alone "loo". It was "cloakroom" or "water closet" if they had to.

In Harry Potter terms it means that there are going to be big differences between the way Draco, Neville, Harry and Seamus (to pick four names almost at random) speak.

Realistically though, it's not worth putting that level of detail into a fanfic, where most people are going to ignore the effort you put into realistic portrayals of characters' upbringings in favour of asking who's going to be paired with whom.
