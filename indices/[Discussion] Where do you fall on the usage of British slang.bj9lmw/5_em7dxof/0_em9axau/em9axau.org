  Realistically though, it's not worth putting that level of detail into a fanfic, where most people are going to ignore the effort you put into realistic portrayals of characters' upbringings in favour of asking who's going to be paired with whom.

You should put in some, though. I'll agree that your example would be overkill, but I remember seeing in one story Augusta Longbottom saying something like, "You kids go have fun." I think something along the lines of, "You children run along and amuse yourselves" would have been more in character.
