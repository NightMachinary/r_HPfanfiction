I almost always describe distances to people in terms of the length of time it takes to cover them. A twenty minute walk, a half hour cycle. The other measure of distance which seems to fox friends from across the pond is “as the crow flies” e.g. “oh it's only ten miles as the crow flies but it's a 40 minute drive”
