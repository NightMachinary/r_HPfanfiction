In the UK we don't use blocks because almost none of our cities are based on grids. I think Terry Pratchett once wrote how most cities evolve around the paths that cows used to take down to the river, which is probably a bit of an exaggeration but at least plausible.

If you look at a map of, say, New York, you can see easily identifiable blocks of buildings divided by roads in pretty much a grid. Now look at central London. It's all over the place - and this is a city that had its centre cleared out 350 years ago thanks to the great fire.

So while the idea of "three city blocks" might make sense in an American context, it makes none in a UK context.
