  So while the idea of "three city blocks" might make sense in an American context, it makes none in a UK context.

yes, this point especially. "Harry walked the rest of the way as it was only four blocks." makes no sense, either use miles or how long it takes to walk or travel somewhere.

It is also rarely a straight path to drive or walk somewhere , especially getting around in London if you are not a regular in the area, should lead to the character being lost once in a while. My uncle, who has been living in London for nearly 40 years, still occasionally gets lost because paths change. He explained it to me once as "London is alive, sometimes a street you have been walking down for years will suddenly be blocked and you have to find a new way". This offers many great writing opportunities especially in a magical world.
