I totally agree with the perspective/dialogue point. Sometimes, as an American reading some of those ridiculous British spellings of words, it can detract a little, but... I don't know, just feels like I owe it to Rowling. She's letting us all play around with her world a bit (She hasn't revoked that right yet) and as homage, I use some silly spellings and words.
