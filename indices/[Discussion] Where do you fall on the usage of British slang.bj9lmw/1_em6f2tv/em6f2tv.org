When I'm writing, I try to use the British slang and spelling because I feel it matches closer to the source material. When I'm reading, I don't really mind, but if there's a word that I know to be of a different cultural origin that wouldn't normally be in the Harry Potter universe, then I start to get a bit peeved and will probably drop it.
