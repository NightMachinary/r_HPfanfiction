According to the Hogwarts rumor mill, Draco didn't visit him on the train ride that year. So Harry started stalking him to see what's up.

Some students suggest that his first attempt led to a confrontation and resulted to Harry getting a bloody nose. It is of popular opinion that Draco was upset of the fact that Harry only started showing interest when Draco stopped giving him attention.
