The Darkness: an elemental force that allows access to an otherworldly dimension and control over the demons who dwell there.

Adjective: a word or phrase naming an attribute(in this case, Wielding the power of the Darkness), added to or grammatically related to a noun to modify or describe it.

Because it modifies the Harry to denote it's my Darkness story, it does work as an adjective, even if the word, traditionally, isn't. I could use Wielder!Harry but too many morons would think I meant welder.
