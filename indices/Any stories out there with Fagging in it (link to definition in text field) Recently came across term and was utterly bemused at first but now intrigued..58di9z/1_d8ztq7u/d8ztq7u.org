A-ha! Time to recommend this old gem again. Linkffn(705541). I'll always praise this for how well it manages to convey pureblood and school social interaction, in a subtle, interesting manner that manages not to become overbearing or pretentious.

Fagging is included, although the tradition is of course called elfing here.
