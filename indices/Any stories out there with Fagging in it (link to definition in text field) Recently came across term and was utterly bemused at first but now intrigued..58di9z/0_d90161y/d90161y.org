I'm surprised to actually see this mentioned. You bought up some tales I almost forgot about.

I went to an all-boys' private school, and this was a practice, just kept quiet. I got in solely because of my doctor who recommended me there, stating that it may help me. The first thing to remember is that it was a christian school and I don't believe in God. People soon realised that I wasn't praying and I got it when the boys all got out of eyesight by the teachers. Rather hypocritical because none of them really did either, they were just wealthy and attended the school that cost the most.

It wasn't called 'fagging' here, because that was far too close to the homosexual word and heaven forbid they be gay! I'm going to skip a lot of the unneeded stuff, but I essentially waited on hand for them and as I got older, it got more and more sexual. It started with being asked to 'prepare' someone so he could 'enjoy' himself. At that point, I was just so used to doing whatever they asked, I didn't even question it.

Long story short, it helped me find my sexuality and I wouldn't change it no matter what... Okay, I derailed this thread, but I'm also interested in any fics you guys have.

Edit: I may do this for my next fic.
