On FFN the author mak5258 has a number of really good ones. Sin & Vice and The Master, the Warden, the Headmaster, and the Deputy and probably my favs, but there are others I remember enjoying.

The Occluded Soul by Aurette is really good.

I know I have more bookmarked, but I can't search through my bookmarks on my phone lol. I'll try to remember to post some others when I get home ðŸ˜„
