If anybody reads this please don't take the science at face value. There are some egregious errors closely linked with racial pseudoscience. I don't know anything about the author so I won't make any claims about what they were thinking, but imo their disclaimer that they are intentionally including mistakes is irresponsible especially given how the story has acted as an entry point for many people.
