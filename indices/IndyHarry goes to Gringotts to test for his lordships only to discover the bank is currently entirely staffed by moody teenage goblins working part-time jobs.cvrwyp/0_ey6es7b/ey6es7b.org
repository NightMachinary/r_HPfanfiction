“Can I help you?” The goblin asked.

He was shorter than what Harry was used to seeing, and had a few piercings on his very long nose. He was flipping through a booklet on gold futures lazily.

“Um, yes. I'm here to get a blood test to confirm my right as heir to the head of the Black, Slytherin and Potter households, and confirm my status as head of their lordships,” Harry replied in his most confident voice. He bowed, and made sure not to make eye contact as he was told was custom in goblin etiquette.

“What are you doing?” The goblin, Bonenasher, as was written on his name tag asked nastily. “Get back up. We don't do that here, you idiot.”

“But,” Harry protested, “I was told...”

“Obviously someone told you that because they knew you'd be an easy target. Anyway, I can perform a blood test only for accounts you have access to. The rest you have to take up with the Ministry.”

“So, will you do that?” asked Harry.

“No, I'm on break. Come back in twenty minutes.”

“But you're at the counter, couldn't you just...”

“What part of I'm on break don't you understand? Now, scram before I close all your accounts.”

“Can I leave my name with you?”

“You can wait back in queue with the others. The current estimate for waiting times is about one hour.” Bonenasher replied, flipping a page.

“This is ridiculous!” Harry shouted, leaving in a huff.

“Thank you for coming to Gringotts, we value your business,” Bonenasher replied in a full monotone, flipping another page.
