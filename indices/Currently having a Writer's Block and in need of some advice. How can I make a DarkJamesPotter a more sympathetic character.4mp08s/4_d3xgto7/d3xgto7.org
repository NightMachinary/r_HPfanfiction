The best way to make an evil character sympathetic is to assign the person some positive characteristics, for example:

- Loyalty, they might be a brutal torturers and murderers, but they would never betray the person they sworn allegiance to.

- Strong sense of honor, never breaking promises once made.

- Intelligent and wise, even though they were doing bad things, their schemes were so clever you have to pay them respect.
