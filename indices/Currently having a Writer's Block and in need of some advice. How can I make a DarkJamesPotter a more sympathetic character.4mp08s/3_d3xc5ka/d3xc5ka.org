Make him worry about this development towards the dark via means of internal struggle. Give him a strong set of morals, which directly conflict with the methods he wants to use. Basically make him a character who inherently dislikes the idea of the end justifying the means, who finds himself justifying the means, because the alternatives to the end would be even worse.

You can increase this up to the point of self-loathing.

A reader will now probably sympathize with him, because people who are thrown into a dilemma and still manage to cling onto a sense of right and wrong (even if they end up acting contrarian to this moral code of theirs) are something people like.
