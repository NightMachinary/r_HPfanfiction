Start off by having him use slightly Dark spells in the past to help in hopeless situations, maybe together with Sirius (who through his family knows at least some Darker stuff) or another friend so he feels like it's not that bad. Then, when he realises just how strong it can be, he starts down a slippery slope, always telling himself that he can handle just a little bit more, until he turns around and realises how far he's fallen (a bit like a drug addiction - he thinks he can quit at any time, until he tries to quit).
