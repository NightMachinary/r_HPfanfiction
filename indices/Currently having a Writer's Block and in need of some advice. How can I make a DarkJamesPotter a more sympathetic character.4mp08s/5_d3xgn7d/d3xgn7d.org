The need for power is created because of opposition from mostly purebloods that heir of a noble family like the Potters is marrying a mudblood. Voldemort and James meet somewhere during the war and they have a subtle conversation(while dueling) about how Voldemort would change that perception of just Lily in society. Voldemort is very aware of how sick James is of the pressure he's getting from political figures and his parents to not marry Lily. James sees the potential of being able to change peoples thoughts about his wife if he performed somewhat of a coup but doesn't like Voldemort's means of getting there nor him only caring about one muggleborn(he would like equality for more muggleborn) so he does it with his own friends, his own way(He finds Dumbldore's Order to be too passive and weak with its action) It becomes a 3 way battle between 3 sects(Dumbledore,James,Voldemort) . James starts out battling light but in a critical battle where Sirius almost dies he throws out a dark curse he knows off handedly from experience. Sirius notices and tries to talk about it but James swears off of it and says he won't do it again. The power of the curse he slings out however begins to eat at him and consume him. Voldemort sees this and the power behind the curse and offers him an invitation to his corps and James denies the invitation and says hes nothing like him. However he doubts that what he says is true because he enjoys the power behind dark magic.
