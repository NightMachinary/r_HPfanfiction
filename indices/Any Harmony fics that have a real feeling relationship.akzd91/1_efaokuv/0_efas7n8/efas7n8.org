wow so much to get through there thanks! I've read none of this honestly i mostly just read femslash of Hermione and various witches. Though Harry/Hermione has appealed to me for awhile now but ones i stumble on are far too lovey dovey and Hermione loses a bit of herself and becomes too passive and less critcal of harry's more reckless actions and there is no fire in the relationship, i dont like them being so totally loved up they just let each others flaws slide as thats boring ahaha thanks again for all the recs
