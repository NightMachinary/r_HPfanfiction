I know you've recommended this one a lot, so could you give me a brief summary? Is it more geared towards action? Romance? Is it more Ron/Hermione focused or is it evenly balanced with Harry/Ginny? Are the trio presented as "super" versions of themselves? Is there any drama in the relationships or are they conflict-free outside of battles with Death Eater-types?
