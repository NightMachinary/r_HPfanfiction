I know of a few where Harry is some sort of "half-breed." They are typically WAY off the rails though. One he was half phoenix, one where he was an elemental spring to mind. Wouldn't recommend either tbh. There are plenty of stories with Harry and Hermione being animagus together. But I don't think that's what you are after.
