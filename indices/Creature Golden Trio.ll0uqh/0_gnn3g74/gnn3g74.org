You know, I'm tempted to write this. I have something kind of similar in my 'fics to write someday if I get bored/have time' where a magical virus is released that turns every magical /not/ already an animagus into a creature/human hybrid. (Basically a Grindlewald nazi that wanted to make 'super soldiers' escaped and spent the years since inside his self-sufficient country house/manor hideaway under Fidelius. When he's almost dead of old age/health problems he says screw it and relases the virus in every magical shopping district worldwide a few weeks before classes start. Long incubation with zero symptoms until it's too late.)

Basically the virus kills people, its a warping of the animagus transformation, so the only way to surrive is to learn the animagus transformation. This happens during third year, Sirius hears about it, gets into Dumbledore's office and begs him to let him help/take veritaserum.

Sirius and others help students complete animagus transformation to surrvive. Their human form is still half-animal though.

I don't really have a lot of plot, more relationship driven than anything else. I imagine Harry as a gryphon, Hermione as a tiger, and luna as some white cat with elf-ears with lava-lamp markings that constantly move and are affected by her mood. If i did this I'd probably make neville a dragon and have him and harry have the instinctive urge to kill each other, since Harry's animal is capabable of killing dragons, but only if an ambush/instant kill works out.

This would basically be the end of the Pureblood movement, and a massive upheaval in magical society. No more easily walking among muggles.
