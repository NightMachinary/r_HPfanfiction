linkffn(Saving Connor) is the first in a 7-book series (plus a one-shot!) following Slytherin!Harry. James/Lily live, Harry is sorted in Slytherin, but his twin Connor goes into Gryffindor. Eventual Drarry in the later books.

Note: It was published almost 15 years ago. Thus, many aspects of the series are seen as "tropey" now, but they were unique back then. I'll list the tropes under a series of spoiler tags as some of them are "spoiler-ish".

WBWL, magical cores, Pureblood Culture, grey!Harry, and Severitus (not bio-dad but adopted dad) make up the main tropes Characters bashed: nearly all traditional "Light" characters in the series, mainly James, Lily, Dumbledore Deeper tropes: magical characters, goblin relations, dark/grey/light/wild magic, blocked magical cores, vows, to name a few.

I know that seems like /a lot/, but it truly is a good series imo. I reread it about once a year and enjoy it every time.
