Certainly things like lack of empathy, complete boredom and frustration at everyday life, inability to connect to anyone in school, or even teachers in their 30s/40s... Realistically, the person who he's going to relate most to is Dumbledore. In fact, you could have manipulative!Dumbledore in full swing and immortal!Harry would think it's all very reasonable.

Now you said he "combined" with his younger self, so it's not just him there. Does he have access to all his memories? All his power and skills? Maybe he's lost access to magic that he'd taken for granted for centuries. Which personality is in control? Are they fighting? Maybe he thinks that the other personality inside him is Voldemort, when it's actually his younger self. Maybe the ultimate tragedy is that immortal!Harry is simply incapable of winning against Voldemort, so he needs to give up his consciousness (i.e. die) and let 15yo!Harry resume his life.
