I am wanting to have canon Dumbledore as much as I can. But I like your point that he would have a hard time relating to just about everyone. And I also like your point that Harry would understand Dumbledore's motives more so being older. I think that I will incorporate that into the story.

As far as "combined" goes, basically older Harry was consumed by younger Harry because older Harry isn't a natural element to the time period. So older Harry has taken over the body. However, muscle memory for spells and fighting, physical strength and anything else that would have been stored in the body is set at where young Harry would be. So his center of balance will be off and he'll have to relearn how to cast spells because the wand movements are no longer natural.

As far as his memories, he remembers his childhood like a lot of older people do - it's kind of a blur and more like a dream than reality. There are of course major points that he remembers, but the details of it are fuzzy.

I really like your idea of the two Harry's and him having to truly die for Voldemort to die. I also wanted to incorporate in the scar horcrux and have problems with it because of it have to get used to older Harry's soul in the body.

Do you think with all the boredom and frustration that Harry would stay at school? I could see him leaving but I don't know what would be the final straw or what would be enough to trigger it...
