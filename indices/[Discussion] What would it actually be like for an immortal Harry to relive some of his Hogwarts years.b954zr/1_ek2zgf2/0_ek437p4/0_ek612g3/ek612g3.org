Hard to say. It depends on what sort of story you want to tell, and how you've characterised him up to that point. If it were my story, I could definitely see him getting frustrated within the first couple of months of just normal school, leaving to go and try and kill Voldemort/fix everything, but failing and probably making things worse in some way. But then he'd return to school and be really depressed for a while (especially since Umbridge would gloat). I don't know where I'd take it from there, though.
