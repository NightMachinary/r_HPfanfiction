Read linkffn(basilisk-born) as it has something similar to this. I feel dumbledores reaction would depend on when he noticed. For instance Harry saw someone die right in front of him and was tortured and nearly killed by a fully reborn full power Voldemort. That would be enough to change pretty much anyone. A good bit of knowledge can be attributed to simply reading and we see a pretty independent Harry already in fifth year canon so it wouldn't be too big a stretch. I feel like Harry would be distant and different because the friends he has haven't been through the same things his older friends has so they're not the same person. I feel like dumbledores reaction would depend on how he found out and what kind of dumbledore you're going for. Evil dumbledore, human dumbledore, Harry must die dumbledore, etc.
