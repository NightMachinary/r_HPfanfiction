What kind does Harry come from? Is it the same or different? That would allow you to keep future knowledge from being too useful which is a major reason people follow stations of canon. Just DONT under any circumstances do a bullshit reason to follow canon that gets people to stop reading real fast. I don't remember the name but there was one story where Harry had the prophecy, he knew Voldemort had a plan to lure him there to get it, knew Sirius and everyone was safe and somehow still ended up in the DoM fight. That is something that makes me and others drop a fic fast.
