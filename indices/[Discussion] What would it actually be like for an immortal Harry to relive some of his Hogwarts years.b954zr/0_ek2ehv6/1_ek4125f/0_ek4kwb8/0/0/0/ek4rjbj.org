Yeah I definitely need to nail down the exact age of Harry. I am working on flushing out the butterfly effect as well. Like Harry missed the dementors, so there will be a whole plot point there later on of how this effected the Dursley's. And the world that Harry finds himself in is the canon world. Though it won't stay cannon for very long. There will be somethings that stay the same of course, but I really want to get away from stations of canon. I really appreciate your help, this is my first fic so I appreciate any and all help!
