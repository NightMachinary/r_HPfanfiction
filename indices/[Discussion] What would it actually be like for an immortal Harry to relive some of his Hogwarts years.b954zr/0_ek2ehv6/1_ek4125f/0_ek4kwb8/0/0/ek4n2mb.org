I used to see dumbledore in a worse light but if it's first person I'd suggest looking at things from an adult perspective. For instance when I was younger my thoughts were more dumbledore should be getting Harry ready to fight and giving him information and all. But now I can only imagine myself doing exactly that and trying to find any option that doesn't place a child on the front lines of a war. Also definitely decide how old you want to make the Harry in control when this happened as it will effect maturity and reasonable knowledge. Another is how close things should follow cannon. I'd suggest using the whole butterfly effect thing with changes becoming more and more pronounced as time goes on. Also is this world going to be the same as the one he came from or is it going to be more alternate reality based then time travel.
