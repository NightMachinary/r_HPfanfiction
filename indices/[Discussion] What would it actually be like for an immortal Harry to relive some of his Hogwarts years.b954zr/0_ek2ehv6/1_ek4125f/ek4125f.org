I will definitely start reading that fic. I've seen it recommended a lot but have never gotten around to reading it.

As far as Dumbledore goes, I want to keep him as close to canon Dumbledore as possible. I am thinking that he would act cautiously from a distance and then might subtly challenge him to see what he's capable of. I just don't know if once it's known that something is different how Dumbledore would respond.
