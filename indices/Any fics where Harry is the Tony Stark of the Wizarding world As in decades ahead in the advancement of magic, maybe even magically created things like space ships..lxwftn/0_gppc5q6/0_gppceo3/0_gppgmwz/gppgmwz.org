Harry stared down at his latest creation from above. Studying its performance as he brushed his badarse goatee with his calloused fingers.

The /Magic Legion/ had deployed. And so far, there were no mistakes.

As a Head Auror he had always been buggered by the growing flow of evil wizards and whatnot, and, no matter how skilled he was, he couldn't be everywhere at once.

The /Legion/ provided him a way to deal with that.

A set of XV century armours enchanted to move, cast spells, fly and kick arse on their own, the Magic Legion was the solution to all of the Auror Office's countless problems. The Aurors would now be allowed to do more effective and less dangerous work, like overseeing their new army.

"I don't know Harry, what if they turn against us?" Ron asks, rubbing his thick a manly moustache.

"I created them, I can put them down."

"I hope, for our sake, you're right."

Then a young man raced to them. He was blond and had an intense beard, "Harry, we have a situation," he said between heavy breathing.

It was Neville.
