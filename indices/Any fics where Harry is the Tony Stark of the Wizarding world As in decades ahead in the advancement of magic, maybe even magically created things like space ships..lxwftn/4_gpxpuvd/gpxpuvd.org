Funny thing, I'm writing a story where the last chapter introduced a magic powered rocket engine.

I'm also thinking of detailed plans for a magical spaceship, but I'll have to write a few more chapters until that can realistically be developed.

Talking of Tony Stark, there could be military applications for the magitech that I'm already planning to include, so that could be a very profitable opportunity.
