As to Dark Magic being jinxes, hexes and anything offensive. I don't buy it. JKR is very ambiguous about it. George Weasley lost an ear and Moody was scarred by Dark Magic. Which means it cannot be reversed. Yet Snape reversed the curse on Draco (it could be because he invented it or was just that skilled) and as you said Dark Magic can easily reversed with a counter-spell. So I'll take anything from canon on that front with a grain of salt.

As to Unforgivables. Is it only for them? I'm not sure, the canon evidence is fragmented. Some spells require the intent component others don't as the plot requires. But I like to think they do require at least some level of malice, ro they wouldn't work. You can't say Harry didn't want to actually hurt Draco, who was about to use the Torture Curse on him.
