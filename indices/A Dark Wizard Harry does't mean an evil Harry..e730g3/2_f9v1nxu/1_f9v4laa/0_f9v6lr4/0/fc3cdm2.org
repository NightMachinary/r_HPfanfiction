Kill, yes. Obviously.

Mutilate, perhaps. If it's truly necessary - for instance, a being as resistant to magic as a troll or giant, but imperioused or confounded into fighting the good guys; no stunner works, so you've gotta disable him.

Rape? Never. Never, never, never, never. you don't have to rape, EVER. I don't know why you say this, but there's no situation in which rape is the correct or preferred solution.

Interrogation, torture, breaking their pride/will? There are far more effective means to do that. Any other "reasons" cannot be justified in any way.
