Pretty much. But they would not be "Dark not Evil" as most fanfiction writers understand the term.

War makes people into monsters. That's the reality of it. If you want to be a soldier in a war, you have to kill, mutilate, possibly rape. Soldiers are not angels and they never will be.

Even the limited war in the wizarding war has it's share of terrible things happening. People will be traumatized by it, no doubt. My only issue is how the fanfiction authors deal with. Usually they don't. Everything is fine and dandy between the Imperius Curse (stripping a person of their will) or Torture Curse (torturing them with the intent to do it) or the Killing Curse (you just want the other person to DIE).

Dark magic is Evil, with a capital E. No way around it. But it can be used to do good, just like a rifle or an artillery shell.

P.S. The only other problem, is that it's impersonal to fire a rifle. You can become detached. It's part of your training. You can never be detached from casting a curse in the Wizarding World. Remember: You have to mean it.
