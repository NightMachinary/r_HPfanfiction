  He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.

--- Friedrich Nietzsche

By throwing these kids to the wolves, by making them the frontline fighters against those sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums, the establishment of Wizarding Britain has created a whole generation of hardened and ruthless child soldiers.

They won a brutal victory against overwhelming odds, after experiencing unimaginable hardships and suffering, so don't ever expect them to go easy on their enemies. Even the Wizard Jesus can only take so much, and he will crucio any enemy who spits on his friends. His friends will be even less forgiving.

I think if you want to write realistic, but not fairytale characters, pretty much every good guy who went through Year 7 and the Final Battle will have to commit at least a few atrocities of their own. Some would recover, some would not.
