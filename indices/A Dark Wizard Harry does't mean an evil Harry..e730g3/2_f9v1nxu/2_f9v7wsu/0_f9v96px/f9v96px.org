It's the point we're making. At least I am.

Most fanfiction authors, the vast majority, simplify the choices and morality of their characters to appeal to the largest audience and/or to satisfy their own simplistic view of the world.

The actual psychology of people in war is incredibly complex and while I don't expect the levels of All Is Quiet on the Western Front, at least some acknowledgement of the realities of killing someone would be appreciated. Just basic empathy.

But no. Most "Evil Harry" stories are torture fests and affirmation of evil is good morality. Similarly most "Dark Harry" stories gloss over the fact that he kills people just because he wants to with no effects on his psyche (this is usually coupled with Dumbledore objecting to people dying for no reason at all).
