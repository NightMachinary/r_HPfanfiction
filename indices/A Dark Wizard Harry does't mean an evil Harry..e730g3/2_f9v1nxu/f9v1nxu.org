I get what you're saying, but the: Dark!Harry not Evil!Harry trope is getting old in fanfiction.

There are a lot of examples of that, just read any indy!Harry story and they usually have the good guys spew unforgivables like candy. One of the best stories that was opposite to that trope was On the Way to Greatness. Which had Harry who was angry, jaded and dabbled in dark magic, but was not Evil. Just morally dubious. Most of the stories in the Dark not Evil genre treat Dark magic as a tool with no downsides, just powerful magic. If that was the case, everyone would use them. The thing about Dark Magic in canon is that you have to mean it. You have to want to kill, torture, dominate.

That's basically the definition of evil.

Now, I'm not saying that it can't be used for good. There are plenty of examples in history and even in HP canon of evil deeds accomplishing a good goal. But let's not kid ourselves, if we devolve the HP fantasy world into reality of moral choices in warfare, we are bound to be faced with evil deeds perpetrated by "good" men. That's just the reality of it. Hiding from it, like many fanfiction writers want to is disingenuous to me.

Good example here is What We're Fighting For by zugrian. It's an awesome fic, but Harry progressively becomes more unstable, willing to kill and morally ambiguous as the story progresses. I think the author is even aware of it as the second to last chapter shows.

Do not be afraid of your characters crossing the moral event horizon. It might make them more human.
