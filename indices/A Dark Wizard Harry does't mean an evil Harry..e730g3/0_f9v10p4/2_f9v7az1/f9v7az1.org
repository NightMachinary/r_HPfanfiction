I agree with you, star wars has a very strong duality, an excample is that we never see an dark side user being good, unlike HP where we see dark wizards doing good deeds.\\
The thing is not just trowing unforgivables arround just like in the end of DH, but a really dark wizard character that is't evil, in Cage and Key, Harry leard very dark magic that is't just for self defense os necessity but because he really enjoys learning about it, just like his eagerness to try fiedfyre in the fic.
