Oh, I think this is the consensus of this sub. Based on our surveys, this sub likes dark Harry, but hates evil Harry.

The canon is more about intention anyway. For example, it's ok for Snape to use Avada Kedavra to euthanize Dumbledore, but it's cold blooded murder when Voldemort confunded a House-Elf to poison her master.

Near the end, good guys are throwing around Unforgivables like confetti too, but the Books never consider them dark Wizards.

I think too many fic authors are influenced by Star Wars. JKR also has a different view about what character traits are dangerous. For example, Star Wars sees anger as a key component of the dark side, whereas Harry Potter repeatedly praises angry or emotional responses from the good guys, especially Hermione and Ginny. Their violent outbursts against their enemies' (and even friends') transgressions are generally seen as awesome moments by the fandom.
