I don't think it was explicitly stated in the books what dark magic is. My "feel" throughout reading them was that it is actually supposed to be evil, but there are plenty arguments to be made that even unforgivables can be used for good.

However, when people in canon were talking about "dark wizards", they certainly meant evil people: Grindelwald, Voldemort, Herpo the Foul, Bellatrix, Lucius. Not nice people who use dark magic for good, and are unfairly stigmatized. Further, good guys using dark magic (aurors; the order and Harry in the war) didn't get called dark wizards. There isn't a dark wizard division in the auror corps to act as a SWAT team or special forces, which there would be, if "dark wizard" just meant person specializing in dark magic. That said, there's the counter argument that this is from Harry's POV, maybe from a Slytherin's POV the picture would look different.

Ultimately, this gives people enough leeway to write dark magic and dark wizards in a facfic however they want. There are plenty of good fanfics where dark doesn't mean evil, my favorite is [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/out-of-the-night-by-raining-ink-t.14151/][Out of the Night]]. There are also bad ones, where the "dark, but not evil Harry" is is actually a pretty douchebagy purebood supremacist who "righteously" takes down anyone who disagrees with him. There are also fics that make dark magic explicitly evil, like it gives you enjoyment for torturing people - which, I'd say, is a pretty convincing reason to ban it (linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts) was an example of this, I think).
