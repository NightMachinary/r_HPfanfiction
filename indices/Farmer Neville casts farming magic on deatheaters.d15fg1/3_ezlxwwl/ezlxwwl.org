So whilst I haven't come across a fic, this heavily reminds me of a Korean Novel call Overgeared which has a character that was one of the candidates to be a legendary sword saint that becomes a legendary farmer who's very very OP and fights the actual sword saint candidate to a draw multiple times. The novel also contains the existence of a legendary blacksmith, miner and tailor.

In my head I would want to execute this as a crack!fic but this can definitely be done as a serious story.

I have been debating whether to grab the most interesting prompts I see and just write a few one shots all night so if I suddenly gain some energy to do the above your idea will be my first.
