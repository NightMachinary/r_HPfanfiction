Huh? No. I was replying to the user triggering the “remind me” bot. I mean TOMT has a bot that automatically changes a Flair to solved once the OP declares it, and ALSO can notify subscribers when a given piece of media is found.

Basically the process goes like this

1. TOMT post made looking for something.
2. Bot replies to post with a post with a link that lets someone subscribe to the post(they think the subject is interesting but don't know it either).
3. People try to help find subject. Eventually, the correct answer is found.
4. OP replies to the post with the correct answer with the keyword to close the search and mark the correct response.
5. Bot changes the flair to reflect the “Solved” status, and notifies anyone who subscribed to the topic that the correct answer has been found.
