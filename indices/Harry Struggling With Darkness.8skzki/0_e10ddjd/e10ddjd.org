- The Prisoner's Cipher linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher): Harry is clearly struggling with his actions and is definitely evil, but he doesn't want to be and is fighting back.
- On the Way to Greatness linkffn(On the Way to Greatness): possibly the best fic showing Harry's struggle with dark magic and killing, and how to win without it.
- Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge): Harry is very conflicted about the spells he uses, particularly later on, and even asks to learn the torture curse for Bellatrix from Tom Riddle.
- Possibly Cage and Key linkffn(Cage and Key), though it has something of the addictive dark magic trope.
