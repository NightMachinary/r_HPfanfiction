linkffn(Imprisioned Realm; Renegade Cause; The Legacy by storytellerspw)

IR this dilema is mostly for MIrror Harry. RC he does shit that he regrets and then tries to live up to it.

The Legacy has more of a grey area with regards to spell, but it is the application of them that has Harry confused or in doubt.
