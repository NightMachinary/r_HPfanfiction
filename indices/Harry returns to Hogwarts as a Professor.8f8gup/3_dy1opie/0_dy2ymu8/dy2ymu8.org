You know, I read all of Jeconais's stories when I was 16 and I loved them. A few years later, I looked them up and they were just unreadable.

They have this sort of French romanticism to them that puts French culture on a pedestal, and that wouldn't be so bad if the characters were less 'soap opera', you know? It makes the French obsession a bit overbearing. They read like they're all being played by Tommy Wiseau, but better educated. Stilted and strange, is how they talk to each other.

Obscene power and character bashing is how Jeconais keeps his protagonist in charge; there is never, ever a point in any of his stories where the fate of the 'righteous' is in doubt. He's always right, everybody is always in awe, and the villains are the most despicable slime to slither on this Earth.

Nothing makes sense. Logic is thrown out. There is only the protagonist, and his righteous quest, which he finds very simple and easy because he's so amazing, and then there's the next goal. And somehow, everything gets wrapped around this perversion of faux-French culture which is based on the most ludicrous French stereotypes. If I were French I would be insulted at this ignorant American trying to write about the French in a positive way, and failing absolutely.

All in all, it's head and shoulders above most Harry Potter fanfiction, and I recommend it.
