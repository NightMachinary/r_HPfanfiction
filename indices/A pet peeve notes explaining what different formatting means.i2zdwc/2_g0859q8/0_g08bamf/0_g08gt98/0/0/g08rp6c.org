... No it doesn't? [[https://i.imgur.com/EkwVOCo.png][MS Word doesn't flag mistakes like that]]. The last sentence is there to show that grammar flagging is turned on. Funnily enough, it didn't catch the other grammar mistake in there :D

Spelling and grammar checks in MS Word are there to help you, not do it for you. And really, this is primary school stuff.
