My two pet peeves:

1. Listing whose POV it is after a scene break. Just put the name in the first paragraph, and we'll know!
2. "Flashback" and "End flashback" labels. Just like the OP says, if you properly use a formatting change (italics are common/standard), these are completely unnecessary.

When I see otherwise talented writers use these, it really frustrates me because they're so close, and yet so far.
