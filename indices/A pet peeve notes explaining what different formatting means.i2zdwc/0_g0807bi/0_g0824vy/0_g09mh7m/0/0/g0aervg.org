It's been a long time since I read those, but if I remember right the story had huge sections dedicated to each POV and intertwined them just enough to keep them related but not whole relying on each other till the end. Same deal as the lord of the rings. I wouldn't mind finding that more in fanfiction, but usually I find the quick bounces between the good guys and the bad guys explaining everything that's gonna happen in the next chapter. Not only does it spoil the story incrementally, I honestly couldn't give two shits about what the bad guys are doing if it they aren't directly influencing or interacting with the main characters in a given moment.

My exception to hating POV switches in fanfiction though will be if it's a story that focuses on multiple main characters that are usually interacting in the third person and the POVs only follow those main characters individually for the sake of furthering the action of the plot.
