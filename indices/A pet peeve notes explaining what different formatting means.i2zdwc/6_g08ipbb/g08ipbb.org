a new paragraph still including the same quote. I don't really know writing rules, but it bothers me. a quote should stay in one paragraph. unless the person is telling a long story. but like two sentences should stay in just one.

speech in italics. some people do this instead of using quotes. it's especially bad if it's a 3rd person view and then also thought are written in italics. it gets too confusing to read. people should just learn where on their keyboard the quotes are.

speech in quotes /and/ italics... (unless it's parseltongue, that's perfect for it. that way you know it's parsel and not normal speech and you also know it's not thoughts.)

paragraphs that are too long; or too short, where each sentence is a new paragraph.

I don't like parseltongue in bold tbh. I think it should be italics in quote. or single quote. just as long as it has its own formatting. I also think of italics by themselves (no quotes) as thoughts. that's kinda universal in most fics. I just don't like bold, and it should be reversed for articles.

not really a formatting peeve, but it fits. when it's not clear from the text who said what. or who did what. eg. talking about two males and it goes "he said..." but you can't be sure which one.

I kinda like this formats:

"speech"

*articles*

/"parseltongue" or/ /'parseltongue'/

/thoughts/

'quotes inside quotes' (could also be in italics)

/emphasizing a word/
