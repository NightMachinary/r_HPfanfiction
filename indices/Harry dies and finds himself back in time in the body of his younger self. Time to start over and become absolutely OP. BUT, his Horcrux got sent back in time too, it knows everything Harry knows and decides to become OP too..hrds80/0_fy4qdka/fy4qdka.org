Oh Harry, I've been there since almost your very beginning, coiled around the back of your soul. Quiescent, suppressed; a flash of red eyes in your mirror.

It is Halloween, and ash falls like snow in Godric's Hollow. In the upper story of a ruined house, an infant lies amid the wreckage, a new scar traced hot and bloody on his forehead.

He is not alone in the room. Lily Evans lies dead on the floor. And a wand lies on the floor.

Yew and phoenix feather, 13 and 1/2 inches. Mine.

The baby's body shakes as two souls reassert themselves, drawn back to this fracture point. The soul of an 17 year old, shocked and emotional. And me, knowledge and willpower beyond all others.

Who do you think would react first?

I latched onto the motor cortex, began to crawl for the wand. Harry Potter's soul rose against me, stronger than most. In fits and starts I continued to crawl.

"James! Lily!" came from downstairs.

I snarled as Harry's control surged. Hope is a powerful lever, as I had learned.

My body seized like an epileptic, but I grasped the wand. Footsteps were thundering up the stairs. I raised it, into my mouth.

Hope would not save you Harry, nor love. I am a Horcrux, difficult to kill, and you are only a baby. The prophecy is fulfilled, and now I have my wand.

I am Lord Voldemort. Was it any surprise when I saw my chance, and seized it?

Sirius Black charged through the door. I smiled at him around my wand.

"Bombarda!"
