Harry's talent for Defense could come from him growing up with the Piece of defensive magic that was Lily Blood protection and what ever Dumbledore Did to it to make it last as long as he Thought of Privet drive as home.

Could also be why Harry Learns the Patronus So young and can teach it it others.( or the Effects that learning it as his First piece of Big magic as such a young age could have on him)

Would be cool to see The Fidelius charm Have a effect on the magic harry is Good at.After all he did spend At least a few month under it as a Baby.
