Imagine if the Fidelius charm affected him with some bizarre ability to hide secrets in his mind.....not as a full occlumens but as someone who subconciously keeps certain things to himself only. Like how Snape couldn't see his childhood or any memories he doesn't know or atleast have an idea about. That would also explain why Dumbledore is against him learning about the prophecy until he knows occlumens since Voldie also knows about the prophecy so Harry's shield won't work on him.
