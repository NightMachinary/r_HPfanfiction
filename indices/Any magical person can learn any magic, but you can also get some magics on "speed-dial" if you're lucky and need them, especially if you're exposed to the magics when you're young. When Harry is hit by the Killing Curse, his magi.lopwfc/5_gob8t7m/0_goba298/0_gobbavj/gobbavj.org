I suppose I may have misinterpreted your statements about "bizarre abilities" "popping out of nowhere" in response to "needing all the help you can get."

I assumed some level of customization must be inherent in your progress for such niche bloodline abilities to emerge with no precedent (E.G. Salazar Slytherin, the supposed first parselmouth, who originated an ability not seen from the "list" before).

The /Worm/ mechanics also include the heritability effect you mention, where Shards/magic can "pick up" the powers of the parent, and group triggers which result in capes with near-identical powersets, which fits with your Marauders example.

I believe the "stress response" interpretation was me being conditioned by the fanon "magic is about intent" trope, which made me assume that the wizard had to, at some level, believe they needed said powers for them to be unlocked by your mechanism. I see now that this was not your intent.
