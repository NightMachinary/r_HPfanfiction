You seem to think I said a bunch of stuff I wasn't trying to say. I guess there's some similarity to Worm, in that special abilities can arise in response to a need, but there's minimal customization for the host and context (abilities are just picked or not from a list), no discarding (metamorphs and parselmouths get to keep their general-purpose magic), and no actual need for a trigger event and a stress response.
