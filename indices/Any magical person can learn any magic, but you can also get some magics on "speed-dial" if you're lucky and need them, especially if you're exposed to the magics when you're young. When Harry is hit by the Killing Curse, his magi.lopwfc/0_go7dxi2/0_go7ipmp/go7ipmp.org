Right? I'm imagining a comedy fic where Harry's special magical abilities (beyond your typical spell casting) are just...randomly turning on and off /all of the time/ and Hermione is trying to help him and Ron is just along for the ride and finding cool shit for Harry to do. It could be a great friendship fic too.
