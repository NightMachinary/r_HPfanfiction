Just a few snippets from how I imagine this to go:

​

"Hermione, I woke up covered in gold again"

​

"Ginny, stop trying to get into my pants, WE ARE IN THE GREAT HALL" -Male Veelas exist

​

"Colin, stop trying to get into my pants, WE ARE STILL IN THE GREAT HALL"

​

"Fuck it, I'm gonna be a woman today... RON STOP TRYING TO GET INTO MY PANTS" -Genderfluid Harry because why not

​

"I have a horrible feeling that that rat is going to try and kill me one day. Last time I got a feeling like this the soup incident happened. I am therefore going to put this rat in an unbreakable cage."

​

"Why is everybody so surprised I can talk to snakes? I mean, I seem to have every single other magical gift so why the hell not this one?"

​

"I'm having cravings for milk again. Nobody tidy up tonight, I got this"

​

"The dragons are arguing about who has the hottest flame. I don't know what you expected, honestly."
