linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge): has Harry and Tom becoming friends/teammates after the DoM incident.

linkffn(On the Way to Greatness): Harry gets Ak'd in the graveyard and learns about the Horcrux from his parents. Similar thing happens in linkffn(Accidental Animagus).

linkffn(The Boy Who Could Not Die): incomplete, but basically the Horcrux makes Harry indestructible and he abuses the hell out of it.

linkffn(The Mind Arts): happens during 3rd year, though its mostly implied rather than bandied about like some fics.

linkffn(A Cadmean Victory): this fic has a ton of problems, but this comes up early in 4th year and Harry tries to figure a way out of it.

linkffn(Abraxas): this is /really tentative/ recommendation, but the gist is the Horcrux hears the prophecy too and decides to make a deal with Harry to fuse their souls. Downside it goes really off the rails later on. Similar ideas of fusing with the Horcrux happen in other fics, such as The Merging.
