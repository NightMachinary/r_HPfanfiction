I wish I could be more helpful and remember which stories I am remembering, but I always remember being annoyed at how long Harry held on to his lies in HP replacement AUs. I would be sitting there the whole time like: "please, just tell someone, tell anyone! Tell a ghost. You holding in this secret is just a shifty way to develop more angst!".

So yeah, il wrack my brain for those stories, but please tell me which stories you are talking about it.
