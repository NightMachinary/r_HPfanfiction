I tried to figure out the class schedule from the books (just for first year) and found that there are not enough teachers for all seven years to get three hours a week each subject. Even with each class being with two houses, and sixth and seventh years being all four and classes running from just after breakfast to right before dinner.

The school isn't functional as written. You could just wing it, there didn't seem to be a set schedule in the books. I'd recommend that you give the first and second years and hour or two extra in their specialty. Third years pick classes based on it. Maybe let them drop a class or two outside of their wheel house.
