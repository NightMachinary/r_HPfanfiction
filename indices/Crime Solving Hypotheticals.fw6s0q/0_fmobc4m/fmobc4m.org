Priori Incantatem would be a good tool if you catch a suspect near the crime scene.

Hairs you find can be thrown into Polyjuice, so some kind of forensics is possible. Maybe something similar can be done with blood.

Fingerprints are an option, the existence of polyjuice is a possible defence, but that's for the judge to decide.

Tracing apparations might be possible, but to make that balanced let's say that you have to be at the origin within a few minutes of the apparation.
