Quite true. Just because a piece of evidence could be wrong or tampered with, doesn't mean you don't collect it and work things out from it - you just keep aware of it being possibly incorrect or misleading. Because that's my point - if it was someone else, would you be able to tell magically? Or is it solely a mundane investigation from that point?

I think Polyjuice can only last an hour per dose though - so if they were around for three hours, they'd probably not be polyjuiced or you'd probably be stupid for letter them drink something. :D

And quite true - I always wanted to see an Indy!Harry fic where Dumbledore was manipulative, but he was manipulating Harry into becoming independent, severing all connections to his friends and family so he'd go after Voldemort more freely. Potion!Weasleys were framed, Tattletail!Hermione was manipulated, Absentee!Remus was bullied, Absentee!Sirius was tricked, etc. It'd be so fun to see that done properly.
