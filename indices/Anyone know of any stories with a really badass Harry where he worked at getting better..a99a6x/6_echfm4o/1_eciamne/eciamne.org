H/Hr is fine in a vacuum, however it attracts some craaaazy people (remember that guy with the 10 thousand word profile extolling the virtues of H/Hr and bashing all other characters). It's not so visible now, but since the 6th book harmonians were some of the saltiest fans in all the fandoms. This resulted in a ton of stories with Weasley bashing, love potions, manipulative DD trying to keep H+Hr apart and Harry being a puppet led around by Her Intellect.

I mostly like H/Hr where they are in different houses, or are not friends from the start and date later (On The Way to Greatness was going H/Hr, I think).
