  Post-OotP Sirius is cleared and finally gets to give Harry the home he had always wanted. Rebuilding his life with a war brewing in their world isn't simple. It's a good thing he has a family to fall back on this time. What he didn't realize was that good things don't last too long. Not for him anyway. Semi canon-compliant. No Slash/bashing.
