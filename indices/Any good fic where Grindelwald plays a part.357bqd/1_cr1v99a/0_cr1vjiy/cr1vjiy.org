Phantasy. Ooooh boy. You can tell by the fact that it has a great premise and hasn't been updated in a year that its a Tsume Yuki story. God damnit, why haven't she been banned yet? I'm 99.8% sure that there is some convention out there outlawing starting so many good stories and abandoning them all, to a fault (not really though, she finished the one with Harry as Sirius and Regulus' brother. Not the sequel though ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) )
