Here's the mentioned Divination Professor Harry fic, also involves Dimension Travel: linkffn(11160991) I can think of a couple other fics that did fun things with Divination, but the names don't spring to mind immediately.

Not so much fanfic, but divination being more about locating objects or extra-sensory in some capacity is common in tons of other entertaining fantasy literature, including most fiction with magic systems inspired by DnD. If you like Harry Potter, Mother of Learning comes to mind as a time loop at a magic school. I also recently read Sufficiently Advanced Magic, which again has the "magic school" element.
