[[http://www.greyblue.net/MidnightBlue/chapter.php?storyid=2&chapterid=1][The Mirror of Maybe]] is a pretty good abandoned HP/SS fic (some smut) from back in 2002.

Basically, Harry gets sucked into the mirror, and lives out a possible future as computed by the mirror, before being spit out an hour later, with a ~15 years of memories into his teenage body.

More or less a peggy sue, but with a slightly different premise. Better than it sounds.
