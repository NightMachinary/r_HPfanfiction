The author's profile is still there. Have you contacted them? Seems to me that should be your first port of call.

Anyway I know people often do try to track down deleted fics and sometimes succeed, but please do take a moment to consider that the writers probably had good personal reasons for removing their stories.

We all know that when something is on the intenet it's there forever, but would you want somebody raking something up from your past like that?
