The best fanon is canon's logical next step. Why wouldn't wizards have a time-telling spell? If they can erase long term memories, how much harder could it be to make a spell that affects short term memories?

Although now that I think about it, none of the wizarding clocks in canon ever actually told time in the modern sense. The Weasley's has states of being, and Dumbledore's is just planets.
