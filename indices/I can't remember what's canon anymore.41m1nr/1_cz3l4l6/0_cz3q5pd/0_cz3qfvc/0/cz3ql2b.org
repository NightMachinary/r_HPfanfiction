I do wonder about Mcgonagall being all scathing on that first day when she suggested she turn Harry or Ron into a pocketwatch so they could be on time. She's probably more modern than Dumbledore. Also did she have to be so snippy? It was their first day and the castle's a mess to new kids, calm your tits, woman.
