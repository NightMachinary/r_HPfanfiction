Regimented time is actually are rather new idea, many due to the fact that accurate clocks are pretty recent too. If wizards feel the same way about time as they do about changing fashion (in that it's stuck somewhere around the 12th century), then no one really cares about the exact time, because they had no way to measure it. You wouldn't say, "I'll be there at 6pm," you would say, "I'll be there late afternoon," or if you had to go to work, you would leave at dawn. That when dawn occurred changed through out the year wasn't really an issue, people just didn't think like that.

Of course, this doesn't really work at Hogwarts, with its rigid class timetable. But even then, if you just moved when the bell went, you still wouldn't need a watch.
