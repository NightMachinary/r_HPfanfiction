As a rule, HP magic does not work via holograms or visual illusions. Almost everything in HP magic happens through some kind of physical medium. It's one of the things I love about HP magic and also why I really hate the fanon tempus spell.

If there is such a spell in the HP world, I really doubt it would create a hovering image of the time. Rather, it would do something like briefly transform a nearby surface into a clock face, or create a chiming sound that only the caster can hear which chimes out the time, etc.
