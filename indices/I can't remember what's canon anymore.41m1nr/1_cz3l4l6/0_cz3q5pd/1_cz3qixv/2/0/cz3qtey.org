I've found, as a useful general rule, that a good way to replicate the feel of the HP magic system is to avoid anything that feels futuristic. HP magic should be relatively subtle, always a little bit quirky, and often does not take the most direct route to something. For example, there's no "warming charm" in canon - whenever wizards want to create heat using magic, they create fire.

It's not that HP magic is incapable of creating visual illusions - we've seen them here and there, such as the anti-gravity illusion in the maze - but rather simply that generally visual illusions don't fit the feel of the system. Auditory illusions, I feel, are more in line with the subtle/quirky nature of HP magic.
