I guess the answer is, yes, if the FF author doesn't make the distinction either. For example if the notice-me-not is used exactly the same way as the Disillusionment Charm, and no difference is explained then I guess it doesn't matter, and so they could be. However, not every author does this. And generally the Disillusionment Charm is seen as particularly difficult (the only students that use it are Hermione and possibly Malfoy and co, all in the 7th book), while the notice-me-not is generally used by FF characters when they are young.

According to the [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/magic/spells/spells_d.html][HP lexicon]], the Disillusionment Charm is indeed a chameleon affect, which only approaches true invisibility when completely overpowered (the two examples are Dumbledore and Voldemort when he really doesn't want to be seen). For the majority of magic users, I think the affect is a little more crappy, like the chameleon affect in real life, so moving too fast or being against something to either too simple or with too many fine continuing details will mean the charm can be seen through. Like the difference between [[http://imgur.com/a/PvMRj][spot the sniper]] and something more [[http://imgur.com/BQIr945][underpowered]].

On the other hand the notice-me-not doesn't depend on the background or how fast you move, but if someone knows you are there and is looking for you, or has significant will, or if you act to draw attention to yourself then the charm will fail.

In any case, you're right in that FF tends to fail at pointing out the problems with either charm, and certainly doesn't tend to explain them.
