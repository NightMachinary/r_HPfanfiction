An explanation for the "why": Because just as me, the first author to do so remembered that there was some kind of "not invisible, but harder to notice" charm, but couldn't remember the name. And didn't bother to look it up.\\
Or someone reinvented the wheel. Then the question would be "is fanon that does the same as canon with a different name canon?"

I never thought too much about how both spells are supposed to work, especially as many FFs don't describe them. Can you be noticed by someone really paying attention while under notice-me-not? If not, wouldn't that make it an invisibility charm and probably much more difficult (I remember it being used pretty early in school sometimes)..
