Horcruxes have been destroyed by Basilisk venom, the sword of gryffindor (which was impregnated with basilisk venom), Fiendfyre, whatever Dumbledore did to destroy the ring.

Avada Kedavra... might work. Kind of fuzzy, but Voldemort cast it on Harry at the end of DH, which destroyed the Horcrux in him.
