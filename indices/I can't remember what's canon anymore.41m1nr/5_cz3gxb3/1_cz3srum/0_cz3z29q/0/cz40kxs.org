Most of the conflict in the earlier books revolves around their negative traits; Harry's whiny procrastination and bottled up anger, Ron's jealousy, and Hermione's overbearing attitude. Dumbledore is the stereotypical old man in an ivory tower, divorced from reality. Umbridge is just plain ridiculous. Fudge is unbelievably inept. Sirius is delusional. Mrs. Weasley is smothering. It seems to me like they end up being caricatures of actual people rather than believable, well rounded characters.
