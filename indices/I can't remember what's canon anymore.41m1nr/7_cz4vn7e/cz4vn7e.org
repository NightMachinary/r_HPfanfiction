Canon or not, we can all conclude that Dumbledore was incompetent in dealing with Voldemort. This guy was the most powerful wizard at the time, had tons of loyal followers, was generally revered by the public, and had past experience defeating a dark lord. Yet, he couldn't put any of his strengths to good use: the ministry was infiltrated by death eaters left and right, a quarter of his school was churning out death eaters en masse, and his own private army suffered 40% casualty rate without seriously hurting the other side.

Then when he finally got that lucky break through Potters' sacrifice, he did NOTHING to follow up this tactical victory. Lucius Malfoy and bunch of death eaters were given free reign to keep corrupting the ministry, while one of his own guys got shoved into Azkaban without trial. He suspected V wasn't dead, but basically sat on his ass doing nothing for 10 years, all valuable time where he could do some serious investigative work, beef up his private army, and prepare for the eventual showdown.

In the end, he gambled everything on Harry to activate the sacrificial magic, where it miraculously worked due to lots of lucky events. Still, hundreds of innocents were killed and far more were traumatized. An entire generation was turned into child soldiers.

The failure of Albus Dumbledore was EPIC and should be studied in great details in ALL magic story classes. He was worse than Neville Chamberlain.
