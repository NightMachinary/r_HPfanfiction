the biggest one I have issues with is wrestling with the idea of Harry being abused. /yes it was abuse/ Whether that abuse was physical or pure neglect is the clincher... for me, I keep remembering how Harry acted around people who got close... or what wasnt said to be precise. It is never stated that he flinched from contact... and he wasnt extremely introverted... meaning he was most likely only neglected... but... a part of me cant help but think that a kid who does absolutely everything for his relatives, without stepping one noticeable toe out of line... You dont get that way without physicality... So... I think that JK Rowling wrote a situation in which Harry was abused, but either doesnt view it as such, or has shut it away. Is that my fanon talking? who knows...
