I also have this problem.... but I do know this comes back to the moving scale of seriousness between the books. What is canon: Harry was denied food, he lived in a boot cupboard, he had more chores then Dudley. But we also know he was quiet sassy/defiant, he was fed, he doesn't act afraid of people. In the first few books this is pretty standard orphan fairy tale set up, but if you had this in the later books it most certainly was abuse. We do know JKR didn't mean for it to come across as abuse, so I guess it is up to you how you want to view it: by early book standard, or by later book standard.
