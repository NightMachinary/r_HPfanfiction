I seem to remember an interview where JKR said that her story originally had much /more/ of incidents like that, but her editor forced her to cut them out.

Prism is right that it depends on whether you stop at the first couple of books or take in the series as a whole. For the first couple of books, it's a fairy tale. The Dursleys are an entire family of evil stepmothers. Sure, their actions are horrid, but no one complains about "abuse" in fairy tales. No one notices that the "abused" hero doesn't actually show any of the signs of an abused kid.

Once the later books are brought in, however, that excuse can't be used anymore. If nothing else, book five has Dumbledore trying to justify and explain his decision to leave Harry with the Dursleys - that alone /demands/ that we take Harry's experiences there seriously, otherwise we can't take the scene itself seriously. And when we take Harry's experiences seriously, we can't treat it as anything but abuse - mental and physical. We can debate and disagree about how serious it is, but there's no debate that it happened.

The fact that Harry never shows much or any of the consequences of abuse is a leftover consequence of the first books being fairy tales. It's one of many, many examples of problems that exist because the series is made up of more than one genre of story and the genres conflict in various ways. But without those conflicts, there wouldn't be nearly as much fodder for fanfiction authors to use.

So in the we here should be happy for the conflict existing, but we need to be clear in understanding why it exists and where it's coming from.
