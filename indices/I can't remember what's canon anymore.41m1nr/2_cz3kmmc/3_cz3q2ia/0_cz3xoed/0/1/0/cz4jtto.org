Dumbledore... knew Harry would die. From the time Harry was twelve, Dumbedore KNEW Harry would die. He had no clue if Harry would EVER be free of Voldemort. Yet he still placed him a home where he was abused by those who should love him. I dont care if the end justified the means, that was /wrong/. James and Lily, would have killed Dumbledore themselves for it. ANY PARENT WOULD.

That first year, Dumbledore suspected that Harry was a horecrux. He prayed that it was not true. He begged to every deity that he even thought to may exist that he was wrong... Yet deep down he knew he was not wrong. Dumbledore, while he was The Only One Voldemort Feared, /feared/ Voldemort. Dumbledore hated that he knew what Tom was, but gave him a second chance. He knew that no matter what happened, he had to sacrifice a child to end the death of his people. People he watched grow up from the ages of 11 to 17. But he still had to sacrifice a child to do it.

In the end Dumbledore got lucky. He found his gambit won, that his greatest regret became the world's savior. That the one in a million chance that Harry would live, succeeded. Instead of sacrificing a Kid who only knew love in the world that was unsure how it felt about him, he sacrificed 11 years and 7 summers. If Dumbledore was alive at the end, I think he would have wept for joy... and out of shame of what he knew as necessary.
