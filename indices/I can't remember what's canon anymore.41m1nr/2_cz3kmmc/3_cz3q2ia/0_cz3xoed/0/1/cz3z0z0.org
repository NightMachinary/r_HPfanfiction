This is ridiculous. Harry being at the Dursley's is quite probably the only reason he survived to 11. They had no way to know who was a Voldemort supporter and Dumbledore had no idea when he would return.

Harry is a powerful wizard, could easily live 100+ years. Sacrificing 10 of them and a few summers, in exchange for literally saving the magical world and going on to live happily ever after, seems like a bargain to me.
