Well, Snape's memory of his conversation with Dumbledore - the one where even Snape blew up at him, accusing him of raising Harry to be a pig for slaughter - certainly adds to the idea of Dumbledore being a MOB. Then he has to go and make it worse by trying to needle Snape into admitting that he cares for Harry.

What's especially curious about Dumbledore's conversation with Harry is how he contradicts himself. On the one hand he insists that he hasn't told Harry the truth because he wanted Harry to enjoy his childhood. On the other hand, he also admit to knowing that Harry had a horrible life - and even if someone denies that the abuse he suffered was really that bad, it's pretty clear that he didn't have much of a childhood. He didn't have it much better after coming to Hogwarts, either, what with multiple murder attempts several times each year. And that's when he was under Dumbledore's direct care!

Saying that he wanted Harry to enjoy his childhood isn't unreasonable. It wouldn't justify all of the secrets he kept, but it would justify holding some things back. But if that excuse had been true, he'd have done more to ensure it happened. He'd have at least /tried/ to ensure that Harry had toys, friends, and time for fun. He have /tried/ to prevent him from being denied... well, just about everything.

Then again, this is the same Dumbledore who says that the "power" Harry has is "love," right after he got done apologizing for having forced Harry to grow up without love. Because the less you're given, the more you have? Or something?
