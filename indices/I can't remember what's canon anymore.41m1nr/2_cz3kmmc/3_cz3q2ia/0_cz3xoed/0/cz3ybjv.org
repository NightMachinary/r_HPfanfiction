Dumbledore acknowledging Harry's horrible life there is what destroys his entire character as the 'good old headmaster' for me, and I guess it's where the manipulative old bastard trope comes from. Before that scene it could be argued he just did not know, afterwards it's clear he knew and did nothing to prevent it except scare the Dursleys into taking Harry back, with no care of what this means for Harry himself.
