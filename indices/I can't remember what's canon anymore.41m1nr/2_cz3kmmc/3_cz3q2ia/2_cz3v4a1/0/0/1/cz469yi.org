Of course you meant physical abuse.

Swinging a frying pan is physical.

Throwing a child is physical.

Allowing or encouraging a dog to attack a child is physical.

Denying a child food for a week is physical.

Keeping a child locked in a cupboard as their only room is physical.

Every single one of those things is abusive. Every single one of them is physical.

I'd pity anyone unable to recognize that those are examples of physical abuse, and I would immediately recommend that any such person not have their own kids because I would have good cause to be concerned for such kids' safety.

Children should not be thrown, should not be locked in cupboards, and should not have vicious animals set on them. Full stop.

If you truly thought that it wasn't physical abuse unless you /always/ hit a child, and that therefore it was perfectly fine to /occasionally/ hit them with frying pan or /occasionally/ let a dog attack them, then you'd be a danger to children. Any children. All children.

But I don't really think that of you because such psychopaths are fortunately few and far between. I was being facetious because you were being stupidly dense for denying the incredibly obvious.

No intelligent, moral adult says that it's not physical abuse to do things like above. Only pointing out that the first books are fairy tales prevents the incidents from being horrific (it's a rare fairy tale that doesn't have something horrific going, a least the old ones), and that only works so long as one remains focused on the first books. As soon as the later, more mature books come into play, the incidents become horrible again.

So why not just admit that it's stupid to define "physical abuse" as "always hitting," admit that the incidents in question are indeed physical abuse, and focus the legitimate question of how bad it is. Trying to defend the idea that all those incidents aren't abusive is just ridiculous.

I'll also point out that trying to excuse what he experienced as not really being abuse takes something away from how well he developed. The abuse was something he overcame, and he deserves kudos for it. Pretending that his treatment wasn't so bad makes his accomplishments a bit smaller.
