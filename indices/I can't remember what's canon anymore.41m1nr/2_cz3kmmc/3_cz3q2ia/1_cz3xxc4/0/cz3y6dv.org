Book 1, Letters From No One chapter:

#+begin_quote
  "They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat. 'Get the mail, Dudley,' said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. 'Make Harry get it.' 'Get the mail, Harry.' 'Make Dudley get it.' 'Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.' Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail."

The frying pan is from Chamber of Secrets' 'The Worst Birthday' chapter:

#+begin_quote
  "As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he was finished."

Harry has to dodge / duck, leaving no question they were actually aiming for him. Dudley may be forgiven for being an idiotic child but Petunia is guily of attempted assault at least (a heavy blow, not a joking fake swing).
