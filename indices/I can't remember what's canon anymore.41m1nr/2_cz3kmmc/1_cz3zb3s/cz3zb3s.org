There are other factors. I've worked with abused children and soical services internationally for around 10 years now, some children just aren't fazed by what happened to them until years later, or when they've had time to realise "Oh, that wasn't normal".

Context is most important , abusing (beating) your children is normalised in many countries. What differs is the degree of abuse you accept as a culture, ive seen beatings ranging from, belts wounds, paddling, frying pans induced scars, pokers, lighters, hot baths, cold baths, open hand, closed fists, with kids still being 'sassy' afterwards because its just accepted as a normal punishment for the 'crime'. My conclusion is that some kids are just resistant and resilient as steel, while others shatter like glass.

Harry just might be unaffected, particularly if the Dursleys abuse was incremental, and might feel the abuse later, if at all, but most likely when his own children are the same age as he was when the abuse started.
