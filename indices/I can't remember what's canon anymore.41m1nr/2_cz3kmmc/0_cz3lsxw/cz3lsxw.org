The original books were written more like a fairy tale, and as such harry has evil relatives as that's a pretty common trope in fairy tales. However, Rowling likely didn't actually want a character with the characteristics that are common in abused children so Harry doesn't have them. Note that Cinderella also doesn't have these characteristics. However the latter books are written as more serious novels, and things that worked from a fairy tale perspective no longer make sense when viewed from a more realistic perspective so there are a bunch of things that are difficult to reconcile that were set in stone in the initial books. Whether or not they were physically abusive as well, (and starvation would probably count as physical) the Dursley's as described treatment of Harry would lead to a kid with emotional issues that Harry seems to lack. So I wouldn't say that's strong evidence either way on whether or not they hit him too.
