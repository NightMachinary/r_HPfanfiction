linkffn(2818538) I read this just before the release of DH because someone sent me a *.pdf stating it was a stolen copy. Melindaleo's version of book 7 still feels much more like canon to me than Rowling's 'Deathly Hallows'. And so I've got some discussions with friends where I notice only after minutes that I'm just wrong because of Fanfic Attribution Error.
