I think it's because he's a very... go with the flow type character for the most part, and it's exacerbated by the medium.

He doesn't initiate his own troubles. (Probably because life is happy to hand him a steady supply of problems so he feels no need to seek out more) He gets involved, and saves the day when the big todo that's been building all years comes to a head (or if Malfoy is involved) ... but we rarely in canon see him working towards a goal intentionally for personal reasons.

He obviously /has/ goals that he works towards but that's not what makes the books. AKA winning quiditch involves practice and etc... but quiditch games are already pretty boring outside of incidents so we don't read about those practices.

Like... he says he wants to be an Auror... but that's both out of left field (as in I don't recall him ever giving the future any thought prior to that) and also somewhat of a knee-jerk 'well duh' answer to the question of what he wants to do when he grows up given that Voldemort is back by then.

I /think/ that's why people find it so easy to add one of their own 'if i was' goals to his to do list and run with it.

That said yeah, he has a very... snarky? I think that's the word..? personality that (sadly) doesn't always make it into fanfics.
