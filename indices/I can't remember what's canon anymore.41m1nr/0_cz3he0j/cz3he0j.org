I can't really remember Harry's personality. He was already quite neutral in canon, written so that it's easy to imagine yourself in his place.

But with all the fics I read it's hard to remember what he really stood for. Is he constantly trying to push everyone away or is everyone using the funeral scene of HBP as an indication of Harry's entire personality? Is he really dumb and clueless about girls or is that aspect exaggerated in fanon? How much of a push-over was he? Was he even a push-over?

That sort of thing. And not just in Harry's case. I just lose track of what their canon personality is.
