Hm...I don't have that problem much (and I've read tons of fanfiction by now), I have another problem:

I think a lot of fanfiction is - sadly! - better than the books (I hate Rowling ruining her main character (Harry!) in the last book...he's stumbling around like an idiot and without Hermione (who's the real protagonist in that book IMHO!) he'd be dead -.-) and that's quite sad, because while the writing style in the books is better than most fanfiction, the stories told in fanfiction are often much more fun to read (a hero that isn't just "along for the ride" (and who let's other lead him around like they choose to, like Dumbledore making him a willing sacrifice...I mean why not imprison Voldemort until Harry dies a natural death? Sacrificing a child is despicable and not OK (and I don't even like children all that much!)) but pro-active is just a lot more fun!)
