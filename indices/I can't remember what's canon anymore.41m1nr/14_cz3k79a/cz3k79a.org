In order: Not after Ariana's death. No. Yes, along with the rest of the trio, but about different things. Probably only by Dudley.

I haven't reread canon in a long time, but I tend to get into a lot of debates over canonicity, and when I get called out on fanon, I adjust my position, so I think I've got a pretty accurate view of things. Of course, if I didn't, how would I know until someone called me out?
