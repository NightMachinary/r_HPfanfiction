So, to answer your abuae queation, I think the answer is yes. Starving your children isn't acceptable, the end, and we see the dursleys starve harry several times during cannon (after harry set the boa constrictor on Dudley in ss, for example, or during cos). But i think what you're asking is whether the Dursley's ever hit harry and the answer is not really. In OotP, Vernon grabs harry by the throat and harry breaks his grip magically. But even though we never see venon hit harry, there's some textual evidence that it happened. There are certainly enough threats, and in HBP we're informed that long experience advised harry to stay out of Vernon's reach when he's angry. So it's in there if you want it to be.
