Before the Weasley's rescued him in his second year the Dursley's were feeding him a can of cold soup through a cat flap for his only meal of the day. I'd consider that borderline starving someone, especially a child who tends to be skinny on the best of days.

Relying on Harry's POV of starvation isn't fair as if he was starved as a child he probably wouldn't know any better. And limiting his food because they disliked him, not because he actually did anything wrong, would probably be considered some form of physical abuse. Granted, as discussed in above comments the first few books were written as a fairly tale, so getting anything definitive from them is almost impossible.
