From Harry's POV he thinks he hasn't been starved. He is, very possibly, an unreliable narrator. Even the way he words it implies he might in fact have been starved, but now he is justifying it. It's like saying, "Oh, it didn't rain too badly," after a storm (he was "never exactly" starved).

In book 1 we have Vernon saying,

#+begin_quote
  /"Go - cupboard - stay - no meals,"/
#+end_quote

and later Harry has:

#+begin_quote
  /Until they were [asleep], he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food/.
#+end_quote

Sure we don't know how long he had no meals for, but the fact he has had to sneak food often enough in the past he thinks it routine is telling. Ron thinks he was being starved in CoS. Harry is always described as quiet thin and small (possible signs of long term starvation.)
