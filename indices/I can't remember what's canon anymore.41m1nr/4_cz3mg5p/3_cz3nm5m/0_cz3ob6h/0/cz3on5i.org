I feel like she would have been quite good at potions, considering Slughorn thought her a good student. She was a muggleborn with no connections so she must have been good at potions to catch his interest. I don't think she was on the same level as Snape, though. Snape was altering potions and making them better, I feel like she would just be good at making what the book said to. And yet, now I don't know if this is canon but, she was very good at Charms. I feel like James was outstanding in Transfiguration, Lily in Charms, Severus in Potions. Sort of like that whole deal.
