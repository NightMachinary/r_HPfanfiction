And then there's the fact that some people genuinely don't have middle names, so it's not absolutely necessary to give them one. Rowling didn't give the Malfoys middle names, to my knowledge, and while I don't really care all that much if an author wants him to be 'Draco Lucius Malfoy', I don't think it's a meaningful addition, either. Some people IRL don't have a middle name, and they get along just fine.
