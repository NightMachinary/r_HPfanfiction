Actually middle names are often the same across a nuclear family, especially when they're patronymic. Especially when a middle name wasn't actually /chosen/ but is given as a default for forms or whatnot

(In addition, there is a difference between one's /middle/ name and one's /other/ names)

To me, the fact that Regulus has a chosen middle name that he shares with an ancestor points to a greater probability that Sirius' was chosen and chosen from an earlier generation than Orion's. His middle name could be Phineas or Alphard for all we know. Or alternatively, horror of horrors, he /just doesn't have one/ (shocking, right?).

Then again I cut my middle name teeth on The Brothers Karamazov so maybe it's just me :P
