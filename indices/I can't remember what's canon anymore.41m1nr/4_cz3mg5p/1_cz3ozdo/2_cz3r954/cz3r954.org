Actually canon does imply that the oldest son of a Wizarding family do share their first middle name with their father's name. e.g. Harry /James/ Potter, William /Arthur/ Weasley and Albus /Percival/ Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. So I personally feel like Sirius Orion Black isn't bad fanon, it could very well be true.

James Charlus Potter is however pure fanon, James' father wasn't called Charlus but Fleamont. That also means that Harry is not directly related to the Black family.
