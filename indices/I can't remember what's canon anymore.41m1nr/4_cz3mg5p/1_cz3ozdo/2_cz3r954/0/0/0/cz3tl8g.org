I don't get people who moan that the epilogue names are unrealistic. Well no shit, the series started out with people named "Rubeus Hagrid" and "Quirinius Quirrell"; wizarding names are /supposed/ to sound weird. The Harry James Potters are the exceptions, not the norm (even Ron has /Bilious/ of all things as a middle name).

  Also, the Black naming system isn't just stars, it's also constellations

So, stars then? :P Just kidding, I know there's a difference. Also there are oddities like Phineas, whose name is essentially Black Black Black.
