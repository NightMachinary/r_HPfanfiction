  No, what canon implies is that some people, like in the real world, have their father's names as their middle names.

Those some people all happen to come from pure Wizarding families, you know what they say, once is an accident, two times is a coincidence, three times is a conspiracy.

Whatever the middle name naming scheme is, the Weasley family follow it and we know that the first son is named after his father (William Arthur), we also know that the third son is named after the maternal grandfather (Percival Ignatius; Ignatius is the name of Molly's father). So we have a slight pattern with the middle names:

1st son: father

2nd son: unknown

3rd son: maternal grandfather

The only second son's middle name we know off happens to be that of Regulus Arcturus. Arcturus is the name of Regulus' paternal grandfather. If we apply this to the pattern we get:

1st son: father

2nd son: paternal grandfather

3rd son: maternal grandfather

This is a clear naming pattern. The fact that Regulus' middle name fits the Weasley family middle name naming scheme perfectly is too much of a coincidence, especially in a world created by JKR.

It is safe to say that Sirius' middle name is Orion. Likewise Charlie's full name is most likely Charles Septimus Weasley, not that his name is ever brought up in fanon. It's not bad fanon to say Sirius' middle name is Orion, it's logical reasoning based on the information we have of the Wizarding family names.

What is bad fanon is naming every first child's middle name after his father, especially when the character isn't a pure blood (i.e. Remus' middle name is John, Remus' father is called Lyall).

  For instance I notice that James Sirius Potter and Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy don't factor into your theory for some reason.

They're next generation kids, it's a subtle way of showing that tradition is less important and that the Wizarding world is changing. Or who knows maybe the middle name naming scheme might have been vogue amongst Wizards during the 19th and most of the 20th century but it died out in during the 90s.
