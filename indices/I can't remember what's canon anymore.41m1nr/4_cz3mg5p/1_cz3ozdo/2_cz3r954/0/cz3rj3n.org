No, what canon implies is that /some/ people, like in the real world, have their father's names as their middle names. For instance I notice that James Sirius Potter and Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy don't factor into your theory for some reason.

And personally I think it is bad fanon, because giving someone their father's name as their middle name is rather formulaic and usually done when there's no reason to actually think of a middle name. The Blacks on the other hand have a rather extravagant naming system (stars, really?) and the ones whose middle names we do know (Regulus Arcturus, Phineas Nigellus) don't follow the typical.
