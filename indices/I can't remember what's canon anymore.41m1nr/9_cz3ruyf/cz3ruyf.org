That is interesting. Canon is definitely more vivid in my mind. I am re-reading for the first time though, so it's a factor, but before beginning my re-read, I could tell what was being exaggerated. It probably helps when you like most of the canon characters, good and evil.

I also very rarely get past chapter 10 of any fanfic, especially the 5000000000000k word ones.
