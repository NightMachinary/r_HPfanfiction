I have an excel spreadsheet with details of the story, a short review anywhere from a couple words to a few paragraphs, and a pretty complicated rating system. Not everything is on there - it's mostly long fics (70k+) which I've finished. A lot of tropey guilty pleasures or recently stuff I don't feel like reviewing don't get put on there; I'd estimate only about 60% of what I've read are actually on there, so I do blank on titles quite a lot.
