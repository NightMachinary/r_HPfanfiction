For me, its a combination of memory and having the vast majority of the fics I've read saved on an app. If I see someone looking for a fic, and it sounds familiar, I can usually just scroll down on the app to see what its called so I can link it. But because I have so many saved, I have to remember at the very least whether it was a shorter fic or longer fic, and when I last downloaded it onto the app. Otherwise, it takes forever to find. Still possible, but not worth it.
