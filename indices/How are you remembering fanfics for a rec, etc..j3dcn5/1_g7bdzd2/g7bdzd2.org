Half the time the search request is for a really popular fic. The second half of the time the request is super generic as to be impossible (unless it happens to fall under the really popular fic part). The third half are the fics that the miracle works who drudge through the worst of the worst and somehow know exactly what the fic is based on a single phrase.
