I assume that for less popular works, what happens is that you get that one person who loves the trope or ship and has low standards, meaning they read basically every fic out there with it, who delivers with a link.

For instance, if people are looking for a particular LESS fic, chances are high that I've read it, and can deduce the fic from rather vague statements.

However, I, like you, don't really store read fics anywhere, so I go on memory alone. So it sometimes causes me to be unable to track down a fic, even if I recognize it.
