I download all fics I've ever read to calibre because I prefer to read on my paperwhite instead of my phone (and my eyeballs thank me for it). So... I have oodles of fics that are all labelled and categorized with custom columns, and I can even search the text of each story if I recognize a specific line that the requester quoted.

Really, the only time I read in a browser is if it's a currently-updating fic that I'm excited for and a new chapter was just posted.

Honestly, its a little excessive but there you go.
