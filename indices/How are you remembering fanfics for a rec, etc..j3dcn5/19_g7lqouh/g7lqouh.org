I go to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/favorites/story.php]] and set the sort to "Sort by Date Added" and to Harry Potter. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/favorites/story.php?sort=added&categoryid=224&userid=0][Cheater Link]]

Then I jump around pages depending on how far back I remember reading it.If I read a fic to the end, and I like it enough to read later? I favorite both the fic and the Author.

I might end up doing an excel sheet in my googledrive eventually.
