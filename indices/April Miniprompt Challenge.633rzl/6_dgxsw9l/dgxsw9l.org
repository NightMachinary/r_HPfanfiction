*Challenge*

Tim the tentacle monster from Rorschach's Blot's linkffn (3695087) enters SpoonandJohn's fabulous linkffn (11634921) and then crack occurs. Sorry, it got a bit long.

“Potter!!”

“Yes Professor?” Hari looked back from his desk where he had one arm raised over a line of open books as his other arm appeared to be casting a page turning charm.

“I'm not going to ask what you're doing, I don't want to know. However something else has come up that has become my problem and as such, it is also yours. Please come with me to the Headmaster's Office.”

“Of course Professor.” The books snapped close and Hari shrugged the sleeves of his robes back into place.

Upon reaching Dumbledore's office Snape stared at a forlorn looking tentacle monster slumped in a pink chintz chair opposite the Headmaster's desk. “Ah, Professor Snape, Professor Potter. Good of you to join us. Allow me to introduce Tim.”

“A pleasure to meet you Tim,” Hari nodded at the sighing monster. “What seems to be the problem Professor Headmaster?”

“I found Tim earlier this evening when I felt him cross the wards. He was down by the lake. I initially assumed he was one of your guest instructors Professor Potter, but he was apparently looking for the giant squid. They seem to have had a relationship in the past, in a different dimension.”

“Albus, how in the world did this become my problem?” asked Snape.

“Ah yes, I have decided that anything that ventures into the realm of odd is Hari's problem, and as your problems are his problems, it's easier to make it your problem first so that you can find him and bring him to my office. Lemon drop?” He offered up a bowl of damp candy.

“No, but thank you Professor. So Tim, you're from a different dimension? Oh, portkey incident, that's too bad. You were an Auror? Tough break on the tentacle. Oh, they grow back? That fast, really?” Hari carried on the conversation while Snape looked on, not allowing his utter confusion to show, as Dumbledore seemed to be keeping up quite easily. “Professor Headmaster, I believe I need to go on a field trip with Tim, about a week perhaps?”

“That will be fine. It was a pleasure to meet you Tim. See you soon Professor Potter, Severus.” He dismissed them while staring at his candy dish mournfully.

“Hari.”

Hari's head came swooping to the door of his room in a slightly wobbly fashion, his neck extending from his bed. “Still working on that. Yes Uncle Pein?”

“Aren't you supposed to be back in your school?”

“Technically, but I'm on a field trip. How did you know I was here?”

“Three things gave you away.”

“Oh?”

“Hidan came running into my office screaming about leather, tentacles, paper, and ‘Not again!' before he passed out by the spark sparrow upon seeing the latest addition to my office, which was my second clue. Finally, I received a gift basket from Orochimaru thanking us for the contributions to his research along with a bill for the equipment stolen. I noticed that the tank containing the two tentacles in my office was labeled ‘Property of Orochimaru' and it all seemed to come together in my mind.” Pein bit out at Hari's bobbing head.

“Two tentacles? Already? That's great Uncle Pein!” Hari's head slid back as his neck shortened to normal length. “Come on in, I'll have to check on that soon, are they both the same size? Are there any buds?”

“One is quite small compared to the other as of now, I didn't inspect it too closely. Hari, I really don't want to ask, but why do you have another tank with a tentacle in your room and are those sharingan on it?”

“Yeah, they must slow the growth process down as this one has yet to sprout more tentacles. I'll have to sort that out. Maybe I should use a Senju bush with some Tim juice.” Hari jumped from his bed and started scribbling in a notebook.

“Hari, let's pretend I have no idea what you're talking about and you tell me where these tentacles come from, why Orochimaru is sending me a thank you and a bill, and what happened to Hidan this time.” Pein tried to remain calm, watching as his “nephew” bounced around like a mad scientist on a sugar high. “Please sit down while doing so.”

Hari sat down and began, “I was at school and there was a dimensional teleportation accident which resulted in a tentacle monster named Tim stuck at the school. I couldn't send him to the Eldritch Plane and they gave him to me to deal with. So after I discovered that he had really great regenerative powers I told him I could bring him here and it would only cost him an arm and a leg, well, technically two arms and legs, er, make that four tentacles, I'm trying to work that out, I think Uncle Kakuzu might get a chuckle-“

Pein interrupted, “You brought an Eldritch Horror to the Elemental Nations and convinced it to let you chop off its limbs for payment?”

“Sounds about right.”

“Continue,” Pein felt a massive migraine coming on.

“Well, I wanted to experiment on the limbs to see if I could reverse grow a tentacle monster from a tentacle, which seems to have started showing promise in your office, I hope your Animal Path can use it, and Orochimaru has the best labs, so I broke in, left him a tentacle and some notes along with a bit of Tim juice, then took a couple of tanks for us to use here. Before you say it, I hadn't come home yet so I didn't leave here unaccompanied and I left Sasuke alone this time.” Hari stated proudly.

“So you left one of our enemies a piece of an unthinkable, regenerative monster as well as notes about its origins and ‘Tim juice'? Why would you give that to Orochimaru, and what is ‘Tim juice'?”

“I left it with Orochimaru because I won't have the time to do all of the experiments I want to on my own while I'm in school and, though he isn't as refined in his techniques as I am, when I come back, I can steal all of his new research and take things on from there. Tim juice is something I made from the fourth tentacle, a sort of regeneration liquid.”

Pein counted off the points in his head. There was still one issue, and he wasn't sure if he wanted to know the answer. “And what about Hidan?”

“I really can't be sure about that one. Based on what he said though, my guess would be that he tried to visit Aunt Konan without knocking.”

“And why would that... please tell me you didn't.”

“Tim needed someone to stay with, and he's on the rebound. Based on Konan's books, it seemed to fit, strangely so did the harness she broke out when I introduced them. I wonder why she's splitting into paper though, huh,” Hari mused. “Anyway, I only have another day before I have to get back to school, did you need anything else?”

“No. No, I think that will be all. Hari, from now on, please get my permission before bringing guests home with you, even and especially if they are in pieces. Also, when you return from school, you will come home immediately without stopping by any of the other Hidden Villages, labs, or anywhere in any other Elemental Nation. Is that understood?”

“Yes Uncle Pein.”

“Thank you Hari.” Pein left to go have a long lie down before making Itachi deal with everything.
