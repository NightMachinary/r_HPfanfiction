I was faced with a tough decision and an incredible opportunity. Never in my whole life would I have thought that I would be given a second chance. I regret many things of my life, and standing here in what I assume is King's Cross Station, with a train willing to take me anywhere in my past, I am unable to choose where, or perhaps should I say, when.

Perhaps I would go back to that fatefull night whence I met Gellert. Fell for his charms and the promise of a challenging mind. Maybe this time I could save ourselves from our youthful and power-driven quest. Maybe I could convince him that our love was more important than conquest over death. I wish I could say this was out of my need to save all those countless lives he destroyed in his ravaging war. Alas, it is true I never fell in love with anyone else, and I missed him more than anything in this world.

No, there would be no redemption to those terrible mistakes of my past. Let Magic judge me truly for who I am. I boarded the train and asked the driver to take me to the night of my death, right to the moment where we landed in the astronomy tower. I was weak, I remember the weakness. Holding on to Harry's shoulder. I looked at him in the eye, his wonderful green eyes. Harry. Strong, loveable, wonderful Harry.

"Harry," I said, in my weak and raspy voice, "look me in the eye Harry," he turned to me, with concern all over his face. "Be strong Harry, I am so sorry for not doing enough. For not being there enough. I am so sorry. Don't blame Severus,"

He was so confused, I could see it clearly in his face, shocked to silence. "I love you Harry, never forget that" I said as I heard steps climbing the stairs, petrifying and silencing him temporarily and throwing his invisibility cloak over him. Alas, the rest was history, and I smiled at Severus as he cast my end.
