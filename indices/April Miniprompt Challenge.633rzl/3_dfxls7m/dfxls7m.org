*H*e was suddenly standing in his old bedroom, and by the calendar on the wall, it was December 1978. Without any further thought, he disillusioned himself. Suddenly, his younger self walked into the room. He suddenly remembered that Albus. This Albus was tired, slouching, with limp unwashed hair and walking with no purpose. He watched himself sit down on the bed.

*A*lbus couldn't tell when this was. He was stuck to his place on the floor, trying not to make a noise. He couldn't exactly remember this period in his life because all the days ran together. He remembered how this Albus /felt/, but not much else.

*T*he young Albus was sitting on his bed, and pulled the Deluminator out of his pocket. He started playing with it, flicking the lamp on and off, alternating the room's main light source between the lightly curtained window and the lamp. His listless flicking made the disillusioned Albus stiff with anticipation. The next ball of light stopped in front of the young Albus, confusing him. He kept flicking the Deluminator, but nothing was happening. The ball then slowly came to Albus and went inside of him, his face showing surprise and a sudden sense of purpose that shed his despondent eyes and mouth.

*H*e stood up, and apparated to Aberforth's bar. Albus still stood in the corner, with a smile on his face. He remembered how they both spent Christmas that year, reforging a brotherhood that combined the strain with a reactivated loving undertone that hadn't been there for a long time.

*A*lbus decided to try something. He apparated, and reappeared in his office at Hogwarts, back to where he was before. Then, he wrote down that Ron would get the Deluminator.
