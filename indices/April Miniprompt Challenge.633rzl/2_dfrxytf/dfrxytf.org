A take on the freeform challenge set at some point during the HBP school year and a tentative first step into the world of fan fiction, I'm sure there are some grammatical errors but I'm probably not going to find them on another read through so I'm hoping they're well hidden at least. Hopefully you enjoy reading it anyway!

He'd spent almost ninety-eight years wallowing in his guilt over that dreadful summer's night. His initial grief had become a rage unlike anything he had known before but which left him feeling hollow. This anger had shifted after his strained relationship with Aberforth had been shattered so publicly at Ariana's funeral leaving him to deal with the pointed questions and false sympathy from those who had never made the slightest effort when his mother had struggled to contain Ariana's magic on her own. Worse even than the snide muttered comments made by people, seemingly uncaring whether he could overhear them or not, was the new sense of self-loathing he had come to possess which had taken his impotent fury and presented it with a new, readily available target -- himself. But, finally, he had the opportunity to discover the truth after his failed attempt to achieve his end with the resurrection stone the previous summer.

Albus knew that he would be unwise to alter the outcome of that warm afternoon in Godric's Hollow though, he admitted to himself, that was not the purpose of the journey through time. Nor was the fact that it was supposedly an impossible feat, yet another piece of miraculous sorcery to further cement his reputation and dazzle others as he had done in his foolish, youthful days. No, he told himself, this was all to help Harry in his quest to finally defeat Tom Riddle which he knew by now was going to require his sacrifice, hopefully at the wand of Severus if he was not going to have the luck to slip across to the other side quietly and naturally in the coming summer. But to give him the strength to face his coming death he had to know before he came across his family again as he knew he must one way or another.

His wand swept through the air in a complex pattern and with a muttered incantation he felt a gentle pull on his arm as he turned and stumbled. It seemed to last an eternity, the darkness pressing around him as he flailed with no idea of when the journey would finish or even what he would discover when at last he reached his destination whether the ritual had been a success or not. After a further wait which seemed to take forever he began to feel more settled as though he was standing on solid ground again.

Slowly, the late afternoon sun settled across his vision and he glanced around the unkempt front room of the Dumbledore residence as he heard raised voices coming from the garden at the rear of the quaint, old cottage. Carefully disillusioning himself he crept through the kitchen and through the open door in time to witness Gellert turn the Cruciatus curse onto his younger brother.

His gaze swept across the immaculately kept lawn and fell onto his younger self's torn countenance as both Albus Dumbledore's took in the scene before them. His teenage self reacted in seconds and leapt in to duel Grindelwald with no effort made to protect himself from the barrage of curses which flew towards him from the other's wand even as Aberforth unsteadily regained his feet and began to launch the strongest hexes and jinxes he was able to muster at his torturer.

In the midst of their duel neither of them heeded the cries of Ariana as she bowled across the lawn, desperately trying to stop the vicious display of magic from the three older boys. When it became clear that her anguished cries were continuing to be ignored by her brothers, she attempted to intervene in the way her mother had done on several occasions in the aftermath of the attack. As she closed the gap towards the unsuspecting duellists Albus began to feel the pull of his magic, an insistent tug on his withered arm which surely signalled the end of his time in here.

Despairing at the prospect of returning without the knowledge of who had thrown that fateful curse he completely forgot himself and his earlier declaration not to interfere in the outcome of the duel. Tears threatened to obscure his vision and his arm wavered as he unsteadily pointed his wand at Grindelwald's back.

â€˜Avada Kedavra,' he choked under his breath as he prayed that this would do it, that this would save her from her terrible fate. However it was not to be as Gellert twirled away from the curse which impacted on a bone-breaking curse which had been coming from his eighteen year-old self's wand. Then the dreadful impact came and Ariana lay sprawled across the tended lawn, her bright blue eyes wide and unseeing as both brothers dropped to their knees beside her and the wrench of magic finally tore him back through the fabric of time and into his office.

As he collapsed into his high backed chair, his legs unable to support his weight any longer, his body was wracked with sobs he was unable to stop as they continued seemingly without end and then he felt it as it grew in him once again more intense than ever before, that crippling sense of self-loathing had returned and this time there was no doubt whatsoever that it was deserved.
