When he got the news, he was shocked. It took him three months of constant research, constant magical theory creation and refining. Three months of effort from a, in his humble opinion, brilliant wizard. Finally he would be able to fix it. Finally he would be able to continue moving forward, instead of being stuck on the past. But first... First he would go downstairs and firm his resolve.

Severus Snape sat beside the hospital bed in a daze. It wasn't meant to be like this. He was supposed to be like her, not like a vegetable. He wasn't meant to be only sustained by the magic in his body. All because of one thing... Severus trembled as a flash of rage blazed through his thoughts just as the Hospital Wing doors opened softly.

Dumbledore stared at the helpless thin body of the boy who lived, and his eyes hardened. He would fix this... right now. With a flick of his wrist, his wand appeared in his hand, and Severus jumped to his feet.

A mumbled incantation, knowing the risks, Dumbledore vanishes in a blast of blue smoke.

The icey breeze tangled the hair of his beard as he faded slowly into existence. His other-self tensed, sensing the strong magic of his counter part. "Gilgamesh was a terrible wizard. He hated candy" Current Dumbledore spoke swiftly the words that he knew that he knew were the safe words for a time-traveling encounter. "Why?" His other-self asked as he cradled the young child. "It's too cold... and they were too cruel. They didn't take him in, in my time... He... he suffers so much." The current Dumbledore's face crumpled in pain. He could handle not knowing who killed Ariana, he could handle his brother hating him, he could handle his lover being a mass murderer, he could take the world's hatred.. But he could not stand to see that broken child lay unresponsive on a bed any longer. "Place warming charms on him. And a compulsion charm for them to take him." The current Dumbledore pleaded with his younger self.

"It has been proven that compulsions on muggles are extremely polarizing. They will do for short times, but then they will amplify the emotions that they are repressing. Surely you know this other-me?" The other Dumbledore replied.

"Better cracked, than broken. We won't be able to live with ourselves otherwise." The current dumbledore slowly became blue smoke as his words echoed.

"Albus?" Minerva asked. The aged headmaster shook his head softly as his glazed eyes firmed. "Sorry Minerva, I was having a conversation with myself."

"Either way, I do not think these muggles are good people Albus!" MInerva started.

"I know exactly how bad they are... so we will run interference." Albus pulled a letter out of his robes as he laid the bundle of happiness on the door step. With several flicks of the wand, and a soft smile, Dumbledore tapped Harry's head. "Maybe this will save you young one... I'll check back in the morning.." With a knock on the door, and a tap of the wand, Dumbledore and his Deputy disappeared from Private Drive.
