That's a bit of a loaded question, really. It's not like I thought the prompts were bad or anything, they just weren't things that really drew my interest. I almost wrote a Dumbledore one, but felt it would have been a little spoilery of my current fic and didn't really want to do that.

For this month I think two of them came directly from request threads, and I didn't think those threads were that interesting, so seeing them as prompts was a bit off putting to me.

That being said, I do think taking such ideas and turning them into prompts is really a good idea. I just think that those specific ideas weren't my cup of tea, as it were.

Personal preference wise, I prefer more slice of life things. I'm also not really a humorist when it's anything more than snark, and this month seemed like the prompts were trying to cater to humor. So that put it a bit out of my wheel house, as it were.
