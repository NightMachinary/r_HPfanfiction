I actually don't think the HP fandom has deflated that much. It's not the all pervasive craze it was, but it's still surprisingly huge, just a bit more incognito. I helped run a local convention for a few years and even though there hasn't been much new HP stuff in a while (this was before Fantastic Beasts) there were still SO many people who came in cosplaying HP characters, asking where to find the merch, looking around to see what they could find- we had to have HP themed activities every time or else we'd have upset patrons.
