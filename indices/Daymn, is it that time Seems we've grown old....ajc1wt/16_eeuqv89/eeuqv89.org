There is still bunch of fics being written about fandoms! But it's all over the place, at different sites, so it's harder to know if the fandom is dead or not. I see plenty of fics being written over at tumblr, deviant art. And a bunch being written over at spacebattles and sufficient velocity sites about worm fandom and stuff.
