Same. That's where I first started posting back in 2005. I even became a beta reader for that site, mostly so I could post my stories myself instead of having to wait for my beta to do it. I remember it as a very well-designed site with a good posting interface, message boards, and comment section. I liked that it was a curated archive, so there wasn't any of this “I wrote this at 3am lol” dreck that we have to wade through now. The community surrounding it was very active and I made some good IRL friends, including my beta that I still work with.

This sub and the associated Discord are great, but nothing like the old CM community.
