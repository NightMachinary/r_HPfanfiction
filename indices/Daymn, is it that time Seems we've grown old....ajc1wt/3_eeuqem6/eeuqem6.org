I don't think the HP fandom is dying out. It's not a worldwide phenomenon that everyone talk about anymore but more and more people I know read fanfic low key and don't really talk about it. It's easier for FFN and AO3 to survive because they cater to almost all fandoms.

However I am extremely paranoid. If I come across a fic I know I'd enjoy reading again, I immediately download it, regardless of completion. I'm scared of websites and authors deleting fics I love.
