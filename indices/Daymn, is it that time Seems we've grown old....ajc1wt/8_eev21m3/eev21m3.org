IMO the HP fanfic community is experiencing what a lot of other entertainment media have gone through historically--diffusion of their userbase.

Like how 25, 30+ years ago cable was almost the sole provider of film entertainment for the masses, such that you could talk to almost anyone about the latest episode of Friends or Law and Order because available options were limited. Then, as options grew, DVR became a thing, and everyone started diversifying what they watched, those flagship shows seemed to fade into the background a bit.

Now you have the same thing that happened here. While HP certainly wasn't the first fanfic fandom, it was by far the one that pretty much anyone who heard of fics at the time knew about, and enjoyed massive amounts of quality contributions to it. Now with HP no longer being so viral, that fandom has proliferated out into countless other series, giving a more "even" spread to author quality.

I do not think you will ever see a Second Renaissance of the HP fandom, as you put it, because it's very hard to re-monopolize cultural attention like that. What we will find instead, is smaller "renaissances" as different series go in and out of vogue, until the next super-viral story takes hold and captures everyone's attention again.
