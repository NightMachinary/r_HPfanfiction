I agree with this 100%. I dropped back into reading HP fanfic about 6 months ago after about a 7 year break. I started with the most popular stories on FFN and quickly realized so many of them followed the template you listed in your post. Add in Harry calling manipulative Dumbledore "old man" every other sentence and pretty much everything is covered.

It's obviously an exaggeration to say all popular fics include all these things but it is shocking how many well regarded fics retread those ideas/styles over and over again. They read as extended therapy sessions for venting all their personal frustrations with canon.
