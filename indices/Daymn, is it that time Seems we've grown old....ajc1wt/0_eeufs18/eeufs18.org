I remember the old days when I had a sticky note on my computer monitor with a list of Geocities pages of HP fanfiction that I checked reguarly for updates. This was in the early 2000's. There were certain fics I read and re-read so much that I ended up copy-pasting them into a word doc and printing them for a ring binder.

Geocities was nuked, and all those fics are gone. Some of them have been mirrored on FFN, but I can only check the ones whose titles + authors I remember from 15 years ago. And my mom threw away my fanfic binder years ago.

At least these days data is cheap and Ao3 has a Download function so it's much easier to save fics for posterity, outside of copying to a Floppy drive or printing in hard copy.
