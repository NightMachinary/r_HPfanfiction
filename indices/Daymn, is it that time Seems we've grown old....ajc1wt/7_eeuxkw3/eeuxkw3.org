For now, but given the culture, I'd give it a decade or less before HP is rebooted in some form, be it anthology, animated series, or something else.

The worldwide impact of HP, its British origin and status as a standout British export of the last 20 years, and the ongoing Newt films should buff it up even if the original core canon fandom depletes a little - and even then we still have, I would say, at least ten years of authors coming up from the kids of original fans who read them at the time and have passed the love of their favorite series on to the younger generation. That in particular might be an exciting time as a new generation becomes the dominant reader and interpreter of an unchanged canon from two decades ago. Already tbh over the last 5 years and since HPMOR there's been influx of new opinions to shift the tide of fanon.
