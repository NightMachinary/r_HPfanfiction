Yeah, Fiction Alley is being imported to [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/fictionalley]], but there are only 73 works there so that can't be complete. If you remember specific titles or authors, it's possible they've reposted their own stuff on FFn or Ao3.

Fandoms do tend to die once there is no more original material. The movies drew HP out somewhat, but it's pretty natural it would die down. That said, I still feel like there's plenty of stuff being posted for HP on the big 2. Maybe not as much as the heyday, but still a good amount.
