I think it's usually up to the site's owners or to dedicated readers to import old works to Ao3. Could be wrong though. I have noticed with other sites/archives that this doesn't happen nearly enough.

Perhaps if people work together we might be able to import a lot of work. I wouldn't mind doing so if others also pinch in to help importing.
