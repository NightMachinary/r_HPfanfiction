I've been reading fanfic for six years, so it was after the movies ended. I wouldn't say it's gone downhill, but it hasn't experience the renaissance I hoped might be coming from /Fantastic Beasts/. I'd also say it's evolved. When I started reading, there were a lot of derivative Super!Harry and Harmony stories. Now, it feels to me like there are a lot more dark stories, Slytherin pairings, and even Harry/Tom and Hermione/Tom stories (which I really don't understand).

I've been on FFN from the start, so I've been lucky enough to avoid any sites dying on me, but I've also downloaded all of my FFN favorites with Calibre, just in case the site finally collapses under its own weight.
