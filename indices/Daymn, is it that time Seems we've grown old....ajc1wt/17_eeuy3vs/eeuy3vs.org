I feel this post. The first fanfic that made me fall in love with fanfic when I was about 12/13 was a Harry/Draco slash and I couldn't find it now if I wanted to. The only thing I remember about it anymore was that it was definitely not on a major site, but I couldn't tell you which of the many, many smaller sites it used to be on because I, too, used to have lists of the smaller sites now long since trashed. Would love to help the fandom save some of these smaller sites!
