There was a brief period where HPFF went down last spring. I hadn't been involved in the fandom for years but had a strong desire to re-read my favorite fic only to discover I had missed the deadline by a week. I was devastated. I scoured the internet but couldn't find a trace of it.

Thankfully someone put the site back up and I was able to download the story but that piece of me was almost lost forever.
