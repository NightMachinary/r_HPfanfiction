I"ve been reading HP fanfic for half my life at this point. From the fun old days when the books were still coming out, through the end of the movies. There's so many half-remembered fics that I'll never find again. I remember reading fiction when the death of Sirius and Fred was first published. I remember reading alternate versions of the dementor trial. The thought of everything coming to an end is upsetting to say the least.
