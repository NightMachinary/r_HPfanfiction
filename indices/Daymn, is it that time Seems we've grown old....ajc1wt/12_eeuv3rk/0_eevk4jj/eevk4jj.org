I've gotten Harry Potter commemorative editions of both Time and Newsweek at Walgreens. Neither of them had fanfiction recommendations that I saw, so maybe you're even thinking of a third?

The fandom is quieter these days, but I really don't think it's in danger. Change isn't death. On AO3, if you filter to all Harry Potter fics, you can refresh and get a new one as the most recently updated fic every few minutes sometimes.
