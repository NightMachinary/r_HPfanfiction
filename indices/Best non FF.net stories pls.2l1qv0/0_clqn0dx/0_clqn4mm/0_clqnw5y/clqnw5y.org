Definitely check out A Year Like None Other - amazingly well written and just all around awesome.

If you're open to slash I'd recommend [[http://thetwobroomsticks.slashcity.net/siren/DracosBoyindex.html][Draco's Boy]].

Summary: "Harry and Draco meet as eight-year-olds after Harry moves in next door. Draco takes a liking to Harry and decides to make him his boy. Follow them as they grow-up together, learn each other's deepest secrets and, after a little bit of angst and a whole lot of UST, fall in love."

The fic does contain m/m relationships but not until you get towards the end and I could be wrong but I don't think it ever progresses to full on sex. The story itself is fantastic and very well written.

I can't think of any others off the top of my head but if I do I'll let you know.
