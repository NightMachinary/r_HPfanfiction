My likes/dislikes:

1. No eroticism unless it's overwhelmingly surrounded by plot.
2. Well written, in the grammatical sense.
3. The more creativity or originality the better.
4. Protagonist needs flaws, antagonists need strengths.
5. No lazy bashing. Criticize people all you want based on canon or common sense, but don't write anyone as unrealistically stupid or pointlessly maliciously evil just to give yourself more things to criticize about them.
