I have, in a surprising twist of events, hence why I offered a fic that met the request's guidelines.

#+begin_quote
  read a fic where Dorea Potter survived
#+end_quote

That said, this form of phrasing implies that the OP believes Dorea Potter is canonically James Potter's mother.

Phrasing that would indicate the OP is aware of the fic's change from canon would be something along the lines of "read a fic where Dorea Potter, here Harry's grandmother, survived".

The rest of the post falls along similar lines. It leaves an impression that the OP has a warped view of canon from fanfiction. As someone who has had the same thing happen to them (Snape and the godfather thing), I know that I would appreciate the reminder.

I don't think that offering information about canon impacts the validity of my recommendation in any way. If you've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear]] and disagree, fair enough.
