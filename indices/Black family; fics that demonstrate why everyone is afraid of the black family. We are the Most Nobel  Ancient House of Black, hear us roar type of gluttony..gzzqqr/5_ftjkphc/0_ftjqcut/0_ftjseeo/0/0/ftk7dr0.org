I don't disagree. I do disagree when fanfiction overrides canon as the default.

Canon actually never said Charlus and Dorea were James' parents. JKR published a family tree of the Blacks that mentioned Charlus and Dorea Potter.

I don't mind it if a fic has Charlus and Dorea as James' parents. I do mind if Charlus and Dorea becomes the default assumption for Harry's grandparents.
