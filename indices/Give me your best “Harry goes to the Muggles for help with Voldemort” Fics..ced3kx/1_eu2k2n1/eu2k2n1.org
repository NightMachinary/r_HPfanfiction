Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

The Death Eaters are a lot more similar to the Nazis, the ministry tries appeasement politics and doesn't do anything to stop muggleborn discrimination, Dumbledore can't do much without antagonizing the ministry, and Hermione has enough, doesn't care what the ministry thinks about her any more and decides to blow up the pureblood summer ball at Malfoy Manor with a lot of muggle explosives. Muggles are helping, but only by supplying guns and explosives and by training the muggleborns in how to fight like soldiers.
