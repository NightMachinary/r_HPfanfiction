Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

is kinda like this, Harry accidentally exposes the magical world to the muggles and the muggle governments have to deal with Voldemort in a similar fashion as Al-Qaida (which is controlled by a Death Eater after Bin Laden's death). Voldemort also gets his hands on some portkey nukes after taking over North Korea with polyjuice.

It's not Harry centric, the plot jumps all around the world to show the different reactions to the two words clashing, although the American Secretary of Magic is probably the character with the most chapters from his perspective.
