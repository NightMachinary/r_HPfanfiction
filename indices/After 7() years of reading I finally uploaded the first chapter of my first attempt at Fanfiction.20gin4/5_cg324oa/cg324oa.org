I'm just now getting around to writing mine. Actually, I haven't even started writing, I'm just doing an outline.

I've been meaning to do it for a long time, but I keep reading other fanfics which give me new ideas, then I try to find a way to incorporate those ideas in my story, fail, change the plot, repeat...

It's been a long process.
