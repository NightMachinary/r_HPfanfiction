I only published a few chapters to test to see what my writing look like and then removed it. I saved my fanfics on my Mac and PC. Hah. I think my writing is better than my first fanfic. I do remember looking back at my first fanfic and I found myself wishing I could disappear...

Problem is I already wrote quite a few different stories with different plots but never dedicated to one of them. Any tips for new authors? Maybe you can share us with your experience so far?

It is a bit frustrating for me to decide which fanfic I want to stick with. My ideas keep popping up - always at beginning - like escaping Dursleys, or Halloween Eve with a twist.

Thanks.
