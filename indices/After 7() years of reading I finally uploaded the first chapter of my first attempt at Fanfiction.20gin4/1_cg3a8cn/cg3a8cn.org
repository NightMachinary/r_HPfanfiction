I was writing my story for over a year before I mustered the courage to start posting. It also took me a month to ask for a beta. I was just so terrified of rejection. Finally I asked the beta I had been looking at. She wanted to read my first three chapters ( I think she was slightly over whelmed to realize I had so much already written) and she loved it. I still was pretty nervous so I didn't post till three weeks later. I now feel great about my writing, and am improving so much. I have a second beta too and he's really wonderful as well. I've now posted 23 chapters ( it's still not finished) and have over 100 followers/ reviews. It took me a long time to have the confidence to post it, but now I feel silly that it took me so long. I was just terrified people would hate it and I would receive awful reviews etc. but everyone so far has just been really kind. Edit: word spelled wrong.
