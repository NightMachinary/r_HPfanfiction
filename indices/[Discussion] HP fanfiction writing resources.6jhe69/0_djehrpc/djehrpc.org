Not /Harry Potter/ specific, but some basic British English resources are always useful:

[[https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/en/quick-grammar/british-english-and-american-english][Quick grammar comparisons]]

Wikipedia's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_American_and_British_English][Comparison of American and British English]], which also has some helpful websites in the external links section.
