Yep, I'm the guy who created the site and I'm still the editor in chief. There's currently an international team of fans who are working on the Lexicon, which in its old form was hand-coded in 1990s and is now basically impossible to edit. We had to do something to make it usable on smaller screens and edit-able. Our big projects right now are improving search and re-creating our timeline (I created the original Potter timeline that's now used by Rowling etc. as canon).

The Lexicon has always been by and for fans, but until the new site came out it also had to have some advertising on it to help cover the costs. That means that if you archived the site instead of using it live, you took away our income, and that would have been slightly problematic. However, when we created the new site, I decided to just pay for it myself and get rid of the ads. I have a Patreon page and get a little bit of income from that, but that's not even close to being enough to pay the bills.

So if you use an archived version of the Lexicon, you're not taking anything away from the running of the site. It's out of date and incomplete, but I'm glad it's still useful to you. The text is protected by copyright, but if you're not redistributing the site or claiming it as your own, I'm not fussed if you use your own copy.

I hope you do give the new version a try, though. It has a lot more functionality and it's fanatically up to date. The search will be getting better and better, and we're adding features all the time. Since there are no ads, this isn't a sales pitch. We're just twenty fans who would love to welcome all Harry Potter fans to enjoy and benefit from our work, and to use the Lexicon as their starting point for researching Potter canon on the web.
