Really? Because I was using your "Potterwords" page for awhile before it disappeared, and it disappearing from your page is part of why I said I was having trouble finding stuff. (Though the post announcing it still shows up if you search for it: [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2005/10/15/october-15-2005/]] )

And yeah, I just about gave up on trying to figure out exactly when canon events happened. I'm sure someone is going to call me out on it if I ever manage to post my fic, lol.
