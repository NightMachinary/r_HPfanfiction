I didn't take it as at all jerkish. I completely understand. I'm just glad that the Lexicon is useful to fans. That's one reason why I took advertising off the site -- I find all the ads on the Harry Potter Wiki to be distracting, and I figure as long as I can afford to pay for it myself (with a little help from Patreon), I'll keep it ad free.
