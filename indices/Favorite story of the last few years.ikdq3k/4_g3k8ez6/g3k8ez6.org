Have to go with linkffn(Victoria Potter) in terms of currently updating fics. Just a great story. That said, there is a trio of fic writers right now writing sorta retro, magically powerful adventure stories and they are just so fun to read. LF74 is one of the most concise and efficient writers around right now and they have two great fics, linkffn(Soul and Body) and linkffn(Blood and Water). linkffn(Subversion by Myricle) singlehandedly demonstrates that powerful Harry can be pulled off with great writing. And linkffn(The Imposter Complex) is just an addictive adventure read.
