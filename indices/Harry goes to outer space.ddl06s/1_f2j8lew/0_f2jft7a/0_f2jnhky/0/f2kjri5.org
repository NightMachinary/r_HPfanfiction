I wouldn't mind it that much if it wasn't Voldy/Harry. I've read some slash (some even pretty graphic with skipping those scenes altogether) but it was all accidental and I didn't want to stop because of it except in the cases of Voldy/Harry which I can absolutely not tolerate. And I won't deliberately read it, since it doesn't worth it for me. I'm sure I'll be labeled as homophobic by expressing this particular opinion.
