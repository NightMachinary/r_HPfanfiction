Everyone has different preferences. People on this sub shouldn't have a problem with you voicing your opinion as long as you express it as subjective rather than an objective fact. I.e. saying "I prefer not to read this pairing" is fine, but saying "every fic with this pairing is terrible" would be wrong and insulting to the fans who have different preferences.
