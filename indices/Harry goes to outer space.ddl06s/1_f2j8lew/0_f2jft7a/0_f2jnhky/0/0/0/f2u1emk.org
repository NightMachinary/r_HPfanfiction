That was very well said. I know when I started reading fanfic I hated the idea of Harry/ Tom riddle but then I read one fic that was really changed how they were both presented and it kinda changed my views. I still dislike Harry/ Voldemort because to me, Voldemort is the psychopathic killer, whereas Tom riddle was who he had the potential to be. People have created their own personas on who he could've been, which is what I find hella interesting. But ya, I completely understand where everyone is coming from, it wouldn't be much fun if we all had the same opinions
