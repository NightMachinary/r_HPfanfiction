It's completely unreadable because there's no option to change away from the blindingly bright background. Add to that the unintuitive format and a mess of tags that aren't consistent across authors if you try searching for something, and you're left with a site on which the only merit is the ability to display the whole story at once instead of going chapter by chapter... not that it's useful on that site because you /still can't read it due to the unchangeable white background/.
