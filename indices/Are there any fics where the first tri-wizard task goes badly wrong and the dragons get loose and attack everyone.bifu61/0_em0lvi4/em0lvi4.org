Oh man I'd love to see a fic where things just keep going from bad to worse.

First task, a dragon somehow breaks loose, kills and eats Krum, and rampages until fake-Moody finally manages to hit it with a Killing Curse.

Second task, the grindylows go berserk and instead of just getting some cuts, Fleur gets decapitated and nobody knows wtf is going on until Fleur's headless body floats to the surface, and then the statis charm on her little sister breaks b/c somehow it was tied to Fleur and the kid drowns and now there's a diplomatic crisis and Britain is on the verge of a magical war with the continent.

But they /have/ to finish because otherwise the Goblet will kill Harry and Cedric, so they do the hedge maze and Moody pulls his shenanigans to help Harry win, but in the process of making Cedric stumble, he falls in front of an acromantula and gets eaten.

Harry stumbles his way to the winners cup but accidentally touches the cup with his wand instead of his hand, which causes this freak portkey accident and ends up smearing Harry's body across half of Scotland and causing an obviously-magical explosion that brings the world to the brink of permanently breaking of the Statute of Secrecy.

Then the irony is, once the SoS is broken, dealing with Voldemort becomes trivially easy. CIA blackops kidnapping site + muggleborn wizard assassins working for The Company mean Riddle is contained, obliviated back to infancy, and dumped in a hole.
