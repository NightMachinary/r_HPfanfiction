And she can play music and yells at people but only if necessary. She also can do magic.

linkffn(6671596) A necessary Gift: [[/spoiler][Harry travels to a world where he is dead... He also eats jizz in the company of goblins. Pretty much teh mass of teh story, also politics and stuff.]]

Edit: I noticed that my second example describes the plot to well, so it put in under spoilers.
