  Of course, you should not actually say if you're going to finish the fic. That's just bad taste. (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧

It is very often so that fics are abandoned with no explanation, are the ones with the most promise.

There are several thousand fics on just ff.net alone, and I would think that less than 3% are still continued to this day.

It sadens me to see fics abandoned with no real way of gaining momentum again.

It breaks my heart that Fire Born stopped, I really loved it. It had, according to me, the perfect start, a great way to see the "master of death" and a real feeling of comradery between Tom and Harry (though this may be because of the fact it didn't get far).

I saw so much potential, ...and it pains me to see it just beeing there on my favorites list and expect there to be .. no updates... ever...
