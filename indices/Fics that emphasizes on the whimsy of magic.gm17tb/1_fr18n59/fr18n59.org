One of the things which were present in JKR books (and films), but almost no fanfic story was able to include was general feeling of imperfection of magic. Magic is great, but it kind of fails a little bit most of the time: magical transport is awesome, but all modes of it are a bit of disaster; Weasley's Burrow is kept together by magic, but it is still slightly falling apart; Hogwarts castle is magnificent but a little bit shabby (remember Snape's office in the films?); professor Flitwick can teach students about levitation charms, but he constantly falls from the heap of books; house-elves are faithful slaves, but they their own head as well, and don't let me start on the Hogwarts' library.

Victoria Potter tries to achieve the similar effort by making the magical world closer to the nature, but it just makes magic more Rousseauian, not this half-comical effort to pretend perfection where there is none.
