I really like this fic. To give a bit more context, extremely powerful older Harry time travels to kill Tom before he makes his first horcrux. Dumbledore doesn't like or trust Tom, but he is /not/ just going to stand by while some random madman tries to attack one of his students. Things go on from there.

(This really isn't a spoiler, that's all obvious in the first chapter)
