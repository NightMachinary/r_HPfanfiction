Well as you probably already read them, it's likely unnecessary, but just in case (and for the other viewers of this post):

The Other Boy Who lived is one I haven't seen recced here in a long time, so maybe you haven't read it. Some interesting concepts in this one.

The art of self-fashioning is a great, dark story, likely my favorite completed fic that has Neville as the BWL. Really enjoyed the development of Harry's abilities.

​

HP and the Boy Who lived the most obvious one, fantastic world building, I really liked how the author developed the Durmstrang educational system, shame it's incomplete:

​

No Knowledge, No Money, No Aim is a fun, incomplete fic. Has the whole nobody knows how OP OP!Harry is trope.
