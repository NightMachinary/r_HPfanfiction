I enjoyed linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes) . It's very similar to linkffn(Prince of Slytherin) but I found I enjoyed Den of Snakes and the Sarcasm and Slytherin series a lot more. It gets less AU. Another very interesting WBWL is linkffn(Antithesis) , one of my absolute favorite fics of all time
