It's one of the more prominent plot lines in Magic Knows No Boundaries But Those We Believe In by NeverGonnaStop. Be warned tho it is not finished and certainly over the top (may be even called Mary sue) but it is practically wandlore porn in term of explaining how elder wand is so powerful. Very cool wand creation ideas. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13162660/1/]]
