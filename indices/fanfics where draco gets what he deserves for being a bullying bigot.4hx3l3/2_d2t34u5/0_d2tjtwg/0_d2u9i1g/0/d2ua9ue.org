I'm literally not even joking right now, I read that exact theory on Facebook and all the comments were like "I knew it!!" [[http://winteriscomingbitch.tumblr.com/post/8020005929/jk-rowling-revealed-in-an-interview-that-draco][Here]] is the same claim on tumblr, alleging JKR said it. I could come up with a good dozen other bullshit theories that have been spread claiming 'JKR said it' when either 1) no she didn't. Ever. Or 2) she said something tangentially related (Eg: Harry *might* be better /in some ways/ for Hermione than Ron) and turned it into their own wish fulfillment ('Harry and Hermione are confirmed! Ginny and Ron were mistakes!').

In this case it's the damn Draco/Hermione shippers. Apparently they've taken the 'he teases you because he likes you^{1} ' notion, combined it with their attraction to Tom Felton, and their ability to relate to Hermione, and gone full wish fulfillment, reading comprehension of the actual series be damned. (Side note: I have no issue with shippers of any pairing, as long as they are aware that some ships require a certain level of OOCness. Dramione wouldn't work with the canon characters, but that doesn't stop me from reading good AU/OOC fics).

^{1} Apparently they also fail to realise that calling someone racial slurs and wishing death upon them at age 12 isn't the same as playful teasing.
