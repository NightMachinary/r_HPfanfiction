I nearly downvoted on instinct.

My favourite is when theories like 'Draco almost fought in the Battle with the Order because of his love for Hermione!' Crop up like....no. You're literally contradicting canon, there's zero evidence for your claim. If that was the fucking intent of the author she would have fucking hinted it, like she did with every other couple/character growth. >:(
