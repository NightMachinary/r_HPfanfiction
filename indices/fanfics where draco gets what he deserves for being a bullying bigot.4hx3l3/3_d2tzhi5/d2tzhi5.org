So, I'm in the same boat as the OP. I hate Draco, and I have a strong distaste for fics that worship Draco. I read a fic called linkffn(accountable by dyce), which is NOT a dramionie fic but I wish it was. It's essentially an 8th year fic and Draco lost his arm in the war. He's humble, self-aware and . . . I don't know how best to describe it, wry. It's not a facet of Draco that I've seen before (although now I'm keeping an eye out for it, hopefully I'll find something else that's similar), and it's not exactly what you asked for (unless you count Draco cutting his own arm off as punishment, and you want to see the aftermath) but I really enjoyed the fic and I thought that Draco was the best part (not something I ever thought I'd say).
