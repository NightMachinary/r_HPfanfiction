Among my top 10 fics, exactly half has Draco killed off. Since you hate him, I'll list those for you:

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]]*, linkffn(10595005): after Voldemort's fall, pureblood extremists in the Wizengamot were crazy enough to pass a marriage law, and Hermione would have none of that. They staged a revolution and got rid of the British pureblood aristocracy, in the Roman proscription and French revolution style. Draco's arrest and execution took almost two chapters.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always]]*, linkffn(4101650): many say it's the gold standard for time travel fics, which I agree. The writing, characterization, and some of the plot are absolutely brilliant. Draco was a very minor character here and basically used as a spell fodder.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]]*, linkffn(5604382): a light-hearted Harry/Multi story, where Harry and his girls made up a really smart and powerful team. Harry, however, would hold back nothing when his family was being threatened. So when Draco threatened the life of one of his girls, Harry essentially fed him to the acromantulas.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]]*, linkffn(6989327): this fic is actually epilogue compliant. After finally rounding up the last Death Eaters, the Trio and Ginny were called by Hermione from a different dimension to defeat Voldemort one more time. Draco was a serious bad guy here, and he met a well deserved end.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11580650/1/Abraxas][Abraxas]]*: the Horcrux in Harry was sentient and it made a deal with Harry. As a result, Harry became very very powerful. When Draco's mission at Hogwarts failed, Voldemort killed him.
