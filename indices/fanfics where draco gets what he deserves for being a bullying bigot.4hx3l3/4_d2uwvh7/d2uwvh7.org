Yeah, that's exactly why I hate Draco, too (I was bullied in school for four years (and when it finally was winding down, I changed schools and those fuckers did it all over again, but not for long, I grew smarter and offered them my English homework (stuff I brezed through in minutes) - in exchange vor their business-studies homework (which would take way longer than English) and them stopping to bully me...so both sides got something from that deal)) so I know bullies quite well and frankly: I hate them all - I only hate their enablers (teachers, parents and followers) more and I think any teacher who lets bullying happen should lose his or her job and bullies should be thrown out of school if they don't stop after being warned (my school director - a monk! - was too nice in that regard, he didn't want to even suspend them and my parents didn't force the issue (they could have gotten a lawyer for example)...I mean I am not vindictive (not really), but sometimes I'd love to see them suffer as I have suffered and still suffer (I still have self-esteem issues!) and when I am in particularly dark mood I'd love to see them actually lose everything and hit rock bottom!).

I always thought he got off too easy in canon (I know his fans will tell you that he was coerced and that it was his fathers fault for raising him that way etc. etc. but all that treats Draco like he can't think for himself and it blames others for what is essentially his responsibility!), so while I can't recommend any fanfictions (I've been looking ever since I got into fanfiction and there's damned few that actually handle punishment of deatheaters and their co-conspirators and supporters etc.):

I do second this request whole heartedly :)
