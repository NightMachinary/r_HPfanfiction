It's actually something Stephen King talks about in his book /On Writing/ (which i recommend if youre interested in writing as a craft and a great read besides). He'd set a goal of 3000 words a day force himself to meet it no matter what

although King is quite prolific as an author, i dont think theres many who put out as much material as he does
