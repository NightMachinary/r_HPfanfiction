Try to find other things in the story to work on. Perhaps you could start an omake scratch file, with little jokes, and what if scenarios. Another idea is to let yourself go edit. Let your brain chew on the upcoming story, while you engage it with something different.

Another track you can take is to intentionally screw over your future plans. Kind of a "whenever you start getting bored writing, set off a bomb in the story", and then force yourself to plot out what would happen next, and try to see if that takes you where you wanted the plot to end up, and if not, if the new direction is better or worse.
