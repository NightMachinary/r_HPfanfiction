ignore the storyline and write what the person would actually do based on what you know of their personality and how people are going to react to that.

you'll probably write yourself into a corner where things become unrecoverable

think of it as an alternate timeline of what could have been and use that as inspiration to for the real chapter. hell, discarded "what if" timelines could even be a divination dream that causes the character to change what they were going to do.

I think it was the ASOIAF author who said that there's millions of discarded words for ASOIAF that never made it into the books.
