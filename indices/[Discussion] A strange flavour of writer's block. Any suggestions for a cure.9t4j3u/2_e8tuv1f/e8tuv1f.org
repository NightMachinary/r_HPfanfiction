Well , I've been trying to get a fic going for a number of months now and still haven't managed to get anything postable yet, so the following is definitely best taken with a grain of salt (this whole writing thing is very much a work in progress for me). But here are a few things that are helping me:

-Don't put everything in one file: Have ‘idea' files, and ‘wip' files and ‘real' files and everything that get you more comfortable. That's probably self-evident for most people but it wasn't for me. The first time I tried to write something, I tried to write it all in one file and as if I was going to publish it directly (I treated that file like a ffn page basically). That did not go well. At all.

-Don't fill the stuff in-between plot point with ‘and thens', this is terrible writing (Harry went to diagon and then he became friend with the goblins and then he went to the train and then a blond jerk came around and then...). Make ample use of Buts and causality. (Harry should have received his letter but the Dursleys stole them, they went into hiding because they kept receiving so many letters so Hagrid had to come and get Harry, so Hagrid ended up showing him around Diagon, It was wonderful but people were acting like he was a celebrity so Hagrid had to explain the first war to him...)

- Write for fun, edit to publish: Sometimes, I like to write super big descriptions of random places... I mean it's like minecraft but with no limitations, people should be going crazy for the stuff. I also have a fascination for long empty dialogues (like absurd levels of empty) and really inefficient communication (people hesitating, misunderstanding each-other, getting sidetracked, getting frustrated with something...). Anyway, you get the idea, the point is: even if it's not usable, write it if it makes you happy. You can decide to use it or not after. I have a bank of a few places I'll probably never use and some dialogues I might eventually use only a few snippets of, but at least I wrote something and explored some ideas that might just be good.

-Just one more: Add one sentence to your fic. It's nothing, just one. Seriously, if you are reading this, do it right now.

I hope this helps a bit, but this comment is getting really freaking long for someone who essentially have no idea of what they are talking about so I'll just end it here. Good luck and have fun!
