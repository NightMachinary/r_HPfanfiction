It's an interesting point. I mean I always knew many HP fandom readers would never consider reading something with an OC protagonist, were only really interested if Harry was the story's focus and would run screaming from anything in first person. At one point, I did /experiment/ with rewriting it as limited third person, so the stories only had two strikes against them instead of three, but I quickly stopped that. I just liked too much having what TV Tropes calls a /"First Person Smartass"/.

So yeah, I'm ostensibly doing what fan authors should be doing - writing whatever they find fun to do. And if the fandom audience doesn't like the result for whatever reason, then so be it.

Yet fan-authors put their work out there to be read for a reason. They want readership and recognition even if they don't get paid (I'm not going to pretend to be an exception). So there is at least an impulse to be audience pleasing to gain that.
