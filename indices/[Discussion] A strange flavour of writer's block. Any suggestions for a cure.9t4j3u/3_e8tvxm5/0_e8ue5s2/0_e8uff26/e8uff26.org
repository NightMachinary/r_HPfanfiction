I transcribed the original - it was written by a professional writer as advice to others interested in her profession, which is probably why the second point was included.

From a fanfiction point of view, I agree that playing to the audience isn't necessary, but I can also attest that writing what you want regardless of the reader's possible discomfort with it will reduce the audience considerably. If you're writing something you think is great and can't see why it isn't more popular, it may be that you've misjudged how much effort a reader wants to make to 'understand' an unusual topic or perspective.
