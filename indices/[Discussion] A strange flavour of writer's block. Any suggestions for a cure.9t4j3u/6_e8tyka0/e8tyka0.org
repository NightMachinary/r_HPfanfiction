You're not alone. I have the exact same problem. I'll get back to you when I find a solutionðŸ˜‚

I know why it happens though. I keep playing and replaying the entire story in my mind and since I write the story for myself, I've actually satiated my curiosity because I've experienced the story too many times in my head. And then I realized I'm only half-way into the story in terms of writing and there's still a long way to go to get to the end. It becomes a chore to write because of it. I don't know if you can get what I'm trying to say.
