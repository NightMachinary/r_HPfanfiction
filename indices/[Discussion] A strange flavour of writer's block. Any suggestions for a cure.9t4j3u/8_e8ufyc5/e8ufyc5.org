Take this with a pinch of salt, because I've never posted anything, but one of the ways I've found to overcome writer's block is to just focus on another story. For instance if I am facing writer's block on my "serious" story, I'll just spew out as much words as possible on a crack fit. Story doesn't matter, grammer doesn't matter, just write something completely silly and put down as much words as you can. It helps take my mind off where I want the "real" story to go. Then it's easier to come back later and move along.
