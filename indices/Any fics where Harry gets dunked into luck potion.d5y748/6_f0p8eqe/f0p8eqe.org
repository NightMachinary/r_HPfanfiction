Not exactly what you're asking for and slight spoliers but I remember a time/dimension travel fic where crazy!Harry, Hermione, Luna and Neville meet the marauders. In their (Harry and the gang's) universe the war had gone on for years and it's later reveiled that the reason that Harry is kind of insane is dude to extreme luck potion overdoses and withdrawal symptoms.

Can't remember the title but it was a pretty good fic.
