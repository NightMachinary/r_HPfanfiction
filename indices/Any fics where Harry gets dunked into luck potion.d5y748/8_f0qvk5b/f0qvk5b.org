You just gave me another idea for a new fic I want to write. There was an interesting post I read where someone wanted an HP fic where many of the students came to Hogwarts broken in some way shape of form because of events that happened to them beforehand like one of them getting kidnapped by fairies, being around magic disasters like how Luna lost her mother to a potions accident, or maybe two students accidentally magically binding themselves to each other.
