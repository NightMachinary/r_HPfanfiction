Maybe. /shrug/ I mostly just wanted to know what, specifically, they were screaming about. It was a long chapter. Any of it might have set them off. Or was it all of it? I'll never know. Plus, there are different kinds of screams - frustration or outright anger, fear, excitement. I'll never know which, or if it was something I could have fixed. :/ It really didn't communicate much - therefore, pointless.
