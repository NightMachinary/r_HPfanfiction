This is from an old fic I posted a few years back. I wrote a Harry Potter oneshot, definitely nsfw. Most comments were similar to "I love this" "that was hot" or "well written, you made a typo here" (I always encourage constructive criticism whenever I post a fic).

But one comment made me feel kinda, well, gross and uncomfortable. It was along the lines of "I jerked off so many times reading this."

How do I respond to that? Thanks?

I felt like I needed a shower afterwards.
