I wrote a lot, but I took a step back and looked at the plotline for a bit. It will eventually update, but I want to make sure that the whole thing actually goes somewhere. I also have the Salem Settlement, which I enjoy writing - a lot. And I'm working on a fem!Harry thing which I enjoy, as well as my own personal novel project.

But yes, I do love to see people writing what they like, what they suspect will happen,... Just as much as spite, these encouragements also help to find motivation and inspiration.
