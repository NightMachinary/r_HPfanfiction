Mine was for my Mass Effect fanfiction, but gave me a bit of a chuckle. In this story, Humanity is fighting aliens species. They humans are far weaker, have no big space fleet to speak of and have a small army.

The review insisted that they should go to every alien capital world and nuke it to oblivion, then move on to the next. They then complained that the Human leader had obviously never played a 4x strategy game if he couldn't grasp such a simple concept.
