My reviewers on ffnet are lovely and I've never had a weird one, although I get the occasional flame that is meant to be nasty. I did have one on HPFF that was the reviewer pretending to be a cat. I deleted my account a while back, but I remember them making a bunch of cat puns like "purrrfect" and doing random hissing throughout the review.
