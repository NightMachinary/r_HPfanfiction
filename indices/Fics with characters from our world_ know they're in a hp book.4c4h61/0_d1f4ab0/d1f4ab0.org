Probably the only decent one linkffn(A Curse of Truth)

I'd love to find more, but self insertion fics are pretty much an active minefield.

At their core they are basically time travel/alternate dimension fics but instead of Harry or some other character changing things, it's an OC, which I find interesting and full of potential.
