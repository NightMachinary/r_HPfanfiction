I mean yeah, the way they fight in canon is absolutely idiotic, except for when there's allies nearby, a body landing on an ally wouldn't really help that ally in a fight.

But in a one on one duel, like the Dumbledore-Voldemort duel, they were constantly apparating and sending stuff at each other, that's how I see one on one wizard duels going, they apparate and shoot and disappear again. Of course Dumbledore and Voldemort can probably go at it for fifty times longer but that doesn't change the point.
