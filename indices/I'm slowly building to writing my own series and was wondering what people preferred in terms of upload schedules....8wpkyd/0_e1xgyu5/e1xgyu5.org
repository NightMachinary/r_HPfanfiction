I prefer posting regularly after a fic is completed.

I tend to rush large fics in order to 'get to the best parts' or because I have a limited amount of time and want to read as much as possible.

Having a reliable schedule makes me slow down and think about what the author has posted.

I also feel like more people will see your fic. If you post it all at once, it will disappear into the abyss of stories. Having a constant update rate will bring it to the front page, allowing more people a chance to read it.
