I really dislike AO3 because of two reasons

There is no app. And if I accidently close but tab I have to remember what the story was called / where I was at.

The second is searching. So much trash on there but I don't know how to get rid of it.

It's been a long time since I tried to search using the site tho. But given I'm running out of content on ffn I just wait until y'all have some good recs
