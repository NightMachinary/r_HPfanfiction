I think a lot of it is people tagging things improperly. You're supposed to tag things that are an important part of the story. You don't need to tag “Slytherin Harry” if the story is about a group of Hufflepuffs in a different year and Harry makes a brief cameo wearing a green tie. You don't need to tag “Charlie Weasley” if he doesn't actually appear in the story, but Ron mentions he has an older brother who works with dragons in passing. You don't need to tag “Harry/Luna” when the story is about Draco and Hermione and there's a single sentence about Harry and Luna making out in the broom cupboard. Etc.

And then people treating them like tumblr tags. Nobody is searching “no ships because they're 11” or “everyone is gay,” you don't need to include that. People will figure out there are no ships when you don't add any romantic ship tags. People will figure out everyone is gay when you don't add any tags for M/F relationships.

I really try to limit tags for BT for that reason. Nobody wants to skim through an entire page of tags that don't tell you anything about the story.
