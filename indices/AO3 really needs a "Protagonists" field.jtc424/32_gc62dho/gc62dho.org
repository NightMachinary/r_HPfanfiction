While a good idea, sadly I think it won't change anything.

People would still tag way too many characters as protagonists. And the issue will remains.

Sometimes, it is true that there are many protag. I'm thinking about fandom such as Marvel, if someone write a story about all the Avenger team. So it makes senses to tag a dozen character, if they have equal screen time in the story, and equal importance.

So, the limit would be bad. And it's one of the reason AO3 is good with the tags.

But People manage to abuse it. And will manage to abuse everything.
