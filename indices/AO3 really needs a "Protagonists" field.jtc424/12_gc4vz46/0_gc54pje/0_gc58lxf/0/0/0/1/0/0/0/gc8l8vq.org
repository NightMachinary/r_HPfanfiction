I am 90% sure I read that one in fanfiction.net, and I have 1840 Harry Potter fanfictions saved. I refuse to ctrl+f "Narcissa" my way through 92 pages of fics because my laptop crashed and my fanfic cheat-sheet is gone.

If you are desperate to read it though, feel free to use that method of finding it for yourself. I don't think I read that many Narcissa heavy fics, so it isn't like half of them should be tagged with the name. My username on ffn is "bleeb90‚Äù
