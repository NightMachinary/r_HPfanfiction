I think that sort of happens on Ao3? I've been cherry picking & bookmarking the few Naruto fics where the protagonist is a nukenin or missing nin, and before you could make a tag out of it but it wasn't a tag suggestion & only applicable when searching within your own bookmarks.

These days it has the suggestion for nukenin ready, making that a searchable tag & easily chosen when people are adding tags to their story.

So it does happen, but I don't know how the tags are adopted.

Edit: often you do find extra tags about the main character and what makes him unique in this story.

"MOD Harry Potter", "Ravenclaw Hermione", "ANBU Kakashi". It certainly lets you know what the emphasis of the story is, and search for a specific type of fic. At the risk of excluding the ones with the same qualities that forgot the tag.
