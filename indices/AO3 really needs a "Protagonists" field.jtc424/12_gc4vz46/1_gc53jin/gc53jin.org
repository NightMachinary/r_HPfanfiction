yeah, there will often be specific tags. For instance with my most searched character there will be ‘regulus black lives' and ‘good regulus black', for Harry there might be others but my brain isn't working very well so I currently can't think of examples. But yes, there should be for pretty much every character. Sometimes it will say whose POV it is? So ‘Harry's POV' might be a tag?

These kinds of tags are my favourite because different tropes and genres will generally have their own set of tags and you learn to be able to figure out if you're going to like a fic if certain tags are present or absent.

even with the clogging I prefer AO3, it does take some getting used to though, and obviously not everyone is going to tag appropriately
