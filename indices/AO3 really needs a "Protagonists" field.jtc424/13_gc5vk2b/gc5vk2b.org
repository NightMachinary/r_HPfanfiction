I agree and disagree.

I agree that a protagonists for elf would be great. I am in the process of writing out a book that frequently goes between a handful of characters and it would be useful to point out the most frequent and consistent ones.

I disagree with the limit though. The book I mentioned goes between more than 4 characters, AO3 would let me cite the important ones FFN would cap it off. Also, if I may rag on FFN for a bit, it's absolute limit is four. If a character is in a relationship with a side character you have to decide weither to keep the 4 most important and get blasted for not putting the ship or put the ship and be blasted for not having an important character there. Also to get into writing tropes quickly, it's far more common to have 5 protagonists (for protagonist groups) than to have 4, almost as common as having 3. I'm gonna cut myself off before I continue my endless vent against FFN, but overall I don't agree with the limiter. I like the protagonist list idea though.
