But they do, there are tags that are official and searchable and tags that aren't. The problem is that characters are searchable even if that character only says two words in the story. If the writer tags every single person in the marvel fandom then that story will show up no matter who in the marvel fandom you search for.

Sometimes I think writers tag everyone because they want people to find their story no matter who they search for, it's a bit of a cheat.

Ao3 is always looking for tag wranglers to help out.
