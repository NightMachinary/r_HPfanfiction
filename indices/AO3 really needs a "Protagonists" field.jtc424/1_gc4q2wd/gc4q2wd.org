Yeah, we definitely need a kind of 'display tags' vs 'sorting tags' distinction, even if it's just the fandom coming to some agreement on how that works. Nobody sorts by 'Like, totez omg they're so cute together', but 'Regency AU' isn't that evocative an advertisement for a story when you're scrolling (even though it is pretty much a good description/guide for the Noble Houses, Pureblood Traditions stories).
