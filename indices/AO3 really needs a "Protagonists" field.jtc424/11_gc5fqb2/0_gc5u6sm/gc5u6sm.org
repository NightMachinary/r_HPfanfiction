AO3 has a dark mode too. Go to preferences, scroll down to where it says "Your site skin", and there's a dropdown list. I use Reversi, which looks very similar to this subreddit.

As a bonus, you'll always know if you're logged in or not, because when you're not, you'll be blinded by the white, lol.
