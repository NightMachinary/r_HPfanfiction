I think it would also work if we could just sort by main and side characters, and you could put a tag cap on your search. Still way easier to find what you want than in [[https://www.fanfiction.net][FF.net]] where I can only find good ones on recommendation posts, unlike in ao3 where I actually can find stuff I actually want by myself.
