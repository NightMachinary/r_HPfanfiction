omg it really does! It really sucks trying to look for work with your fave as a main character when the tag will be filled with fic with them as a minor character

and a main pairing, minor pairing or like endgame or something for ships. It sucks so bad when you're looking for your rare pare and all that comes up is those people as a minor pairing for a more popular pairing
