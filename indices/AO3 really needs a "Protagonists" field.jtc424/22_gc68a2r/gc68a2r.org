This would also be very useful if you are in a shipping mood and wanting to read certain ships. Like, because they're either popular or canon, they get featured in the relationship tag but they end up being background characters who are together and the story doesn't even focuses on them. With the protag field you could tell if they were featured just featured or if they are going to be focused on.

(just commenting because the other day I was in a shipping and romance mood and decided to search fics with a certain pairing but ran in just as many fics with them as back ground as fics focused on them. And if this is an issue from the start then you really need something to tell who's the main pairing or main characters.
