Personally, I completely disagree. Although AO3 has problems (and people don't really know how to tag, and which characters to tag as well) I find the website easier to use than, say ffn. Im 20 and I've been using ffn for 11 years or so now and yes, some features are really just better than AO3's and I can comfortably agree that some of could be implemented by them. Now, there are a few things that I like better in AO3, like the lack of adds, the layout, summary and (yes, even them): tags. What I'm going to ask is where you read, outside AO3 and ffn, I'd appreciate recommendations. * Edit: typos
