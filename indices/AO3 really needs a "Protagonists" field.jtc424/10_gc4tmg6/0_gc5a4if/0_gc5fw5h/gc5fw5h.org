Sure, but encouraging the website to implement features that allow for a better user interaction experience is more useful for everyone involved. The user has an easier time engaging with the website in a meaningful and useful way, where as the website will likely get increased traffic due to better features and ease of use.

Personally if I am looking for a fanfiction to read AO3 is always the last place I will look for something. I go so far as to google story names that people post here linked to AO3 to see if they are hosted on other websites. AO3's user experience is so bad that I actively avoid interaction with the website unless there is no other option.
