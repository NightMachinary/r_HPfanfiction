This is basically the only reason I search for SSHG excluding teacher/student. I don't care for the ship (and avoid it outright for teacher/student) but it's part of a larger list of filters I use when looking for Snape-centric fics on ao3 (The exact filters are SS&HP, SSLE, SSHG, SSOC), because it's the only way to sort of get good results for character-centric fics.
