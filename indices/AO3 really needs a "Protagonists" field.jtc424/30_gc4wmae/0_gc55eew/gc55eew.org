There are lot of tropes that should not exist / be allowed in my opinion. I fully agree with you - grown adult with children is disgusting. But ... silly things like freedom of speech and expression and all that.

Child porn, though despicable in real practice, is not always illegal to write about in a fictional setting (it is legal in quite a few countries, including US). There are lot of niche topics and for some people may be the only way to express themselves. We shouldn't be vigilantes and start deciding what is proper read and what is not.

Main reason ao3 started was because many other sites started cranking up censorship rules. Which were mainly driven by advertiser demands than anything else.

Also keep in mind lot of fanfiction is written by teenagers - it is only natural that they prefer writing about their own age group.
