You're right, complaining about it here won't do much good. I still think that complaining abt it on AO3 could help, that site is full of impressionable teens and kids who - if such relationships are normalized/idealized - are made more vulnerable to abuse. Surely even a automated warning could solve a lot of problems? The writers are free to write then, and the kids or teens aren't opened up to abuse. This is unlike the general 18+ warning, which warns for any sex and is easily clicked past.
