People are required to tag for underage or use the “choose not to use warnings” option. It's very easy to just not read anything with those two tags and to report someone who does write underage who hasn't tagged it that way.

And you can say your restrictions sound reasonable, but not everyone is going to agree on them. Who gets to make that decision? Right now it's the people who run AO3 and they've decided to deal with the issue by having people warn for it through tags. They get to make that decision because they run the archive. If you want to be sure not to run into it, or are able to report it when you see it, use ffn.
