I'd say that it's porn if the sex between a child ( let's say under 16, for the purpose of aclear rule) and a adult (again for purposes of what a rule would look like, under 16 anyone above 18 and 16 +, let's say... 7+ years age difference) is idealized, whereas with sexual abuse, the point is sort of that it's ABUSE. If people choose not to warn, or tag, then you cannot see it coming until you're reading it. Needless to say, this has problems.
