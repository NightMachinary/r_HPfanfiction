How do you decide what is child porn and what is people writing child sexual abuse recovery fics though. There are both types that can be graphic. What do you do when one character is 16 and one character is 18? Where do you draw the line? And, keep in mind just about everyone will have an idea of where the line should be drawn and it's not easy to reach a consensus on what constitutes written child pornography. What about the book Lolita? What about books that have underage sex in them? What about the movie Cuties that everyone was upset over a while ago. This problem isn't unique to fanfiction.

AO3 advocates for free speech. As long as fics are rated and tagged with the appropriate warnings (or choose not to warn) then people can choose to avoid what they don't want to see. If you want restrictions on what you're allowed to post and see, go to ffn.
