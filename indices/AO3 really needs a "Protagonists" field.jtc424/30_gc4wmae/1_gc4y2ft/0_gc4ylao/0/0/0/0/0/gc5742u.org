No, bcs when you start banning a specific fic bcs it contains illegal material(underage sex), the same reason can also be applied to ban fics containing explicit stuff like torture/rape etc bcs they are also considered illegal .

You are really fighting a losing battle in this. Mind you I'm speaking from experience bcs I tried to argue w an author who write underage fics and they argue their case really well, citing laws and all.
