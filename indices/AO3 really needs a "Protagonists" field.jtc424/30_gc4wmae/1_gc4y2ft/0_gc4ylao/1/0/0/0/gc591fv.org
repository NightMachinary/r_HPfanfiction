Yeah. I find it good because sometimes you're about to click on something you don't actually want to read, like some weird sort of self sabotage or something; and also some fics are tagged with non con and are still very readable, the dead dove tag is like as sign that says â€˜my other tags weren't joking. Think real hard about clicking on this fic' and more often than not it's prevented me from a bad time---or you do click on it, but you're forewarned about the contents and thus there will be no jarring surprises, which is sometimes the trigger, rather than the content itself
