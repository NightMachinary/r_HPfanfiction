The problem for me is that when I'm searching for rare characters, especially ones who always show up in the background but are hardly ever a main character (like, say, early villains such as Quirrell or, to use a non-HP example, Zaku/Dosu/Kin from Naruto), I get hundreds of results. Out of all of those, maybe 10 (on a good day!) will be what I'm looking for, because people tend to tag the character even if they've only got one line in the whole fic.

It's gotten to the point that I don't even search for rare characters unless I'm also searching for a pairing with them, because I know I won't get any results either way.
