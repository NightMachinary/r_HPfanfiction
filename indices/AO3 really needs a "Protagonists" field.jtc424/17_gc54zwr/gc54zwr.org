What I'd like to see:

- option to declare one single primary pairing.
- option to declare 2 primary characters, delegate all others to background
- automatically coalesce variations of the same tag/relationship into one well understood one. We have variations of "HP/GW", "Harry/Ginny", "Harry Potter/Ginny Weasley", etc. all are the same bloody thing.
- ability to filter out stories with too many tags. Usually they aren't good anyway

real problem though is authors misusing the tagging system. ao3 should try to do better job at explaining how to tag properly.
