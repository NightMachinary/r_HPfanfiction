Yeah, I wouldn't want it anywhere near as restrictive as "Tag? What's a tag?" FF.net, but maybe limit it to 20-25 tags or something. That's a respectable paragraph, but not even close to a tag wall.

I see people tagging /everything/ in their fics, even if it only shows up for one chapter and is never mentioned again, and that's ridiculous. Not only does it clutter up the tags, it often spoils the plot of the fic. If it's a recurring thing, yeah, tag it. Otherwise just put a warning in the author's notes for that chapter if it's important.
