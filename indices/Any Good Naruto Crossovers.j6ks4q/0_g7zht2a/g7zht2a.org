In progress crossover [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12584637/1/A-Ninja-Summoned][/A Ninja Summoned/]]

Harry, through a powerful case of accidental magic fleeing the Dursleys, transports himself to the the elemental nations, and is summoned when his name is placed in the Goblet of Fire. Features Harry in a relationship with a gender-swapped Naruto. It's still being written, but hasn't been updated since January

Mind you, this fanfic features a particular flavor of Manipulative Idiot Dumbledore. He wants to control Harry, and despite him very obviously being much older than he expected(due to a time differential between the two dimensions), he keeps trying to treat Harry like the 14-year-old child he expects to see, rather than the 21+ year old man that he is. In fact, it seems like a LOT of characters act like this.

EDIT

What the hell? Who's downvoting me?
