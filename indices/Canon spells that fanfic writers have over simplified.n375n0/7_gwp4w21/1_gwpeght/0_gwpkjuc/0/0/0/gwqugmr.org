For some reason I always just thought it made more sense for Bill to SK the Burrow and Mr Weasley to SK Shell Cottage, but yeah it's a bit of a plot hole. I always thought the thing with the Fidelus is that it's a very powerful defensive spell, but the weak point is that you have to trust SOMEBODY who isn't hidden under it regularly. Otherwise you'd assume Moody would use it all over his stuff, except that he'd have to trust somebody else to do it.
