  why would the fidelius fall after James and Lily died when the secret keeper was still alive?

I think it has to do with what the secret is about. Is it "James and Lily Potter live at Godric's Hollow" (meaning that, when they die, there's nothing to be kept secret) or is it "The Order of The Phoenix is based in Number 12 Grimmauld Place" (The Order being the secret).

In any case, Sirius wasn't the secret keeper of the Order's headquarters. It was Dumbledore. After his death, each member of the Order (including Snape) became the Secret Keepers.
