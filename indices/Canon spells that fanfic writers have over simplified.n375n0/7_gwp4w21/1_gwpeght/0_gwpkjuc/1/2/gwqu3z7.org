Dumbledore was secret keeper for the order iirc. For the Potters, I think it was something like the secret was that they're living in Godric's Hollow. When they were no longer alive, the secret was no longer functional. If you'll remember the note Harry read to get into Grimmauld, the secret was that the headquarters of the order of the phoenix was there, which hid it. My guess on the Fidelis is that it doesn't just hide a location, but hides a location that fulfills a condition. Just guesswork, mind you.
