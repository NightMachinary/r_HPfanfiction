No specific spells, but magic in general is treated like, as Harry says, memorising a bunch of spells and throwing them at the enemy. I think FF writers downplay the extent of study, practice, and casting difficulty ("swish and flick", "winGARdium levioSA") that spells require. I also think there's not enough shown of successfully-cast but /weak/ spells and spells going wrong.

And that goes triple for /wandless magic/ in HPFF...
