Plot hole patch: there are various kinds of Trace spells, and some are more precise than others, but may require a stronger wizard to cast.

E.g. Trace type 1, all magic in this area (COS) Trace type 2, all magic done by this person (OOTP) Trace type 3, all utterances of this word (DH)

If you think about it, Trace type 3 is so powerful it's clearly an extraordinary feat of magic
