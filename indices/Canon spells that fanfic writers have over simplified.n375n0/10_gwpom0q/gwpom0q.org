The Trace! - it's so nuanced that I don't think I've ever seen a fic portray it perfectly.

The single biggest mistake I see is the idea that it placed on a wand; this is incorrect, it is placed on every magical child through unknown means. It's worth noting that since Hermione says she practiced a few spells before coming to Hogwarts, it's possible that this is the triggering event - this also explains why accidental magic at a young age isn't detected.

The second most common is that people constantly forget that the Trace pings /any/ magic in the nearby vicinity of an underage witch or wizard - this is literally the idea reason Harry got in trouble in the summer before second year, yet people forget it all the time. This also includes magical means of transport - crucially Apparation!

Thirdly, while the Trace is placed on everyone, the Ministry does not follow up on uses of magic in wizarding areas, because obviously, they'd have to be sending out Aurors every ten seconds otherwise. So any underage kid is free to cast spells to their heart's content in Diagon Alley, for example.

Fourthly, when the Trace does trigger, it doesn't tell the Ministry who cast the spell (again, see Dobby incident) or /who's Trace was triggered/ merely where the spell was cast. This means that the Trace cannot be used to track a specific person! So long as you got out of dodge fast enough afterward, you wouldn't get in trouble. Again, Harry was presumed guilty because no other wizards were in the area at the time.

Finally, and by far the most confusing, there are a bunch of examples of the Trace /not/ working when it should, which fall to the author to explain away. Some of these are fairly easy to explain, like why the Trace didn't trigger when Arthur Weasely did magic at Privet Drive - he arranged a floo connection, which meant the Ministry knew he'd be there - but some of them really aren't. For example, the trace should have triggered when Tom Riddle killed his family at the age of sixteen. Probably the simplest is the idea that the Trace hadn't been invented yet, but this seems a little unlikely. You could also say that Tom Riddle found away around it, which would be extremely impressive, but also makes sense considering the Trace should have triggered around Harry in the graveyard, and again didn't.

Phew, that's a lot of info. Sorry for the rant, but I hope it helps!
