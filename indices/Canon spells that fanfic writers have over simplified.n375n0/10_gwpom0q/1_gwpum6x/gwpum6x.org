personally, i've always assumed that trace can identify if there's an adult witch or wizard in the vicinity, so when arthur arrives at privet drive, the presence of his trace interacts with harry's and therefore somehow mutes it, as it may not be harry's magic. same with petigrew being at the cemetery --- it cancel's out the harry's trace somehow.

i've always thought it was odd and kind of interesting, and i don't think that they start handing out warnings and such until the kids do something exceedingly dangerous or have started attending a school. so while they may have pinged child magic, perhaps they just monitor for safety. turning a cat a different color or harry growing his hair back is obviously minor and harmless compared to other potential magics.

personally i've guessed that when they're children, it may come in color codes of some sort, meaning if, for instance, a muggleborn kid turned another child into a rat or something, the ministry can send someone to clean up and maybe even approach the family early.
