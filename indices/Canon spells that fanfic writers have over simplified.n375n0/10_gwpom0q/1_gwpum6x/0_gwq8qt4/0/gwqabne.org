the only part i diverged a lot from possible canon is idea that maybe it somehow monitors in color. it makes sense that the presence of an adult witch or wizard is also catalogued. we already know it monitors the type of spell. it's not a big leap that it can likely monitor if one is present or the danger level of the spell in some way.

i made an educated guess based on canon rather than completely changing and morphing the spell to fit my own parameters. i do think it's an interesting piece of magic that she could have been more thorough about.

also: hermione “gets away with magic” for a year beforehand, because it isn't until they're at hogwarts that they are told they shouldn't be using magic outside of it. that's the whole reason they go --- to learn to hone their magic and control outbursts edit to add: & to be productive members of wizarding society. they have NO way to even start controlling it beforehand, so it would be ridiculous for the ministry to threaten someone with no way to even start learning. i'm not sure why you'd even attempt to make that argument. it's silly.

maybe it is a measure that helps find muggleborns but who knows? it was never explained.

i do so hate when i see people take a spell and totally change it up.

that said, i do shrug it off as i read and say “oh, well. it's a fanfic. they can do what they want.”
