An educated guess based on canon is literally what fanfiction IS.

And they actually DO have a way to start controlling magic before going to Hogwarts. It's literally canon that Hermione started controlling her magic before going to Hogwarts. How? By getting a wand and reading spellbooks. Hogwarts isn't even necessary per se, any more than math class is necessary. Kids with enough motivation can learn without teachers lurking over their shoulders.

So basically all that telling kids they shouldn't use magic outside Hogwarts buys anyone is control. And it's only your interpretation that they're told that at Hogwarts. For all we know it's in the introductory literature for every Muggleborn, and Harry didn't get it because he got the Pure/Halfblood letter that assumed knowledge of owls for responses, rules about magic, and so on. Don't pretend that your interpretation of canon is the only viable one unless you can prove with text references that there's no alternative.
