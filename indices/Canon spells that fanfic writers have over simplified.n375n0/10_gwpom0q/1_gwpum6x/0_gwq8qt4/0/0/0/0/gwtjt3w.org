  if you think that hermione granger would knowingly disobey a rule

When did I say that? I suppose I implied it with the "rules in the intro literature" bit... If anything, that PROVES my points that: a) the Trace probably doesn't apply before school (though that's debatable given the detection of accidental magic), and b) school is not all that necessary. The very fact that she of all people started learning magic ON HER OWN, just with wand and books, proves at least point (a), and possibly (b). And application of the Trace to STOP kids from learning anything further on their own is purely a method of control, nothing to do with safety. (As a side issue, Hermione Granger set a teacher on fire within her first three months of school. I'm absolutely positive that there's a rule against using magic against teachers, but she did it anyway. She likes making OTHERS obey rules, but for her they're optional.)

As for the rest, canon is what's in the books. Nothing more, nothing less. You can extrapolate on canon, but the result is no longer canon even if it doesn't directly contradict canon. You can change canon, but doing so willy-nilly tends to result in shitty fics.

The best fics have one point of divergence (e.g. Harry was born female, or Harry time-traveled back to the Ministry battle, or Petunia got in a car crash and left Harry with Vernon alone), and the rest is butterflies from that, or are unapologetically and wildly AU. The worst have one point of divergence, most things are butterflies from that, but then there are also random changes here and there that make no sense based on the premise of the story and are explained away with "Well, it's fanfiction." Yes, but even fanfiction needs to explain things that are different from canon, just as canon needs to explain things that are different from reality. WHY are they different from canon?

If the point of divergence is "Harry is bitten by Remus in the woods, becoming a werewolf", how does that change also somehow turn Dean Thomas into a girl? Was she a girl through the past four years? Did that mean there's another, different boy in Griffindor? How does that change the dynamic in Harry's dorm and Griffindor at large? Why is Deana not friends with Hermione? Etc. Introducing random changes in addition to the main point of divergence almost always creates more questions than answers, and results in a sloppy fic.

And yes, I know this is only peripherally related to what you discussed, as your points were peripherally related to the OP... but it's pet peeve of mine and I got off on a rant. :) Happens.
