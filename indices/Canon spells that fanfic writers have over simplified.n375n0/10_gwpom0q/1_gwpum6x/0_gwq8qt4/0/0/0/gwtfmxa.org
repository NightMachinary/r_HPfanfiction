before i get into this, i do want to say that /if you think that hermione granger would knowingly disobey a rule before she even got to hogwarts and risk her magical education just to make your point,/ you're crazy. that's rather ridiculous to assume. i can think of nothing less... /canon-compliant./

----

i think i'm beginning to see the disconnect.

/for me,/ i don't look at everything not strictly said in the books as non-canon. i look at it like, "oh, well, maybe it'll turn out they're right and it'll be canon rather than canon-compliant." & this has happened in a couple of fics, which i thought was rather impressive. we have brains, and we can make correct inferences about the wizarding world.

re: An educated guess based on canon is literally what fanfiction IS.

hm. but is it? i thought fanfiction was where you took the time to /intentionally/ deviate from what what was in the books for whatever reason to give another storyline --- like everything from changing up pairings to genders to giving harry a twin, etc. that's the difference to me. canon vs canon-compliant vs fanfiction.

i typically don't read strictly canon stories, so maybe this is why i don't see a difference between strictly canon, meaning you canNOT say that even though the trace can differentiate what spell is being cast and alerts the ministry what happened, that because they didn't dispatch obliviators for harry's hover charm, they won't dispatch for other more dangerous charms.

if you're basing your information from what was in the books but giving new scenarios and environments, etc., to give them different experiences and, in turn, change the entire storyline into something else, but you're keeping the rules of the world the same, i folder that (in my brain) as "possibly canon," until i receive more information that points to otherwise.

but maybe that makes me a nerd, hahaha, because too many diviations from canon or canon-compliant world rules (like turning the trace into something that goes onto wands or changing the muffliato to be a silencing charm that everyone and their mother knows) does start to add up for me and turn it from being canon-compliant to... just a pure work of fiction loosely based on the hp series.

sorry, i'm probably bothering you at this point, but i haven't really talked to anyone about fanfiction and what is and isn't canon before, so really, it's interesting to learn about your (and others) perspective.
