The Trace is not just a plot hole, it's a plot wormhole. JKR absolutely did NOT think through what she was writing at that point. It's a COUNTRY-WIDE spell or spell-matrix that only works when she wants it to. Why does it NOT pick up accidental magic? Or does it? Is that how Muggleborn are found in the first place? Are Obliviators sent out as a matter of course? If so, why does anyone remember Harry's accidental magic? And why DOES Hermione get away with casting whatever she wanted for the YEAR she knew about magic, yet students aren't allowed to cast anything starting the moment they get on the train home?

Since JKR used the Trace (or didn't) as and how she felt like, so can fanfic authors.
