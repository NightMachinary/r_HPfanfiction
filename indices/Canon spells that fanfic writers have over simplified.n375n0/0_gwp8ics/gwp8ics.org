Or Muffliato. If I remember canon right, it prevents people around you from understanding your conversation because it sounds like buzzing/white noise. But I've seen a lot of fics that make it so that no noise can be heard or where of you cast it on someone, they can't hear anything around them (usually like for sleeping people)
