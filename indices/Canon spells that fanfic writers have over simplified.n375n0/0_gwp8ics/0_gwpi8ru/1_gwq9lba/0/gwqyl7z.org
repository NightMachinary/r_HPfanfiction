I'd say that there are other privacy spells, but because they're commonly known, they can easily be cancelled. Whereas I see muffliato as a)harder to sneakily cancel because it has a specific finite(unsure if that's canon), like Levicorpus did, and b)subtle enough that unless someone was right beside you, they'd not realize there even was a charm - they'd just think it was a bout of tinnitus or crackly ears or just that they were talking really really inaudibly.
