Yeah. The whole "unreliable narrator" trope. I've seen it used in Worm fandom far, FAR too frequently to explain/handwave away any of the ridiculous or confusing elements of the setting. I don't really like it, but it IS true that a third-person limited perspective is bound to miss or misunderstand things beyond their experience.

If JKR were a better writer she could've used that as a means to explore Harry's growth as a wizard, where in early books he misunderstood stuff a lot and only later, as he learned more, did he re-examine some of his assumptions from his first few years and realize that he'd been wrong. But if JKR were a better writer, there wouldn't be so many plot holes to fill, and the fanfic community wouldn't have such a field day with her work.
