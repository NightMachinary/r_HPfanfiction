I feel like a lot of magic comes down to how much research you put into it. Someone who isn't motivated is just going to do what they need to get their OWLs and NEWTs and maybe some specialized stuff for their job. More motivated folks (dark or light) are more likely to dig into the old books and find “new” things. About the only time that I can think of us seeing Harry do this is in HBP, but that was really just looking at Snape's notes in his textbook as opposed to looking something up in the library.
