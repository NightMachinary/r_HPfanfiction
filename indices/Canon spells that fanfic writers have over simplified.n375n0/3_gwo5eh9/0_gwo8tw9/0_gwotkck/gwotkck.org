The issue is, "banish" is the opposite of "summon" and "conjure" in D&D and many other magical settings. "Summon" and "Conjure" both mean to call something from <other>, such as 'conjure spirits'. Conjure also comes from con- (together) jurare (to swear, or make an oath)

You can Banish (remove from the current world, send back to hell) a Demon, but that doesn't just fling them down the road, which is all the Banishing charm does.
