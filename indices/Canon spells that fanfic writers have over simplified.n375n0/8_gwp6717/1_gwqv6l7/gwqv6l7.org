It is indeed fanon, and the way it's portrayed even then is wildly varied, but usually ridiculously overpowered. It's effectively the set of spells Hermione casts in Deathly Hallows around their camp site, but as one spell if you want to think of it that way. Realistically it would be immensely complex, and probably not many could use it. If you do want to use it, there's maybe two ways I'd recommend to portray it: similar to the effect a false hydra casts on a town it's in, or that it makes things harder to notice in a group of things but wouldn't be very effective in an empty room (alternately it's noticed but deemed unimportant and ignored. You might realize after the fact of questioned, but at the time would disregard it).
