In Deathly Hallows Harry says that the his cloak being invisibility cloak of legend makes sense because Dumbledore could cast a Disillusionment Charm strong enough that he wouldn't need to borrow it from James for any other reason. Of course to be fair this is Harry's opinion, not necessarily fact, but I'd guess based on that and the fact that he made himself completely invisible in book 1 without a cloak that he's at least pretty darn close.
