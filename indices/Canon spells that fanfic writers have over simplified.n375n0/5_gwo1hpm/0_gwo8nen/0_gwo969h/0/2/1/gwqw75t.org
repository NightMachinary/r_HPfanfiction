My best guess about this is that people speculate just 'how' does stupefy make people lose consciousness. For example, if it's a spell targeting the mind, causing it to shut down, then a person skilled in occlumency or with strong mental fortitude could resist the spell. If, on the other hand, stupefy affects the body, similarly how a strong hit to the back of the neck or the head in general, then this would indeed not make sense.

To me personally, both options make sense so I just adjust my mindset about it as I read.
