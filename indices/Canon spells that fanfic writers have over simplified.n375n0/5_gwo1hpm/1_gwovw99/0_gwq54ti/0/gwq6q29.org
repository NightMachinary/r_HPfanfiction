  honestly, I can see the movies being the reason for this belief.

I was talking about the movie only, in the books they actually stayed true to the spells and wrote how spells made people laugh controlled or made the dance without reason.

Honestly, the movies was just stupidly inconsistent with the spell-work and how it looked/behaved.

movie 1: we barely see any spell-work and it is mostly invisible.

movie 2: loud flashes and streaks of light, that just blasts people back, no matter what spell you use.

movie 3: invisible again, while adding a loud whistling noise whenever used.
