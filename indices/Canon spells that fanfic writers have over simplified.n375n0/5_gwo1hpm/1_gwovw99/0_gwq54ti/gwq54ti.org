Again, was that in the book, or just the movie?

I think the movies turned all magic into "pew pew, lazergunz!" and it weakened the feel of MAGIC. Sure, stunners and killing curses canonically were red and green beams of light, but not EVERYTHING has to be a beam of light. What about area effects? What about invisible effects? What about effects that happen at the target directly, with no beam to intercept or dodge? What about transfigurations? There are so many things that aren't, and shouldn't be colored lasers, but that's what we got in the movies.
