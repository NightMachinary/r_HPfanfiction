There's no reason to think that any random solid object can't block AK. If I have a brick wall in front of me, why wouldn't that block the AK coming at me? If I have a solid wooden table in front of me, why wouldn't the table block it? Maybe the AK would destroy the table, but to say that only pure gold can block AK seems oddly specific.
