Sure, but that doesn't mean solid objects /can't/ block AK, it just means that in that fight, Fawkes was the only thing that attempted to block an AK. If Dumbledore ducked behind a huge piece of concrete to avoid being hit by an AK, and the AK hits that concrete, what reason do we have to believe that the concrete wouldn't block the AK?
