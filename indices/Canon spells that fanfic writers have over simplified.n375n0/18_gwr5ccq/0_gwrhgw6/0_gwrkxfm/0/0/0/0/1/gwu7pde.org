Whenever people describe AK as being unblockable, I always took that as it's unblockable by magical shields ala Protego; i.e. if you try to block AK with Protego, the AK will just go through Protego as if it isn't even there.

I wouldn't call putting a solid object between you and an enemy wizard "simple" if you are in the middle of a duel with them, especially considering that spells generally move pretty fast; some spells even have instantaneous results that are not dependent on distance.

The thing about inanimate objects not blocking spells is a rabbit hole though, and when you think about it it doesn't make sense for inanimate objects to have no effect on spells. If I shoot a spell off in Hogwarts and I miss my target, is that spell going to just pass through every wall it hits until the spell is outside, and then it just keeps going forever until it hits flesh? Or does it make more sense that inanimate objects typically block spells, and there is simply some other reason that clothing is specifically exempt from this?

The only AKs that we know of that fail to kill something are the two examples you mentioned, along with Harry getting "killed" in the Forbidden Forest. That being said, we don't have any examples of an AK succeeding to literally pass through solid matter to hit a target behind said matter. As I mentioned in my previous point, it just doesn't make sense for inanimate objects to have /no/ effect on spells.

If I am in one room and I cast Lumos, does the light from Lumos also illuminate the room next to me as if the wall is not there? Or does the presence of the wall affect how the light behaves?

If spells can pass through solid matter, where is the cutoff point? Is a spell able to pass through one wall but not two? Can a spell pass through 10 walls but not 11? Can a spell pass through a literally infinite amount of walls without even slowing down, until it hits a flesh-and-blood target? If this is the case, why can't Voldemort just sit in Malfoy Manor all day and just constantly be shooting off spells in every direction under the guise of "well, they're going to hit a target eventually. I'll just blanket the UK in my hostile magic because the only thing affected by them is their target. I can snipe people from miles away."

If that sounds ridiculous, it's because it is. It makes /far/ more sense, logically, for spells to be affected by inanimate matter and clothes just happen to be exempt from this for any number of reasons.
