The major reason why is because I think we should operate with the assumption that the characters of Harry Potter aren't dumb, and they do know the rules of their world. The AK is ubiquitously presented as unblockable- if it was as easy as putting a solid object between you and the spell, that would be taught and be standard practice, since that isn't particularly hard for a wizard to do. The only things it's ever shown to be blockable by are things that can't be engineered by most people.

The second thing is that inanimate objects frequently don't block spells. Wizards are never presented as having to aim for exposed skin- if inanimate objects block spells, why doesn't clothing?

Finally, except for the two brother-wand interactions between Harry and Voldemort, the only AKs we know of that fail to kill something are 1) the one Fawkes blocks (which does kill Fawkes, but as a phoenix he gets better) and 2) the one that is described by Hagrid as having blown up the Potter's house.
