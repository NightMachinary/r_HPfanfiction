Occlumency. Technically, it's not a spell, but it's close enough.

We don't get to see what successful Occlumency training looks like from the point of view of the trainee, but what little we see seems to indicate that it's not something that one can learn just by sitting around and meditating, or on one's own, or without at least some trauma and suffering.

It certainly doesn't involve "mental shields" or "mindscapes", and it's probably not a one-and-done box that a character ticks on their way to power. It may, however, involve long-term trauma and personality changes. (That none of the Occlumenses we know are exemplars of mental health is telling.)
