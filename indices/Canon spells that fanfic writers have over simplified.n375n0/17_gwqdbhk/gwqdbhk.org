The first thing that sprung to my mind was the ease in which some characters in fics, especially pre-Hogwarts children, learn Occulemency. Sometimes its treated as the intense mental training needed to fortify your mind, other times it's like a lonesome brain workout for a few years (without any specific training, guidance, or (too much) research, mind you) before Hogwarts starts, and then suddenly the main character can coast on by without worrying about Snip Snap and Dumblydoo using legilimency on them at every corner.
