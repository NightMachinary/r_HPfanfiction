Transfiguration. In fanon, characters do freeform transifguration all the time in combat or just day-to-day life. In canon they spend seven years learning a list of spells that all turn one specific object into another specific object with presumable a unique wand movement and incantation each time. Even if you say that they learn an example spell from a catagory, and once you master one you can self teach similar spells quite easily, you would have to be very lucky to know the exact spell to turn something lying around you into whatever you want to use.
