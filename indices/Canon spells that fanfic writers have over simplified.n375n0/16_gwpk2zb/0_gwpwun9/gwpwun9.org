  In canon they spend seven years learning a list of spells that all turn one specific object into another specific object with presumable a unique wand movement and incantation each time.

They do nothing of the sort in canon. They specifically turn one thing into another, but nothing in canon suggests that they're all different spells. Or that there are any specific transfiguration spells at all.
