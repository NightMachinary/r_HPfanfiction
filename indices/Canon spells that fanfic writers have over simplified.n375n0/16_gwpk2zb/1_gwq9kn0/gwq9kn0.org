If you could only transfigure a specific object into a specific object then it makes the whole thing pretty useless, especially with some of the things we see them practicing. like when in the world do you need to turn your pet into a cup? it makes more sense that they would be taught hard things (like living to inanimate or hard to soft) and then be able to use that for anything later in life
