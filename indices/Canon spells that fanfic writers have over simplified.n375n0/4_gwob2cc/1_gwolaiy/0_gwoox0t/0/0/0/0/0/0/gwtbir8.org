A fic where he /fails/ to cast the Patronus - time paradoxes happen, could be used for time travel, loops, or maybe some weird divergence, or he becomes stuck between being dead and alive (but not as a ghost, he exists but cannot interact with anyone, or "exists" 30 minutes ago, like irl lag).

Or an idea stolen from Strugatsky brothers' "Monday Begins on Saturday" - there's a character who is split in two, and lives both forwards and backwards in time, so one copy lives forward like usual, and another has days arranged in reverse.
