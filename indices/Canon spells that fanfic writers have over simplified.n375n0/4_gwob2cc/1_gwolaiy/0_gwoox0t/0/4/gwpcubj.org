I also feel that very few people know it because they never bother to learn. As far as we know there are no wild demetors, at least in Britain as far as we see, then the only time you could encounter one would be in Azkaban. Only when Voldemort started using them did it become a useful spell. Even then, I suspect most witches and wizards didn't know the spell existed, the ministry probably didn't shout out too the world the method to counter their prison guards. Probably only people working for the Ministry or in the Order actually knew someone who could teach it to them.
