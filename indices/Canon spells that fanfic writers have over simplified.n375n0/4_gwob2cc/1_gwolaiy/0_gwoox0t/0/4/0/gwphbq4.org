Yeah, and in a world where "most" adult witches and wizards can't even cast a competent shield spell, which they all learn in tenth grade or so... There's a reason that the "lazy/stupid wizards" trope exists. Rowling did everything she could to make 95% of the Wizarding populace worthless losers. Without exaggeration or flanderizing of any kind, it's easy to make the case that muggles are just smarter or more capable than wizards, and I hate it. I wish it weren't canon, but she tried to be funny and now it's sorta sad.
