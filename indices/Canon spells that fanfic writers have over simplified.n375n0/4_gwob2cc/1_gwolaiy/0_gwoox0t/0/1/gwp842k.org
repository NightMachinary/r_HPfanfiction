I think it would even be easier for Harry's generation as they are young.

Powerful Happy memories are hard to come by. Especially one that isn't linked in some way or another to something hurtful or even tragic.

I had to find a untained memory, full of peace and happiness for therapy. Not necessarily powerful, but just no negative attached to the memory. And seriously it had been hard. Because this memory involved that person that died, this one that places that something else bad happened, and this and that. And it's hard to only think of that one moment and to not have your mind goes to the next one, or what you want to think of.

And The older wizards went through a war. The birth of their child might still be their happiest most powerful memory. But how you do not think about their death?

Sure, I go to the worst-case scenario, but I think the more experience you get, the hardest it is to find a memory absolutely free of all negative.
