  I had to find a untained memory, full of peace and happiness for therapy. Not necessarily powerful, but just no negative attached to the memory

Maybe it takes a certain psychological aptitude or a certain kind of personality, like Draco is good at occlumency because he's good at compartmentalizing while Harry isn't good at either of it.

For example, I've had a pretty rough life but I can think of at least five untainted happy memories just off the top of my head. And it's pretty easy for me to see each memory as detached from what happened previously or next.

And Harry survived a very rough childhood with little psychological damage, so maybe it's a personality trait of his like it is for me, and like compartmentalizing his mental experience is for Draco.
