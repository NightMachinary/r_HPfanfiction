I could be in the realm of possibilities if Harry only knew the Summoning Spell, but in these fics, the demonstration is more used as a standard of Harry talent than anything else. Unsorted Harry already know the Summoning Spell, but every spell under this one (as if Harry could probably follow a 5th Year Class at 11). Canon Harry may have learnt the Patronus in PoA but he can't do Human Transfiguration, or Silent Casting, he is still a normal 3rd Year outside of knowing a cool spell.

I'm also not convinced that the Patronus is really that hard. Sure Canon say that it's a very difficult spell (Lupin tell him that, the Wizengamot is impressed that he could do the spell), but at the same times, most of the DA learnt how to use the spell in a matter of weeks (even faster than Harry did). So if the Patronus a really difficult spell, or is it just an obscure one that seem difficult because it is only usefull for 3 or 4 profession?

Then again, "Telling rather than Showing" is a pretty common thing with Rowling.
