I agree, though I can definitely see people finding it odd that so mundane a utility--Summoning an object you can't reach--is considered a fourth-year level spell.

That said, Harry had to summon his Firebolt from a quarter-mile away (if not further), so it's clearly not on par with /Wingardium Leviosa./
