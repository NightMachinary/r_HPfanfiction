The Summoning Charm. Fanon didn't change the effects of the spell much (though I'm still not convinced it could be used to attract something alive), but a lot of fics made the spell of lot easier to use.

Canon Harry strugled to learn the spell while in 4th year, while it's pretty common for the magically raised Harry to use this spell the first time he is on the Hogwarts Express (usually to find Trevor and show to Hermione how good he is at magic ).

I get it that a magically raised or more talented Harry should be better with Magic, but there should probably be a limit.
