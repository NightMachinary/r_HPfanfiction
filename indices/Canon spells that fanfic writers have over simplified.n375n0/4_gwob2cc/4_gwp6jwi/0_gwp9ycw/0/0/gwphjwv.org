There was a fic (can't remember which one, sorry) in which it was revealed that /Harry/ had blocked himself on the Summoning Charm. Sirius and/or Remus couldn't understand why he was struggling with it because he was calling things across the room to him all the time as a baby. But when he did it at the Dursleys, their reactions caused him to repress himself to the point of almost being unable to perform it now.

IIRC, something happened that caused him to use it just before the Task and he felt a snap or release inside him. He ignored it in favor of dealing with whatever the current situation was and then forgot until it came up in discussion afterwards.
