That Harry didn't start practising the spell until the night before strikes me as a very tenuous interpretation of the text.

Everything seems to indicate that the Summoning Charm has heavy theoretical prerequisites. In Chapter 15 (i.e., before the delegations arrive), we get

  Professor Flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on Summoning Charms.

After that, your own quote indicates that Harry performed badly at Summoning Charm in Flitwick's class---but that would require him to have attempted it in the first place. He also develops a mental block---and that, again, requires him to have kept trying.

Hermione has him read a lot of theory (presumably in addition to that assigned by Flitwick), and then, the night before the First Task, he finally gets it.

This reads to me like a culmination of a lot of effort and practice. And, the theoretical prerequisites (which may have prerequisites of their own) would make learning it at an earlier age more difficult.

Interestingly, this seems like a very different learning process from the Patronus Charm, where, IIRC, it was mainly about the wand motion and the right emotion---and so more suitable for learning at a younger age.
