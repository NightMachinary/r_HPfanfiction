This. I just mentioned Harry being bad at occlumency in a previous comment so it's a salient argument for me ATM I guess, but Harry is really bad at concentrating on what he needs to do when he has other things on his mind or is going through intense emotions. You see it all over the books. If he hates the professor, he does badly. If he thinks it's useless, he does badly. If he has other things he's concerned about, he does badly. It's a motivation thing, not a spell difficulty thing.
