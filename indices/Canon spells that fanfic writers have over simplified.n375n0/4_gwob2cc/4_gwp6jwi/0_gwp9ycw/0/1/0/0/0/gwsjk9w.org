ADHD is at its core a disorder in being able to regulate oneself. Emotional disregulation is a huge part of that, but historically it's been an unappreciated part of the disorder, because scientists just couldn't find a clinically objective way to measure subjects' emotions. I went undiagnosed until I was 25 and now I'm learning new things about it all the time that explain my entire childhood lol.

Of course we don't have enough information to actually diagnose Harry, I just made my comment because I identified strongly with your first comment and it got me thinking about other ADHD-like qualities I can pick out in him.
