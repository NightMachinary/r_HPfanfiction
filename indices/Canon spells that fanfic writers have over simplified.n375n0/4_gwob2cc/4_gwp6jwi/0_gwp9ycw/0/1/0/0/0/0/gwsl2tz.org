You're right, but ADHD has a neurological base and other types of emotional disregulation don't necessarily.

Obviously we can't say anything decisive about a fictional character, and if you find something that reflects your own experience that's awesome

I made my comment because things have changed since we were kids and overdiagnosis of ADHD is a problem now, whereas when I was young people were just beginning to gain awareness of it (I am 26).

(Also, who tf is downvoting you, you didn't say anything wrong)
