Idk, telekinesis seems to be like one of the very first things someone consciously trying to master Magic would start with.

Though, I'm not sure they would manage to summon any random animal without having a direct line of sight on it.

As an aside, imagine if Harry does indeed manage the spell, but he doesn't account for all the obstacles along the way and Trevor flies in his hand... well... in several pieces, to put it gently.
