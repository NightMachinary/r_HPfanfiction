Canon Harry learned the spell in under a day, on November 23rd. He sees the dragons at night on November 21, gets advice from fake-Moody on the 22nd or 23rd, and practices Summoning with Hermione (before it's taught in class) on the 23rd. He masters it in that one day to the point that he can Summon his broom from something like half a mile away in the middle of a stressful situation. It's NOT that hard to learn. Harry's not the most studious fellow, and this isn't a defense-oriented spell where he tends to shine.

That said, I've seen fanfics where Harry can Summon Tom Riddle's heart from across the country and it works just because nobody thought to defend against it. Yeah, right.
