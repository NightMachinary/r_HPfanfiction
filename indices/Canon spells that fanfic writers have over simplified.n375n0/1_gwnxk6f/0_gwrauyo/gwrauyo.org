Ever since I got a smart-assed review asking if I'd 'forgotten about the Point Me spell' because 'it would drastically shorten this story' this has been a personal bugbear of mine.

Well, considering the person they're looking for is not being held at the north pole, I don't think it would shorten it all that much, funnily enough. If you're going to be a smart-alecky stickler for canon, then at least be /right/ about the canon you're preaching.

And lets not mention the fact that, if we're getting into canon-stickler territory, 'Point Me Horcrux' kinda buggers most of the plot of Deathly Hallows too, don't you think? I wonder how it took Dumbledore so very long to find the locations of those Horcruxes when all he needed was a simple spell!
