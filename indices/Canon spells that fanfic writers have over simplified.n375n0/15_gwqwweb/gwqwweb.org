There are so many spells that are used by characters who are way too young to be able to cast them. Like ‘accio' on Harry's first train ride to Hogwarts, or ‘aguamenti' when a character is thirsty in third year. There's also spells that very few characters should know, yet so many use ‘muffialto' or patronus messengers. Then there are spells that just completely change use to become more powerful. ‘Episkey' goes from healing very minor injuries healing gushing wounds. ‘Confundo' basically becomes a legal imperius curse instead of just making the target confused.
