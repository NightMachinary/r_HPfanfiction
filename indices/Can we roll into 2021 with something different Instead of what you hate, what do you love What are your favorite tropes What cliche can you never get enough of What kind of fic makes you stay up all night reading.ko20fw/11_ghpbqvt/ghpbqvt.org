After the year 2020 was, what I really want from 2021 is some "everybody lives" fics where sensible decisions get made in Harry's life by supportive grownups, and it leads to everyone developing much better plans, and not racing off to make silly mistakes and die.

I want some fluff, I want some happy-ever-afters.

I want more golden trio poly triads.

I want exploration of wizarding culture that isn't superficial or imitation of Victorian Muggle upper classes, and exploration of their history and relationship towards things that are effectively meaningless in the magical world, like race, sex, gender, orientation, and how that impacts their views on Muggles (in such a way that it doesn't become pureblood apologism, nor Mugglewank).

But mostly, the triad thing.
