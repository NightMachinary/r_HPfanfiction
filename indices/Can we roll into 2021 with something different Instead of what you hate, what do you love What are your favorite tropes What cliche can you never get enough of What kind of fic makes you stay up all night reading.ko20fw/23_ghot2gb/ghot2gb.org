Drarry. I will never not love good Drarry.

Fics that explore deeper into the politics of the Wizard World, or that uncover the true nature of magic, or show us things Rowling never conceived of.

Dark is not evil and Good vs Good conflicts.

Morally-grey Dumbledore who never really let go of the whole Greater Good bit.
