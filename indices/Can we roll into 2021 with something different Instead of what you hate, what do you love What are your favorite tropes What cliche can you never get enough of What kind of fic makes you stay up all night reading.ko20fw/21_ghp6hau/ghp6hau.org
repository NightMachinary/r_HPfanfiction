I know it's very specific but I love stories where the protagonist's parents are in Azkaban. So far, the only good fics I've found with this trope are linkffn(The odds were never in my favour) where James is in Azkaban and linkffn(Certain dark things) which has Sirius in Azkaban and his daughter being best friends with fem-Harry.
