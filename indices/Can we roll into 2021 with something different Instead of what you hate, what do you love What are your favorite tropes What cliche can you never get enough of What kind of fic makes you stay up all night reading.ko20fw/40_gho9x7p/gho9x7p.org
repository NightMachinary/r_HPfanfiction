I like reading about the perspective of other characters and other timelines, while sticking primarily with the canon. I like reading about various forms of magic. I like to read about gradual transitions either from good to evil or evil to good. I am not a big romance fan but I like to read fics about dysfunctional relationships, particularly where one of them is emotionally abusive towards the other.
