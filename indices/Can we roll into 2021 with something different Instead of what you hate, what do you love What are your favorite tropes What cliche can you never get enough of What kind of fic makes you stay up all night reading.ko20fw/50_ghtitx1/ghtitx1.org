Fix-its, fluff and comedy.

Really well-written AUs, where rules are changed or explored in a depth that just doesn't exist in the original novels. Where magic is interesting and new. Or where canon is just.. tossed out. Totally rearranged.

I really get tired of rehashed canon plotlines. Having characters just go totally off-script is more appealing. None of this stone in first year, basilisk in second, sirius in third, and so on madness for the umpteenth time. Unless it's all done /really/ differently.

In general: Difference.

OCs and self-inserts can be nice. Prefer them not taking over the body of an existing character. Something about that kind of transmigration has always rubbed me the wrong way - makes them an.. imposter. Changeling. I know I'm overthinking that and I /do/ enjoy those stories in this fandom and beyond. But, "prefer".
