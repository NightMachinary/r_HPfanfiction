Oh, hell yes. Especially your second paragraph. Well written foreshadowing is practically a kink of mine, whether it's a full-blown plot point or merely symbolic.

Although I do still like a bit of romance sprinkled in... just not as the main driver of the story. Romance as the B or C plot? I'm in.
