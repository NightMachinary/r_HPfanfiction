I love drama. Plot. Intrigue. Hurt/comfort stuff. I love watching characters get betrayed or captured and have to think they're way out of it. I love watching them beat the odds, hitting their rock bottom with no hope of winning then finding a solution through all odds.

I love skillful planning. Cunning foreshadowing. Characters you can't trust. People playing both sides. I love the mystery and excitement of not knowing where a story is going to end.

No romance. No smut or sappy love shit. Just the drama!
