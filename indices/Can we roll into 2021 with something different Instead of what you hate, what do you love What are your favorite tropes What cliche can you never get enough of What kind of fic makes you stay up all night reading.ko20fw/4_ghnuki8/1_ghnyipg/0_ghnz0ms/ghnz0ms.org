I'll swap two? linkao3(The Practical Applications of Arithmancy by JanuaryGrey) ^ Sirius faces the consiquences of changing his electives. Orion uses some real A+ parenting skills. It's evil and cold but calculated and I completely understand why and I hate it and it's great and you gotta read it!!!! (Oneshot)

linkao3(Of A Linear Circle by Flamethrower) ^ an 11 book monster with so much history and language and secret societies and hidden identities and politics and magical law and masteries and titles and ranks and statues that I have no idea what's happening half the time but holy shit I love it so so so so much!
