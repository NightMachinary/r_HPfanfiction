Update:: I'm done!!! Well that was fun!! I think... I can't tell. I'm so glad the ending was somewhat happy in the mist of also being very sad. Like a hug and a punch in the gut all at once I don't really know what to feel...

Aurore was wonderful. And James. I just want to hug them oh my.

This was perfect. Exactly what I wanted. Something dark and twisted with cruel intentions and characters who I still don't really like even though I'm sure I was supposed to like them... Hermione is so fustrating and Draco is absolutely terrifying and I don't think I like either of them but I adore the story they were in!!! Eugh Lucius and Astoria! And the Flashbacks were painful! When Harry realises he's a Horcrux? That broke me. Especially because I already knew how the war played out. Having to then watch it play out was just heart breaking...

I really liked how it was almost 3 different stories in one? The opening third is delightfully cruel and twisted. The middle is just a slog of death and destruction. I love it but it was just never ending pain... It was a war. Then the last 3rd was slightly better. I'm glad someone got a happy ending out of it all at the very least.

10/10. I'll be rereading this. Thank you so much for the recommendation!
