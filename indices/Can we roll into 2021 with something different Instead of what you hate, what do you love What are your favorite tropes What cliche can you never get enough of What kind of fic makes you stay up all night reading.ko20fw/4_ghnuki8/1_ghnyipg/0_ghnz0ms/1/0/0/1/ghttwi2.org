Another update: chapter 48.

I love how sly and twisted Draco is this is so fun to read! I love these characters!! Eugh he's so smart and cold and cunning and cruel it's delightful to read I can really see it on him! My little black heart is grinning maniacally at all the stuff I really shouldn't be grinning so happily at ðŸ˜ˆ

I love the mystery! I don't know what his motives are at all? I assume good but I don't know how were going to get there. I adore Hermione's fustrations because of how stupidly idealistic the Order is. It's so dark and hopeless and I'm living for it!

I don't read Dramione at all. I think that's working in my favour here because these characters are so OOC that they are HP characters in name only. I love it. The world is so dark that these characters really fit it they just happen to have the HP history you know? Eugh it's really really good! Really good I'm thoroughly enjoying it ðŸ˜Š
