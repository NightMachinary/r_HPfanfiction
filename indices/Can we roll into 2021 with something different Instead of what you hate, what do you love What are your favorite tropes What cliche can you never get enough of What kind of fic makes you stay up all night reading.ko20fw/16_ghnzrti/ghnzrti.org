- Enemies to lovers
- Time Travel but only if it's done well
- Marriage Law but only it's done well
- Stuck together/forced together in some way (bonus points if they're enemies)
- Finding out they love each other by smelling Amortentia
- Secret relationships
- Fake dating

Also I really dislike OOC characters but sometimes when they're given completely different backgrounds than what was canon and they're OOC, i get really intrigued. For example I was reading a James/Lily fic one time where James and the other Marauders were in Slytherin and on their way to being Death Eaters and Lily was a pure blood but she masqueraded as a muggleborn to spite her pure blood supremacist family. I was immersed in it COMPLETELY I didn't sleep properly for two days just so I can finish it because I liked it so much even though it could have been written better.

Also I just love drama. I love it when you're reading and everything's okay and then a bombshell gets dropped and you get a smile on your face because you know this fucks so much shit up, I live for that stuff!
