I really like reading power (crossover or otherwise, maybe just "Power the Dark Lord Knows Not") fics that stay in the Harry Potter verse, where JUST Harry gets reasonable powerups but it doesn't bleed into the whole verse and give everyone powerups. Like if Harry gets a few extra powerups, and Voldemort loses PIS and actually has a brain, where the "70 year old elite Dark Wizard vs 17 year old" fight is actually made interesting by the crossover power, rather than Voldemort being a moron that only uses three spells unless he's fighting Dumbledore, he's the terrifying Dark Lord, and Harry's Crossover power makes it so Harry can win in a way that isn't "My wand not yours GG"

You can add Drama without powering up the Villain, ESPECIALLY in Harry Potter, just by making them competent with their skillsets. Like where if the power the Dark Lord knows not is being immune to magic, Voldemort doesn't think "MORE AVADAS! THAT'LL WORK!" Like the canon one would, he uses the environment, drops boulders, banishes rocks at Harry, traps him under buildings, that sort of thing. And if that's written well, it's amazing.
