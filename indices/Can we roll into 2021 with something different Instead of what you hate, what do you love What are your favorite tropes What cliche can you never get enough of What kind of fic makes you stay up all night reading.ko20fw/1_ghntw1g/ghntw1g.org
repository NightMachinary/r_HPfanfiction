Fluffy rom-com stories that you can tell have some thought put into them. Well-written stories with the twins.

Feel-good family stories usually involving the Weasleys.

Still not sick of 'swapped bodies' stories although probably haven't read enough of them to be sick of them.

Crack like Seventh horcrux or the one where the author deliberately crammed every HP fanfiction trope into it...forget the name
