I love emotions, thought process. Where there's not really angst but emotional/ physiology word play. Where the author really focus in on how the character feel. Soo hard to find one that doesn't go into crappy angst or cry-cry. Love absolutely love, time travel (done right) adore mixmatch relationship that almost dives into toxicity (guilty pleasure I suppose)
