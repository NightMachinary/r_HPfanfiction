I love Harry adopted into a loving family fics I'll be able to read them forever. I also like fics that focus on magic/spell creation though I don't read those that much. Fics with pranks will always be some favorites of mine. I might be the first to admit but when it's done well I enjoy dumbledore bashing since fics where good guys are bad are something I find interesting.
