Stories where a genuine mystery is built up convincingly and with enough intrigue and surprise to not spoil it until the end. The payoff has to be worth it though! A good example would be linkffn(The Strange Disappearance Of Sally-Anne Perks) - to one of my previous recommendations of this fic, someone described it as a story you can curl up with it and a hot chocolate on a cold night and just enjoy. I think that fits it well.
