Give me enemies to lovers any day! My absolute favorite trope of all time

Love potion mishaps

Time travel that is actually thought out

Development of Draco - there is so much potential there for interesting redemption stories and I love them

Happily ever after endings and romantic fluff

Well written Marauders banter

Well written Weasley twins
