I really like the idea of the Wrong Boy who Lived story, however, I've never found one where Harry is revealed to be the real BWL. They are either unfinished, with the story not having reached the point where Harry is revealed to be the real BWL, or Harry actually isn't the BWL. I just want to read about everyone realising how shitty they've treated their real "saviour" while his twin brother has been spoiled for no reason.
