James Sirius Potter/OFC. Quality probably doesn't matter beyond a certain level. I've read two good ones, the rest are basically just different variations on the theme.

I also like time travel and alternative realities. But, in principle, it probably needs to be Hinny these days. At the start of last year (2020) I was definitely reading fics which didn't feature Harry as the main character but I may have entrenched on that as well. In some ways I hope not because most of the time travel ones I read were using different POVs to Harry.

I also have a soft spot for the Hinny Muggle AU.

Parselmouth!Ginny... at least, in the Hinny context.
