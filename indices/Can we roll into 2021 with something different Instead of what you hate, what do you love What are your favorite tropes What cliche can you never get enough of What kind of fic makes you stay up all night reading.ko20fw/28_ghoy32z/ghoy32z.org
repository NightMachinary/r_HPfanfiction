Some tropes I enjoy:

1. Prodigy!Harry, in the full sense of the word. Not an overnight power boost but a fic which charts the development of a magical prodigy. Think Santi's "Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived".

2. Powerful, elegant, sophisticated fem!Harry. Think Jasmine Potter from "A Long Journey Home".

3. Expanding canonical-tone magic. Most magic-focused fics go full AU and completely rework the magic system, or go the Mugglewank route of seeking to explain magic in physical terms. It's a rare treat to find a fic which expands magic in a way which is sympathetic to the canonical magic system. Think "What You Leave Behind" by Newcomb.

4. Classism/inequality as a theme, explored through the elite end of magical society. Lord and Ladies not necessary (and indeed they are often a hindrance) but I enjoy fancy balls, formal dinners, and bitchy, gossipy afternoon tea. Plus the more practical side: estate management, magical agriculture, expansion of the political system in a way that makes sense given the size of the society, etc. Hard to think of a fic which has fully realised this, but Android Knight's "The Minister" was promising before it was abandoned far too early.

5. Harry learning magical traditions, especially where they involve what might be called "little magic" - small pieces of relatively inconsequential but aesthetically pleasing magic which hint at the fact that wizards' magic goes deeper than wand-waving. Extra points when these traditions are obscure/secret/forbidden in some sense. Prime example of this is Raining Ink's "Out of the Night".

6. Gen fics or fics where Harry has multiple non-serious relationships. If there must be a "pairing", then one of: Harry/Ginny; Harry/Hermione; Harry/Daphne; Harry/Susan; Harry/Fleur; Harry/Parvati; Harry/Lavender; Harry/Pansy; Harry/fem!Harry.
