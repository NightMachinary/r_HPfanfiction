I'm such a huge Dramione fan. I'll read almost anything with draco/hermione. Hurt/comfort dynamic is great, and redeemed!draco is great. Honestly, most pairings of hermione/anyone-not-ron. I just always thought she was too intellectual to be happy with Ron. I could do with less ron-bashing dramione stories. I love ones where Ron is supportive/understanding.

However, you can't really go wrong with time-fravel fics. They're so good! My favorite: The Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie on Archive of Our Own. My eyes were so dry and scratchy from all the non-sleep I did devouring this beauty.

I have read a few really great gray!hermione fics where she embraces dark magic as well as light to help the Light get ahead against voldemort.
