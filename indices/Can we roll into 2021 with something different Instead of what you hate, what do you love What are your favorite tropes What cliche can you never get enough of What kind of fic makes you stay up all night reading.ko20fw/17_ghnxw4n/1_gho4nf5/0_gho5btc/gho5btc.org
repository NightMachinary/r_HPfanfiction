Well, the one I can think of off the top of my head is off the beaten path, but quite enjoyable! Linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist by BrilliantLady). There's another one where Hermione fakes her parents deaths to save them but.... I need some time to poke around and find it lol also, a bit gritty and unfinished but linkao3(When Hermione Fights by Aivy, queenie17).

Edit: lol faking her parents' death is the same story as When Hermione Fights! Hope you enjoy :)
