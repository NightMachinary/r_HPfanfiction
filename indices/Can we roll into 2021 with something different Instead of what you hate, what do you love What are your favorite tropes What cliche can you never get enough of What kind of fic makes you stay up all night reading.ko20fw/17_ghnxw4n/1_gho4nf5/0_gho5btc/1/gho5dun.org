  They say you always have a choice and I had chosen. I would fight! I was ready to face life with all its ups and downs. I would follow the path of a warrior, not popular but necessary, as I had been part of the war for years. Every year without fail Harry, Ron and I would fight for our lives. Was I, Hermione Granger, a good person and would I still be good after everything was done and finished? This is my story beginning at the end of the holidays after Year Four (GoF), and in the end you'll have to decide if my actions and my decisions were the right ones! HG with SB, DM, SS and LM; HP will play a bigger role as the story progresses!

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.
