i love world building and politics done properly and dark gritty wars

also harry fics where he is utterly determined to destroy voldemort at any cost, something like post time skip eren from AOT in the manga where he has no moral stipulations from doing what is necessary to achieve his goal

also for all that i dislike drarry/dramione, if daphne's character was anything similar to draco's character i honestly like it. anything to change from the monotony of ice queen daphne.
