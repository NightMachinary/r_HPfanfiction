I love when the main character slowly gets insane. A story where you can see how the insanity slowly grows... each chapter shows you what creates the insanity, how other people are concerned about the main character or (on the opposite) don't see anything. You can see how the main character tries to fight it (the desire of revenge, of blood on their hands), how they hope that nobody finds out. Or maybe you see them being confused why everyone is asking if they're okay and not realising that they are slowly going insane. Resons (as long as they're good) can be any: abuse, lost to much, tries to find a way to bring back their family or friends, etc.

Plus points if old friends face each other in battlefields
