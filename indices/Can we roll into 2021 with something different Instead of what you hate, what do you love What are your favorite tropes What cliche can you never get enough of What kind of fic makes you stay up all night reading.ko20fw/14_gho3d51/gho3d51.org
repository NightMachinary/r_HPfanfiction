Anything with James and Lily in it that's well written, I just can't get enough of that pairing. And when Lily gets close to the rest of the marauders...

And the best fics of all are change in canon where they live and Voldemort gets defeated some other way (although those are harder to find)

I'm also ok with AUs of them together although they usually don't capture my interest quite like them at Hogwarts
