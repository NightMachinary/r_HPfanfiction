I wish there were more good post-war fics. Of course there's nothing wrong with stories about teenagers - we're all here because of a young adult series, after all - but adult life has a different flavour to it. I'm also a sucker for stories about decent people being decent to each other, without Voldemort looming in the background.

Maybe all I really want is a thousand variations on Grow Young With Me.
