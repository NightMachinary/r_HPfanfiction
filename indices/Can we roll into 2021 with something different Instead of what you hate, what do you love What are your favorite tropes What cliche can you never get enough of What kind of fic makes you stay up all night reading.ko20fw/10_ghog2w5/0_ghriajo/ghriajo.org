Same as you, I love non canon pairings for Harry. Those are the main three for me too. I got into fanfiction cause I wanted to read character interactions. Ship fics are the easiest route for those. No disrespect to the canon ships, but I just am bored by them at this point.

To your second point that's part of why I love the fic Novocain, although I imagine you already know that one.

And to you third point that something I'd like to see more of.
