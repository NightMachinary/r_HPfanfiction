- non-canon pairings, especially for Harry. The great thing about Harry having non-Ginny and Hermione relationships, or even friendships, is that it significantly opens the number of stories that you can explore. I'm a sucker for Daphne Greengrass, but also enjoy Susan Bones and Katie Bell as love interests. Harry is just so damn isolated all the time that you want more positive human interaction for him.
- post-Hogwarts recovery and rebuilding of the wizarding world
- Dumbledore realizing his mistakes with Harry sooner and truly making amends with him
