Fics that focus on character development. Canon and a lot of stories love to run to the destination. I like seeing the journey.

Fics where Ron is given the credit he deserves, whether he's the central character or not. Fics where he steps up are a special favourite.

Fics where Hermione isn't 100% perfect and her actions have real consequences. None of that canon weaksauce shit.

I'm a sucker for a good sci-fi and/or x-over fic.
