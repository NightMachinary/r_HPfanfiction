  Fics that focus on character development. Canon and a lot of stories love to run to the destination. I like seeing the journey.

It's a marauder fic but linkao3(All The Young Dudes by MissKingBean89) has the best character development ive ever read. Follows Remus from 1st year to OoTP but he grew up in a children's home so he's real rough around the edges to start off with. Then a bunch of stuff happens and we see him turn into the quiet guy from the books who just wants to help. It's genuinely brilliant and completely engaging. There's development of the werewolf stories and the history of the order. It really gives a canonical history to the books ðŸ˜Š
