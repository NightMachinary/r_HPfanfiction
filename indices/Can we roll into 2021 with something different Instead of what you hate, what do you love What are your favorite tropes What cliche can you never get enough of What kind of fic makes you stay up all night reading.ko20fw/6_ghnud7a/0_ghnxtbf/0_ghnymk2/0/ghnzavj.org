[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307886/1/Strange-Reflections]] In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

Harry stepped out into the open, breathing in to allow the scent of the forest to calm any nerves he had left. The sky appeared grey in these twilight hours, which he supposed was appropriate for the situation. A dark, but gentle, situation that made Harry feel both serene and frightened at the same time. Nagini was dead, thanks to Neville, and now one curse will win this war.

Harry just needed to die first.

But magic is complicated. Very complicated. So it shouldn't come as a surprise when the killing curse sends him somewhere else.

Somewhere he was dragged from seventeen years ago.
