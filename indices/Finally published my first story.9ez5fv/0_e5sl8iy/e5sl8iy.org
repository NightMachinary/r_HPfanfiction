It's a really nice atmosphere and tone, but you need to work on your dialogue. Particularly grammar. When dialogue tags (") close, they don't end the sentence. You need to use a comma before them if you have something like "said ron" afterwards, or a period if you're moving onto something entirely new. Things like exclamation marks and question marks can be used interchangeably here. Consider getting a beta to give your work a read through.

Also try to resist using dialogue as exposition - 'I'm just so excited to see their new flat!' feels a bit false. Something more natural sounding might be 'I want to see how they're settling in!' Or 'let's see what you've done with the place!' I'm also not sure Hermione is quite this excitable in canon. Your dialogienis nearly there and certainly far better than most fanfic, but it still doesn't quite flow in my opinion.

That said, the rest of your spelling and grammar is fine, and you have a nice balance of dialogue and narrative.
