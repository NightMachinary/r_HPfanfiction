I think the tone is really off for a lot of the characters- they're much more old fashioned in their speech and formal. I find the focus on tradition (the mage things) to be really jarring, considering there's no canon indication that tradition was that highly valued. And they're not really explained- I think it's fine to create your own mythologies for fanfic, I just think it needs to be done better. Like, there's a weight room. Dumbledore apparently completely trusts him to run a class with no kind of supervision. There are just odd things shoehorned into the story. Also, the whole quidditch pitch scene has always sat very oddly with me, as well as the military out of left field.

The thing is, a lot of what I think this story does poorly is done excellently in The Marriage Stone (Harry being so much more powerful, higher in “hierarchy”, traditions, etc) - so it's not necessarily the topic or the angle, but the writing itself. Harry in this story is not the Harry of the books- which again, it can be done well to explain all the personality changes, but I don't think it's done well in this story. I think there's not enough ground work to accept some of the suppositions that are required to really get into the story.
