Hermione looked up at the guillotine blade hanging precariously above her neck.

Apparently no-one told the house elves that the condemned were supposed to be looking /down/, not up.

Her famous last words were both uncharacteristic for her yet very apt for her situation.

"Well, shit."

The blade descended, the world spun, and Hermione's last few moments were of her staring at her own decapitated corpse being hacked into pieces by rabid house elves armed with meat cleavers.

Her last thoughts, however, were of her friends. She hoped Harry was at least happy -- even though he stood against her revolution, she still loved him and couldn't stand the thought of hurting him.

So, the sending him away for his own protection was the logical thing to--

The world went black.

Harry, with a silk collar around his neck, couldn't believe his life had ended up like this.

Hermione, the girl he considered a sister and one of his closest friends, had /sold him/ to the goddamn princess of the veela nation, who happened to be Fleur's second cousin, like cattle! "For [your] own good!"

...And a shit ton of gold to fund her revolution.

His new "owner"... fiance? humming "here comes the bride" still gave him nightmares.
