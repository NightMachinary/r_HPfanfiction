"You could join me Harry, the house elves respect you. You have powerful and resourceful, I need a wizard like you at my right hand. Maybe you want to lead a stealth platoon with Officer Dobby or Commander Winky?"

Honestly it didn't sound all that bad to Harry. He was used to doing chores from his time with the Dursleys and his friends the Weaslys didn't have any house elves, so it is not like they were in danger. Plus without Hermione how was he ever going to get his homework done in time?

...Screw it, might as well, people kept calling assuming he was dark anyway, why not embrace it and support his friend?
