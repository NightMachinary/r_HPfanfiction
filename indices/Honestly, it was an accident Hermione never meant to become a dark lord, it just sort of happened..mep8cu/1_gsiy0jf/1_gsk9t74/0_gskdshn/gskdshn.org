Hermione was the only one who cared in canon, so it's not at all implausible that confronted with the enormity of what was happening, they would instinctively defend the status quo.

That said, I don't think they are seriously defending slavery in this snippet, just reacting in a familiar way (humour) without thinking. I can easily see them sitting down, talking it over with Harry and maybe others, and then joining Hermione.
