"Look Harry," she said with an air of impatience, "All I did was try to find a way to set the house elves free. I never intended for all of..." Hermione gestured weakly to the window and the armies beyond, "/This/."

Harry pulled a face, looking at the couple before him, "You're alright with this then, Ron?"

Shrugging the redhead retreated a bit further behind the dark lord. His hand fumbled a bit with his brand-new wand, his gaze lingering somewhere around Hermione's backside. The witch in question rolled her eyes, sighing dramatically before turning on her heels. Her hand reached out, grabbing Ron in passing as her other hand dug into the pouch of flu powder at her waist.

Her back toward Harry, she spoke softly, "I never intended for this to happen, Harry. You of all people should know that. You of all people should know how many hours I spent at the library, the trials I went through to get here-"

"You mean here as in, at the head of your own private army?" One of the twins sneered, "you're taking away not only our little brother-"

"-Who you're welcome to-"

"-but every house elf in Hogwarts-"

"-Now who's going to make dinner?"

She spun on her heels, spitting out, "Then why don't /you/ do it?! With all your mighty magic you should be /plenty/ capable!"

Fred - or George, who knew, threw her a mischievous grin, "Barf Brownies for dinner? Sounds great!"

Hermione didn't respond, instead looking at Harry with pleading eyes, "You have to believe me, Harry. I just thought they ought to be free. I never imagined so many of them would be this /angry/ -- though I suppose I should have realized. Besides, who knew people were keeping Kobolds? Centaurs? /Trolls?!/"

"All I did was amplify my magic to set them all free at once. I tried to /avoid/ war. But then so many of them wanted vengeance, and they were looking for a leader, and I just..." again she helplessly motioned to the thin glass window, "I couldn't just /leave/ them, now could I?"

Suddenly, Hermione's demeanor changed as she straightened her back and cast her fiery gaze upon those that had once been her friends, "No, I couldn't. And I shouldn't be made to feel guilty about it, either. These creatures were kept in servitude for so many generations that no one can even find a /reference/ to a time when things were different. Well, they're different now. Now it's their time. And I'll see to it that they get what's theirs, even if they have to take it by force-- I will help them take it!" She took a deep breath, turning back to the large chimney, flu powder in hand, "Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a revolution to run. You can come with me and be part of the change, or you can stand against me and face the same fate as the likes of the Malfoys -- their former servants decapitated them. With their bare hands."

The fire glowed bright green for a moment, and Hermione and Ron were gone. Harry looked at his remaining friends, was there any way to stop her?
