Wow I can't believe how unpopular this site is... At least with writers. All it is doing is storing your stories as a backup it is not trying to to take credit for your work... They even give you credit using the same name.

FH is great for readers because of the search function is much better, the UI is way better and this is just the beginning. There are plans to add more items like collections (think of kinda like a Playlist crossed with ffn communities). More details about story information and others.

FFN is all based on older code that has been needing updated for years but when ws the last time they really did any front-end chances? Years because they stopped trying to improve the site and any tech company that refuses to chance stagnants. So yeah they do not ask permission but they will remove content if asked in a timely way and if ffn devs just want to be lazy why not support a site that is only trying to get you writers more readers?
