Fictionhunt is an archival website largely for HP fanfiction taken from Fanfiction.net. Fanfiction.net is where authors originally published their fanfics, and Fictionhunt trawls the website and backs up the stories.

Fictionhunt has a slicker design and apparently prides itself on its search features, but they also basically just "backup" all the stories without permission from the authors or anything.
