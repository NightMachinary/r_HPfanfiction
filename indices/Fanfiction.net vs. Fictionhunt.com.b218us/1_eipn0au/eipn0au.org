On ff.net, authors post their own stories, receive feedback, interact with readers, and have creative control of their own work.

Fictionhunt is an unauthorized aggregator; it scoops archives and basically steals the stories without the authors' consent in order to re-post content. The only control a writer has, if they even know their work has been copied, is to ask that it be removed. FH is reasonably quick to accommodate take-down requests. (Although I just name-searched myself and discovered two of my fics are still there, damn it.)
