Yes. Better question is why would he bother doing that? If he wants to stay hidden, he would conceal his identity more thoroughly than that (and your forgetting about the scar too, which would not be long concealed). On the other hand...he is an eleven-year old boy with the sense of invincibility that most teens and pre-teens have to have kicked out of them by life, so I doubt he would think that far.

As for the wizards? Of course they would notice, and question, and probably believe it too whether he denies it or not. The Hogwarts letter is going to go to a Harry Potter, and McGonogall is going to call out his name either way in the Great Hall.
