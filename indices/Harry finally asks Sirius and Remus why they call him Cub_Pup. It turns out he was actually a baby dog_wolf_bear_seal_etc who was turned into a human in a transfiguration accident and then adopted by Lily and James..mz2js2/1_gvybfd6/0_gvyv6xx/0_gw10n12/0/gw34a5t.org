Uh, yeah. You could spin it that way if you took fanfic creative liberties and made Gabrielle to be at least Harry's age (I've seen folks do that in other fics). That wouldn't be as bad.

Obviously you wouldn't be able to post it here if such activities actually took place, but if it was falsely implied as a joke, I think it would be able to get by.
