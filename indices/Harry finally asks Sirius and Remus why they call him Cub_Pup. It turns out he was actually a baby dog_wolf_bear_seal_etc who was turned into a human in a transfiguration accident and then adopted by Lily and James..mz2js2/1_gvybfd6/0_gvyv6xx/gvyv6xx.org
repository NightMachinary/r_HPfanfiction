Yeah, I feel like him being a seal has the most comedic potential. Cue Fleur or Gabrielle learning about this and referring to him as “le phoque” and Harry being confused unless he knows that that's just the French word for seal.

Edit: thinking about this a little more; maybe Harry becomes a seal animagus for the second trial and is referred to as “le meuiller phoque,” or “the best seal,” but something gets lost in translation and people think that Fleur called Harry “the best fuck” or something.
