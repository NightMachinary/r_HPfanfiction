Since so many Ginny haters equate her with Lily Evans, the lack of Ginny/Snape fics is surprising.

I think it's even possible that Voldemort initially had dastardly plans for Ginny, considering her relationship with Harry. But Snape stepped in and told Voldemort that he wanted Ginny for himself, so Voldemort backtracked and left Ginny alone. Then in front of other Death Eaters, Voldemort made fun of Snape saying he had a thing for redheads, but that he made a better choice this time by picking a pureblood.
