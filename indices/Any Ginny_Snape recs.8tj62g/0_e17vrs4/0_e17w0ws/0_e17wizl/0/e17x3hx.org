Ohhh interesting. That's possible...but maybe it has something to do with Rowling being a redhead? For some reason I thought that she was redheaded as a child.

Honestly, I like the idea that he becomes a Weasley because he didn't grow up with a loving family. His best friend becomes his brother (a redheaded family).
