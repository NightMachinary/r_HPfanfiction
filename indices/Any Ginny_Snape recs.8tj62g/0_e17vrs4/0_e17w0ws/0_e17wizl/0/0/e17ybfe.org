In most of places of the world (Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Southern Europe), red haired people are indeed extremely rare. I think it's an inherent human bias to consider ethnic groups they aren't familiar with as â€˜look like the same'. When I had worked in China as an expat, I had plenty of people there confusing me with someone else from my ethnicity.

But in Britain, red haired people can make up to 10% of the population.

In the Books of course, there is absolutely no indication that Ginny and Lily resemble each other physically. Personality wise, Lily has more in common with Hermione anyway, from the little tidbit we know about Lily.
