Im still writing it and only got down till third year. Besides that, its mostly political trope. Don't get me wrong, Harry still hates Dursleys with a passion, he's just able to completely ruin Dursleys name with major overpowering. Be it by buying Grunnings or catching Dudley red handed with drugs, yada yada yada. You get what i mean. Its still in progress.
