Yes and no, you have to have the genetical faults inside the brain to be classed as a psychopath. Certain areas of your brain which mainly deal with emotions is what is generally effected. Now in saying that, there is the debate of your Nature vs Nurture which is effectively your biological make up vs the environment that you have grown up in. In the case of a psychopath, it is most definitely both. There is the neurological make up which leads to the lack of empathy, but then the environment which that child grows up in has the effect of choosing whether that psychopathic child is a killer or a law abiding citizen. This is a very general rule, you don't have to be a psychopath to be a monster, and you don't have to be a monster to be a psychopath. In my opinion, tom is a psychopath who's living environment changed him into a monster. It really all comes down to the debate if whether our genetics dictate how we act as humans or whether it is our environment. My personal option is that it is a mixture of both your environment and genetic make up which dictate that way we behave in society.
