I am no psychologist and only have a limited knowledge on the subject that is so incredibly diverse. It's definitely cool to hear another's opinion on the matter, because to be honest, that's all it really is. The studies are still so inconclusive that all you can do is to form your own opinion based on your own knowledge.
