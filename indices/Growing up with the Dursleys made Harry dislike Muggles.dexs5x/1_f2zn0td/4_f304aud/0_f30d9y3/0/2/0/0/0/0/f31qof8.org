A lot of research regarding psychopathy is still very inconclusive with different theories being thrown around. There was a study led by the University of Wisconsin-Madison during 2017 which confirmed theories that psychopaths have reduced connections between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. The study used convicted, diagnosed psychopaths. “This is the first study to show both structural and functional differences in the brains of people diagnosed with psychopathy. Those two structures in the brain, which are believed to regulate emotion and social behaviour, seem to not be communicating as they should.” - Micheal Koenigs. Dr James “Jim” Fallon, did some incredible research into the subject. This is just my opinion on diagnosed psychopaths, I'm not really referring to normal criminals at all.
