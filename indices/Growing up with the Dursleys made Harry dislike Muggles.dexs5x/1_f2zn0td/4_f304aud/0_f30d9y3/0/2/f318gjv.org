While this is the case for most people in the world, there is the situation when someone with the neurological issues of a psychopath that they don't bounce back. Not all psychopaths are killers, in fact very few are. It's the ones who have been traumatized that become predators due to the fact that they are physically incapable of processing the emotions required to deal with that. It's when a shitty set of circumstances are added together that create some terrible results. That being said, it is only a incredibly simple overview of the neurological issues in a psychopaths brain. What i'm trying to say is that there are cases where it creates a hatred towards certain people, characteristics ect ect. It's just important to understand that not all killers are psychopaths and not all psychopaths are killers. Idk, my rant is kind of meaningless, but it could be argued that he suffers from the same numerological discrepancies of a psychopath, leading him to be a remorseless person with a fixation on the goal of magical supremacy, but not necessarily a monster.
