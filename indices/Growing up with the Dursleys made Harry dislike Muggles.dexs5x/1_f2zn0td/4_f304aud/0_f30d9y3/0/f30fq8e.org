My friend was raped by her uncle for years. She doesn't hate all men, just her uncle.

My other friend has been assaulted multiple times and doesn't hate all men.

My best friend was beaten by her mom for existing her whole childhood and all she hates is her mom.

Most people are good people and don't blame everyone for the mistakes of a few. Blaming other muggles for what his family did is similar to blaming all men for one assaulting you.
