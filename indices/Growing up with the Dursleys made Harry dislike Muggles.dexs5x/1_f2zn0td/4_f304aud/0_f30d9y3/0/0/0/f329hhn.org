Yeah, Harry went to primary school for what? 5 or 6 years? He was out in the public enough, and he's not so damaged that he doesn't know how to socialize, he just really couldn't make lasting friends due to all the bullying. He's good at being a fly-on-the-wall type person, because he had to be growing up, and he'd be able to observe and reflect. Harry strikes me as pretty emotionally intelligent: he recognizes Draco as a bully straight away, even without knowing all the pronouns in play.

That's not to say Harry couldn't or wouldn't be biased in some way, but he's got enough intelligence to recognize that the Dursleys are not your average muggle family.
