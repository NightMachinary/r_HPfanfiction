If he was a blood purist he would never have befriended her before Hogwarts, and wouldn't have remained her friend for several years at Hogwarts. He was angry and embarrassed, and when people are highly emotional they do and say awful things that they don't really mean. That he didn't mean it is clear because he repeatedly apologized, and it was one of his worst memories.
