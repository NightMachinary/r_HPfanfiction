I see the Death Eaters as being a bit like the SS. Plenty of foolish and impressionable young men were sucked in to that not because they were True Believers to the heart of their being, but because they were fooled by grand oratory and a good looking uniform. They often had a superficial belief, but that didn't last. Plenty of them realised how horrible it was but by that time it was too late. They *had to* obey orders and do hideous things, because the alternative was execution. I see Snape as being like that - suckered in under false pretences, and by the time he realised what he had signed up for it was too late. He then went with the flow until that one intolerable thing happened and he turned spy.

It is common for naive youngsters to get sucked in to extremist groups without having a complete grasp of their ideology and aims.

As for Sectumsempra - it was created "for enemies" IIRC while he was at school. Who were his enemies then? Those bullying shits the Marauders. Yes, he later used it while in the Death Eaters, but that just brings us back to him acting under duress like those suckered into joining the SS.
