There are lots like this, and they don't make sense. The defining characteristic of Harry Potter is his inherent morality. A person with functioning morality would not perpetuate a prejudice. It's not a matter of being brainwashed into loving muggles by Dumbledore and the Weasleys.

His boundless compassion is not a product of manipulation. It's innate. It's the thing that makes him different from Tom Riddle and Snape. The only prejudice he seems to have absorbed is against Slytherin, and even that falls through when push comes to shove. He hates Snape, but sympathetises with him against his dead father who he reveres when he finds out that Snape was bullied. He suspects Draco of being a murdering death eater, but his first impulse upon finding him crying in a bathroom is to reach out, until Draco raised his wand to cast an unforgivable.

Harry Potter does not have the kind of sustained hate or even apathy in him that any kind of bigotry or prejudice would require, especially when he has targets other than the group of people his parents died fighting for to blame for his fate.
