I've long been interested in reading a fic with the idea of a dark or grey Harry who's views are more in line with Grindlewald or Magneto from X- Men. A Harry who is a magical supremacist, but not a blood purist. As with his background with the Dursleys, this could have easily been a path he could have gone down.
