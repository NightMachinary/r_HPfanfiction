Not many top fics this year, although 0800-Rent-A-Hero will become a classic in a few years time, I'm sure. Most I enjoyed have been mentioned, but I'm currently liking linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House) . Hermione is not a witch, but another girl is. There's changes to the story, I'm sure a few more in later years, since the sequel was released just a few days ago. The OC is also interesting and a refreshing change of pace with an original pairing. And a female is in Slytherin and the main character without being needlessly paired with Draco or Snape! Yay!
