linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger;The Black Prince by cxjenious;Grow Young With Me by Taliesin19;Out of the Dark and into the Green by Chim Cheree)

Tied for top are Shadow of Angmar and Grow Young With Me. At most basic, it is the consistently well done character growth for both fics that gets me. Black Prince is a favorite but I can't rate it better till I see more HP magic introduced. Fic that I think will grow a lot in popularity is Out of the Dark and into the Green.
