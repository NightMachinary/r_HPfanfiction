I read this earlier this week and while I /liked/ it, it's not really a Harry Potter fic. What I mean by that is it doesn't /feel/ like a Harry Potter story, and the Potterverse elements it does use seem tacked on and unnecessary. This would have worked just fine as a standalone story with original characters and no magic, maybe making the main character a police officer or government agent if Harry's Auror work actually matters to the plot. [[/spoiler][Given how many times Unspeakable Roth has been offhandedly mentioned since the flashback to the botched raid, I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out Ginny's death wasn't an accident.]]

The Potterverse characters also feel... off somehow. The only character who feels like an adult version of their canon self is Hermione, who the author absolutely /nails/ (intelligent, protective of her friends, and willing to go behind their backs if she feels it's necessary). This might be the best adult Hermione I've ever read.

I'm also not convinced the author has ever met a child. Harry's children are all unrealistically perfect, with their only "flaws" being amusing pranks, manipulating people with their cuteness, or minor sibling squabbles that are easily broken up. Not that I /want/ them to be a disruptive force in the story, but it feels like they are only present because they were in the epilogue. It's just another way the story suffers for being a fanfic.

Again, I should stress I did enjoy this fic, I just think it'd work better as a standalone story.
