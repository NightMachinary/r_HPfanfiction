Prince of Slytherin started pretty strong, but since its gotten in CoS it's really fell off in quality. The 2nd book is already as long as the first and it isn't even christmas. The author has lost focus and the story has gone everywhere. Also the 30 year old 12 year olds has really gotten out of hand. I really dislike this Lockhart too. I'm still reading, but it wouldn't take much to make me stop.
