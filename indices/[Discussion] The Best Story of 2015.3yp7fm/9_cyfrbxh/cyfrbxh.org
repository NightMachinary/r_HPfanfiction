There's the obligatory linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man)

Then, there are three stories that are still pretty short, especially compared to Prince. However, I think they have a lot of promise. linkffn(Warning Signs Read Desolation by minidraken; The Katarn Side by Darth Marrs; The Unwinding Golden Thread by The Carnivorous Muffin)

ETA: Sorry, just skimmed the intro post and didn't read that the OP only wanted us to rec one story each. -_-;;
