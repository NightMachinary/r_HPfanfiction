If The Lesser Sadness was a bit longer I would likely support that, but as that isn't the case, I'll instead mention linkffn(800-Rent-A-Hero).

I'm generally a sucker for time/dimensional travel, so it automatically earns a plus for me there. It takes it time to set things up, with Harry's dimensional counterpart not entering the story in the flesh until... 10 chapters in? It takes a while, anyways.

I'm also fairly fond of Harry as a teacher, though since Harry is best treated by mistreating him, it shouldn't be in something he excels in. Rather, he has to become the Divination Professor which he is... not quite qualified for, initially. He gets better, and one of the weaker points of the story is perhaps that it makes him a bit too good at it, too quickly, while making it a bit too useful to have fallen into disregard as it has.

Another aspect I enjoy is that it takes many INDY-HARRY-FUCK-YEAH! tropes/cliches, runs with it, and shows how it's generally for the worse.
