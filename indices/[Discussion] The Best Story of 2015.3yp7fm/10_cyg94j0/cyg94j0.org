It's a relatively late entry in the year, but linkffn(Nine Lives Too Many by Fahad09) is shaping up to be a pretty amazing fic. Basically, instead of Severus Snape as the head of Slytherin, we've got the History of Magic teacher who just happens to be a talking cat (technically an Animagus, but why be a human when you can be a cat?). There's slightly more than that going on, but all in all it's just a real joy to read.
