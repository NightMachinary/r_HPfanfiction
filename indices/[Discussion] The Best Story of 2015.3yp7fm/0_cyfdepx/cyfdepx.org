I'll start us off. My favorite was linkffn(The Lesser Sadness by Newcomb)

It's one of the few Super!Harry stories that I've really enjoyed. It takes a rather clich√© idea, and turns it into an incredible story. It's one of those stories that get better every time you read it. Very well-written with great characterization, brilliant action scenes, and a lot of awesome stuff. It also has a unique pairing (Harry/Penelope), which I really like.
