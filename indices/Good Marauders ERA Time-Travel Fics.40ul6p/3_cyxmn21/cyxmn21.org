I didn't realize the Marauders were all baseball pitchers, or that whole fanfictions were based on their Earned Run Averages. That particular statistic is depended upon a bit too heavily in modern baseball (in my opinion), but this is still pretty cool to find out.

It seems unlikely that this is what you are asking for, but I can't see any other reason you would capitalize ERA like that.

So, here is the best req I could find for you: linkffn(1742286). It has Marauders and baseball, but no statistical analysis sorry.

EDIT: Ok I felt like a jerk after my "hilarious" comment so I found a real req. linkffn(2386991). Enjoy.
