Thanks! "Era" was capitalized as I was attempting to emphasize that I don't really care for fics focusing on the Marauders themselves, but rather, fics where Harry travels to their time.

Often, "Marauders Era" is synonymous with "Marauder-centric", something I was trying to avoid.

I can see why it might not make sense, though.
