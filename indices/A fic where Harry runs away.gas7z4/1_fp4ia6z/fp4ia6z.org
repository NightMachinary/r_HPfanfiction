[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11412814/1/6]]

Summery:

At the tender age of four, Harry ran away when he realized the Dursley's would never love him like they loved Dudley. Hermione ran away when she began getting bullied, thinking her parents to deserve better. Ron ran away when his mother favored his sister over him. Three children on the run, thinking themselves worthless, stupid, little freaks... but the Trio are meant to be together. They shall travel the world, seeing and learning amazing things, unaware of how the Wizarding World was searching for them. In this world, they are still gold, but not entirely. Just a... darker gold. The Wizarding World is in for a shock... meet the Dark Gold Trio, my friends.
