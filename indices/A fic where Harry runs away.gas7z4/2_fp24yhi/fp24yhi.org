RemindMe!

linkffn(The Hidden Hero) is the only one I can think of right now, though I know that there are quite a few roaming about. Not exactly running away, but more kicked out. I know that theres a popular one somewhere where he keeps running away and getting Vernon arrested but Dumbledore keeps altering his memories. I am at a complete loss in what the title was but it was a good crack.
