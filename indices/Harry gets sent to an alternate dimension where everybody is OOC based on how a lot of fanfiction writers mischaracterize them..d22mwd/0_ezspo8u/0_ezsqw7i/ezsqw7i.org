This is officially canon, as of Cursed Child.

*ACT III, SCENE IX*

#+begin_quote
  *SNAPE looks at him, every inch a hero, he softly smiles.*

  *SNAPE:* Tell Albus --- tell Albus Severus --- I'm proud he carries my name. Now go. Go.

.

And for some reason, he gets weirdly flirty with Professor Hermione from an alternate universe. What the fuck, the more I re-read, the worse it gets. I guess Snamione is canon, too.

*ACT II SCENE VII*

#+begin_quote
  *HERMIONE:* And --- Snape? What does Snape do in this other world?

  *SNAPE:* I'm dead, presumably.

  *HERMIONE:* I'm sorry, Severus.

  *SNAPE looks at her, and then swallows the pain. He indicates RON with a flick of his head.*

  *SNAPE:* Well, at least I'm not married to him.

#+begin_quote
  *SNAPE:* Sometimes costs are made to be borne.

  *The two look at each other, SNAPE nods, HERMIONE nods back, SNAPE's face crumbles slightly.*

  *SNAPE:* I didn't just quote Dumbledore, did I?

  *HERMIONE (with a smile):* No, I'm pretty sure that's pure Severus Snape.
