I can see him being lazy up until 3rd year. That's when he learns the Patronus because he's highly motivated. A post-Newt level charm most adult wizards can't cast. The next year he's entered into the Tournament, and clearly starts learning post fourth-year spells, then he's involved in Voldemort's necromantic ritual. Fifth year he starts the DA and teaches other students Defense, including the Patronus. Then he has the fight in the DoM and sees how outclassed he is in terms of Dumbledore and Voldemort, Sirius ends up dead, everyone else ends up wounded, and he's almost possessed by Voldemort.

All of this provides a shit ton of motivation, and he's shown to not be lazy when properly motivated. Yet we don't see anything significant in regards to him really dedicating himself to be a more powerful or skillful wizard. He just seems pretty average with a few exceptions.
