Average? What average wizard survives Voldemort that many times, kills a Basilisk, chases away a horde of Dementors, competes and survives the Triwizard tournament at 14, trained people in DADA that are older, teaches them the Patronas, one of the hardest spells to master, fights against fully trained wizards and lives long enough for support to arrive.

If Harry is average, what the hell is every one else? Do you really think Harry is at the same level as Lavender, Nott, McMillan or Boot?
