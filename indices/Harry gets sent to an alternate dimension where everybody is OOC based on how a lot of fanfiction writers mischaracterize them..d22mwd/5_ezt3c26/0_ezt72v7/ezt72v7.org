I'd say he's above average. Not Dumbledore, or Voldemort level(for at least a long time. I could see him getting there maybe, but decades out at least), but he does have some impressive magical feats like his fending off dozens of Dementors(not sure what the average adult wizard can do, but it certaintly seems impressive), and I remember reading about Fred & George adding shield charms to hats, because the average wizard/witch is crap at it.
