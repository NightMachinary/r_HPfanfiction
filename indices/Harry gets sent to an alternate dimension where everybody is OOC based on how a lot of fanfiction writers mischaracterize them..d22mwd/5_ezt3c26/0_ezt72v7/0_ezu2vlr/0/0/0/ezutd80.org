How? I'll give you the Animagus transformation, but that's on a similar level to a bunch of teenagers learning the Patronus charm, and let's be honest, the stuff that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to pull on the Horcrux hunt was damn impressive for underage wizards. Also there was Hermione having enough skill to brew the Polyjuice potion in her second year. I mean looking at their skills, they picked them up due to circumstance, I wouldn't call one generation more skilled than the other, unless you can back up your reasoning?
