"Sorry, Harry. You have a massive harem due to your inheritance that you need to produce heirs with, but you're /also/ Draco's destined Veela-bonded mate, and he'll die if you ever have sex with someone else. Both are binding magical contracts, and if Draco dies, that counts as murder. So, basically, your choices are to lose your magic and go back to the Dursleys, or go directly to Azkaban forever."

"...I'll take the one that leaves me with a massive harem, I guess."
