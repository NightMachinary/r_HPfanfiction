Off the top of my head, there's Sisyphus, by Esama (spelling?), a depressing-but-good oneshot about a Harry who is cursed to loop through his entire life, forever.

Also, there's Wastelands of Time, plus HP & the Temporal Beacon, both of which involve a "groundhog day" like time loop. The former is Harry/Fleur and complete, the latter is H/Hr and abandoned, IIRC.

Sorry I have no links, I'm on mobile atm.
