The ones already mentioned are the best I know in the HP fandom.

If you don't mind considering the next largest fandom extant, there are a few very good Naruto ones: /Time Braid/ by SharperV, /Reload/ by Case13, and /Do You Remember Love/ by DigiFruit. (Perfect Lionheart also did a Naruto one, but like all of his stories, it sucks.)
