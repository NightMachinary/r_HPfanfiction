A Marauder's Plan is objectively cliche but enjoyable overall. If I rated aspects of the story... Here's my overall review that I put too much effort in.

Writing 8/10 Dialogue 7/10 Plot 5.5/10 Action scenes 9/10 Magical theory concepts 8/10 Pacing 6/10 (900k words to detail the entire 4th year and then some)

Yes, it's packed with tropes.

Super!Harry: Funny thing is he never really gets to use his power. It's said he's near the level of Dumbledore's power but the majority of action in this story doesn't involve him.

Lordships: I let this slide because the political drama/events subplot is pretty good.

Multiple Animagus forms for Harry: Stupid, and ultimately irrelevant to the story. His forms are a Raven and a Lion. The Raven is featured maybe every other chapter but the Lion gets forgotten.

Romance: Surprisingly, there is no issue here. Harry and Hermione act like they should: 14 year olds without a clue. Remus and Tonks is a nice subplot,

Final verdict: It's a fun story, honestly not meant to be taken super seriously.
