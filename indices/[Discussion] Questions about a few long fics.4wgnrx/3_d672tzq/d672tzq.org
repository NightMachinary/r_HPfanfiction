I read the first few chapters of Angry Harry and the Seven and it was too painful to continue. I had seen it promoted a few times on this subreddit and so I tried reading it. Just do yourself a favor and never read it.

Marauders plan is great, I love the Sirius and Harry father/son relationship. The romance is done well. Politics is also done well. There is this family magic that is waaay too OP. Honestly this would be one of the best stories there is if the pacing was better and they got rid of the OP family magic bullshit. Even then though it is great.
