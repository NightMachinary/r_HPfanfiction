The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig is a good example, although it's got some sci-fi elements, especially later on. Also, it's complete, which is always nice. There's even a sequel (which I haven't read), but it's both unfinished, and a Star Wars crossover.

Wit of the Raven is similar to Hogwarts Battle School in that Hogwarts is fiercely competitive, but it follows a different route - instead of duelling being the only measure of ability, the challenges are more varied. Nice world-building, with very minor magic-replaces-technology as well.

The Serpent and the Crown is an excellent example of world-building, to the point that large parts of the setting and magic aren't recognisable. There's a parallel dimension that wizards live in, instead of them hiding in the same world as the muggles. There are changes to the magic system, economy, school and a few of the characters (for example, Kingsley is a sailor).
