There's an author on FF dot net who has somehow managed the most comprehensive list of students across the Hogwarts years between 1987 and 1995. Unfortunately, I can't remember the name of that profile. If I find it again, I'll update this comment and let you know.

EDIT: It's sprinter1988, who wrote Junior Inquisitor, a somewhat better, if even more outlandish Manipulative Dumbledore fic.
