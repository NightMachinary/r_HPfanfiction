[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24620707/chapters/59480275][*The Last Enemy: The Howling Nights*]] *by CH_Darling* is the first story in a new canon-compliant Marauders era series that starts in their Fifth Year and will go through the end of the First War. It is EXCELLENT, and surpasses all the old standbys of this genre in my opinion. I particularly loved how she wrote the whole process of the boys becoming animagi, which spans the first half of the fic, and it provides some of the best humor in the story. I recommend reading the whole thing, but you should at least read Ch. 17 ("Erotic Breakfast Poetry"), which can stand alone as a funny one-shot during the process.
