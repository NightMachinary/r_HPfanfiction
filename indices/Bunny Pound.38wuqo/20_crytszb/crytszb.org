Hermione goes back in time to her eighth birthday or so to rescue Harry and save the wizarding world from the tug-of-war between Grindelwald (who possessed Tom Riddle on his defeat) and Dumbledore (who wants to keep the wizarding world unchanging and isolated, and who plans to possess Harry when Harry is old enough). In her first timeline, she had a soul bond to Luna Lovegood, but that was when they were roughly the same age rather than fifteen years apart.
