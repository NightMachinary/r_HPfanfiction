[[/r/pets]] may be able to help, or your [[http://www.reddit.com/r/LocationReddits/wiki/index][city's/country's/state's subreddit]].

Or [[/r/Rabbits]] which has tons of helpful info about taking care of rabbits, really, it's a more comprehensive pet subreddit than any I've seen, even those for dogs/cats, sidebar wise that is. [[http://wabbitwiki.com/wiki/Adoption_Listings][Worldwide rabbit adoption listings]] is one of the links.
