Ooh man! A while ago, I was in an OC-making-mood and I made a backstory and things the character would do. I never did get around to making a story though.

Here's one, feel free to change the name or whatever you want.

Azkaban. The fortress inhabited with dementors and prisoners. But what if there was another being. Placed in the fortress to keep others safe? Rowena Ravenclaw liked to invent, she like I do the impossible. So she made it her goal to create a living being with magic. It looked human, it sounded human, it acted... /mostly/ human. Her name is Calypso, the prison was built to house her when she got out of control. Insane people forget her but Sirius Black wasn't insane. Sirius escapes and Calypso hears word that her only friend in the last few hundred years was being hunted by dementors, she mascerade a as one herself and sneaks out to protect him.

Basically, there's a never-aging human-like being living in Azkaban who befriends Sirius and aids him. She would see modern things, even wizarding world modern things and she would be amazed.

I'd love to see this turned into a story.
