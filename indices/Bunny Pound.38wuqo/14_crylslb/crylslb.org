Butterfly effect - Remus Lupin was born a girl. Fallout - doesn't join the marauders, no marauders becoming animagi or map creation? friends with Lily instead? Better wolfsbane potion or no wolfbane potion improvements? how does this affect harry's upbringing. Would fem!Remus be less of a wuss than canon!Remus and attempt to be a better guardian for Harry?
