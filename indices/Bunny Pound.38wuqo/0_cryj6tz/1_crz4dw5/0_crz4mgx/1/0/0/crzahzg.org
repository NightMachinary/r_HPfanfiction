Yeah, I've begun writing, it's a fantastic prompt you've come up with here. The Walburga in my story is rather weak and frail because she's dying in four years so she can't /really/ do much. My Lestrange Jr (Vega is her name) is born in August.

What's your fanfiction.net name, by the way? I've been meaning to ask so we could talk more about this over there. Mine is Abyranss.
