I did not, I think I'd prefer to kill her off a bit sooner, because of the whole isolation theme I was thinking of, but I guess Walburga is asocial enough for that not to ruin it. Plus I had imagined her portrait being one of her main influences, this might actually improve that connection.

It would be 4 years though, since she didn't become an orphan until after Harry did, which was Halloween 1981. Depending on where one sets her birthday, she would have been 5 or 6 when Walburga died.
