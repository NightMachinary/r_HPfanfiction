The daughter of the Lestranges (same Hogwarts year as Harry), was still at home when vindictive aurors came to burn her home down after arresting her parents. They don't check for this (or care), and she is saved by Kreacher who recognizes her distress and Black blood (if not name), though not before she gets a fair amount of burns on her. She is raised by Kreacher, some portraits and a ghost that lives in the hidden library in Grimmauld's place. The wizarding world doesn't find out that she lives until her sorting ceremony.

That one has been in my head for a while but I have 2 other stories that I'm already working on. Would love to see someone work this one out. (I can see some nice dialogue between her and Harry arguing about which side is more cruel, not that she would care much I think)
