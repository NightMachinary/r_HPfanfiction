werewolf!severus au: sirius provokes severus into going down to the shrieking shack, but doesn't encounter james because he's in his dorm, wanking over lily, or something. severus goes, gets attacked by remus, fights back, firing a few sectumsempras etc. he incapacitates remus long enough to escape. he was still bitten and is now a werewolf. butterfly effect, there are now actual hard consequences to sirius's actions, james is disappointed, remus feels guilty and ashamed. severus is enraged and also terrified at what this means for his life.

noseless!james au: severus aims a little bit more to the right during swm, cuts james's nose off. he now lives life without a nose.
