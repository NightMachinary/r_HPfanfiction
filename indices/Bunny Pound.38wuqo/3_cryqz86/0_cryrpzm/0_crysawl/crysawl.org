I'd imagine Voldemort or some of his close cabinet who would have had to hear part of the prophecy would realize Neville had been marked as an equal by losing his parents too. Actually it would be kind of funny if that last chunk of Voldemort to revive, the one who ends up being the central protagonist, had absolutely no idea of all the confusion until the death eaters clue him in.
