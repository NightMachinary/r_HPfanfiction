Newly bodified Voldemort is chomping at the bit and all, "Let's go get that little bitch, Potter."

And the Death Eaters are like, "Nooo. No, milord, we can't."

Voldemort gets upset that they're raining on his parade and telling him what he can or can't do. He fires off a few Cruciatus curses.

Lucius Malfoy is writhing in the dirt but manages to gasp out a few sentences explaining the situation. The can't just snatch Potter, they have to get the Longbottom brat as well. Witnessing his parents torture as a tot and losing them to insanity has caused him significant emotional trauma. Malfoy explains that Neville is believed to be marked as well, showing an odd amount of emotional insight for a man so self centered.

Voldemort is a bit perturbed to realize he doesn't know which one the prophecy refers to, or if it's even both.

Yeah, that'd be pretty interesting to read about (assuming I wasn't writing it). It would still need to be tweaked because I think the prophecy implies the child is marked by Voldemort himself when it says "the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal." I would consider Neville's trauma to be primarily caused by the Lestranges and Crouch and only secondarily by Voldemort.
