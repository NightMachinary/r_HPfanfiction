Ok two AUs I've always kind if wanted but never had the time to write:

Dumbledore decides to drop all his eggs in one basket, just to be safe. Harry is raised by Augusta Longbottom. How on earth do he and Neville turn out? Melodrama surrounding Neville and Harry debating about who the hell is the chosen one if they're both destroying horcruxes together is optional.

Growing up in the Dursley household makes Harry seek approval by duplicating the behavior he sees praised from Dudley. What results is simply the douchiest little bully Hogwarts has ever seen.
