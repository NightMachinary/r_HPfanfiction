Crossover with His Dark Marterials.

In the HP universe, James Potter and Lily Evans are on the run from the Death Eaters with baby Harry. Somehow they end up at the Archway on the Dias. James gets murdered, and Lily jumps through to save baby Harry from Lord Voldemort. Only it's not a pathway to death, but rather a window into a new world. They wind up in Lyra's world with the Daemons. Lily (whose Daemon is a stag) decides that this is a safe spot to hide and raise Harry. Back in the HP world, Voldemort takes over. He then starts expanding his army. Harry grows up in the world with Daemons, but Voldemort starts sending his army through the window to find him. Lots of wiggle room. Maybe there's a Hogwarts in both realms? Maybe Albus Dumbledore only exists in the Deamon world.

I dunno, have fun.
