Fair. So, Harry still goes into Gryffindor with Hermione and Ron.

Dudley, not a complete prick, was also never going to be top of his class. We'll say he goes into Slytherin (because he isn't brave enough to ask for Gryffindor?) and teams up with Draco and Pansy?

He and Harry still never completely got along, but more in a brotherly way. Dudley's parentage would teach Draco to be less elitist. Harry/Ron/Hermione would still assist in some of the heroics because of Harry and Dudley being raised as brothers?

In keeping with cannon plot?

Sorcerer's Stone... Ginny gets abducted... The third book would have to be reworked... And Snape's role in the death of Dudley's Parents?
