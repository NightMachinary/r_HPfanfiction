Not my own idea: J.K Rowling's Harry Potter is really an unusual kid. Many kids brought up in an abusive home(locked in a closet, verbally abused, beaten) do not grow up to be well-adjusted adults, let alone self-sacrificing heros. This is a darker take on Harry's story. This is a Harry who sees his magical abilities as his chance to gain the respect and power his muggle relatives denied him his whole life... A Harry who actively hates Dumbledore and Hagrid for abandoning him to the hell that was #4 Privet Drive. A Harry who embraces Draco's muggle-hating views and chooses Slytherin over Gryffindor... His story comes to parallel Voldemort's even more, save for one difference: Voldemort killed his parents for which Harry wants revenge. Does Harry seek to replace Voldemort as the next Dark Lord, or does he prove to be the anti-hero that returns honor to the infamous Slytherin house.
