Another option is that the Books are like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms][The Romance of the Three Kingdoms]], which is 60% truths and 40% lies.

Among the lies:

- Voldemort is nowhere near as bad as depicted in the Books, he neither mutilated his soul nor looked like a snake. The winner of the war simply bashed him into oblivion.
- The good guys are nowhere near as innocent and passive as in the Books. Dumbledore is one top political hack and his Order had committed their share of war crimes. Of course, Voldemort's gang was more brutal.
- There is no prophecy. Voldemort targeted Potters because they got some seriously important intel on him. BWL is just a propaganda ploy because the truth is that Lily Potter activated self-destruct. Voldemort survived not because of some soul anchors, but because some other dark rituals that gave him much better protections.
- Nevertheless, Voldemort being badly wounded gave his enemies the opportunity for a devastating counterattack. Only the growing rift between the Ministry and Dumbledore prevented his network from being completely destroyed.
- Harry Potter was never given to an abusive household, although both parties were not happy with the arrangement.

Under this pretext, SI's Book knowledge is mostly useless, and often counterproductive.
