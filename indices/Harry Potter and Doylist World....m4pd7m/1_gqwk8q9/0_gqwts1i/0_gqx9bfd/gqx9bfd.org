I think it could still work, Harry is just operating on more of a time crunch since he has to wait for inciting events. Like death eaters and the dark mark don't even exist until the quidditch world cup! He could do notes to people, like reverse /Memento/. Like "don't read until x date" because it will sound crazy before then. That could help him make up for lost time compared to how a normal time travel situation would let him operate.
