The two famous complete series are NoahPhantom's Albus Potter - linkffn(8417562) for first book - and Venkin87's Albus Potter seriers - linkffn(4380964). Both series are written in the same style as Harry Potter and both have seven complete books. The first one takes it one step further and explores cosmic magic and stuff like that, while the second is a little more like Harry Potter style with no significant world building contribution except for the after-war effects but it's also a feel-good story with no grand plots or anything (the main antagonist is the typical cartoonish villain who wants to rule the world through fear). Both are really well written though
