The two best ones (one of them is a trilogy) that I've come across over the 10 ish years that I have read next-gen centric fics are Ignite (and Starfall & Oblivion that succeed it) by Slide linkffn(8255131), as well as Clash by shezwriter linkffn(12383732).

Note that Ignite is more of a POV fic with Albus as one of the main characters, and Clash is a for the most part dual-perspective fic. Clash is an acquired taste though, for reasons that you can surmise quite early on in the fic (not the writing though, I can assure you that the writing is excellent - not quite Ignite level, perhaps). Ignite, on the other hand, presents its readers one of the best writings - both in terms of plot and of the linguistic commands that Slide has - that I have ever seen amongst the hundreds of fanfictions that I have read over the years.
