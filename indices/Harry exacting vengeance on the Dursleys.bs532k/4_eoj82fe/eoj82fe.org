In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path) there's a scene later on where Harry (who started a quite successful rune business) invests in Grunnings just to tell Vernon that he's fired.

In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina) the Dursleys get ruined by Sirius, Harry doesn't even realize what's happening. One moment he's in the cupboard with the Dursleys, suddenly they're arrested and he's living in a magical mansion.
