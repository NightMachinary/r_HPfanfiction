Rebuilding Life by Kezzabear on FFN might be one of the best Harry Potter fanfics that I've ever read. It's the post-DH "eighth year" as Harry (and by extension those around him) struggle to pick up the pieces after the war. I'm hesitant to link it as I don't want to violate the sub's rules by accident (there are implied sexual encounters), but I honestly can't think of a better fic to recommend than that.
