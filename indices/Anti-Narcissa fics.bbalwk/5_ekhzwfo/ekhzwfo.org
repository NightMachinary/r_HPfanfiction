I think that's what makes me appreciate Narcissa as a character so much. She is unapologetic. Yes she's hypocritical, but she doesn't care. She will do anything---LITERALLY anything---to protect her son. I'm not saying she's a good person, but in some way I admire her. I can't imagine what it's like to love someone so much that you're willing to do whatever it takes to keep them safe, even at the cost of your own life.
