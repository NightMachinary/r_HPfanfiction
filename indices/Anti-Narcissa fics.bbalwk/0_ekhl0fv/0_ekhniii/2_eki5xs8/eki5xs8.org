I mean, there is the whole Snape debacle as well; the series is not exactly known for its fair and accountable justice system.

Actually, now that I think about it, their situations are fairly similar. Both seem to be perfectly happy with Voldemort's goals and methods until it appears that he will kill somebody they love. Then they turn traitor to try and protect that person and are spared from jail time based on the word of the hero of the day. Narcissa probably gets more of a pass because her love for Draco is less creepy and obsessive than Snape's love for Lily, and because fanon has turned her into the ultimate MILF.
