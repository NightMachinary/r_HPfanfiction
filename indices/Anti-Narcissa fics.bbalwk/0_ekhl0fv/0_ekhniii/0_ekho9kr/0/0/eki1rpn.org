Which are? Unless she went and murdered baby in their sleep, Canon shows more of a passive compliance than active involvement.

Of course she is a blood purist and would not cry any dead mudblood, but apart from letting the Damn Lord living in her house with his escaped followers, not transmiting informations to Auror and later taking part in the battle, she did not do much.

In a normal case, it would be more than enough for a trial and maybe some prison sentence, but in a situation like Harry Potter where 95% of the society showed passive compliance, the government itself organized muggleborn arrest and the Dementor (the only magical deterent other than fines) switched to Voldemort, I can understand her leaving free or with just something like a house arrest.
