I'm not sure why you are downvoted. It is a conspiracy for the premeditated killing of a human, aka "conspiracy to murder".

In my country being a knowing and willing participant in a conspiracy to commit a crime is almost equal to commit the crime. And in this case Narcissa wasn't only knowing, she was seemingly instrumental in convincing Snape to kill someone.

If this ever came out, she would be guilty of murder.

No matter how you look at this: Starfox is right, she is far from innocent.
