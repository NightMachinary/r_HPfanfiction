It is not illegal to not report a crime. It's illegal if you lie to the police about it, but you don't have to tell them anything. It is only illegal if you actively participate in the crime. Standing aside doesn't count.

I'm pretty sure it's that way in england at least. Some places have it different for serious crimes, but even so the fact that the Dark Lord himself was there, would make her blameless for not reporting his crimes in any sane legal system.
