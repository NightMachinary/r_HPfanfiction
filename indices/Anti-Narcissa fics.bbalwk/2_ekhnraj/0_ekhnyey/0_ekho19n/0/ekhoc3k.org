This is during a war where teenagers are being taken from their own mothers and killed,two abducted teenagers are being kept in Narcissa's basement. At no point does she ever express any misgivings with what's going on until her own son is put in danger and then suddenly she wants to abandon Voldemort . Seems pretty hypocritical and borderline sociopathical .
