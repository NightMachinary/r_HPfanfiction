In this fic, Harry doesn't believe what Quirrell says about power, BUT Quirrell does emotionally manipulate him into handing over the Philosopher's Stone and becomes a mentor figure to Harry after he flees the castle. Harry's in third year and just now figuring out that Quirrell was lying to him and wasn't a friend of his mother's. Linkffn(a new kind of normal by brilliantlady)
