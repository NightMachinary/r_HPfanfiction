linkffn(Path of Decision by lulu42) has someone else (and I won't spoil who) tells Harry a slightly different thing, specifically "There is no right and wrong. There is only power and those too weak to see it." Note the one letter change.

It's probably not what you're looking for, but it's quite good, and the crossover elements with "The Sandman" are well done.
