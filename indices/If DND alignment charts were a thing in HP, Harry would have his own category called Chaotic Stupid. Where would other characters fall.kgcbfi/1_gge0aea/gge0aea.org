Harry is nowhere near chaotic stupid. The only character in the series who might be is Peeves, but he's probably more of a Chaotic Neutral.

By that definition, I'd say that almost all of the good guys in the series are Lawful Good. Maybe Neutral Good in some cases, but probably still leaning towards Lawful. The Twins are probably the biggest exception, as they are solidly Chaotic Good. Luna might also be Chaotic Good, or at least Chaotic-leaning Neutral Good.

Voldemort and most other Death Eaters probably fall somewhere in the Neutral Evil to Lawful Evil range. I would probably put Voldemort closer to Neutral and Malfoy a closer to Lawful, but you could probably make a case either way. Bellatrix, of course, is Chaotic Evil.

Snape is confusing because his alignment shifts, he doesn't always act like his true alignment anyway, and he's probably just generally too complex to fit nicely into a box. I'd probably lean towards Lawful Neutral if I had to pick.

Umbridge is Lawful Evil, but Fudge is probably Lawful Neutral.
