Agree with you on Hermione. I think Luna was too involved in the conflict to be Neutral, she took part in the battle of the Department of Mysteries after all.

Controversial take but in the context of the war, maybe Snape was true neutral. Switched sides when it suited him, doesn't actively seek to better or worsen the world.
