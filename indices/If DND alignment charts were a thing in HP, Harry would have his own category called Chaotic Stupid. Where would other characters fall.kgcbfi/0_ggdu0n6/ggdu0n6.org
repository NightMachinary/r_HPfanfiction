Umbridge is lawful evil, Bellatrix is chaotic evil, Voldemort is evil evil

Dumbledore is chaotic good (no-one is convincing me he is lawful with that scene when they came to arrest him lol)

I'm stuck on Hermione. Despite her original passion for following the rules she does a lot of illegal shit, including trapping a PERSON in a JAR, so maybe ruthless good if that's a thing.
