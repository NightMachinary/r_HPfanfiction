I don't think pity is a matter of deserve. You pity someone regardless of whether they deserve it. I pity Peter Pettigrew, too, and even Voldemort to a certain extent. No matter what someone did, if their life ends up in a sad miserable state because of their character flaws and the choices they made, they're pitiful.

Do I also have zero tolerance for Snape and think that he was a terrible human with few redeeming qualities if any? Uh yeah
