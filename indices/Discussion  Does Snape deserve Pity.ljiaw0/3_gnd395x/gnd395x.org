Nah.

Is he an interesting character? Sure, but does he, as a character, deserve pity after everything he's done? No.

Like you said, he only felt bad about telling Voldemort of the prophecy once he realized it would affect Lily, not because it was an awful thing to do, and damning a child and family to be murdered is pretty awful.

Also, I could be wrong, it's been awhile since I read the last book, but I think the scene where he holds Lily's body is in the movie only, and was only done to make Alan Rickman's Snape into a more sympathetic character.
