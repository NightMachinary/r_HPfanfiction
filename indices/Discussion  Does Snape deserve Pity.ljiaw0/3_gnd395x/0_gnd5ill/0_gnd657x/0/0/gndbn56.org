That's okay, here goes:

Arthur and Molly are okay, but Bill was no better than a cardboard cut out of what we /could/ have had, like he was depicted as so cool in the books, but was transferred into wet paper in the films. Charlie wasn't even in the movies, so there's that, Percy was pretty on point, and the twins were okay also, but Ron and Ginny got shafted /big time/.

Ron, like you said, all of his good lines and actions were given to Hermione, and he was depicted as a selfish, lazy comedic relief, while Ginny got the Bill treatment also, meaning that she had none of the personality or presence that book Ginny had, effectively causing Ginny/Harry to crash and burn before it could ever take off.

Honestly, I think it comes off as an unconscious (I hope) classist take, portraying the Weasleys in a bad light because they're poor, while they made a character like Draco appear far more sympathetic (likely because it's implied that he's wealthy) when he's a whole violent bigot with 0 redeeming qualities in the books.

Sorry for the shpeel, I clearly have many thoughts on the characterization in the films lol
