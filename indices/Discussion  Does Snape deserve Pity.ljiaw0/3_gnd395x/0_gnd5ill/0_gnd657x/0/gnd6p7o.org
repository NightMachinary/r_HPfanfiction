The perfectionization of hermione is quite annoying and the awful treatment of weasleys I don't understand. Like I get it that they treated Ron wrong by taking a good chunk of his lines and giving them to hermione. I think they portrayed the rest of the weasleys fine though. If you have any examples care to jog my memory? Also I will not respond for a good few hours cuz im going to bed rn.
