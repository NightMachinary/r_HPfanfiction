I agree with you but I find the movies canon as JK Rowling has basically pt her stamp of approval on it. And even if Rowling doesn't approve of the scene the scene itself is stupid. We are supposed to forgive Snape for leaving a baby in the cold with no one to watch over him but 2 dead bodies. A scene which is supposed to make you forgive him makes me dislike him more. Snape's morals are questionable, he is like a loose cannon who only focuses on one thing and only works for one thing only while ignoring everything else.
