Does Snape deserve pity? Yes, I think he does, because he had a horrid life, for the most part.

Now, forgiveness... that's a whole other kettle of fish. Severus Snape is an arrogant, miserable, hateful and hurtful piece of shit. Sure, he had to maintain his cover to act as a spy, but it's easy to do, when all you have to do is to be yourself.

He mistreated not only Harry, but Neville, as well. He treats almost everyone with at least a measure of disdain, and scorn.

He may not be evil, but that doesn't mean he's not a failure as a human being.
