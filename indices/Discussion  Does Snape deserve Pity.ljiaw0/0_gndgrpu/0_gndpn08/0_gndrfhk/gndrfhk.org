I agree, and do think she made the right call in cutting off their friendship when she did.

I don't think he ever tried to bother her or contact her after she made it clear their friendship was over. If he had then James, Sirius, and Remus would have at least known about it, and likely retaliated. As it was nobody who was alive during the timeline of the books knew that Snape had feelings for her besides Snape and Dumbledore. I also doubt he ever confessed his feelings to her directly at any point before their friendship ended.
