Dumbledore really bears a lot of responsibility for stuff that went on in the classrooms that he never stepped in to fix.

Snape started teaching at about 21 years old. That means the Slytherins under his care were literally his former housemates. And the Gryffindors were kids who had witnessed him getting bullied and humiliated by their beloved star seeker, who had recently been martyred in the fight against Voldemort. This bullying is heavily implied to have included having his underwear removed in front of the school (which was sexual assault). Which makes me wonder if his early Gryffindor classes had students acting like twerps and fooling around in dangerous ways. Like did they call him "Snivellus" to his face when he was giving instructions to the class? Did they do anything worse than that, like when Harry threw a firecracker into a cauldron?

Wizards don't get any post secondary education. Snape had no training on classroom management. He was just put into a room with dozens if not hundreds teens that personally knew him when he was a teen himself, and somehow had to keep them from melting their faces off or killing each other by fooling around.

It's not too surprising that with his personal background he resorted to harsh discipline and intimidation to manage his classes. And when a behavior gets the desired results, it's really hard for someone to change. So when he was older and those students were gone and he could have gone a bit softer, he didn't.

I do not understand why Dumbledore never stepped in to show Severus more effective ways of handling the students. Also, if Dumbledore had explicitly forbade certain behaviors such as insulting students based on intellect or personal appearance, I don't think Snape would have went behind his back and done it anyway. It doesn't make him a nice person if it would have taken that to make him stop, but the fact that Dumbledore never intervened or gave him adequate support to learn how to teach properly isn't okay either.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
