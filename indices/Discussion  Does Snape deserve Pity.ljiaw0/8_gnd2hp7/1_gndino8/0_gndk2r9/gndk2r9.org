Nothing is ever Snape's fault with you lot.

Nothing about Snape's personality suggests that he would stop being a miserable dickhead just because Dumbledore asked him not to. Dumbledore tried to get Harry to be civil to Snape. Who's to say he didn't get Snape to be civil to his students?

Don't want to get bullied? Don't join the wizard nazis and throw around racial slurs. Especially if there's a war going on and the people that are called by that slur are getting murdered by the people using that slur.

If I knew Dylan Roof before he shot all those people and saw him getting bullied, I wouldn't give a damn. That was who Snape was in school.
