Taking Harry's year as representative, at least 10 students out of 40 achieved an O on their Potions OWLs (Snape only accepted O students into his NEWT class, and Harry and Ron were the only ones added at the last minute after the change to Slughorn). Keep in mind that even passing an OWL is considered something of an achievement, let alone getting the highest grade. This seems to indicate that Snape is a good teacher in terms of educational outcomes, if not in terms of pastoral care.
