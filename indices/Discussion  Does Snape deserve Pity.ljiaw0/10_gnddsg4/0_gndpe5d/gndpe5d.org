Yeah but Snape got off easy because of Dumbledore he should never of been a teacher in the first place he should of been locked up executed or kissed by a dementor.

Don't make excuses for Snape being an abusive bully of a teacher because its for his roll. He is nothing more than an abusive bully to children and chose to become a death eater and was never forced into it he already had death eater friends in Hogwarts. Snape didn't need to be a villainous potions teacher to be in voldemorts good graces stop making shitty excuses for him maintain his position as spy if anything hit just made him as shit spy
