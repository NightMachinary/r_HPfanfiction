I think he's a tragic character who was very well written and he is written in a way that makes him very easy to hate.

One thing to note: Snape went to Dumbledore when Voldemort disappeared. Both knew that Harry Potter was the child of prophesy, and Dumbledore tells Snape that one day Voldemort will rise again and Harry will be in grave danger.

  *Canon quote:*

  “He does not need protection. The Dark Lord has gone ---”

  “The Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger when he does.”

  There was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of himself, mastered his own breathing. At last he said, “Very well. Very well. But never --- never tell, Dumbledore! This must be between us! Swear it! I cannot bear . . . especially Potter's son . . . I want your word!”

  “My word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best of you?” Dumbledore sighed, looking down into Snape's ferocious, anguished face. “If you insist . . .”

Essentially, Snape went through his teaching days /knowing/ that one day Voldemort would return, so he played the part of villainous Potions Master to maintain his position so he would be in Voldemort's good graces once the Dark Lord regained power. The war never ended for him.
