It's not so much that "there's nothing else to read", it's more that there's nothing new and good that's there to read.

I mean, c'mon: every story on FFn, aside from the rare, new gem, is the same shit these days.

Manipulative Dumbledore. Indy!Harry. Weasley bashing. Goblin friends. Lordships. Et Cetera. Et Cetera.

There's no originality. A story can be the most wonderful take on these cliches in the world... but they're still turds -- just polished ones.
