I'm lucky in that regard since compared to most of you I'm relatively new to HP fanfics, having started early 2020.

I do fully understand where you are coming from though, since I went through that with ASOIAF fanfics. Due to no new book having come out in over 9 years and the show having a shit ending, ASOIAF fanfics seem to have come to a blinding halt. Two of my favourites have been abandoned, and three more haven't updated in over a year, and are therefore most likely also abandoned.
