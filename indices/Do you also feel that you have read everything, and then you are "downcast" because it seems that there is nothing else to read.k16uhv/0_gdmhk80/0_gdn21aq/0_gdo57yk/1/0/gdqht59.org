For anyone who hasn't read it and likes both, I recommend [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/felix-fortuna-worm-hp.56551/threadmarks][Felix Fortuna]], updated every now and again. For those who are only on the HP side, it's an insert with Contessa, a 'background' character from Worm (In that she's largely responsible for the entire setting being the shitfight it is, because her superpower is a precog who asks questions like "How do I do X" and gets a step by step answer) as a mind wiped child version of herself, starting in the year of Prisoner of Azkaban.

It's pretty great and manages to avoid the pitfalls that sort of power could lay in the story.
