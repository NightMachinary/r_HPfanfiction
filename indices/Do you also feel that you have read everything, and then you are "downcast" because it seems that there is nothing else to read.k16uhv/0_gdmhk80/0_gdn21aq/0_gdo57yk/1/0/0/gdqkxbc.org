I think I started it and DNFed, can't remember why. I'll give it another try.

Edit: I definitely read all of it, pretty solid fic. The worm and HP fanfic traditions, so to speak, are so different though that every cross I've read feels incredibly awkward to an extent. FF is very much a worm fic and the worm stuff I really like (Absolution, Atonement/Intrepid, Shamus) is not very representative of the Worm fandom anyway, so YMMV.
