This is the cycle unfortunately, stretched only by the popularity of the base series.

I originally got into fanfiction in 2001, with Final Fantasy 7 and 8 fanfiction being my main jam, there are to this day some of the best fics ive ever read in that fandom, but the fandom died off for obvious reasons. Then i slowly segued into Naruto and HP fanfiction and a few weeks ago fell into the dark abyss of Worm fanfiction which is now keeping me sustained!

But yeah, Fandoms come and go, but theres always another fandom to get sucked into if you keep an open mind! I only discovered worm 3 weeks ago and ive already read a ridiculous amount of fanfiction!
