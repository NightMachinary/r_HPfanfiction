I've been reading HP fanfic on and off since before OOTP came out. Its my main fare when it comes to any sort of lit and I really read a lot.

I know for a fact that I will never ever run out of good HP fics to read as long as I am flexible in regards to the main characters of the story and story length.

There are so many good snack-sized ficlets under 10k you could spent years doing nothing but going through them.

I personally have a "to read" list that will probably get me through another quarantine just from checking this sub every second day or so and bookmarking fics others have recommended.
