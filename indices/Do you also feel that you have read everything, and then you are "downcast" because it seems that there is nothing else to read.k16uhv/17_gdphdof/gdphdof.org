I cycle through Royal Road, SB/SV, AltenrateHistory, and various Fandoms on FFnet and nowadays I just kind of search around all of them when looking for something new.

A balanced diet of Litrpg, quests, historical SIs and fanfics keep me occupied, there's always more things to find and new stories being written if you cast your net wide enough.

Locking yourself into just the HP Fandom, or just fanfiction in general will mean you MAY end up consuming faster than it can be produced and you'll miss out on the best of the rest.
