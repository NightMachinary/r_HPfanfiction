The more you read the more you get idea of things you really like and things you don't like at all. Also, you get idea of what is a really good fic, what's only a good idea but poorly realised and what's just plain sh**..

Ten years ago I started with fanfiction that was in my first language and slowly transitioned into English ones. Now it seems I can't even see the Czech fics, I just automatically skip them and focus on any in English.

To not get mind numbingly bored of the HP fanfiction I started with crossowers and then into totally different fictions and it served me well. I always come back to Harry Potter in the end but I'm not always desperate for brilliant stories anymore..

But what's the worst is starting a fic, finding it utterly fascinating and fabulous and realising that it cuts of in half of the story and last update was in year 2011.. That's the kill me now sort of a feeling.
