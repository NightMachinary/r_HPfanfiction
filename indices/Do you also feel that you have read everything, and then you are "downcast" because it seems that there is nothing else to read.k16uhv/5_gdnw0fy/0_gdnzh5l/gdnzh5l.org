  God yes - I really think I might have read every existing whump fic for a character in another fandom in te past few months and have reached the point of trying to write my own to satisfy my need for more lol

I am so desperate that I started writing fanfic, so that someday in the future when I want to read something, hopefully I will forget the story I wrote, and read it as if it were something new. Judge me, I'm going crazy. HAHHAHAHA
