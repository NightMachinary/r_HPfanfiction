Yeah not going to lie, been reading on a major Fanfic binge for two years now? My sister thinks I've lost it. Mad woman. Love her though.

But yeah, there really isn't anything left to read. I've gone from Harmony to every other pairing that won't make me sick, to hating Hermione. Read everything I could. Now I just wait for updates, which get slower and less frequent with time. Read really boring fics sometimes just cause they update regularly.

So yeah I get where you're coming from but don't stress about it too much. At certain points you'll find booms in the Fanfic community, with new fics being written and completed fast, certain pairings gaining more steam and then dying down for some time, only to restart again. Like the flowerpot ship booming last month. Harmony usually comes to the forefront in November in my experience.

Also, idk about other fandoms. Well other than maybe PJO, which has nearly completely died, but HP due to its popularity and agelessness, might lose hype and steam, but it'll never fully die like PJO, ASOIAF, GOT etc.
