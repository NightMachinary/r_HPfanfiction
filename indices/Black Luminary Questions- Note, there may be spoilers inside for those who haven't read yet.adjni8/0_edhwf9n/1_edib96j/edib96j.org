Does it ever get less melodramatic? I ask not because I think melodrama is a bad thing, but because most of the conflict felt unearned, it lacked grounding in the world.

It was, I think, more a pacing or presentation issue. Rather than empathising with the characters I was rolling my eyes at the histrionics.
